40|$|Summary: Calcium {{plays an}} {{important}} role in endocrine reactions such as hormone biosynthesis, release, secretion, and action on target organs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a new long-lasting calcium-channel blocker, <b>lacidipine,</b> on basal and stimulated anterior pituitary hormone secretion. In a single-blind crossover study comparing <b>lacidipine</b> 4 mg p. o. once daily with placebo, variations in plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were evaluated in 10 hypertensive patients. Basal or stimulated anterior pituitary hormone secretion was similar after <b>lacidipine</b> and placebo. <b>Lacidipine</b> treatment significantly reduced blood pressure. It can thus be concluded that <b>lacidipine</b> is an effective calcium antagonist that has no effect on pituitary function...|$|E
40|$|The Ca 2 +-antagonistic {{properties}} of <b>lacidipine</b> were investigated in patch-clamp guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. In basal conditions, 0. 1 [*]μM <b>lacidipine</b> reduced the action potential duration, {{associated with a}} decrease in the L-type calcium current (ICa,L) to 66 ± 4 % of the control value, without a change in the current-voltage relationship. Sodium current and background potassium currents were not affected. All the effects reached a steady state within 2 [*]min. The Ca 2 +-antagonistic effect of <b>lacidipine</b> was voltage-dependent: a marked negative shift (about 20 [*]mV) of the steady-state inactivation curve was observed with long (10 [*]s) conditioning prepulses, but not with short (350 [*]ms) prepulses. The onset of and recovery from the voltage-dependent effect caused by 0. 1 [*]μM <b>lacidipine</b> were significantly slower when compared to those of equiactive concentrations of nimodipine (0. 5 [*]μM) and nisoldipine (0. 1 [*]μM). ICa,L measured after prepulses at − 40 [*]mV lasting 500 [*]ms or less was unchanged (95 ± 5 % of maximum current value) while it was reduced to 49 ± 10 % by nimodipine and 43 ± 9 % by nisoldipine (P< 0. 05 vs <b>lacidipine</b> for both). Similarly, the recovery from block in the presence of <b>lacidipine</b> was slower than with nimodipine and nisoldipine. After a prepulse of 1 [*]s at − 80 [*]mV, ICa,L recovered up to 54 ± 2 % of the maximum current value in the presence of <b>lacidipine,</b> and up to 91 ± 3 % and 93 ± 5 % in the presence of nimodipine and nisoldipine, respectively (P< 0. 05 vs <b>lacidipine).</b> Blockade of ICa,L by <b>lacidipine</b> was use-dependent. After ten 200 [*]ms long pulses (1 [*]Hz) from − 80 [*]mV, ICa,L was reduced to 55 ± 7 % of the current measured at the first pulse. In the presence of nimodipine and nisoldipine, ICa,L elicited by the tenth pulse amounted to 93 ± 3 % and 80 ± 6 % of the first pulse value, respectively (P< 0. 05 vs <b>lacidipine).</b> <b>Lacidipine</b> did not cause use-dependent blockade of ICa,L in cells stimulated with 10 [*]ms long pulses. These results demonstrate that <b>lacidipine</b> selectively inhibits ICa,L in isolated cardiomyocytes and suggest that this effect occurs mainly through binding to the inactivated Ca 2 + channels...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the antiulcer {{activity}} of <b>lacidipine</b> was investigated on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model {{and it was}} examined whether the antiulcer effect of <b>lacidipine</b> was related to oxidant/antioxidant parameters in rats. Anti-ulcerative effects of <b>lacidipine</b> were investigated on an indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. The antiulcer capability of <b>lacidipine</b> was compared to 20 mg kg - 1 famotidine.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{has been}} shown that {{administration}} of <b>lacidipine</b> markedly reduces systolic blood pressure in elderly patients with hypertension without increasing the incidence of cardiovascular events and total mortality. But in Korea, there were no available data about the effectiveness and safety of <b>lacidipine.</b> ObjectivesThe goal of our study was to compare the effect of <b>lacidipine</b> and amlodipine besylate on sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and edema regression time as primary parameters, and sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and tolerability as a secondary parameter in patients with hypertension. MethodThis was a prospective, randomized, open-label, noninferiority study in which patients received 14 weeks of treatment with either <b>lacidipine</b> or amlodipine besylate. Patients aged 55 to 80 years having uncomplicated, mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (SBP 140 to 0. 05). Because the 1 -sided 95 % CI for the difference in mean SBP changes between groups (− 4. 18 to 0. 72) was within the pre-specified lower limit (− 5 mm Hg), <b>lacidipine</b> was considered noninferior to amlodipine. There were no differences in mean edema regression time and in mean DBP changes. These results were consistent in the isolated systolic hypertension subgroup analysis. The overall incidence of clinical adverse events was comparable between the 2 groups (ie, 7. 4 % in the <b>lacidipine</b> group and 11. 1 % in the amlodipine group [P > 0. 05]). The most common adverse events were headache and facial flushing (5 out of 162 patients [3. 1 %] in the <b>lacidipine</b> group and 11 out of 153 patients [7. 2 %] in the amlodipine group]. ConclusionsFourteen weeks of <b>lacidipine</b> treatment significantly reduced blood pressure in older Korean patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The efficacy of <b>lacidipine</b> was not inferior to that of amlodipine besylate and tolerability was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT 00460915...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lacidipine,</b> a third {{generation}} dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has demonstrated pronounced anti-atherosclerotic activity in preclinical studies. The drug can act at several stages within the atherosclerotic process, utilising its anti-hypertensive and antioxidant properties to protect hypertensive animals against mortality and vascular damage, to reduce cholesterol levels from the vessel wall of hypercholesterolaemic animals, {{and to reduce}} the progression of existing atherosclerotic lesions. The clinical benefit of <b>lacidipine</b> in atherosclerosis has recently been confirmed in humans in a large, multicentre, comparative, 4 -year clinical trial involving patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The European <b>Lacidipine</b> Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) showed that <b>lacidipine</b> was able to slow the progression of atherosclerosis, measured as carotid intimato-media thickness, by 40 % compared with atenolol (p = 0. 0073). Although further comparative trials are needed, {{based on the results}} of ELSA, <b>lacidipine</b> is likely to become a promising therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{cardiovascular}} events {{associated with}} hypertension are complications of atherosclerosis. Some antihypertensive agents influence experimental models of atherosclerosis through mechanisms independent of blood pressure lowering. METHODS AND RESULTS: The European <b>Lacidipine</b> Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) was a randomized, double-blind trial in 2334 patients with hypertension that compared {{the effects of}} a 4 -year treatment based on either <b>lacidipine</b> or atenolol on an index of carotid atherosclerosis, the mean of the maximum intima-media thicknesses (IMT) in far walls of common carotids and bifurcations (CBM(max)). This index has been shown by epidemiological studies to be predictive of cardiovascular events. A significant (P< 0. 0001) effect of <b>lacidipine</b> was found compared with atenolol, with a treatment difference in 4 -year CBM(max) progression of - 0. 0227 mm (intention-to-treat population) and - 0. 0281 mm (completers). The yearly IMT progression rate was 0. 0145 mm/y in atenolol-treated and 0. 0087 mm/y in lacidipine-treated patients (completers, 40 % reduction; P= 0. 0073). Patients with plaque progression were significantly less common, and patients with plaque regression were significantly more common in the <b>lacidipine</b> group. Clinic blood pressure reductions were identical with both treatments, but 24 -hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic blood pressure changes were greater with atenolol (- 10 /- 9 mm Hg) than with <b>lacidipine</b> (- 7 /- 5 mm Hg). No significant difference between treatments was found in any cardiovascular events, although the relative risk for stroke, major cardiovascular events, and mortality showed a trend favoring <b>lacidipine.</b> CONCLUSION: The greater efficacy of <b>lacidipine</b> on carotid IMT progression and number of plaques per patient, despite a smaller ambulatory blood pressure reduction, indicates an antiatherosclerotic action of <b>lacidipine</b> independent of its antihypertensive action...|$|E
40|$|First-generation calcium antagonists {{have been}} used in {{patients}} with congestive heart failure with rather disappointing results. Therefore, second-generation dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, such as felodipine and <b>lacidipine,</b> have been developed that may be beneficial in congestive heart failure owing to their high vasoselectivity and more favorable neurohumoral modulation. The effects of <b>lacidipine</b> in patients with congestive heart failure, who remain symptomatic despite receiving long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, were investigated during a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Twenty-five patients were randomized to receive either <b>lacidipine</b> (4 mg once daily; 12 patients) or placebo (once daily; 13 patients). After 8 weeks of treatment patients receiving <b>lacidipine</b> showed a significantly higher increase in cardiac output (p < 0. 01), and a significantly greater reduction in vascular resistance (p < 0. 02) than those patients in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in filling pressures and heart rate. The arteriovenous oxygen content difference was significantly reduced in the <b>lacidipine</b> group (p < 0. 01) without significant changes in arterial oxygenation, suggesting an increase in flow that was not a result of pulmonary shunting. Further peak oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing increased significantly in the <b>lacidipine</b> patients (p < 0. 02). These beneficial effects were achieved without significant changes in neurohumoral parameters. Analysis of right and left ventricular ejection fractions revealed no cardiodepressant effects. <b>Lacidipine</b> was well tolerated {{during the course of the}} study, and adverse reactions were minor. These data suggest that <b>lacidipine</b> has a promising profile for the treatment of congestive heart failure patients, ana that further investigation with second-generation dihydropyridines in the field of congestive heart failure appears warranted...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{compare with}} placebo the efficacies of once-daily administrations of <b>lacidipine</b> and {{hydrochlorothiazide}} separately and in combination to elderly patients with systolic hypertension. Design and methods. Nineteen elderly subjects (five men and 14 women, median age 71 years, range 62 - 79 years) {{participated in the}} study, which had a randomized double-blind crossover design. For each subject there were four treatment phases, each of duration 4 weeks. The initial treatments in each phase were 2 mg <b>lacidipine</b> once a day and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once a day, separately and in combination, and placebo. Doses of each agent could be doubled after 2 weeks in each phase if the patient 2 ̆ 7 s goal systolic blood pressure had not been achieved. The numbers of subjects administered the higher dose of each treatment were 13 for placebo, 14 for <b>lacidipine,</b> 11 for hydrochlorothiazide and eight for <b>lacidipine</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide. Results. End-of-phase mean clinic blood pressures were 164 / 85 mmHg with placebo, 159 / 82 mmHg with <b>lacidipine,</b> 157 / 84 mmHg with hydrochlorothiazide and 152 / 82 mmHg with <b>lacidipine</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced during all active treatment phases compared with placebo and that for the <b>lacidipine</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide phase was also significantly less than those for both of the other active treatment phases. There {{was no difference between}} sitting and standing blood pressure for any phase. Factorial analysis of the main effects of treatment indicated that the effects of <b>lacidipine</b> and hydrochlorothiazide on clinic blood pressure were additive and also that heart rate was higher when hydrochlorothiazide had been administered. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed the pattern of the responses of blood pressure and showed that administration of hydrochlorothiazide had a significantly greater effect on systolic blood pressure and a longer duration of action than did administration of <b>lacidipine.</b> There was no difference in the frequency of adverse effects among any of the phases. Conclusions. In treating elderly systolic hypertensives the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide is a more effective antihypertensive agent with a longer duration of action than is the calcium channel antagonist <b>lacidipine.</b> In combination the effects of these two drugs on blood pressure are additive...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) {{is common}} in hospitalised {{patients}} and has a poor prognosis. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are anticipated. <b>Lacidipine,</b> a novel third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has been demonstrated effective for hypertension. However, its potential effect on renal injury remains unknown. In the present study, an in vitro model of renal ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury was used to investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanisms of <b>lacidipine</b> on human kidney cell (HKC) apoptosis. Methods: HKCs were subjected to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and recovery (0. 01 µM AA, depletion for 2 h and recovery for 30 min), with or without <b>lacidipine</b> (1 µM and 10 µM, 24 h), then cell viability and apoptosis were determined using the cell counting kit- 8 (CCK- 8) assay and Annexin V flow cytometry.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{hypertrophy}} is {{a common}} feature of hypertension, but is is not known if this is related only to increased blood pressure or also to non-hemodynamic factors. Indeed, drug treatment of hypertension with hydralazine does reduce blood pressure but not cardiovascular hypertrophy.

SHRSP were submitted to salt load from 8 to 14 weeks of age with or without <b>lacidipine,</b> a long acting dihydropyridine. We observed that the cardiovascular hypertrophy was attenuated by <b>lacidipine</b> 0. 3 mgkg(- 1) day(- 1) which did not change high blood pressure.

The concentration-inhibition curves on K(+) -evoked contraction and on K(+) -evoked 45 Ca 2 + influx were superimposed; the IC 50 was 0. 09 nM for the former and 0. 11 nM for the latter. The inhibitory effect of <b>lacidipine</b> 60 pM or (+) isradipine 60 pM on rat aorta contraction was significantly enhanced when the preparations had been preincubated {{in the presence of}} the drugs in a K(+) -rich depolarizing solution.

40|$|Cholesterol {{esterification}} and accumulation in the {{arterial wall}} is a hallmark of atherogenesis. Several preclinical studies suggest that calcium antagonists may exert antiatherosclerotic activity by directly affecting atherogenesis in the arterial wall. We investigated {{the effect of the}} second generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist <b>lacidipine</b> on cholesterol metabolism in vivo in the aortic arch of cholesterol fed rabbits, and in vitro in mouse cultured peritoneal macrophages. Treatment of cholesterol-fed rabbits with 1, 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 of <b>lacidipine</b> for two months reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, cholesterol esterification in the aortic arch: 24 ± 6, 30 ± 12, and 41 ± 8 % inhibition, respectively (P< 0. 001 vs HC control). Concomitantly, drug treatment reduced total cholesterol content of the vessel wall. <b>Lacidipine</b> 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 reduced cholesterolaemia (∼ 20 %); no effect was observed at the lowest dose used (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1). These results suggest that the action of <b>lacidipine</b> on cholesterol esterification in the arterial wall involves, at least in part, a direct effect on cellular cholesterol metabolism. Inhibition of cholesterol esterification in the arterial wall was observed also in a reference group of animals treated with the specific ACAT inhibitor CI- 976. To evaluate the action of <b>lacidipine</b> on intracellular cholesterol metabolism we performed in vitro experiments with murine macrophages, the main cell type that accumulates cholesterol in the arterial wall. <b>Lacidipine</b> almost completely inhibited cholesterol esterification in cholesterol loaded macrophages in culture. The effect was observed independently of esterification stimuli and in cell free homogenates. The drug modified intracellular cholesterol distribution, doubling the free- to esterified sterol ratio, but did not influence the cellular rate of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in the cell.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} effect of the long-acting calcium channel blocker <b>lacidipine</b> on {{cardiovascular}} remodeling induced by salt loading in a genetic model of hypertension. DESIGN: We examined the influence of threshold doses of <b>lacidipine,</b> with little blood-pressure lowering effect, on cardiac weight and gene expression in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). METHODS: SHRSPs (8 -week-old) were randomly allocated to four groups: control, salt-loaded SHRSP and salt-loaded SHRSP treated with <b>lacidipine</b> at 0. 3 and 1 mg/kg per day. Systolic blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. At the end of 6 weeks of treatment, ventricles were collected and weighed. Ventricular messenger RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: <b>Lacidipine</b> (0. 3 mg/kg per day) not only prevented the salt-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and the slight increase in systolic blood pressure induced by salt, but also prevented, largely or completely, salt-dependent increases in ventricular levels of several gene products: skeletal and cardiac alpha-actin, beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC), type I collagen, long-lasting (L) -type calcium channel and preproendothelin- 1. At a higher dose of 1 mg/kg per day, <b>lacidipine</b> further decreased systolic blood pressure below the level of control SHRSP, completely prevented salt-dependent overexpression of the beta-MHC gene and markedly attenuated salt-dependent overexpression of the transforming growth factor-beta 1 gene.

The {{purpose of the present}} experiments was to examine the action of <b>lacidipine</b> in a condition that accelerates the development of atherosclerosis in order to test the hypothesis that the protective action of <b>lacidipine</b> in atherosclerosis is unrelated to the reduction of blood pressure. Male ApoE-deficient mice (6 weeks old) were exposed either to normal chow (ND) or to a Western-type diet (WD, adjusted calorie diet containing 42 % from fat) for 8 weeks.

Chronic treatment of WD mice with <b>lacidipine</b> (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) increased significantly the acetylcholine-evoked relaxation (to 76. 6 +/- 3. 5 %, n = 6, ANOVA, p < 0. 001) and prevented the loss of responsiveness to SNAP in mice exposed to WD. Plasma renin activity and endothelin- 1 plasma levels as well as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance levels in kidneys were significantly lower in WD mice treated with <b>lacidipine</b> than in untreated ones. In mice exposed to WD <b>lacidipine</b> reduced extension of atherosclerotic lesions, renal injury and increase in blood pressure.

The hearts were paced at a frequency of 5 Hz and perfused with Tyrode's solution of 37 degrees C. The following five parameters were determined: left ventricular pressure (LVP), maximal rate of pressure increase (+dP/dtmax), aortic output (AO), coronary blood flow (CBF), and cardiac output (CO). First, dose-response curves were constructed; from these data the EC 50 concentration {{for the three}} calcium antagonists was calculated. Subsequently, washout from the cardiac tissue for these three compounds was determined. The effects of <b>lacidipine</b> did not diminish during < or = 90 -min washout, whereas the effects of nifedipine disappeared completely in 10 min. The effects of nisoldipine, however, disappeared partly in 10 min. In separate experiments, the antiischemic activity of the three calcium antagonists was analyzed, using low-flow ischemia. The calcium antagonists were used in a concentration that produced a 60 % reduction in contractile force (EC 60). Nifedipine and nisoldipine caused significant improvement in functional recovery. The antiischemic properties of <b>lacidipine</b> could not be shown because of its slow kinetic properties with accumulation in the membrane phase and slow kinetics with the channel.

40|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} protect transplant {{patients from}} cyclosporine-induced daily renal hypoperfusion. Renal toxicity, possibly due to vasoconstriction and vascular injury, {{is the most}} relevant side-effect of chronic cyclosporine (CsA) therapy given to prevent graft rejection. In kidney transplant recipients each oral dose of CsA is invariably followed by a transient reduction in renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that results from a form of acute reversible hypoperfusion. We sought {{to determine whether the}} Ca 2 + channel blocker, <b>lacidipine,</b> prevented CsA-associated renal hypoperfusion in these patients. Parallel studies on CsA pharmacokinetics, renal function parameters (GFR and RPF), as inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearances, respectively, and urinary excretion of the vasoconstrictor endothelin in 10 consecutive renal transplant patients given CsA as a part of their immunosuppressive therapy were performed. Patients were studied at different time intervals after CsA alone, CsA and <b>lacidipine</b> (4 mg/day), and again seven days after <b>lacidipine</b> withdrawal. In all patients basal RPF and GFR declined on average 51 % (139. 3 ± 20. 7 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2) and 50 % (32. 5 ± 5. 8 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2), respectively, two to four hours after maximum blood CsA concentration was reached. As blood levels of CsA returned to trough, both parameters progressively increased to baseline. <b>Lacidipine</b> administration completely prevented the fall in RPF (pre-CsA: 277. 1 ± 23. 6; 6 hr post-CsA: 304. 5 ± 31. 1 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2) and GFR (pre-CsA: 66. 6 ± 8. 1; 6 hr post-CsA: 70. 1 ± 9. 8 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). When <b>lacidipine</b> treatment was discontinued the abnormal RPF and GFR response to CsA administration was again observed. <b>Lacidipine</b> administration did not prevent the increase in urinary excretion of endothelin which was observed after CsA alone, and was temporarily related to the decline in GFR.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the second generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker <b>lacidipine</b> in patients with heart failure. DESIGN: Placebo controlled, parallel group, double blind study over 8 weeks. SETTING: General community hospital in Breda, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: A random sample was studied of 25 outpatients with symptoms of mild to moderate heart failure, despite treatment with diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Their mean age was 65 years, with mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0. 24 and a peak oxygen consumption of 14. 4 ml/min/kg. Two patients dropped out on <b>lacidipine,</b> one patient on placebo. INTERVENTION: Treatment with <b>lacidipine</b> 4 mg once daily or placebo for eight weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, invasive haemodynamics, and plasma neurohormones. RESULTS: Treatment with <b>lacidipine</b> 4 mg once daily, as compared to placebo treatment, significantly improved peak oxygen consumption (P < 0. 02), cardiac index (P < 0. 01), and stroke volume (P < 0. 03) paralleled by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P < 0. 03) and arteriovenous oxygen content difference (P < 0. 01). Plasma noradrenaline, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone values did not differ between <b>lacidipine</b> and placebo.

40|$|Alcohol-induced endothelial changes might {{contribute}} {{to an increase in}} blood pressure in regular alcohol consumers. Some antihypertensive drugs affect oxidative stress and endothelial function and might counteract the effects of alcohol at the cellular level. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro the effects of three different types of anti hypertensive agents on alcohol-induced endothelial responses and oxidative stress. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (1, 10, 60 mu mol/L) of zofenoprilat, carvedilol, and <b>lacidipine</b> in the absence and in the presence of ethanol (140 mmol/L). Concentrations of endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the culture media as markers of endothelial function, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular glutathione (GSHi) were measured as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to alcohol increased the levels of ET, NO, and MDA, and decreased GSHi. Carvedilol and zofenoprilat were more effective than <b>lacidipine</b> in counteracting the effects of alcohol on ET production. Alcohol-induced NO production was enhanced by carvedilol, whereas zofenoprilat and <b>lacidipine</b> did not have a significant effect. The alcohol-induced increase in MDA concentrations was blunted by all three drugs, but only carvedilol restored a normal response. All three drugs increased GSHi levels, with the effect being greater for carvedilol and <b>lacidipine</b> than zofenoprilat. Carvedilol is more effective than zofenoprilat and <b>lacidipine</b> in counteracting alcohol-induced endothelial responses in vitro and in decreasing oxidative stress.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} 1, 4 -dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (nifedipine, nisoldipine, and <b>lacidipine)</b> on serotonin (5 -HT) - and KCl (120 mM) -induced contractions of rat isolated septal coronary artery. The preparations showed the well-known biphasic response to KCl depolarization. All three calcium antagonists were more potent in inhibiting the second, tonic phase compared to the first, transient phase, with pIC 50 values of 7. 17 +/- 0. 12 / 8. 27 +/- 0. 07 (nifedipine), 7. 93 +/- 0. 21 / 8. 96 +/- 0. 06 (nisoldipine), and 8. 28 +/- 0. 07 / 9. 79 +/- 0. 04 (<b>lacidipine)</b> for suppressing {{the first and the}} second phase, respectively. Furthermore, the influence of the calcium antagonists on the 5 -HT concentration-response curve was investigated. Nifedipine, nisoldipine, and <b>lacidipine</b> concentration dependently depressed the maximum effect of 5 -HT on the coronary artery preparations without influencing the pEC 50 of the 5 -HT concentration-response curve. In conclusion, all three dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are potent and effective inhibitors of depolarization- or 5 -HT-induced coronary artery contractions. <b>Lacidipine,</b> a new lipophilic compound, was the most potent one in inhibiting the depolarization-induced contraction, thereby showing a marked selectivity for the tonic phase compared to the initial phasic respons...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{hallmark}} of Gaucher's disease cellular pathogenesis is the lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide, {{which is caused}} by misfolding of mutated glucocerebrosidase (GC) and loss of lysosomal GC activity, and leads to depletion of [Ca 2 +]ER. We demonstrate that modulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis and enhancement of the cellular folding capacity synergize to rescue the folding of mutated GC variants. <b>Lacidipine,</b> an L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker that also inhibits [Ca 2 +]ER efflux, enhances folding, trafficking, and activity of degradation-prone GC variants. <b>Lacidipine</b> remodels mutated GC proteostasis by simultaneously activating a series of distinct molecular mechanisms, namely modulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis, upregulation of the ER chaperone BiP, and moderate induction of the unfolded protein response.

40|$|Changes in {{myocardial}} {{expression of}} Na+/K+-ATPase alpha-subunit isoforms {{have been demonstrated}} in different models of cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. Here we studied the expression of these isozymes in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) {{and the influence of}} high salt diet and treatment with the dihydropyridine <b>lacidipine.</b> Adult SHRSP were offered either 1 % NaCl or water as drinking solution for 6 weeks. Salt-loaded SHRSP were treated or not with I mg/kg/day <b>lacidipine.</b> Compared to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, non-salt-loaded SHRSP presented significant hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Salt intake markedly enhanced cardiac hypertrophy, an effect blunted by <b>lacidipine.</b> [H- 3]Ouabain binding assays on total particulate fractions from heart ventricles revealed the existence of two high-affinity sites with K-d similar to 25 and similar to 200 nM, ascribed to the alpha(3) and alpha(2) isoforms, respectively. B-max of alpha(3) was unexpectedly high (40 % of total high-affinity binding) in ventricles from WKY rats but very low in all groups of SHRSP. On the other hand, B-max of alpha(2) was similar in WKY and non-salt-loaded SHRSP; however, salt loading of SHRSP resulted in a B-max reduction of 20 % (P < 0. 05), an effect blocked by <b>lacidipine.</b> These effects were largely confirmed by inummoblotting analysis, which, in addition, demonstrated that the density of the ubiquitous (x, isoform was comparable among the experimental groups. In conclusion, WKY rats showed a high myocardial expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha(3) subunit, which was not found in SHRSP; the level of the alpha(2) isoform was similar in untreated SHRSP and WKY, salt-loading of SHRSP promoted reduction of the a, isoform, and this effect was completely hampered by <b>lacidipine.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

However, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Findings Ox-LDL induced HUVSMCs proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When pretreated with three CCBs before 50 [*]μg/ml ox-LDL stimulation, 30 [*]μM <b>lacidipine</b> and 3 [*]μM amlodipine exhibited 27 % and 18 % decrease of pro-proliferative effect induced by ox-LDL, whereas (S -) -amlodipine {{did not have any}} anti-proliferative effect. 30 [*]μM <b>lacidipine</b> inhibited about two-thirds of the ox-LDL induced ROS production in HUVSMCs, whereas amlodipine and (S -) -amlodipine did not have influence on ROS production.

In the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation appears {{to contribute to}} the pathogenesis of stroke independent of blood pressure. Because treatment with <b>lacidipine,</b> a long-acting calcium channel blocker, protects against stroke and cardiovascular remodeling in this model, we investigated the effect of this treatment on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in the aorta. Stroke-prone rats were exposed to a salt-rich diet (1 % NaCl in drinking water) with or without <b>lacidipine</b> (1 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1)) for 6 weeks. A high-sodium diet (1) increased systolic blood pressure, aortic weight, and wall thickness and plasma renin activity (P< 0. 05); (2) markedly reduced nitric oxide (NO) -mediated, endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings to acetylcholine and the sensitivity to the relaxing effect of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, an NO donor (P< 0. 001); and (3) induced an elevation of preproendothelin- 1 mRNA levels in aortic tissue (P< 0. 01) without affecting endothelial NO synthase mRNA levels. <b>Lacidipine</b> treatment prevented the salt-dependent functional and structural alterations of the aorta, including the overexpression of the preproendothelin- 1 gene, and increased endothelial NO synthase mRNA levels in aortic tissue (P< 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Essential {{hypertension}} {{is associated}} with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation caused by oxygen free radical-induced nitric oxide (NO) breakdown. Since calcium antagonists can improve endothelial function in hypertensive patients, we tested whether this beneficial effect {{could be related to}} restoration of NO availability by antioxidant activity. METHODS: In 10 healthy subjects and 20 essential hypertensive patients, we studied forearm blood flow (strain-gauge plethysmography) modifications induced by intrabrachial acetylcholine (from 0. 15 - 15 microg/ 100 ml per min), bradykinin (0. 005 - 0. 05 microg/ 100 ml per min), two endothelium-dependent vasodilators, and sodium nitroprusside (1 - 4 microg/ 100 ml forearm tissue per min), an endothelium independent vasodilator, in the absence and presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (100 microg/ 100 ml forearm tissue per min), an NO synthase inhibitor. RESULTS: In controls, vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin was inhibited by L-NMMA. In hypertensive patients, vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin, but not to sodium nitroprusside, was blunted and resistant to L-NMMA. Hypertensive patients were randomized to a 12 -week treatment with <b>lacidipine</b> (4 - 6 mg/daily) or atenolol (50 - 100 mg/daily) (n = 10 each group). <b>Lacidipine</b> but not atenolol increased the vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin and restored the inhibiting effect of L-NMMA on endothelium-dependent vasodilation, without affecting the response to sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, <b>lacidipine</b> reduced circulating markers of oxidative stress including plasma and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) hydroperoxides, the susceptibility of LDL to Cu 2 +-induced oxidation and the reactive oxygen species generated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells after incubation with LDL derived from plasma of the patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In ELSA, a randomized, {{double-blind}} trial in 2334 hypertensives, 4 -year antihypertensive treatment with <b>lacidipine</b> slowed down progression of carotid atherosclerosis {{significantly more than}} atenolol treatment. To avoid bias, the primary outcome was measured blindly at study-end on a randomized sequence of scans, but measurements were limited to the four far walls of common carotids and bifurcations (CBMmax) and to one of each couple of duplicate scans recorded yearly. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Secondary outcomes included measurements made on all duplicate scans of both near and far walls, not only of common carotids and bifurcations, but also of internal carotids (12 walls). These measurements were made blindly during the 4 -year study, shortly after recording. To avoid possible readers' drift or bias, 250 duplicate baseline scans were re-read at yearly intervals (longitudinal on-line quality control) and a correction factor calculated. RESULTS: Measurements during the 4 -year study showed a trend toward decreased values, with the <b>lacidipine</b> effect significantly greater than the atenolol one. A trend toward lower values was also observed in the longitudinal quality control of baseline scans. After applying a correction factor calculated from this longitudinal control, all measurements no longer decreased with time, but significantly increased, with progression being significantly smaller in <b>lacidipine</b> than in atenolol patients. Corrected values were quite similar to those calculated on measurements carried out at study-end. CONCLUSION: The relative benefit of <b>lacidipine</b> over atenolol could be measured precisely by reading scans either during the study or at study-end. However, absolute treatment-related changes (progression versus regression) cannot safely be judged by readings made during a long-term study, unless a longitudinal quality control of readings is performed...|$|E
