5|$|During {{the last}} year of the operation, the massive scope of full {{excavation}} and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, the 2002 dive season {{was dedicated to}} lifting the [...] turret to the surface. Around 160 divers were assigned to remove {{the parts of the}} hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, exothermic cutting torches and [...] hydroblasters. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually concreted coal as one of the ship's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage. A large, eight-legged <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> nicknamed the [...] "spider", was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the Wotan. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while the other ran the full length.|$|E

The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|E
50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> and hydraulics.

Clamping collars were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section extendable ladder, the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|R

500|$|The navy {{decided to}} convert Asahi into a {{submarine}} salvage ship {{and she began}} {{the first stage of}} her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925. From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at Kure Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large <b>lifting</b> <b>frames</b> were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0-1 (ex-). In May 1928, Asahi was fitted with a [...] compressed-air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an E2N1 Type 15 seaplane. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder. On the completion of testing in 1928, Asahi was placed in reserve.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> during safety gears tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test lift car and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the safety gears activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|R

2500|$|As {{the weight}} of the {{caissons}} and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams, the superstructure was strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> {{in order to avoid the}} need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a machinery deck 60ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing [...] each, 18 on each side to balance the [...] weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to overcome friction between the pulleys and their bearings. A [...] motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power.|$|R

40|$|Trends in the {{offshore}} wind market show that newly installed wind farms move towards deeper waters. Wind turbine generators are currently installed using jack-up vessels, {{which have a}} limited operating depth. Installation of wind turbines using a floating vessel is an alternative for the current method, but blade installation is an area which is not explored yet. Using the innovation model from the Delft System Approach, a new method for blade installation enabling competitive wind turbine generator installation is developed. The current installation method is analysed, and a logistical concept is proposed which can install wind turbines competitive using the Oleg Strashnov. Concepts are generated, from which the tower ring concept is the most feasible. A blade <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> {{is attached to the}} tower ring to eliminate the motions at the blade from the vessel. Wind turbine blade can be installed in 4. 2 hours, which is within the competitive time-frame. It is defined that wind turbines can be installed 38 hours faster than current jack-up vessels.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the extensibility and stiffness of the hamstrings {{in patients with}} nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Design: An experimental design. Setting: A university laboratory for human movement analysis in a department of rehabilitation medicine. Participants: Forty subjects, a patient group (20) and a healthy control group (20). Interventions: Subjects laid supine on an examination table with a <b>lift</b> <b>frame,</b> with left leg placed in a sling at the ankle. Straight leg raising, pulling force, and activity of hamstring and back muscles were recorded with electrodes. Patients indicated when they experienced tension or pain. Main Outcome Measures: The lift force, leg excursion, pelvic-femoral angle, first sensation of pain, and the electro-myogram of the hamstrings and back muscles measured in an experimental straight-leg raising set-up. Results: The patient group showed a significant restriction in range of motion (ROM) and extensibility of the hamstrings compared with the control group. No significant difference in hamstring muscle stiffness can be assessed between both groups. Conclusion: The restricted ROM and the decreased extensibility of the hamstrings in patients with nonspecific LBP is not caused by increased muscle stiffness of the hamstrings, but determined by the stretch tolerance of the patients...|$|R
