5000|$|In electronics, a Lecher line or <b>Lecher</b> <b>wires</b> {{is a pair}} of {{parallel}} wires or rods that were used to measure the wavelength of radio waves, mainly at UHF and microwave frequencies. [...] They form a short length of balanced transmission line (a resonant stub). When attached to a source of radio-frequency power such as a radio transmitter, the radio waves form standing waves along their length. By sliding a conductive bar that bridges the two wires along their length, the length of the waves can be physically measured. Austrian physicist Ernst Lecher, improving on techniques used by Oliver Lodge and Heinrich Hertz, developed this method of measuring wavelength around 1888. [...] Lecher lines were used as frequency measuring devices until frequency counters became available after World War 2. They were also used as components, often called [...] "resonant stubs", in UHF and microwave radio equipment such as transmitters, radar sets, and television sets, serving as tank circuits, filters, and impedance-matching devices. [...] They are used at frequencies between HF/VHF, where lumped components are used, and UHF/SHF, where resonant cavities are more practical.|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theory of}} transmission lines {{shows that the}} terminating impedance {{of a pair of}} lines may be expressed in terms of the current at any point in the lines, the potential difference across the lines at this point, and certain other characteristics of the lines. Therefore, if it were possible to measure the currents and voltages at various points along the lines, this would provide a method of measuring impedance. Unfortunately, when a bridge containing a current measuring instrument is placed across the lines, the current through the terminating impedance and the current through the bridge assume complicated forms. Also, the movement of the bridge along the lines changes the input impedance, and the input current varies with the position of the bridge. These difficulties render the direct method of measuring current and voltage at any point by means of a single bridge impracticable. Flint and Williams (1941) eliminated the effect of variations in the input by measuring the ratio of the currents flowing in two bridges. One bridge is fixed {{at the end of a}} pair of <b>Lecher</b> <b>wires,</b> and contains the unknown impedance in series with a current meter; the other bridge is movable, and contains a current meter only. Graphs of the current ratio plotted against certain functions of the distance between the two bridges give values of two constants, from which the terminating impedance may be calculated. Since the terminating impedance consists of the unknown impedance and the impedance of the current meter, a subsidiary experiment must be performed to determine the impedance of the current meter. Also, the exact way in which the two impedances are combined is not known. <p...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} circuits for {{the measurement}} of impedances at frequencies up to about 50 Mc/s are bridge networks although special design incorporating shielding and earthing devices is necessary in the radio-frequency range. The theory of the various bridge methods assumes that the current flowing in any arm of the bridge is constant throughout its path and depends only on the potential difference applied across the arm and the impedance of the arm. Since the current {{at any point in}} a circuit depends on the magnetic field of the electro-magnetic wave in the vicinity and is not constant throughout the whole of its path, this assumption is only permissable for wavelengths which are large compared with the linear dimensions of the apparatus. In fact the current varies from a maximum to a minimum value in a distance where is the wavelength of the electro-magnetic wave associated with the current. At a frequency of 100 Mc/s, say 300 cms and 4. = 75 cms. It is impracticable to design bridges of the dimensions of a few centimetres and other methods have to be employed at these higher frequencies. An outline of these methods is given in Section I followed by a more detailed study of two of the methods in Sections II and III. The difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory short-circuit in order to find the critical separation of the Williams' method was then investigated. This was eliminated by plotting the graphs differently. This work is described in Section IV. Next an impedance was measured on the same apparatus by the Williams method (using this modification) and the Chipman method. These results are described and compared in Section V. Finely in the conclusion it is suggested that the Williams method may prove more useful on a coaxial transmission line than on open <b>Lecher</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|E
