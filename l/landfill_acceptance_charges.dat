40|$|As {{a result}} of the EU Landfill Directive, the {{disposal}} of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash is restricted to only a few landfill sites in the UK. Alternative options for the management of fly ash, such as sintering, vitrification or stabilization/solidification, are either costly or not fully developed. In this paper an accelerated carbonation step is investigated for use with fly ash. The carbonation reaction involving fly ash was found to be optimum at a water/solid ratio of 0. 3 under ambient temperature conditions. The study of ash mineralogy showed the disappearance of lime/portlandite/calcium chloride hydroxide and the formation of calcite as carbonation proceeded. The leaching properties of carbonated ash were examined. Release of soluble salts, such as SO 4, Cl, was reduced after carbonation, but is still higher than the <b>landfill</b> <b>acceptance</b> limits for hazardous waste. It was also found that carbonation had a significant influence on lead leachability. The lead release from carbonated ash, {{with the exception of one}} of the fly ashes studied, was reduced by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude...|$|R

The analysis is needed to demonstrate that as a hazardous waste, or a stable, non reactive hazardous waste, or an inert waste, any load of waste meets the appropriate <b>landfill</b> waste <b>acceptance</b> criteria.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of waste {{characterization}} methods are available, each developed for a specific purpose such as determining compost stability, or for <b>landfill</b> <b>acceptance</b> criteria. Here test methods have been evaluated {{for the purpose of}} assessing waste treatment process performance and monitoring the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) from landfill. The suitability factors include the timescale of the method, applicability to a {{wide range of}} materials and ability to indicate the long-term biodegradability of organic waste samples. The anaerobic test methods, whilst producing reliable results, take at least several weeks to complete, therefore not allowing for regular routine analysis often required for diversion assessments. Short-term tests are required which can correlate with, and therefore estimate, values obtained from long-term anaerobic methods. Aerobic test methods were found to offer a significantly improved timescale compared with anaerobic test methods; however they have limitations due to not measuring the full extent of sample biodegradability. No single test method was found to be completely sufficient for routine biodegradability analysis suitable for monitoring the BMW diversion from landfill. Potential areas for further research include spectrographic FT-IR or enzyme-based approaches such as the ECD or EHT methods...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} wider {{feasibility}} study on the possible reuse potential of Croatian sewage sludge ash, ash has been produced by laboratory incineration of sewage sludge from two Croatian wastewater treatment plants. The Croatian sewage sludge ash was tested for soluble heavy metals according to EN 12457 and results considered {{in the context of}} EU <b>landfill</b> Waste <b>Acceptance</b> Criteria. With sewage sludge ash alone, the main soluble elements/ions of concern were (in decreasing order) : Mo, SO 4, Cr and Cl. When obtained ash was incorporated into cement mortars at cement replacement rates of 20 %, EN 12457 leaching of the crushed mortars demonstrated compliance with the strictest limits for inert <b>landfill</b> Waste <b>Acceptance</b> Criteria and well within other limits specified for use in road bases. However, much of the reduction in leaching levels {{can be attributed to the}} dilution effect of sand used in mortars. In the cases of Se, Cr, F and Cl, results imply that the cement used in the mortars actually represents a more significant source of soluble Se, Cr, F and Cl than the produced ash. Regardless, the overall results reveal that leaching of heavy metals and other ions is not a significant concern that would prevent the potential reuse of Croatian sewage sludge ash in cement mortars or concretes should Croatian wastewater treatment plants opt for sewage sludge incineration as an alternative sludge disposal and management option...|$|R

40|$|AbstractContemporary {{applications}} {{are changing the}} failure mechanisms of lead acid batteries. Sulfation at the negative electrode, acid stratification, and dendrite formation now precede positive electrode failures such as grid corrosion and active material shedding. To attenuate these failures, carbon has been explored as a negative electrode additive to increase <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance,</b> eliminate sulfation, and extend cycle life. Frequently, however, carbon incorporation decreases paste density and hinders manufacturability. Discrete carbon nanotubes (dCNT), also known as Molecular Rebar®, are lead acid battery additives which can be stably incorporated into either electrode to increase <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and cycle life with no change to paste density and without impeding the manufacturing process. Here, full-scale automotive batteries containing dCNT in the negative electrode or both negative and positive electrodes are compared to control batteries. dCNT batteries show little change to Reserve Capacity, improved Cold Cranking, increased <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and enhanced overall system efficiency. Life cycle tests show > 60 % increases when dCNT are incorporated into the negative electrode (HRPSoC/SBA) and up to 500 % when incorporated into both electrodes (SBA), with water loss per cycle reduced > 20 %.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis was completed {{with the aim of}} providing a complete picture of the dynamic <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> (DCA) behaviour of lead-acid (PbA) batteries of different carbon additive technologies. It was inspired by the growth in the electric vehicle (EVs) market due to the increasing need for clean energy and the fact that, despite advancements in their technology, EVs still remain expensive due to the cost of the battery. Considering their inexpensive manufacturing costs, as well as material cost, the advancement of automotive PbA batteries for EV use is an area of high interest.

40|$|Lead acid {{battery cells}} have {{low energy density}} and {{relatively}} low life-cycle, yet because of their cost effectiveness they are still considered the preferred choice by many electric vehicle (EV) developers {{and are likely to}} continue to be so for the next 5 - 10 years. One method of improving the performance of a battery powered EV is to improve the battery charging methodology since EV performance and range is largely determined by the capacity, weight and charge/discharge characteristics of the on-board batteries.

5000|$|The six <b>acceptance</b> <b>charges</b> against Marrese were {{dismissed}} on a legal technicality in mid-October 1983, {{when the judge}} ruled that a school trustee cannot be considered a municipal official. Defending himself against the remaining breach-of-trust charge, Marrese told the court that he had only agreed to make an improper financial arrangement with Lonergan to procure evidence that the realtor was trying to bribe him. He testified {{that he had been}} planning to take his evidence to the next board meeting in order [...] "to reveal the bribe and vote against Lonergan's offer"; this course of action was, he added, made impossible by his arrest. [...] In his closing remarks, the Crown council described Marrese's explanation as [...] "unmitigated lies" [...] and [...] "nonsense". The judge agreed, describing Marrese's testimony as [...] "untruthful" [...] and [...] "a total fabrication". Marrese was found guilty of breach-of-trust on November 7, 1983. Marrese's criminal conviction meant that he automatically lost his seat on the separate school board. Jack Graham, the board's acting chairman, described the conviction as the most embarrassing incident in the history of Catholic education in Ontario. On November 23, Marrese was stripped of his real estate license and sentenced to a year in prison. He was forced to resign from the Ontario Mortgage Corp. and the Ontario Land Corp.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for estimating {{the value of}} information of sampling programs for contaminated soil. The purpose is to calculate the optimal number of samples when {{the objective is to}} estimate the mean concentration. A Bayesian risk-cost-benefit decision analysis framework is applied and the approach is design-based. The model explicitly includes sample uncertainty at a complexity level that can be applied to practical contaminated land problems with limited amount of data. Prior information about the contamination level is modelled by probability density functions. The value of information is expressed in monetary terms. The most cost-effective sampling program is the one with the highest expected net value. The model was applied to a contaminated scrap yard in Goteborg, Sweden, contaminated by metals. The optimal number of samples was determined to be in the range of 16 - 18 for a remediation unit of 100 m(2). Sensitivity analysis indicates that the perspective of the decision-maker is important, and that the cost of failure and the future land use are the most important factors to consider.

40|$|Batteries in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle applications operate from partial state of charge and are subjected to short periods of charge and discharge with high currents. These operating conditions create two major problems, namely low <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> and progressive sulfation of the negative plates. The low specific electrochemically active surface of the negative plates can be expanded significantly by adding definite types of carbon materials, which improves substantially the <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the battery. We assume that the slowest elementary process during charging negative plates is {{the dissolution of the}} lead sulfate crystals. This process can be accelerated by adding poly-aspartic acid (Baypure DS- 100 or DS) to the negative paste or to the electrolyte. DS causes partial amorphization of the PbSO 4 particles and reduces their size. Thus, the reversibility of the charge-discharge processes at the negative plates is improved and their sulfation is retarded. Besides, DS increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution on the lead electrode. These effects of DS make it a useful additive to lead-acid batteries operated in the high-rate partial-state-of-charge duty...|$|R

This work elucidates the impact of the external surface area of carbon additives on the electrochemical performance of lead-carbon electrodes with respect to the DCA. Five specially synthesized amorphous hard carbon powders with different specific external surface area ranging from 13 m 2 g− 1 to 192 m 2 g− 1 were added to the negative active material of laboratory lead-carbon test cells. Results from cyclic voltammetry reveal that the specific external surface area of amorphous carbons exhibits a clear correlation to the electrochemical activity of lead-carbon electrodes. Firstly, an almost linear increase of the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction with increasing specific external surface area of the carbon additive can be found. Secondly, the specific double-layer capacity of the negative active material is directly linked to the specific external surface area of the additive, as well. Thirdly, a clear correlation to the DCA can be established. In conclusion, a high specific external carbon surface in the negative active material seems to be a key to improve the dynamic <b>charge</b> <b>acceptance</b> of modern lead-carbon batteries...|$|R
