5|$|On 29 November 2006, an Australian Army S-70A Black Hawk {{helicopter}} {{operating from}} Kanimbla, and carrying ten Army personnel on board, crashed whilst attempting {{to land on}} the ship's deck, killing 1 person, injuring 7 more and leaving one missing (later confirmed dead). HMAS Melville arrived on task the morning of 15 December 2006, equipped with a Towed Pinger Locating Drone supplied from the United States Navy set about locating the downed Black Hawk. Melville detected the <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> during its first pass over the crash site and pinpointed its exact location in subsequent passes. The helicopter is sitting in around 2900 metres of water.|$|E
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
25|$|The cameras filmed at {{high speeds}} causing an {{estimated}} 15 times slow-motion view of the sequence when seen in a documentary. The camera capsules were jettisoned soon after the first stage separation, and, though at about 200,000 feet in altitude, were still below orbital velocity. They then reentered the atmosphere and parachuted to the ocean, where they floated waiting for recovery. Only {{one of the two}} S-II cameras on Apollo 6 was recovered; the other was lost due to a problem with its <b>locator</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PLBs ({{personal}} <b>locator</b> <b>beacons)</b> are {{for personal}} use and are intended to indicate a person in distress who is away from normal emergency services; e.g., 9-1-1. They are also used for crewsaving applications in shipping and lifeboats at terrestrial systems. In New South Wales, some police stations and the National Parks and Wildlife Service provide personal <b>locator</b> <b>beacons</b> to hikers for no charge.|$|R

25|$|There were {{fears that}} the plane's {{tracking}} equipment and emergency <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> could have been damaged after the crash or weakened by interference, and that this would hamper the search. The head of the National Search and Rescue Agency told the Associated Press that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea. From 5 January 2007, {{the main focus of}} the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's Sam Ratulangi Airport reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before. However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim. Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece. On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore sent four towed underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> detectors, sometimes called Towed Pinger Locators, and six consultants in their use to aid in the search. These would successfully locate the black boxes. On 24 January, the British ship MN Endeavour joined the search. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed. By 24 January, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were found by the submarine [...] using sonar to detect the underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> signals and were quickly retrieved by Canadian Navy divers (the FDR on 6 September and the CVR on 11 September 1998). Both had stopped recording when the aircraft lost electrical power at approximately , 5 minutes and 37 seconds before impact.|$|E
2500|$|On July 26, 2013, ANA said it {{had found}} wiring damage on two 787 locator beacons. United Airlines also {{reported}} that it had found a pinched wire in one 787 <b>locator</b> <b>beacon.</b> [...] On August 14, 2013, the media reported a fire extinguisher fault affecting three ANA airplanes, which caused the fire extinguishers to discharge into the opposite engine from the one requested.

50|$|On 18 February 2009, a Super Puma Helicopter ditched {{in the sea}} whilst {{approaching}} one of the ETAP installations. All 18 {{passengers and}} crew were rescued. Bernard Looney, a President of BPâ€™s North Sea business based in Aberdeen, credited their Project Jigsaw with the safe, quick and efficient recovery of the 16 passengers and 2 crew. Project Jigsaw uses <b>locator</b> <b>beacons</b> on all helicopters, standby vessels and fast rescue craft, connected to a computerised system located in Aberdeen. This way locations of all rescue craft and their response time are always known to staff in the BP control centre. In addition all staff are supplied with wristwatch personal <b>locator</b> <b>beacons</b> (WWPLB) that automatically activate when immersed in water.|$|R
2500|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} contact the helicopter were unsuccessful approach control declared an alert at 2.50am. [...] Four helicopters, a Royal Air Force Nimrod, a United States Orion and number of vessels in the area searched for the missing aircraft. At 10.23am two inflated life rafts were spotted floating upside-down 16 miles north east of the Murchison platform. Other pieces of helicopter debris and three bodies were found and recovered 17 to 22 miles north east of this platform during the day. On 17 September an underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> led searchers to {{the bulk of the}} wreckage and two more bodies [...] from the platform at [...] below water.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 212 {{registered}} as G-BDIL was a twin-engine two-bladed medium helicopter manufactured on 18 July 1975. For the flight the rear bench seats were removed to allow fitting a rescue winch, leaving only two rear seats available {{and the remaining}} two cabin crew using safety harnesses. The aircraft had an Certificate of Airworthiness that was valid until 30 January 1983 and a Certificate of Maintenance that was valid until 27 October 1982 or 7,567.5 airframe hours. The airframe had a total of 7,532.25 hours {{at the time of}} the accident. [...] The gross weight of the aircraft and the estimated center of gravity were both within authorized limits. [...] The aircraft had two liferafts installed and all six personnel were wearing immersion survival suits and life vests with personal locator beacons. The aircraft was also equipped with a SARBE beacon and an underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon,</b> both activated by immersion in salt water. [...] Available navigation equipment installed included a Decca Navigator System, VOR, and ADF receivers. During the flight, the co-pilot had asked for the non-directional beacon located on the Murchison platform to be turned on to assist in finding the Baffin Seal but the beacon remained off until after the accident because the platform's radio operator was fixing an equipment issue.|$|E

Beaming requires a sensor lock on the subject; members of SG teams are equipped with <b>locator</b> <b>beacons,</b> and later <b>locator</b> chip implants, to facilitate emergency beam-out. The Wraith have developed countermeasures to prevent beaming aboard their ships. Beaming is not possible through shields. With a slight modification, Asgard beams can convert energy into desired forms such as air and food.|$|R
5000|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{were reported as}} [...] "good", with the water at 0 C, waves at 2 - 3 m, and winds at 37 km/h. The normal practice on these flights is to wear immersion suits for hypothermia protection. Survival times for adult men wearing the immersion suits in these conditions are estimated at 24 hours, but no signals had been received from the suit <b>locator</b> <b>beacons.</b> According to the company's website, the suits are Helly Hansen type E452 Survival / Marine Abandonment suits with their own inflatable life jackets. All passengers on these flights are required to have taken a five-day escape and survival course within the past three years, but escape from a ditched helicopter is difficult even when put down gently.|$|R
