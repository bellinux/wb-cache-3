5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E
25|$|A <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> is a {{gardening}} {{tool that}} propels {{air out of}} a nozzle to move yard debris such as leaves. Leaf blowers are usually powered by two-stroke engine or an electric motor, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> was invented by Dom Quinto in 1950.|$|E

Witz becomes the test pilot for a flying chair, one of Sonny's newest ideas. The Stinkers go to Groundskeeper Roy's shed and steal his <b>leaf</b> <b>blower.</b> Before that, they stole Mr. Brinway's desk chair. The Stinkers fail to notice that the <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> was not entirely duct taped onto the desk chair. When turned it on, the <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> flew off the contraption but left Witz sitting in the chair. The <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> was heading straight for Mr. Brinway's new convertible, but the <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> {{ran out of gas}} before it destroyed the car.

5000|$|A <b>leaf</b> <b>blower</b> (often {{referred}} to as simply a blower) is a gardening tool that propels air out of a nozzle to move debris such as leaves and grass cuttings.

Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The latter is more ergonomic for prolonged use. Larger units may rest on wheels and even use a motor for propulsion. These are sometimes called [...] "walk behind leaf blowers" [...] because they must be pushed by hand to be operated.|$|E
