This paper investigates the influence of compacting rates on the properties of compressed earth blocks.

The study concludes that although the low rate of compaction achieved slightly better performance characteristics, there is {{no statistically significant difference}} between the soil blocks produced with <b>low</b> <b>compacting</b> rate and high compacting rate. The study demonstrates that there is not much influence on the properties of compressed earth blocks produced with <b>low</b> and high <b>compacting</b> rates.

30|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of densifying ground maize cobs and Ceibapentandra sawdust at room temperature using <b>low</b> <b>compacting</b> pressurewithout a binder. The maize cobs were crushed using a hammer mill. Particlesizes of maize cobs and C. pentandra used for the study were≤ 1  mm. The two materials were combined at mixing percentages of 90 : 10, 70 : 30 and 50 : 50 (C. pentandra/maize cobs). Briquettes wereproduced using a laboratory hydraulic press. Compacting pressure was varied from 20 to 50  MPa at an interval of 10  MPa. The results indicated that therelaxed density of briquettes produced from particles of maize cobs only rangedfrom 541 to 659  kg/m 3 whilst that made from a mixture of maizecobs and C. pentandra ranged from 565 to 774  kg/m 3.Compressive strength in cleft of briquettes produced from maize cobs only rangedfrom 0.12 to 0.54  N/mm whilst that produced {{from a combination of}} maizecobs and C. pentandra ranged from 7.72 to 59.22  N/mm.Additionally, at all compacting pressure levels, briquettes made from maize cobsonly had an impact resistance index of 0 %. Whilst those made from a combinationof maize cobs and C. pentandra ranged from 115 % to 500 %. Thus,briquettes with adequate physical and mechanical characteristics could beproduced from maize cobs at room temperature using <b>low</b> <b>compacting</b> pressure whenmaize cobs are combined with sawdust of C. pentandra. These findingscould enhance the existing technology for densifying agricultural residues, forexample, maize cobs, especially in rural communities.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new sample of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources with radio {{luminosity}} below 10 ^ 26 W/Hz at 1. 4 GHz called the <b>low</b> luminosity <b>compact</b> (LLC) objects. The sources {{have been selected}} from FIRST survey and observed with MERLIN at L-band and C-band. The main criterion used for selection was luminosity of the objects and approximately {{one third of the}} CSS sources from the new sample have a value of radio luminosity comparable to FRIs. About 80 % of the sources have been resolved and about 30 % of them have weak extended emission and disturbed structures when compared with the observations of higher luminosity CSS sources. We studied correlation between radio power and linear size, and redshift with a larger sample that included also published samples of compact objects and large scale FRIIs and FRIs. The <b>low</b> luminosity <b>compact</b> objects occupy the space in radio power versus linear size diagram below the main evolutionary path of radio objects. We suggest that many of them might be short-lived objects, and their radio emission may be disrupted several times before becoming FRIIs.
