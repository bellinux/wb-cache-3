40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to {{the rising}} cost of infrastructure, there is a {{paradigm}} shift from the public sector to private sector provision of <b>infrastructure.</b> Therefore, <b>local</b> authority needs to identify ways into partnership with the private sector to secure adequate provision. The paper reviews the different approaches to facilitate off-site <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> then examines options for both public and private funding. It then explores how development control mechanism might be used to secure off-site <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> facilities. The paper concludes with a short summary of key issues in <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and proposes a model for <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> provision...|$|R
40|$|Critical infrastructureâ€™ {{generally}} {{refers to}} significant pieces {{of plant and}} equipment, such as power stations and motorways. High population densities in cities, and the increasing interconnectedness of the services and supply chains that sustain them, mean <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is equally important. <b>Local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> {{must be able to}} cope with system shocks, whether from natural hazards, terrorism or catastrophic failures. Engineering design plays a major part in achieving this, but shocks will occur that overwhelm even the most conservative design. <b>Local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> must therefore be able to adapt to, and recover from, shocks: it must be resilient. <b>Local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has evolved with little consideration for resilience of the interconnected system as a whole, whereas resilience {{has been the subject of}} much research in many other systems. This paper explores the lessons that <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can learn from such research by reviewing literature related to resilience of ecological, economic, physical infrastructure, community/social and government systems. A critical analysis highlights the factors affecting resilience and different approaches that need to be taken into account when attempting to model <b>infrastructure</b> at a <b>local</b> scale. The ultimate aim is to provide an evidence base on which to build resilience into various infrastructures and direct future <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> resilience research in an age of austerity. ...|$|R

40|$|Local {{authorities}} {{are turning to}} the private sectors to achieve their objective of providing <b>local</b> <b>infrastructures</b> for effective management of the local areas. Private sector and local authority have good understanding of the fundamental concept of <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> provision. Despite this understanding, there are still considerable lapses of what best practice and method to adopt {{in the provision of}} <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This study therefore examined the role of private developers in <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the practices used by local authorities for infrastructural procurement in Malaysia. 22 local authorities and 16 developers were selected through purposive sampling method, and data collected using questionnaires was analyzed using the descriptive analysis technique. The findings revealed that joint venture and complete public delivery systems; negotiations are the most commonly adopted practices and successful method applied by the local authority to securing infrastructure. One major weakness expressed by majority of the developers is difficulty to promote private sector involvement in <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> development due to unregulated-procedure. This study therefore recommends that local authorities should not only be concerned on collaborative and joint approach but also in developing a well-coordinated structure and system of operations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the recent decentralization of governance in Indonesia {{and its impact}} on <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> provision. The decentralization of decisionmaking power to local jurisdictions in Indonesia may have improved the matching of public <b>infrastructures</b> provision with <b>local</b> preferences. However, decentralization has made <b>local</b> public <b>infrastructures</b> depend on <b>local</b> resources. Due to differences in initial endowments, this may result in the divergence of <b>local</b> public <b>infrastructures</b> in rich and poor jurisdictions. Using data from village-level panel surveys conducted in 1996, 2000, and 2006, this paper finds that (1) <b>local</b> public <b>infrastructures</b> depend on <b>local</b> resources, (2) decentralization has improved the availability of <b>local</b> public <b>infrastructures,</b> (3) <b>local</b> jurisdictions are converging to a similar level of <b>local</b> public <b>infrastructure,</b> and (4) to some extent, decentralized public infrastructures' provision reflects local preferences.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} face considerable {{challenges in}} the design and operation of <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> planning systems in decentralized or decentralizing countries. Many of these are well documented, but the complex political economy environment in which planning evolves has received insufficient attention. The forces driving decentralization and other public sector reforms shape how planning emerges, functions and performs. Local planning involves a range of differentially empowered and variously motivated actors at multiple levels and in diverse ways. The dynamics among them can support or undermine authentic local planning, with potentially significant implications for results. This paper reviews the evolution of <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> planning with a focus on least developed countries, outlining the key expected and observed relationships among decentralization, planning systems and infrastructure development. The main goal is to create greater awareness of political economy issues that could inform the design and management of more effective and pragmatic <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> planning systems...|$|R

40|$|Do <b>local</b> {{improvements}} in <b>infrastructure</b> provision improve city competitiveness? What public finance mechanisms stimulate <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> supply? And how do local efforts compare with national decisions of placing inter-regional trunk infrastructure? In this paper, we {{examine how the}} combination of <b>local</b> and national <b>infrastructure</b> supply improve city competitiveness, measured as the cityâ€™s share of national private investment. For the empirical analysis, we collect city-level data for India, and link private investment decisions to infrastructure provision. We find that a cityâ€™s proximity to international ports and highways connecting large domestic markets has the largest effect on its attractiveness for private investment. In comparison, the supply of <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure</b> services â€“ such as municipal roads, street lighting, water supply, and drainage â€“ enhance competitiveness, but their impacts are much smaller. Thus, while local efforts are important for competitiveness, {{they are less likely}} to be successful in cities distant from the countryâ€™s main trunk infrastructure. In terms of financing <b>local</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> we find that a cityâ€™s ability to raise its own source revenues by means of local taxes and user fees increases infrastructure supply, whereas as inter governmental transfers do not have statisticall...|$|R
