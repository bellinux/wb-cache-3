40|$|The {{effects of}} Sr {{addition}} and pressure increase on the microstructure and casting defects of a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> (LPDC) AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 alloy have been studied. Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used}} to quantitatively examine the microstructural changes and the amount of porosity occurring at different Sr levels and pressure parameters. The results indicate that an increase in the filling pressure induces lower heat dissipation of the liquid close to the die/core surfaces, with the formation of slightly greater dendrite arms and coarser eutectic Si particles. On the other hand, the increase in the Sr level leads to finer microstructural scale and eutectic Si. The analysed variables, within the experimental conditions, do not affect the morphology of eutectic Si particles. Higher applied pressure and Sr content generate castings with lower amount of porosity. However, as the filling pressure increases the flow of metal inside the die cavity is more turbulent, leading to the formation of oxide films and cold shots. In the analysed range of experimental conditions, the design of experiment methodology and the analysis of variance {{have been used to}} develop statistical models that accurately predict the average size of secondary dendrite arm spacing and the amount of porosity in the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> AlSi 7 Mg 0. 3 alloy...|$|R
30|$|Alloy wheels {{constitute}} a very prominent aspect of an automobile. This {{is because it}} forms {{an integral part of}} overall visual esthetic appeal of the automobile. The A 356 aluminum alloy with 7 % silicon as its prime alloying element forms the popular material for the manufacture of automotive alloy wheel castings. The alloy wheel manufacturing process starts with ingots which form the input into the furnace of the melting section. After ladle preheating, the liquid metal treatment (degassing) is performed in the melting section. The die in the die maintenance area is preheated and sandblasted in order to clean the die surface, increase the surface finish and relieve the external surface stresses. Then, the prepared die is preserved in the Die preservation yard. As per the production schedule the required die is retrieved from the die preservation yard and then fitted onto the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> (LPDC) machine unit.|$|R

40|$|The {{die casting}} {{process is a}} name given to metal casting {{processes}} that utilize metal molds or permanent dies.

The three processes differ mainly {{in the amount of}} pressure that is used to force the molten metal into the die. The advantages of such a process include high production rates, exceptional dimensional repeatability, low part costs, and less machining due to reduced casting finish stock. The great heat transfer rate obtained by means of metal molds can further refine and improve the final cast structure, and therefore the mechanical properties, of the castings.

Magnesium casting technology was well developed during and after World War II, both in gravity sand and permanent mold casting as well as high-pressure die casting, for aerospace, defense and automotive applications. In the last 20 years, most of the development has been focused on thin-wall die casting applications in the automotive industry, taking advantages of the excellent castability of modern magnesium alloys. Recently, the continued expansion of magnesium casting applications into automotive, defense, aerospace, electronics and power tools has led to the diversification of casting processes into vacuum die casting, <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> squeeze casting, lost foam casting, ablation casting as well as semi-solid casting. This paper will also review the historical, current and potential structural use of magnesium with a focus on automotive applications. The technical challenges of magnesium structural applications are also discussed. Increasing worldwide energy demand, environment protection and government regulations will stimulate more applications of lightweight magnesium castings in the next few decades. The development of use of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) tools will accelerate the applications of magnesium castings in structural applications...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} a study of low- {{pressure}} die casting process in Southern Aluminium Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Comalco in Tasmania. The first major stage in the wheel manufacturing process is casting. Wheels for automobile companies such as Nissan, Ford and Mazda are cast using a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process. A casting cycle involves filling of the dies with molten aluminium solidifying the aluminium in the dies, ejecting the solidified castings from the dies, quenching the castings to a temperature close to room temperature and delivering the castings to the operator for further processing. When running at full capacity, each casting machine is capable of producing two castings simultaneously every six minutes. Each metal transfer into the caster crucible yields enough volume of metal {{for the production of}} approximately sixty wheels. The operator that initiates the casting cycle is responsible for some further wheel processing operations. These operations include the stamping of each cast wheel with a melt number stamp, manually removing any visible marks from the front face of each wheel and removing excess aluminium from the top and bottom rim of each wheel and finally, checking the castings for distortion using a distortion gauge. Each time the caster crucible is filled, an alloy sample is taken from the crucible and examined spectrographically to determine alloy composition. The alloy composition is recorded and the melt number is changed. The melt number of each cast wheel can then be related to an exact alloy composition. A distortion gauge placed on the front face of the wheel will inform the operator of the wheel distortion. A wheel that it badly distorted, greater than plus or minus half a millimeter out of plane is rejected. Further there is limitations on the minimum thickness that can be cast on these wheels. The conditions to achieve the minimum thickness in effective casting have been established in industry over a series of investigations. This project highlights the conditions necessary to maintain minimum thickness in wheel castings, produced by <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> by taking into consideration various process variables. The stress analysis and solidification rates have been studied as a part of this investigation using finite element and finite difference methods. The experimental investigation in achieving minimum effective casting thickness complements the results from the finite element investigations. The experiments were carried out over 500 wheels for Nissan, Ford and Mazda wheels to understand the effect of process variables on cast dimensions This investigation gives {{a better understanding of the}} major process variables that control the thickness in casting process.

In this paper, the effects of microstructure and defects on the impact properties are studied. The results indicate that the impact energy is lower in as-cast wheel than in T 6 heat-treated wheels. A finer microstructure always corresponds to higher {{impact strength}}, while a direct correlation between the resistance to crack propagation values and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) exists. Casting defects, revealed by means of X-ray and density measurements techniques, become critical when concentrated around the V-notch, where they reduce the load bearing area of Charpy specimens. The fracture profile and surface of Charpy specimens have been investigated revealing how the crack crosses the interdendritic eutectic region where a significant fraction of cracked eutectic silicon and intermetallic particles is found. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behaviour of the alloy of the wheels analysed, in order to predict the final microstructure and shrinkage formation. Solidification times, estimated by means of SDAS measurements and calculated with a numerical simulation approach, showa good correspondence. Critical areas, as concern hot spots and shrinkage porosities, are generally revealed in the zone of the wheels between the spoke and the rim, {{as well as in the}} rim area...|$|E

40|$|A {{repetitive}} <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> {{technique has}} been developed for casting high quality Mg 6 SCU 2 SY 10 bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples. Using these as-cast samples, the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the BMG in the supercooled liquid (SCL) region was investigated principally by uniaxial tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Using the die casting facility, charge temperature, injection pressure and injection velocity {{were found to be}} important parameters for controlling the length, porosity and degree of crystallinity in the as-cast samples. A processing map was generated which showed that a melt temperature and casting pressure in the range 560 - 580 °C and 0. 4 - 0. 5 bar, respectively, generated the highest quality samples. The static crystallization behaviour of the as-cast BMG was investigated in detail. It was found that the kinetics of both anisothermal and isothermal crystallization were adequately represented by a number of transformation models. Using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) relation in conjunction with isothermal DSC, the Avrami exponent was found to vary from 2. 2 to 2. 5 with increasing annealing temperature which implies that, at high annealing temperatures, nucleation occurs at a constant rate accompanied by diffusion-controlled growth of spherical grains. A comparable Avrami exponent of 2. 34 was also calculated by anisothermal DSC using the Ozawa method. The tensile flow behaviour of the BMG was investigated over a range of strain rates (10. 3 to 10. 1 S&# 149; 1) and deformation temperatures (150 to 170 QC) in the SCL region using standardized tensile test samples. It was found that, the flow stress increased rapidly to a maximum value followed by a decrease to a very low steady-state value. In the SCL region, the relationship between peak flow stress, strain rate and absolute deformation temperature was described adequately by the classic Sellars-Tegart constitutive relationship. There was also a good correlation between the Zener-Hollomon parameter, Z, and the flow characteristics of the BMG such as the transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow at Z> 1 031 S&# 149; 1 and optimum superplasticity for Z-values in the range 5 x 1030 to 5 x 1031 S&# 149; 1 where tensile elongations in excess of 1400 % were achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{accuracy}} of <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> simulation results is both verified and improved for the casting process at Oras Oyj. The accuracy of casting simulation depends on the correctness of the initial data used for the simulation. This data include the process parameters and material data. As casting simulation programs only usually provide a limited database for the materials available on purchase it is often necessary to expand this database by modeling more materials and providing the correct process parameters of the simulated process. The main goal of this project was to verify the correctness {{of the most important}} process parameters, material data and the actual results. With correct values the simulations can provide valuable information to the product designers and production. This information can be used to design better products and molds from the concept stage forwards. The simulation results can be used to improve old products. The project was divided into two separate parts, theoretical and experimental sections. The theoretical section of the project concentrated on providing background information on the data which needed to be verified. During the experimental section of the project, data was acquired which could be used to tune the simulation program. The data on casting alloys were improved by simulating the materials properties which were needed. These simulated properties were verified by using the thermal analysis of the casting alloys. The mold materials were tested at Jönköping University for the needed properties. All of these measurements were used to model the casting alloys and mold materials into the simulation programs database. An experimental mold was also manufactured; this mold was used to measure the temperature-time curves inside the mold material during the casting cycles. The mold was used to cast test-castings of each different casting alloy which had to be simulated. The thermal data acquired from these test castings was compared to the simulated thermal data and the simulation program was adjusted until the results were comparable. The accuracy of the simulation results was increased significantly due to the improved data acquired during this project.

40|$|Selection of {{materials}} with the expected, application-dependent characteristics constitutes {{a very important}} point in any industrial application. In the automotive and aeronautical industries, the current tendency is to use light metals and their alloys for production of various components. For example, some of the problems related to fuel consumption and weight reduction could be partially solved by using such alloys as an alternative to traditional iron-based alloy components. Due to their very attractive properties, the most commonly employed light materials for producing high-stressed components are aluminium, magnesium and their alloys. Al-based alloys have a high strength/weight ratio, good formability, excellent combination of castability and mechanical properties which together with an excellent corrosion resistance make them very appropriate for a large variety of applications. There are two important families of aluminium alloys: (i) wrought alloys, firstly cast as ingots and/or billets and then mechanically hot- and/or cold-worked into the preferred shape, and (ii) cast alloys, directly cast into their final form through different traditional or innovative processes. At the same time, there is continuing interest in Mg alloys for engineering proposals because of their lowest density directly connected to a weight saving of about 40 % compared to steel and cast iron and 20 % compared to aluminium for the same component performance. Their high specific strength, good castability and machinability, high thermal conductivity, high dimensional stability, good electromagnetic shielding property, high damping characteristics and full recyclability place them in a particular position for production of different types of components. High-pressure die casting is the most widely used technique and represents about 50 % of all light alloy casting production. The tendency to use <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> is increasing (it accounts for about 20 % of all production). Gravity die casting, a small but growing contribution derived from a vacuum die casting and squeeze casting process, represents the remaining share of manufacturing processes. Generally, during solidification in a traditional manufacturing process, volume contraction is observed. This is due to the wrong feeding system and/or gas development, which in turn generate some voids or cavities within a casting, which are in turn responsible for the presence of defects in the casting components. For these reasons, the research community and manufacturing industries are giving a high level of attention to the development of innovative production procedures. In this context, semi-solid metal processing is able to attain at least the same level of properties and performances as those obtained by conventional techniques. Progresses in materials development represent a valid support for enhancing the life of an engineering component and its reliability. In this chapter, a general overview of the actual scenario concerning the production and use of light alloys will be presented, including a short history and description of state-of-the-art techniques integrated with some results of the current research in this field carried out by the author...|$|E

V ta namen smo podrobneje proučevali dosežene kemijske sestave ulitkov in njihovo toplotno obdelavo. Ulitki so liti po tehnologiji nizkotlačnega litja in toplotno obdelani po režimu toplotne obdelave T 6, ki vključuje raztopno žarjenje, gašenje in umetno staranje pri povišani temperaturi.

V eksperimentalnem delu je predstavljen potek raziskav, ki so bile opravljene v okviru tega magistrskega dela. Za izvedbo raziskav smo uporabili osem ulitkov iz podjetja Talum, d. d. Dva sta ostala v litem stanju, dva smo preiskovali po raztopnem žarjenju, dva po celotni toplotni obdelavi v podjetju Talum, d. d., na dveh pa smo na Naravoslovnotehniški fakulteti izvedli lastno toplotno obdelavo. Iz ulitkov smo izrezali standardne preizkušance za natezni preizkus, s pomočjo svetlobne mikroskopije pregledali mikrostrukturo, izvedli kemijsko analizo s pomočjo energijske disperzijske spektroskopije in pregledali prelome nateznih preizkušancev s pomočjo vrstične elektronske mikroskopije. Po analizi rezultatov smo ugotovili, da nam je z lastno toplotno obdelavo sicer uspelo povišati raztezke, vendar pa sta se preveč zmanjšali natezna trdnost in meja plastičnosti, ki nista dosegali vrednosti, predpisanih s strani kupca. Nadalje smo ugotovili, da pri vseh ulitkih kemijska sestava odstopa od predpisane, kar lahko negativno vpliva na raztezek. Pri analizi prelomov smo ugotovili poroznost v vseh nateznih preizkušancih, kar prav tako negativno vpliva na raztezek. The {{purpose of}} the master thesis was to {{investigate}} the problem of insufficient elongation and variations thereof at certain castings manufactured by the company Talum, d. d. For this, we further studied the obtained chemical composition of castings and their heat treatment. The pieces are cast by low-pressure casting technology and heat-treated under the regime of heat treatment T 6. First they were solution annealed and then quenched in water and artificially aged. The theoretical part provides basic information on the casting of aluminum alloys, details about the group to which it belongs 3 xx. x basis for preparing material and <b>low-pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> and heat treatment, with emphasis on the T 6. In the experimental part the course of research that have been conducted within the framework of this master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis is presented. To carry out the research, we used eight castings of Talum, d. d. Two pieces remained in the as-cast state, two were examined in solution treated state, two after the full heat treatment in the company Talum, d. d., while two were checked after own heat treatment conducted in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. On the pieces we performed tensile tests, examination of the microstructure using light microscopy, chemical analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy and tensile fractures review using scanning electron microscopy. After analyzing the results, we find that with our own heat treatment we succeeded to increase elongation, but the tensile strength and yield were both reduced, which did not achieve the values prescribed by the buyer. Furthermore, we find that all pieces of the chemical composition deviates from the prescribed, which may adversely affect the elongation. When analyzing the fracture surface, we found a porosity of tensile specimens, which also has a negative effect on elongation...|$|E
