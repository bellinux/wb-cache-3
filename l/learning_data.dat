He has published over 250 research articles, including many highly cited ones, as well as several books on these topics. His recent work has focused on scalable algorithms for constructing predictive models from large, semantically disparate distributed data, learning predictive models from linked open data, big data analytics, analysis and prediction of protein-protein, protein-RNA, and protein-DNA interfaces and interactions, social network analytics, health informatics, secrecy-preserving query answering, representing and reasoning about preferences, and causal inference and meta analysis.|$|E

2500|$|In {{reinforcement}} <b>learning,</b> <b>data</b> [...] {{are usually}} not given, but generated by an agent's interactions with the environment. At each point in time , the agent performs an action [...] and the environment generates an observation [...] and an instantaneous cost , according to some (usually unknown) dynamics. The aim is to discover a policy for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost, e.g., the expected cumulative cost. The environment's dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy are usually unknown, but can be estimated.|$|E

2500|$|Despite criticisms, experimenters {{are still}} trying to gather data that may support the case that {{conscious}} [...] "will" [...] can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so. Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex (anterior medial prefrontal cortex) and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (medial parietal cortex). In order to ensure report timing of conscious [...] "will" [...] to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% accuracy rate, which may be limited by experimental setup; machine <b>learning</b> <b>data</b> limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.|$|E

Student <b>learning</b> <b>data</b> requires information from all subject areas, disaggregated by demographic groups, by teachers, by grade level, by cohorts over time, and individual student growth. This {{type of data}} helps to address additional help to {{students who are not}} proficient, deepening into what they know and what they don't know to become proficient. Student <b>learning</b> <b>data</b> connects with curriculum, instruction, and assessment in order to improve outcomes. Student <b>learning</b> <b>data</b> can clearly state the effectiveness of a single educator or the entire school. SLD can be gathered by looking at diagnostic tests, formative assessments, performance assessments, standardized tests, non-referenced tests, summative assessments, teacher-assigned tests, and others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{describes}} an ultrasonic robot eye for shape recognition using ultrasound pressure data and a Genetic Algorithm. This type of robot eye has commonly used a Neural Network (NN) for shape recognition. However, a NN perform poorly when lacking <b>learned</b> <b>data.</b> In order {{to overcome this}} problem when using a NN, we here attempt to replace the NN with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Unlike a NN, the GA can recognize shapes without depending on <b>learned</b> <b>data.</b> Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition ratios of the proposed ultrasonic robot eye using the GA are {{higher than that of}} a conventional ultrasonic robot eye using a NN. Therefore, it is shown that our robot eye is effective for many robotic applications...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} hierarchical agglomerative cluster algorithm Pnc 2 {{in the context}} of direct generation of If-Then rules for classification tasks. As an agglomerative cluster algorithm, the Pnc 2 initializes each <b>learn</b> <b>data</b> tuple as a single cluster. Then, if a merge test is passed, iteratively always those two clusters with the same output value are merged, that are closest to each other. The merge test transforms the generalized cluster into a rule and evaluates it by a kind of hitrate. The rule's premise is the cuboid, that encloses the input vectors of all <b>learn</b> <b>data</b> tuples merged in the cluster. This representation suffers in high dimensional input spaces due to the COD problem and thus a special mechanism is used to extend the cuboid during the merge test. ...|$|R
