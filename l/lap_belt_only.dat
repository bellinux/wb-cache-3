40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder <b>belt</b> and <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. <b>Lap</b> <b>belt</b> angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angles leading to submarining and more vertical <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower belt anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R
5000|$|Automatic belt systems {{also present}} several {{operational}} disadvantages. Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual <b>lap</b> <b>belt,</b> thus rendering redundant the automation {{of the shoulder}} belt.

The present study describes the development of a method for quantifying belt fit with a Hybrid-III 6 -year-old test dummy.

Backless boosters generally produced better <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit than highback boosters, largely because adding the back component moved the dummy forward with respect to the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> routing guides.

Twelve tests were performed with the standard 6 YO Hybrid III ATD and 29 tests were performed with {{a modified version of}} the 6 YO ATD. The modified dummy has a pelvis with more realistic shape and flesh stiffness, a gel abdomen with biomechanically-based stiffness characteristics, and a custom neoprene jacket. Shoulder belt upper anchorage was set at the FMVSS No. 213 belt anchorage location and 64 mm inboard and outboard from this location. <b>Lap</b> <b>belt</b> anchorage locations were chosen to span the range of <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angles permitted under FMVSS 210, using the FMVSS No. 213 belt anchorage locations and forward belt anchorage locations that produce a much steeper <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angle. Four booster seats that provide a range of static belt fit were used. The ATDs were positioned using either the standard FMVSS No. 213 seating procedure or an alternate UMTRI procedure that produces postures closer to those of similar-size children. Kinematic results for the standard and modified dummies under the same test conditions were more similar than expected. The current version of the modified 6 YO is less sensitive to <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> geometry than the prototype version of the dummy. The seating procedure had a greater affect on kinematic results. The UMTRI seating procedure produced greater knee-head excursion differences and less forward torso rotation than the FMVSS No. 213 procedure. Shifting the shoulder belt upper anchorage 128 mm laterally produced minimal variations in kinematics for a given booster seat/lap belt condition, likely because the belt-routing features of the booster seats limited the differences in static shoulder belt score to less than 10 mm. Moving the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> geometry from rearward (shallow angle) to forward (steep angle) produced less desirable kinematics with all booster seats tested. The forward position of the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> anchorage allows greater forward translation of the booster and ATD before the belt engages the pelvis. Steeper belt angles are associated with better <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit for children sitting without boosters, so designing rear seat belts for children who sit with and without boosters may involve a performance tradeoff...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to quantify the effects of belt-positioning boosters on <b>lap</b> and shoulder <b>belt</b> fit. Postures and belt fit were measured for forty-four boys and girls ages 5 to 12 in four highback boosters, one backless booster, and on a vehicle seat without a booster. Belt anchorage locations were varied over a wide range. Seat cushion angle, seat back angle, and seat cushion length were varied in the no-booster conditions. All boosters produced better mean <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit than was observed in the no-booster condition, but the differences among boosters were relatively large. With one midrange <b>belt</b> configuration, the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> was not fully below the anterior-superior iliac spine (ASIS) landmark {{on the front of the}} pelvis for 89 % of children in one booster, and 75 % of children failed to achieve that level of belt fit in another. In contrast, the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> was fully below the ASIS for all but two children in the best-performing booster. Child body size had a statistically significant but relatively small effect on <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit. The largest children sitting without a booster had approximately the same <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit as the smallest children experienced in the worst-performing booster. Increasing <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angle relative to horizontal produced significantly better <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit in the no-booster condition, but the boosters isolated the children from the effects of <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> angles. Reducing seat cushion length in the no-booster condition improved <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> fit but changing cushion angle did not. Belt upper anchorage (D-ring) location had a strong effect on shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing from the booster. Unexpectedly, the worst average shoulder belt fit was observed in one highback booster with a poorly positioned shoulder belt routing clip. The shoulder belt was routed more outboard, on average, with a backless booster than without a booster, but raising the child also amplified the effect of D-ring location, such that children were more likely to experience poor shoulder belt fit due to outboard and forward D-ring locations when sitting on the booster. Taller children experienced more-outboard shoulder belt fit in conditions without shoulder belt routing by the booster and in the one booster with poor shoulder belt routing. Adjustable shoulder belt routing on three of the highback boosters effectively eliminated stature effects, providing approximately the same shoulder belt fit for all children. Seat back angle did not have a significant effect on shoulder belt fit. The belt fit was measured in each test condition using the 6 YO and 10 YO Hybrid-III ATDs. ATD belt fit was strongly correlated with child belt fit across test conditions, but offsets between the ATD and child belt fit scores were observed due to anatomical and postural differences between the ATDs and children. The results of this study have broad applicability toward the improvement of occupant restraints for children. The data show substantial effects of booster design on belt fit, particularly the effects of alternative <b>lap</b> and torso <b>belt</b> routing approaches. Regression analyses quantify the critical importance of belt anchorage location for child belt fit, providing an important foundation for efforts to optimize belt geometry for children. The strong correlation between ATD and child belt fit scores means that ATD-based measurements can reliably be used to assess booster and vehicle designs with respect to child belt fit...|$|R
