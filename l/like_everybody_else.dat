5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} {{was able to}} summon {{a large amount of}} public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work. However, when they tried to make a living <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> they did not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice and ostracisation. The situation has continued to this day.|$|E

She {{is a big}} fan of Star Wars, Clint Eastwood, and movies in general. She has a best friend, Tyler, on whom she develops a crush as she got older, though he is unaware of her feelings. Molly is the one who has probably warmed the most towards Zoey, aside from her mom, and is trying to be the best big sister to her.|$|E

Moreover, {{whenever}} she went out the fairies scampered away before her like so many mice, for they all knew {{that she could see}} them with her magical eye. This, as you may see, was bad enough, but no other harm would have come of it if she had only gathered wisdom at that time, seeing what ill came of her speech. But, like many other old dames that I wot of, no sound was so pleasant to her ears as the words of her own mouth.|$|R

25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as more than just an object, <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|E

We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Dallas, {{who plays}} Prince Charming, was pleased the writers took [...] "some {{dramatic}} license" [...] with his character, believing the prince {{had become more}} real. He explained, [...] "Prince Charming {{just happens to be}} a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> He's human." [...] Jennifer Morrison was hired for the part of Emma Swan. The actress explained her character as someone who [...] "help this kid who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional," [...] but noted that Emma does not yet believe there is a fairytale universe. Ten-year-old Jared Gilmore, known for his work on Mad Men, took the role of her son, Henry.|$|E

50|$|In 1907, he {{travelled}} {{along with}} Édouard Chavannes through several Chinese provinces, describing ancient sculptural monuments previously unknown to international scholarship, {{in particular the}} Song monuments of Henan and Tang monuments of Shaanxi.ln addition to his Professorship, Alexeev became the Curator and Senior Researcher at the Asiatic Museum. In that role, he contributed a paper on Chinese folklore to a 1918 Museum symposium, published by its parent group, the Russian Academy of Sciences. Alexeev's situation at this time, though perilous <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> had great potential, which he quickly proceeded to realize. His position at the Museum gave him a realia basis: he had custody of artifacts {{for the study of}} Chinese popular tradition, including a large trove of Dunhwang documents brought back from a Russian expedition of 1914-1915. In 1919, Alexeev became associate editor, and chief of the Eastern division, of the newly founded Publishing House for World Literature. This provided a publishing outlet. Under his direction, the Museum's Sinological library was expanded, catalogued, and systematically employed in research, by a team of young persons Alexeev gradually gathered around him, among them the brilliant Shchutsky.|$|R

500|$|During the journey, Brittan {{performed}} {{the duties of}} the ship's surgeon. He and the ship's chaplain produced a play, The Merchant of Venice, and his contribution was to invite women to act the female roles, which was unusual for the time and a hot topic of conversation causing great amusement. Arriving in Lyttelton on 5 February 1852, most of the immigrants had to find somewhere to live and many slept in tents or under the open sky. The Brittans were among the fortunate few, as a house on Christchurch's Hereford Street had been arranged for them by Guise Brittan. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> who was heading for Christchurch, upon disembarking from the ship they had to make their way over the Port Hills then follow the steep Bridle Path to reach the city. They carried as many of their possessions as possible, but following months at sea, their fitness was rather poor. [...] The remainder of their possessions was shipped by whaleboat around the coast and up the Avon River, which was a dangerous undertaking due to the Sumner sand bar located {{at the entrance to the}} Avon Heathcote Estuary.|$|E

In {{his review of}} State of Confusion, Rolling Stone critic Parke Puterbaugh said that the song [...] "sums up the bittersweet mood that wafts through [...] in calming counterpoint to its more turbulent moments." [...] George Kalogerakis, also of Rolling Stone, [...] said in his review of the album [...] that the song was an [...] "undeniable winner," [...] claiming that [...] "hearing [...] in th crackling live version is like running into [...] old friend." [...] AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted the song {{as one of the}} [...] "quieter moments" [...] on State of Confusion where the album [...] "came to life," [...] praising its [...] "buoyant nostalgia." [...] On the band's Rolling Stone biography, the song was called [...] "delightfully nostalgic." [...] Author Rob Jovanovic called the song [...] "incredibly catchy" [...] and said that, as the song's title suggested, it [...] "made [...] want to move his feet." [...] Andrew Hickey said in his book, Preservation: The Kinks' Music 1964–1974, that the track was a [...] "great pop song." [...] Thomas M. Kitts praised its [...] "big band sound" [...] in his book, Ray Davies: Not <b>Like</b> <b>Everybody</b> <b>Else.</b>|$|E

His opponent would be his toughest test to date, seasoned veteran Fred Kassi (18-5-1, 10 KOs). Miller, determined to stop Kassi inside the distance, said, [...] "I'm ready to put his lights out <b>like</b> I do <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> I know he's durable and {{a little older than}} me. He's a tough guy and he can take a beating. So far, he's only been stopped once. I'll be the second." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{light of}} Bereman's {{decision}} not to field a team, TeamTennis decided before the season {{that no matter what}} record the Loves posted, they would be placed last among the eight teams in the standings. The players were paid a salary instead of being eligible for prize money based on their performance. However, their matches counted in the records of the other seven teams. The Loves' first match was a loss to the eventual 1983 champion Chicago Fyre on July 20. Player-coach Syd Ball said, [...] "It's unfortunate we can't play any home matches. But we knew before we hit a ball in Chicago what the situation was. We accepted the fact we won't share in the prize money. We're looking at it as a good workout session that will stand us in good stead in any tournaments coming up. We have a compact little program. We haven't had any wins yet, but we had a super tiebreaker against Dallas. We just <b>like</b> spoiling <b>everybody</b> <b>else's</b> record." ...|$|R
60|$|After two-and-twenty years' {{absence from}} London, Mr. Binnie {{returned}} {{to it on}} the top of the Gosport coach with a hatbox and a little portmanteau, a pink fresh-shaven face, a perfect appetite, a suit of clothes <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's,</b> and not the shadow of a black servant. He called a cab at the White Horse Cellar, and drove to Nerot's Hotel, Clifford Street; and he gave the cabman eightpence, making the fellow, who grumbled, understand that Clifford Street was not two hundred yards from Bond Street, and that he was paid at the rate of five shillings and fourpence per mile--calculating the mile at only sixteen hundred yards. He asked the waiter at what time Colonel Newcome had ordered dinner, and finding there was an hour on his hands before the meal, walked out to examine the neighbourhood for a lodging where he could live more quietly than in a hotel. He called it a hotel. Mr. Binnie was a North Briton, his father having been a Writer to the Signet, in Edinburgh, who had procured his son a writership in return for electioneering services done to an East Indian Director. Binnie had his retiring pension, and, besides, had saved half his allowances ever since he had been in India. He was a man of great reading, no small ability, considerable accomplishment, excellent good sense and good humour. The ostentatious said he was a screw; but he gave away more money than far more extravagant people: he was a disciple of David Hume (whom he admired more than any other mortal), and the serious denounced him as a man of dangerous principles, though there were, among the serious, men much more dangerous than James Binnie.|$|R

The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. <b>Like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> I am still in shock.

For this master thesis I did {{research in the area}} of rendering at the Philips High Tech Campus in Eindhoven in the Visual Experiences group. I have been working on finding a relation between the quality of renderings and the effort that is needed to create the renderings. The knowledge gained from this work can be used in the future to create renderings that look more realistic. During my research study I learned how to conduct and report research projects and I gained experience in the field of 3 D modeling, rendering and image quality.

From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted <b>like</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him.
