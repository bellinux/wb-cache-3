The <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest}} of the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E

A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. It was even possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.|$|E

5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using {{the first and the}} two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The first movement is a chorale fantasia dominated by the trumpet. In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth movement is a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas is different from the one used in movements 1 and 3.|$|E

The French, under the command of Marshal Victor, were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare a trap.

5|$|Domestically, {{air travel}} between Paris {{and some of}} France's largest cities such as Lyon, Marseille, or Strasbourg {{has been in a}} large measure {{replaced}} by high-speed rail due to the opening of several high-speed TGV rail <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. For example, after the LGV Méditerranée opened in 2001, air traffic between Paris and Marseille declined from 2,976,793 passengers in 2000 to 1,502,196 passengers in 2014. After the LGV Est opened in 2007, air traffic between Paris and Strasbourg declined from 1,006,327 passengers in 2006 to 157,207 passengers in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{convention}} designates {{the cooler}} star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab {{has been given}} various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G.The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star. The composite spectrum appears {{to be dominated by}} the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen.
