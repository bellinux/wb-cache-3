50|$|The Counts Palatine (Dukes) of Zweibrücken {{introduced}} the Reformation {{as early as}} 1537. According to the 1609 Visitation, there were 15 families living in the village. The 17th century was largely marked by wars, such as the Thirty Years' War and French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. The somewhat remote villages suffered all the more from hunger and sickness. The grimmest hardships began in 1635. In general, an unimaginable brutalization of morals came over people. From that time comes a report according to which two men from Adenbach, with their wives’ help, beat a man from Odenbach in the countryside and took his livestock from the pasture. In 1645, five Swedes came to Adenbach and stole, with two local men’s help, cows, horses and sheep, all of which they took away, never to be seen again, and that after having {{spent the night in}} the village and incurred considerable costs. By the time the Thirty Years' War ended, the number of families in the village had shrunk to five. Still available today is a 1629 <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> and taxes in Adenbach, which was still owned by the Lords of Oberstein. All that is known from the time of Louis XIV’s wars is lists of contributions. In the time that followed, population figures rose quickly, {{partly as a result of}} immigration. In the course of the 18th century, though, there was extensive emigration. That century also saw repeated disputes between Adenbach and neighbouring villages over grazing rights. A comprehensive village régime from 1717, contained in which is a considerably older Weistum (a Weistum - cognate with English wisdom - was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), remained preserved for Adenbach. As in many of the Northern Palatinate’s other villages, a coal mine and a chalk mine were opened in Adenbach. All around the village, remnants of pits may still be found, where coal was once mined.|$|E
40|$|The modern honors {{movement}} that {{arose in the}} 1950 s was propelled {{and supported by the}} Inter-University Committee on the Superior Student (ICSS) and its newsletter, The Superior Student. This first honors serial publication, now relegated to the misty past and unknown to most honors deans and directors, merits examination. Its value lies not merely in its historical interest, but in the usefulness of its discussions of the same issues that arise currently in honors programs, conferences, and publications. One of the consistent premises that emerge from the ICSS newsletter is the recognition that the wide diversity of honors programs appropriately reflects the diversity of institutional cultures and their varying stages of readiness for an honors approach. At the same time, however, the ICSS through this publicity organ advises certain desiderata—in evolving versions—of a “full” honors program. These desiderata are, of course, the forerunners of today’s “basic characteristics” of honors programs and colleges promoted by the National Collegiate Honors Council (NCHC), the organization that succeeded the ICSS. This balance between tolerance of diversity and the upholding of ideals or standards seems the most salient aspect of the wisdom of our honors elders. This essay offers first a descriptive analysis of the periodical and its development for the benefit of readers unfamiliar with it. (See Appendix for a partial <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> for this periodical.) The second section evokes the historical context for the ICSS and its newsletter by drawing on statements appearing in the newsletter itself. The following and main section analyzes the key themes of the articles. Only a few of today’s issues are absent from these early honors discussions—for example, computer technology, alumni relations, and fundraising. That the following themes were discussed {{at the outset of the}} honors revival may seem surprising: international honors, advising, selection of students for creativity and motivation, honors in the visual and performing arts, gender, talented Black students, and even accreditation of honors. The analytical section includes discussion of various start-up issues faced by new programs and of what later would become the “basic characteristics. ” In the process, a number of eloquent arguments and nuggets of wisdom will emerge that may prove useful to current honors leaders as they make their case for an honors education...|$|E

40|$|The Nigerian medical {{librarian}} has an uphill task {{in his effort}} to satisfy the journal needs of users of his library. His problems stem from difficulties in the selection and acquisition of journals, delay in postal services, budgetary and other administrative controls, and the changing nature of medical education and health-care services in Nigeria. The librarian's attempts to solve these problems include increased subscriptions to journals and use of interlibrary loans, but the absence <b>of</b> union <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> other libraries, the heavy cost of photocopying services, and poor postal facilities present another dimension to his problems.
