50|$|Some {{mechanical}} {{linear actuators}} only pull, such as hoists, chain drive and belt drives. Others only push (such as a cam actuator). Pneumatic and hydraulic cylinders, or <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> {{can be designed}} to generate force in both directions.|$|E
50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> and the <b>lead</b> nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|R
50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> on the Z-axis. A low <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> A <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is a <b>lead</b> nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the <b>lead</b> <b>screw.</b> By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R

(e) Acme thread - With its 30° {{thread angle}} this has higher {{friction}} than the square thread, but {{is easier to}} manufacture {{and can be used}} with a split nut to adjust for wear.

5000|$|Some <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> have {{multiple}} [...] "starts". This means they {{have multiple}} threads alternating {{on the same}} shaft.

This allows for more adjustment between thread pitch and nut/screw thread contact area, which determines the extension speed and load carrying capacity (of the threads), respectively.|$|E

40|$|A sliding mode {{vibration}} controller for <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives Orang Vahid-Araghi 1 and Farid Golnaraghi 2 The conversion of rotary to translational motion in <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drives {{occurs at the}} meshing <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut threads. A decreasing coefficient of friction with sliding velocity, may lead to instabilities in these drives. In this paper, a sliding mode controller is designed for a {{two degrees of freedom}} <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> drive model. This controller has two objectives: to regulate the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> angular velocity to a preset value and to attenuate friction-induced vibrations. Only upper and/or lower bounds of system parameters are assumed to be known. In addition, {{in the development of the}} controller no specific model is assumed for the dependence of the coefficient of friction on the relative sliding velocity. Two modifications are applied to the basic discontinuous sliding mode controller to eliminate the inherent chattering problem and to limit the controlled input torque levels. Numerical simulation results are presented that show the applicability and the per-formance of the proposed controller...|$|R

50|$|In manual linear stages, {{a control}} knob {{attached}} to a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear displacement of the stage {{is related to the}} angular displacement of the knob by the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch. For example if the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> pitch is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform.|$|R
40|$|A load {{positioning}} system with gravity compensation has a servomotor, position sensing feedback potentiometer and velocity sensing tachometer {{in a conventional}} closed loop servo arrangement to cause a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and a ball nut to vertically position a load. Gravity compensating components comprise the DC motor, gears, which couple torque from the motor to the <b>lead</b> <b>screw,</b> and constant current power supply. The constant weight of the load applied to the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> via the ball nut tend to cause the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> to rotate, the constant torque of which is opposed by the constant torque produced by the motor when fed from the constant current source. The constant current is preset {{as required by the}} potentiometer to effect equilibration of the load which thereby enables the positioning servomotor to see the load as weightless under both static and dynamic conditions. Positioning acceleration and velocity performance are therefore symmetrical...|$|R

A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the drive gear, the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three <b>lead</b> <b>screws</b> and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the drive gear rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|E

40|$|Multidisciplinary design {{optimization}} {{has been widely}} applied in the optimization of large-scale complex system {{and also in the}} design and optimization of components, which are involved in multidisciplinary behaviors. The wear and fatigue life of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Thirdly, finite element analysis is conducted using Nastran to assess the contact stresses in the <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> and nut assembly model. The estimated data from the three sources are finally merged to formulate a mathematical model in predicting the wear and fatigue life for the optimization of <b>lead</b> <b>screw</b> actuators...|$|R

The loading frame consist of two vertical <b>lead</b> <b>screws,</b> a moving crosshead and an upper and lower bearing plate which bears the load of the <b>lead</b> <b>screws.</b> The maximum capacity of the loading frame attached to the table mounted unit is 50 KN In this study a velocity between 310 mm/min was applied to the moving component to ensure the quasistatic conditions whereas velocities between 0. 5 mm/min and 15 mm/min have been used by many researchers to simulate the quasi-static lateral compression of tubes between various indenters [1 - 2]. In addition to the experimental work, computational method using ANSYS is used to predict the loading and response of such tubes where series of models was performed with elliptical ratios ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5. Comparison of numerical and experimental forcedeflection response is presented. It has been found that with changing the elliptical ratio of the tube the loaddeflection curve change and this leads to change the energy absorbed by tube, the changing of the geometrical shape of the tube leads to change the volume of this tube and hence the mass.
