In this commentary I reflect on the place of materiality—that quality of material phenomena—and materialization—the processes by which such qualities are actualized in social life—in Matthew Hull’s brilliant book, Government of paper (GoP).

40|$|This {{interesting}} chapter {{can be read}} {{as making}} two main points. First, it shows that mandatory arrest laws (MAL) in cases of domestic violence have been counterproductive on at least one dimension, namely the frequency of serious abuse cases. Second, it shows that the method used for evaluating alternative policies against crime that has become the golden standard in criminology (and economics), namely randomized evaluation, can be seri-ously misleading. While I appreciate that the fi rst contribution is a good complement to other cautionary notes already raised regarding the correct interpretation of the Minnesota Domestic Violence Experiment (see, for example, Schmidt and Sherman 1993), I believe the second point could have important consequences for the way we approach the policy evaluation more generally. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the fi rst point raised in the chapter.

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{offers a}} personal perspective on wealth taxation in the 21 st century. Wealth taxation {{has been the}} subject of substantial policy action in recent years, with the implementation of large inheritance tax cuts in several OECD countries (e. g. U. S., Italy, U. K., France). More generally, I believe that the issue of wealth and wealth transfer taxation is very likely to play an important role in the public finance debates of the coming decades, for at least two reasons: a theoretical reason, and an empirical/historical reason. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the theoretical reason. In spite of the voluminous existing literature, the current state of optimal capital taxation theories is wholly unsatisfactory, and one can (hopefully) expect major developments in the future. Existing theories of optimal labour income taxation, as pioneered by Mirrlees (1971) and recently reformulated by Diamond (1998) and Saez (2001), are in a relatively satisfactory state.

40|$|The {{full story}} of Hungarian Reformed {{resistance}} to the anti-church policies of the communist regime cannot yet be told.

30|$|Why might {{nationhood}} be progressive? Several political {{theorists have}} offered normative justifications {{for the political}} project of nationhood, and I won’t attempt to repeat all of the arguments here. 2 So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the simplest one – namely, the role of nationhood in stabilizing the demos, the units of democratic governance. Some political philosophers have implied that stability is assured simply by having a consensus {{on the principle of}} democracy itself: if everyone agrees on the principle that decisions should be made democratically, then democratic procedures will be stable. But a shared consensus on democracy tells us nothing yet about the units within which decisions will be made. Imagine that everyone on the continent of Europe shares a commitment to democracy. That doesn’t yet tell us whether there should be one state in Europe, or twenty-eight, or two hundred and eighty. Nor does it tell us how the boundaries of these units should be drawn: should they be drawn as straight grid lines of latitude and longitude, or should they follow topography or historical settlement patterns? We cannot act upon our shared democratic principles until we have at least a provisional consensus on the number and borders of political units.|$|R
40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> a {{well-known}} story. Kant held that logic and conceptual analysis alone cannot account for {{our knowledge of}} arithmetic: “however we might turn and twist our concepts, we could never, by the mere analysis of them, and {{without the aid of}} intuition, discover what is the sum [7 + 5] ” (KrV, B 16). Frege took himself to have shown that Kant was wrong about this. According to Frege’s logicist thesis, every arithmetical concept can be defined in purely logical terms, and every theorem of arithmetic can be proved using only the basic laws of logic. Hence, Kant was wrong to think that our grasp of arithmetical concepts and our knowledge of arithmetical truth depend on an extralogical source—the pure intuition of time (Frege 1884, § 89, § 109). Arithmetic, properly understood, is just a part of logic. Never mind whether Frege was right about this. I want to address a different question: Does Frege’s position on arithmetic really contradict Kant’s? I do not deny that Frege endorsed (F) Arithmetic is reducible to logic or that Kant endorsed (K) Arithmetic is not reducible to logic. 1 For comments on earlier versions of this paper, I am grateful to audiences at U...|$|R

As you surely know, only one year and few months ago, on September 13, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a new human rights instrument, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
