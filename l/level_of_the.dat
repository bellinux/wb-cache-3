Transcript <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called liver-type form of subunit VIa of cytochrome c oxidase diminished during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> differentiation, while transcription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called heart-type form was induced.

The results suggest subunit switching of subunit VIa and co-expression of subunit VIIa isoforms during myogenesis. The differential changes in mRNA <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart-type subunits VIa and VIIa and the differential changes in mRNA <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liver-type subunits VIa and VIIa demonstrate that different transcriptional regulation mechanisms are present for both heart-type genes {{as well as for}} both liver-type genes...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to compare <b>the</b> {{readability}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recreational reading books children selected to read with <b>the</b> reading <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children established by Powell's (1992) criteria for the Informal Reading Inventory.

Five hypotheses were tested at <b>the.</b> 05 <b>level</b> <b>of</b> significance. Hypotheses I-IV were tested using a t-test for paired samples to determine if there was any particular reading level from which children tended to choose their recreational reading books. The analyses did not allow rejection of Hypotheses I and II. There were no significant relationships found between the reading levels independent and developmental, and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> recreational reading books children chose from their school library. The analyses did allow rejection of Hypotheses III and IV. The reading levels emergent and frustration proved to be statistically significantly different from the children's recreational book levels. Hypothesis V was tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between <b>the</b> reading <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recreational reading books the children chose and read and <b>the</b> reading <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books the children chose and did not read. The analysis failed to reject Hypothesis V. There was no significant relationship between <b>the</b> reading <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books the children chose and read and <b>the</b> reading <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books the children did not read. Although this hypothesis did not prove to be statistically significant, the following tendency was observed: the easier <b>the</b> readability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, the more likely it was to have been read. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study indicate fourth grade students chose books from their school library on all their reading levels.
