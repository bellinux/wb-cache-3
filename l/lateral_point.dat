60|$|And {{the first}} I shall propound is, Whether {{there may not}} be made an {{artificial}} transparent body of an exact Globular Figure that shall so inflect or refract all the Rays, that, coming from one point, fall upon any Hemisphere of it; that every one of them may meet on the opposite side, and cross one another exactly in a point; and that it may do the like also with all the Rays that, coming from a <b>lateral</b> <b>point,</b> fall upon any other Hemisphere; for if so, there were to be hoped a perfection of Dioptricks, and a transmigration into heaven, even whil'st we remain here upon earth in the flesh, and a descending or penetrating into the center and innermost recesses of the earth, and all earthly bodies; nay, it would open not onely a cranney, but a large window (as I may so speak) into the Shop of Nature, whereby we might be enabled to see both the tools and operators, and the very manner of the operation it self of Nature; this, could it be effected, would as farr surpass all other kind of perspectives as the vast extent of Heaven does the small point of the Earth, which distance it would immediately remove, and unite them, as 'twere, into one, at least, that there should appear no more distance between them then the length of the Tube, into the ends of which these Glasses should be inserted: Now, whether this may not be effected with parcels of Glass of several densities, I have sometimes proceeded so farr as to doubt (though in truth, as to the general, I have wholly despair'd of it) for I have often observ'd in Optical Glasses a very great variety of the parts, which are commonly called Veins; nay, some of them round enough (for they are for the most part, drawn out into firings) to constitute a kind of lens.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} facial skeletal features associated with chin deviation. MethodsTwenty-five patients (14 males and 11 females) diagnosed with chin deviations of more than 2 mm were recruited. Fifteen skeletal landmarks, including median and <b>lateral</b> <b>points,</b> were located on posteroanterior cephalo-grams. The CG–ANS (crista-galli of the ethmoid–anterior nasal spine) line and the perpendicular line through the CG were used as references. The differences between the distances from paired <b>lateral</b> <b>points</b> to reference lines were examined with intraclass correlation coefficients to analyze the symmetry of facial skeletal tissue. The factors associated with the amount or direction of chin deviation were analyzed by multiple regression analysis or by logistic regression analysis. ResultsSeventeen subjects (68 %) showed chin deviation {{to the left side}} and 8 subjects (32 %) to the right side. Sixty-eight percent of subjects presented with Angle Class III malocclusion. Horizontal distances of all paired <b>lateral</b> <b>points</b> to the y-axis, in mandibular body length and effective length, showed a low grade of symmetry. Only vertical distances of paired zygomaticofrontal sutures and zygonion points to the x-axis were asymmetric. However, there were no significant asymmetries of the gonial angle, ramus height, and vertical distances from other paired <b>lateral</b> <b>points</b> to the x-axis. The amount of chin deviation was associated with the absolute differences of the left and right antegonion to the y-axis and zygomaticofrontal suture to the x-axis. The direction of chin deviation was significantly associated with the difference in the effective length of bilateral mandibular halves. ConclusionFacial skeletal asymmetry exists in patients with chin deviation. This should be considered when planning treatment for both the nonsurgical and surgico-orthodontic cases with chin deviation...|$|R

50|$|Several {{distinguishing}} traits {{have been}} established. The snout on its midline bears a large crest, {{the front of}} which is formed by the praemaxillae. It continues to behind over the nasals and lacrimals; its rear touches the frontals. The top of the crest runs parallel to the upper jaw edge. The ascending branches of the praemaxillae each have a forked rear. The side of the praemaxilla features a deep groove running from {{an opening in the}} ascending branch towards an opening below the nostril. Within the depression around the upper rear side of the nostril two pneumatic openings are present, of unequal size. The rear branch of the lacrimal, above the eye socket, has a distinctive hatchet-shaped process pointing upwards. The combined frontals are rectangular and elongated with a length:width ratio of 1.67. The holotype skull has a length of eighty centimetres. It is as such rather flat but this is obscured by the presence of a large snout crest occupying about three quarters of the skull length, reaching the level of the eye sockets. Sprouting from the praemaxillae at the snout tip, the crest is largely formed by the nasal bones. Transversely it has a triangular cross-section with a broad base and a more narrow top; this does not form a ridge, however, but has a flat upper surface. The nasal crest side is very rugose with a series of bosses and swellings. The nasal bone contributes to the upper rear part of the depression around the antorbital fenestra. This area shows a number of pneumatic openings or pneumatopores, where diverticula of the air sacks entered the bone. In the front two small foramina are present, more to the rear two large horizontal oval openings. CAT-scans showed that internally the nasal bone is heavily pneumatised, with large air chambers. Also the jugal bone is pneumatised. The lacrimal is I-shaped. It has an ascending branch forming the vertical rear edge of the crest; due to the triangular cross-section this branch is inclined towards the midline of the skull. The upper outer side of this branch forms a rectangular boss. Behind the eye socket, on the postorbital another, smaller, horn is present. The frontal bones do not contribute to the crest; they are unique among Theropoda in having a combined rectangular instead of triangular shape, due to the posterior position of the crest rear. The praemaxilla has a narrow ascending branch, forming the front of the crest. The rear of this branch is forked and embraces a <b>lateral</b> <b>point</b> of the nasal, a feature not recognised in the original description of 1994. At the base of the branch a small opening is present. A larger opening is located below the nostril. Both openings are connected by a distinct groove, curving around the underside of the nostril. The function of this unique trait is unknown. The praemaxilla bears four teeth. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The maxilla has a short depression around the lower front of the antorbital fenestra. Within this area a smaller hollowing is located, closed at the inside, perhaps representing the fenestra promaxillaris, of which it has the usual position, or the fenestra maxillaris, the normal identity of a single opening.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} some ultrasonographic standards of temporomandibular joints with normally positioned discs. Nineteen patients from 18 to 45 years old (average age: 27. 4 years; 16 females and 3 males), with history of orofacial pain, but without clinical or radiological signs of disc displacement, underwent ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the examination of their joints. In 30 joints, the distance between the most <b>lateral</b> <b>point</b> of the articular capsule and the most <b>lateral</b> <b>point</b> of the mandibular condyle (lateral capsule-condyle distance) was measured, as well as the distance between the most anterior point of the articular capsule and the most anterior point of the mandibular condyle (anterior capsule-condyle distance). In the closed-mouth position, the average values found for the lateral capsule-condyle distance were 1. 4 mm and 1. 6 mm, respectively in the longitudinal (coronal) and transverse (axial) scans. In the open-mouth position, the average distance was 1. 2 mm, in both longitudinal (coronal) and transverse (axial) scans. The average values found for the anterior capsule-condyle distance were 2. 3 mm in the closed-mouth position and 1. 1 mm in the open-mouth position, both in transverse (axial) scans. Intra-examiner agreement, measured in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient, varied from 0. 83 to 0. 93. We believe that this study can contribute to the validation of US as a diagnostic method for temporomandibular joint disorders, provided that the obtained measurements be used in future studies as normal reference values...|$|E

40|$|We have {{hypothesized}} {{that the size of}} the binocular field among mammals has been selected to maximize the visually surveyable region around the animal (Changizi and Shimojo, 2008). At first glance it may seem that this hypothesis should always predict <b>lateral</b> <b>pointing</b> eyes, and a consequently small binocular field width. However, the hypothesis does not predict <b>lateral</b> <b>pointing</b> eyes in cases where the environment is filled with leafy occlusions and the animal's interpupillary distance surpasses the typical widths of the leaves (when both of these apply, we call the environment “cluttered”). In such cases, within an animal's binocular region the eyes tend to sample the scene independently. Laterally directed eyes also sample the scene independently, but the binocular region benefits from a variety of binocular summation, lowering the threshold for the recognition of objects in the binocular field. Our hypothesis predicts that mammals outside of leafy environments should have small binocular fields, independent {{of the size of the}} animal; but it predicts that for animals in leafy environments, whereas small animals should have small binocular fields (because their interpupillary distance is small compared to the typical occlusion width), large animals should have large binocular fields (because the binocular region begins to become more powerful at object recognition). Our paper provided evidence consistent with these predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for speckle {{reduction}} by combining spatial compounding technique with parallel Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FDOCT).

By compounding these spatial-resolved images, we can obtain a speckle-suppressed B-scan tomogram in a single shot without sacrificing axial resolution and imaging speed. The principle of our method is demonstrated by imaging a shrimp's telson in vivo and a pearl. A signal-to-noise ratio improvement close to a factor of two was achieved by averaging four spatial-resolved FDOCT images. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} the brachial portion of the radial nerve with surgical implications is proposed. Thirty specimens of arm from 20 fresh cadavers (11 male, 9 female) were {{used to examine the}} topographical relations of the radial nerve with reference to the following anatomical landmarks: acromion angle, medial and lateral epicondyles, point of division between the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, lateral intermuscular septum, site of division of the radial nerve into its superficial and posterior interosseous branches and entry and exit point of the posterior interosseous branch into the supinator muscle. The mean distances between the acromion angle and the medial and lateral levels of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus were 109 (+/- 11) and 157 (+/- 11) mm, respectively. The mean length and calibre of the nerve in the groove were 59 (+/- 4) and 6 (+/- 1) mm, respectively. The division of the lateral and long heads of the triceps was found at a mean distance of 126 (+/- 13) mm from the acromion angle. The mean distances between the <b>lateral</b> <b>point</b> of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus and the medial and lateral epicondyles were 125 (+/- 13) and 121 (+/- 13) mm, respectively.

40|$|A {{numerical}} deconvolution {{method to}} cancel lateral defocus in Fourier domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FD-OCT) is presented. This method uses a depth-dependent <b>lateral</b> <b>point</b> spread function and some approximations to design a deconvolution filter for the cancellation of lateral defocus. Improved lateral resolutions are theoretically estimated; consequently, the effect of lateral superresolution in this method is derived. The superresolution is experimentally confirmed by a razor blade test, and an intuitive physical interpretation of this effect is presented. The razor blade test also confirms that this method enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of OCT. This method is applied to OCT images of medical samples, in vivo human anterior eye segments, and exhibits its potential to cancel the defocusing of practical OCT images. The validity and restrictions involved in each approximation employed to design the deconvolution filter are discussed. A chromatic and a two-dimensional extensions of this method are also described.
