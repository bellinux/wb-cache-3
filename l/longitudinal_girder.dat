50|$|Barnes Wallis {{created the}} frame of the airship using only 11 {{standardized}} components. The 16 longitudinal girders were formed of three tubes each, formed from strips of Duralumin wound into a helix and riveted together. These connected 15 polygonal transverse frames, which were held in shape by wire bracing connected to a central <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> running the length of the ship. A further consequence of the new rules for airframe stress design was that a new way of harnessing the lifting force of the gasbags had to be found. Wallis's solution to this problem later led to his innovative geodesic airframe fuselage and wing design for the Wellesley, Wellington and Windsor bombers.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1992, {{the bridge}} was the first {{cable-stayed}} road bridge in Greece. A technical challenge during the design and the construction phase was the extremely slender (L/480) longitudinally and transversally pre-stressed concrete deck with only 45 cm constant thickness, providing sufficient stiffness to abandon any <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder.</b> The multi-strand stay-cables therefore have a closer spacing of app.5 m with a minimum inclination of 23 degrees and were directly used to support the free cantilever formworks during deck construction. For purpose of higher seismic performance, the concrete deck is monolithically connected with the towers. Constrained reaction due to temperature rise can be handled well due to the slender towers and the soft superstructure. At the transition piers at the bridge ends hinged tension pendulum members are used to transfer uplift forces into the substructure.|$|E
50|$|On 24 June 2005, {{a private}} cargo vessel M V Mani, {{belonging}} to the Ganges Water Transport Pvt. Ltd, while trying to pass under the bridge during high tide, had its funnel stuck underneath for three hours, causing substantial damage worth about 15 million to the stringer and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> of the bridge. Some of the 40 cross-girders were also broken. Two of four trolley guides, bolted and welded with the girders, were extensively damaged. Nearly 350 m of 700 m of the track were twisted beyond repair. The damage was so severe that KoPT requested help from Rendall-Palmer & Tritton Limited, the original consultant on the bridge from UK. KoPT also contacted SAIL to provide 'matching steel' used during its construction in 1943, for the repairs. For the repair costing around , about 8 tonnes of steel was used. The repairs were completed in early 2006.|$|E

50|$|Since {{wind tunnel}} {{tests showed that}} a 16 sides {{transverse}} section had about the same drag as a circular one, both R100 and R101 used {{a smaller number of}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> than previous airships in order to simplify stress calculations. Even so, the calculations for the transverse frames required hand computation that took two or three months to produce a solution for each frame. The thoroughness of the stressing calculations was a consequence of new Air Ministry criteria for the strengths required of airships, formulated in response to the catastrophic structural failure of R38 in 1921. However, fewer <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girders</b> resulted in larger unsupported panels of fabric in the envelope. Flight trials were to prove that the R100's covering was barely adequate. The envelope of R101 was also unsatisfactory, and a failure in its cover was possibly a cause of its crash.|$|R
50|$|From a {{structural}} perspective, the second extradosal characteristic is the reduced proportion of superstructure live load that is {{carried by the}} cables. On cable-stayed bridges, the stays commonly support at least 80% of the loading from vehicular traffic acting on the bridge superstructure, whereas on extradosed bridges, the stay cables typically support only between 20% and 60% of this load. In both cases, {{the remainder of the}} load is carried by the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> element in spanning-action between the main bridge supports. This characteristic derives from the relative stiffnesses between the cable stays and the girder element. Cable-stay designs typically incorporate flexible deck structures without a stiff girder element, and such systems transfer the majority of any applied deck loads directly into the nearest stay cables. In comparison, extradosal designs utilise a substantially stiffer deck/girder structure, allowing the girder to support a significant proportion of any deck loads, and facilitating the distribution of the remaining load between a larger number of individual stay elements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper was the {{optimization}} design of heavy strength carriage for 50 t heavy-duty truck. Two optimization schemes B and C were provided based on original scheme A, which have different thickness of sole/side plate and main <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> and different number of strengthening ribs. ANSYS was used to do the finite element analysis of equivalent stress and elastic displacement of truck carriages. The equivalent stress of main <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder,</b> soleplate and transverse bars of soleplate will increase when the soleplate’s thickness was reduced. The maximum of equivalent stress will increase 13 %~ 15 % with 1 mm reduction. When the thickness of side plate or the number of side plate’s strengthening ribs was reduced, the elastic displacement of side plate would increase. Scheme C fulfilled the requirement of structure strength, in which the elastic displacement increases in the allowable range and the lightening ratio was 12. 6 %. Scheme B didn’t fulfill the requirement of structure strength.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{connection}} details used for cable anchorage blocks on cable-stayed bridges have the potential for fatigue damage due to fluctuating stresses generated by the cyclic traffic loads passing over the bridge. To investigate the fatigue damage and determine the remaining fatigue life of a cable anchorage block used on a cable-stayed bridge, finite element (FE) analyses were undertaken by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed by the Eurocodes to identify the most fatigue-critical locations within the details. One of the main objectives of this research was to identify the critical area prone to fatigue in the anchorage block due to the response in traffic loads. Therefore, two types of numerical models of a typical cable anchorage block were analysed as a three dimensional sub-model which was driven by global cable forces obtained from the global analysis of a three-span cable-stayed bridge. These models are of the cable anchorage block without the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> modelled and the cable anchorage block with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> modelled. The cable anchorage blocks without the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> model were classified into three categories of model types namely; model types 0, A and B. Similarly, the cable anchorage blocks with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder</b> model were classified as model types A-G, B-G and C-G. These model classifications are based on several boundary conditions simulated in the analyses. In addition to this, the fatigue behaviour of the cable anchorage block was analysed by using three different approaches namely; by using the nodal stresses at the location of the stress concentration (node stress concentration), by using a stress averaged over an area {{in the vicinity of the}} stress concentration (average elements) and by using the hot-spot method, in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of cable anchorages. Each approach was analysed with three different mesh sizes; 5 mm by 5 mm, 10 mm by 10 mm and 20 mm by 20 mm in order to carry out a mesh sensitivity analysis of the resulting stresses and associated stress ranges. The 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size was found to be most appropriate for this fatigue appraisal. This finding is supported because the 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size is specified in several code of practices such as the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and BS 7608 as guidance for use when determining hot-spot stress when using the hot-spot method for the fatigue analyses of a welded detail. The critical stresses from model type C-G were used in the fatigue appraisal as the behaviour of this model represented more accurately the actual cable anchorage block on the cable-stayed bridge compared to the other types of models used. Model type C-G were selected for further fatigue appraisal as this model include the correct boundary conditions and applied load that represented the actual condition of the anchorage behaviour on the cable-stayed bridge. This included the movement of the top anchorage block due to the displacement of the cable and in addition the deck movement. Also, non-uniform pressure was applied on the bearing plate which was included to model possible construction tolerances which was one of the important properties of the model type C-G. In evaluating the possible fatigue damage in the cable anchorage block, the cumulative model for fatigue failure expressed in terms of Miner’s rule was used. In addition to this, the condition of the structural detail due to fatigue with increasing traffic loading was determined by projecting traffic volume increases of up to 20...|$|E

40|$|The railway line in Kiruna is planed to {{be moved}} before year 2012 due to {{expected}} cracking in the underlying rock. The cracking is initiated by the mining in the Kirunavaara-mine. The cracking is expected to cause increasing ground motions that affect the whole infrastructure in Kiruna. For one of the bridges, The Mine Bridge (Gruvvägsviadukten), settlements are expected in the future. Initially at its west side and further eastwards towards the city. An early assessment of the bridge showed that the bridge has enough load-carrying capacity but that {{the length of the}} reinforcement close to the interior columns probably is a little bit too short to fully compensate the prestressing force in top of the concrete girder. A certain worry has been expressed that the ground movements may cause some existing cracks to propagate upwards to the girders top i. e. that the cracks goes through the whole girder which may reduce the shear capacity remarkable. Luleå University of Technology is asked to perform a more thoroughly study of the bridge's capacity to resist different scenarios of settlements. This thesis {{is a part of the}} work and deals with non-linear finite element modelling and analysis of the bridge's capacity to resist the settlements and to evaluate limits for certain expected scenarios of settlements. To confirm the correctness of the final model, the displacements from the model is compared to measured displacement for a known truck load. The comparison shows that the model is somewhat weaker than in the reality. This is believed to depend mainly on a generalization of the deck's geometry and a stiffer construction during the field measurement.

50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability.

40|$|Modern inland {{vessels are}} open-top double-hull ships with {{an unusually large}} aspect ratio, a shallow draught and an {{extremely}} long cargo hold. These ships have a very low bending and torsional rigidity. Due to minor collisions, grounding in shallow water, corrosion and fatigue {{the state of the}} ship structure changes appreciably in course of time. These imperfections reduce the stability and strength of the structure. The safety against total collapse decreases. This thesis is showing the results of a systematic investigation of typical ship-constructions with the Finite-Ele-ment-Method (FEM). The failures of a complex structure like a ship hull is not entails by one item. Usually more than one negative factors are responsible. For example these are an unfavourable cargo distribution, the reduction of the plate thickness and the large imperfections during ser-vice. Normally ships are construct for a relative long working season (20 - 30 years and more). In course of this long term the features of the structure are changing considerably. Already the dimensions of new components must take care of it. As an example, the traditional calculations methods recognize an extra charge for the corrosion. To investigate the structure stability {{it is very difficult to}} take into account the imperfections (e. g. pre-deformations) with analytical calculation methods. This is a typical application for the FEM. The introduction part of the thesis will showing different possibilities to calculate the structural stability and strength of an inland vessel. On account to the points mentioned above (imperfections, load distributions) the traditional calculation methods are not sufficient. Using the Finite-Element-Method (FEM) a new calculation concept will be introducing to achieve these elaborate analyses. In future the influence of local damages to the global structure should be a minimum. The heart of the procedure is the registration and numerical consideration of typical damages. It is to investigate which imperfections are important to consider and which are negligible. A classification of the imperfections will support this. To consider these imperfections the mentioned calculation concept will be used. First, the simple example of a stiffened plate and a box girder will be using to discuss the influence of imperfections on the structure behaviour. Later this knowledge of these investigations will be utilizing for the analysis of typical inland vessels. The FE-models of a pusher barge and a modern inland container vessel will be introducing and their calculation results will be showing. These are deformations and stresses for various cargo distributions. Additionally the non-linear results for extreme loads will be presenting to simulate the collapse behaviour of the vessel. At least constructive modifications (e. g. <b>longitudinal</b> <b>girder,</b> high-tensile steel) will be discussing to show their effects.
