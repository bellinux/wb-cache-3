25|$|The {{heat that}} drives {{geothermal}} {{activity in the}} Yellowstone area comes from brine (salty water) that is 1.5 to 3 miles (2.4 to 4.8km) below the surface. This is actually below the solid volcanic rock and sediment that extends {{to a depth of}} 3,000 to 6,000 feet (900 to 1,800 m) and is inside the hot but mostly solid part of the pluton that contains Yellowstone’s magma chamber. At that depth the brine is superheated to temperatures that exceed 400°F or 205°C but is able to remain a liquid because it is under great pressure (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> pressure cooker).|$|E
25|$|Nyanza was a royal {{capital of}} Rwanda. The king's {{residence}} the Ibwami {{was built on}} a hill. The surrounding hills were occupied by permanent or temporary dwellings. These dwellings were round huts surrounded by big yards and high hedge to separate compounds. The Rugo the royal compound was made of circular reed fence around thatched houses. The houses were carpeted with mats and had a clay hearth in {{the center for the}} king, his wife, and entourage. The royal house was close to 200-100 yards. It looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> maze of connected huts and granaries. It had one entrance that lead to a large public square called the karubanda.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its announcement, Alpha was heralded as an {{architecture}} for the next 25 years. While this was not to be, Alpha has nevertheless had a reasonably long life. The first version, the Alpha 21064 (otherwise known as the EV4) was introduced in November 1992 running at up to 192MHz; a slight shrink of the die (the EV4S, shrunk from 0.75µm to 0.675µm) ran at 200MHz a few months later. The 64-bit processor was a superpipelined and superscalar design, like other RISC designs, but nevertheless outperformed them all and DEC touted it as the world's fastest processor. Careful attention to circuit design, a hallmark of the Hudson design team, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> centralized clock circuitry, allowed them to run the CPU at higher speeds, even though the microarchitecture was fairly similar to other RISC chips. In comparison, the less expensive Intel Pentium ran at 66MHz when it was launched the following spring.|$|E

Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand they sound British but on the other they sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> global artist." [...] In 2011 Coldplay were hailed as 'rock statesmen'.|$|E

5000|$|In many {{discussions of}} the piece, the issue of {{struggle}} is central. Sara Bitloch, violinist of the Elias String Quartet, says this sense of struggle informs her group's interpretation of the fugue. [...] "Every part has to feel <b>like</b> it's <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> struggle ... You need to finish the Grosse Fuge absolutely exhausted." [...] She calls the piece [...] "apocalyptic." [...] Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri String Quartet, calls it [...] "Armageddon ... the chaos out of which life itself evolved." ...|$|R

500|$|Inafune {{credited}} {{himself for}} redesigning the protagonist Mega Man as MegaMan.EXE for the Battle Network series, though he recounted the character designers {{were reluctant to}} hand over the responsibility to him and even altered his illustrations afterwards. The character's initial concept art went through a large number of changes before it was finalized to a much simpler design, so that even very young fans could easily draw it. Yuji Ishihara acted as a primary character artist for the game. Each of the game's boss characters was designed so that their bodies would exude a certain motif; for example, StoneMan.EXE was meant to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> castle made from stone masonry. Some bosses resembled their original Mega Man series counterparts while others were a large departure from these more humanoid appearances. Ishihara explained that the artists chose size and shape variety among the characters to [...] "provide a little bit of surprise and excitement" [...] to fans familiar with their classic forms. The musical score for Battle Network was composed by Akari Kaida, who would later work on the fifth installment of the series. All 22 musical tracks for Mega Man Battle Network were included on the Rockman EXE 1 ~ 3 Game Music Collection, released in Japan by Suleputer on December 18, 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{the project}} looked {{less like a}} new {{operating}} system and more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> collection of new technologies; QuickDraw GX, SOM, and OpenDoc became core components of the system, while completely unrelated technologies like a new file management dialog box (the [...] "open dialog") and [...] "themes" [...] support appeared as well.

2500|$|But even axin {{does not}} act alone. Through its N-terminal {{regulator}} of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain, it recruits the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. APC is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> [...] "Christmas tree": with {{a multitude of}} β-catenin binding motifs (one APC molecule alone possesses 11 such motifs [...] ), it may collect as many β-catenin molecules as possible. APC can interact with multiple axin molecules {{at the same time}} as it has three SAMP motifs (Ser-Ala-Met-Pro) to bind the RGS domains found in axin. In addition, axin also has the potential to oligomerize through its C-terminal DIX domain. The result is a huge, multimeric protein assembly dedicated to β-catenin phosphorylation. This complex is usually called the beta-catenin destruction complex, although it is distinct from the proteosome machinery actually responsible for β-catenin degradation. It only marks β-catenin molecules for subsequent destruction.|$|E
2500|$|On August 5, 1926, while {{traveling}} in the Humboldt Mountains of Tibet's Kokonor region, Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich reported, members of his expedition saw [...] "something big and shiny reflecting the sun, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp the thing changed in its direction from south to southwest. And we saw how it disappeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun." [...] Another description by Roerich was of a [...] "shiny body flying from north to south. Field glasses are at hand. It is a huge body. One side glows in the sun. It is oval in shape. Then it somehow turns in another direction and disappears in the southwest." ...|$|E

60|$|Instantly {{a hundred}} tiny fliers {{rose from her}} deck, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swarm of <b>huge</b> dragon flies; but {{scarcely}} were they clear of the battleship than the nose of each turned toward the shaft, and they, too, rushed on at frightful speed toward the same now seemingly inevitable end that menaced the larger vessel.|$|R
60|$|When, {{followed}} by a few stragglers, these had passed and gathered themselves in the red shadow beneath the gateway towers waiting for the summons, an unusual thing occurred. For a few moments the Road was left quite empty. After that last great stroke Death seemed to be resting on his laurels. When thus unpeopled it looked a very vast place <b>like</b> to <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> arched causeway, bordered on either side by blackness, but itself gleaming with a curious phosphorescence such as once or twice I {{have seen in the}} waters of a summer sea at night.|$|R

60|$|The last {{traveller}} {{to face me}} was a {{very heavy}} man with a great bullet head and a shock of light hair.

But my husband, Jamie, has a whole bunch of non-traditional instruments sitting around our house, and finally my curiosity got the better of me and I started playing around with them. We did 'Brightest Light' with that in mind, and wow! I feel <b>like</b> it's <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> step forward. It's like I have more colors to paint my little scenes with.

25|$|Meanwhile in the Capital, the {{situation}} is close to panic. Everyone knows by now that Gorbovsky's Tariel II cannot take them all to space and that the nearest to Rainbow spaceship that can won't make it in time. Plans <b>like</b> burrowing <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> underground cave under the Capital {{to hide from the}} Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) are desperately developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|R
