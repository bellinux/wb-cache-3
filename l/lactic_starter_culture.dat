Optimal amount of <b>lactic</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> {{in the production of}} lactic acid in the production of cheese and yogurt are used. Materials and methods: Isolation of Lactobacillus in MRS medium from various samples was performed. Then, The variation of different characteristics in terms of the ability of Lactobacilli to produce CO 2 from glucose, the ability to grow at pH 2. 5 to 8. 5, different concentration of NaCl, 1. 5 to 10. 0 (percent w / v) and temperatures of 15 ° c, 45 ° c, the ability to move, indole and H 2 S production were also studied. The production of lactic acid was assayed in skim milk by titration with % 1 NaOH. L-lactate isomer was investigated using UK Randox kit. Results: In this study, from 30 samples of different indigenous yoghurt and cheese 43 gram-positive, catalase-negative, oxidase negative lactobacilli were isolated. All isolates were resistant to pH 2. 5 and 30 and % 69 of the isolated were sensitive to 7. 5 and % 10 concentration of salt respectively. Most of lactic acid production with % 1. 8 and L-lactate 6. 8 g/l were consididered for one isolated. This isolated bacillus based on biochemical tests was identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{manufacture}} of natural cheese was developed using 5 X ultrafiltered whole milk retentate. The retentate was prefermented to pH 5. 0 - 5. 2 before curd formation {{to simplify the}} cheese making process. It was demonstrated that the process can be made commercially feasible. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration of whole milk were done so that the desired level of residual lactose {{was left in the}} retentate. Retentate was inoculated with <b>lactic</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> and incubated (prefermented) until all lactose was converted to lactic acid. The final pH stabilized at about 5. 0 - 5. 2; the desired pH of the cheese curd. Incubation at 25 °C allowed the retentate to remain liquid during prefermentation and easily pumped through pipes. After prefermentation, retentate was passed through a mechanical curd former where rennet was injected and mixed. The retentate-rennet mixture coagulated as it traveled upward through a cylinder. The curd emerged from the curd former and was cut into cubes by a grid of knives. The curd cubes were treated for removal of moisture by cooking in liquid and evaporation under vacuum. After moisture removal, curd was drained. salted and pressed. Cheddaring and milling were unnecessary. Experiments were performed to determine proper methods for preparing retentate. Diafiltration level was significantly related to lactose concentration in retentate (p=. OOO 1) and final pH of fermented retentate (p=. OOO 1). Acidified permeate and acidified, deionized water were evaluated as cooking liquids. Cheese made from curd cooked in permeate had acid defects. but curd cooked in water produced cheese with a pH similar to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese. Moisture content of all finished cheese was excessive for Cheddar cheese. Body and texture of cheese made from curd cooked in water was close to conventionally produced Cheddar cheese.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{probiotic}} cells need to be alive when they are consumed, culture-based analysis (plate count) is critical in ascertaining the quality (numbers of viable cells) of probiotic products. Since probiotic cells are typically stressed, due to various factors related to their production, processing and formulation, the standard methodology for total plate counts tends to underestimate the cell numbers of these products. Furthermore, products such as microencapsulated cultures require modifications in the release and sampling procedure in order to correctly estimate viable counts. This review examines the enumeration of probiotic bacteria in the following commercial products: powders, microencapsulated cultures, frozen concentrates, capsules, foods and beverages.

40|$|Summary: Butter {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular dairy {{products}} that have been transformed from a cottage industry to successful large scale productions. In western countries, consumption of butter has slowly overtaken margarine as the most popular spread. Different kinds of butter are now available on the markets, of which sweet cream butter and salted butter constitute significant proportions. The popularity of cultured cream butter is mainly attributed to its unique flavour and nutritional properties. Butter contains large amounts of β-carotene (provitamin A carotenoid) and is characterised by the buttery flavour due to the presence of diacetyl as well as other organic aroma compounds. Although butter has been produced successfully in large scale commercial processing, small scale productions still exists in small communities and for use in specialised products. New Zealand, like in many other western countries, is dominated by small to medium scale food processing enterprises which produce speciality foods for discerning markets. The domestic market in New Zealand enjoys a variety of dairy products which includes cultured butter. Some small food processing enterprises in outlying areas of New Zealand produce their own cultured butter to cater for the local businesses and their inhabitants. Thus, the main objective of this project was to standardise small scale production of cultured butter using kitchen/domestic scale equipment. Fresh cream (40 % fat) used to produce cultured butter was fermented by a mixed <b>lactic</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc cremoris) following a modified standard method. The cream was pasteurised at 95 °C/ 5 min, rapidly cooled to 8 °C, and then starter culture (2 %) was added. The cream was held at 8 °C/ 2 h to initiate the formation of low melting point fat crystals. The temperature of the cream was then increased to 20 - 21 °C, and held at this temperature for further 2 h to melt fat crystals with high melting point and recrystallise the crystals. The temperature was then decreased to 16 °C/ 2 h to form pure fat crystals. This was then followed by slightly decreasing the temperature to 15 °C for butter churning in a K 5 SS KitchenAid Heavy Duty (USA) churning mixer. Buttermilk (100 mL) was collected and stored at 4 ºC for analysis and the remained buttermilk in the butter churn was drained. The butter grains were washed with distilled water to remove any residual buttermilk. Final cultured butter (product) was packed in heavy duty aluminium foil and stored at 4 ºC for 21 days. Cultured butter was produced on three different occasions commencing in August 2014 (batch 1), September 2014 (batch 2), and October 2014 (batch 3). Various analyses and measurements were conducted during processing and storage to monitor the shelf life stability of the butter. Standard methods were used to measure chemical, physical, consumer sensory acceptance of the products and presence of coliforms were enumerated by Violet Red Bile Agar. Thus, fat content in buttermilk was determined by the Mojonnier test to calculate churning efficiency. Colour was measured by colourimetry, while texture analysis was determined by the TA. XT 2 Texture Analyser. Water droplet size of butter was examined by confocal laser scanning microscope after staining with Nile Red and Acridine Orange. The cultured butter samples were also evaluated by consumer sensory panellists using hedonic scaling of six sensory attributes (smoothness, hardness, spreadability, melting rate, buttery flavour, and overall acceptance). Data were plotted on graphs and also analysed by analysis of variance (P< 0. 05), linear regression and interaction plot. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in moisture content of the three batches of butter which ranged from 13. 90 to 19. 19 %. Although the moisture content of two batches (1 and 3) of butter was slightly higher than the standard (16 %), it was within expected range. Manual washing butter grains after churning to remove water droplets may be inefficient to remove water droplets on the surface of butter. Most of the water droplets had a diameter of 5 μm which is desirable to inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms. No coliforms were detected in the cultured butter, indicating good hygiene standard during production. There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) in hardness of the three batches of cultured butter. Batch 2 had higher hardness than the other two batches, probably attributed to its low moisture content. The fat content of cultured butter of the three batches ranged between 75 % and 80 %, which was slightly lower than the expected 80 %. However, the results were reasonable, considering the higher moisture content of the butter. The cultured butter was well accepted by sensory panellists. Linear regression and interaction plot showed that spreadability and buttery flavour had significant effects (P< 0. 05) on the overall acceptance of the butter. The products were spreadable, presumably due to higher moisture content. The buttery flavour could be attributed to the aroma compounds produced by lactic acid bacteria through citrate metabolism during cream ripening. The dominant hue in the butter was yellowness, which slightly decreased during storage, presumably due to the loss of β-carotene. The pH of butter samples (5. 3 to 5. 8) during storage was slightly higher than in previous studies (4. 7 - 5. 2). The higher pH may be caused by poor acid production of the leuconostoc in the mixed culture. Cultured butter was successfully processed using a kitchen/domestic churning mixer. The churning efficiency of the equipment was lower than the expected range. The butter had good keeping quality and was well accepted by sensory panellists. The quality of the butter during storage was probably attributed to the optimal size of water droplets, which were successfully measured by the confocal laser scanning microscope method modified in this study...|$|E

Six different combinations of the six-strain mix (each containing a different mutant) and a control (containing all six parent strains) were grown over a 10 hr incubation period in two different types of bulk starter media. Samples were taken every two hours and then plated onto M 17 with streptomycin (enumerated mutants only) and without streptomycin (enumerated total cell count). Evidence of dominance was seen in one medium but not the other. Where dominance was present, only one of the six strains studied was found to be suppressed when grown in association with the other strains...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of the use of selected <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> of dairy origin in the production of nitrite-free low-acid fermented venison (Dama dama) sausage (Salame di daino) produced in a small-scale plant in Umbria (Italy), and their effect on microbiological, physico-chemical and sensorial properties of the products. Salame di daino was obtained with two different processes: with and without the addition of selected LAB <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Microbial counts of safety indicators were lower in salami made with the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Pathogens after the first week of ripening were only detected from salami made without the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Control salami were paler and harder, whereas those made with the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> slightly saltier, juicier and in general more acceptable.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are industrially important microbes used {{all over the}} world in a large variety of industrial food fermentations. Cheese, cottage cheese, especially acid curd cheese, are characteristic dairy products for some Central and Eastern European countries. For production of acid curd cheese, only two components are needed: milk and <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> <b>Starter</b> <b>cultures</b> determine in large extent the technological process, the quality of the resulting quark and its shelf life. The composition of quark acid bacteria cultures is constituted in majority by Lactococcus and Leuconostoc bacteria. Selection of strains and construction of cultures with balanced species and stable composition for acid curd production is still very complex and presents a difficult challenge for producers of dairy cultures...|$|R

The maximal specific growth rate (µm) and generation time g ranged between 0. 51 h- 1 to 0. 14 h- 1 and 0. 61 h to 1. 33 h, respectively. We observed that the strains were sensitive {{to a change in}} water activity (aw 0. 32 final), storage and incubation temperatures. The Strain LF obtained a higher cell concentration and viability, as well as a lower g compared to those obtained by the other strains. The kinetic growth parameters (µm, g) together with viability after stress treatments could be used for the screening of dried <b>lactic</b> acid <b>starter</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cream {{cheese is}} a soft fresh acid-coagulated cheese product, which is acidified by {{mesophilic}} <b>lactic</b> acid <b>starter</b> <b>culture,</b> i. e. Lactococcus and Leuconostoc. Cream cheese products are categorized into two main types {{based on the}} different fat content in the initial mix and the final composition. These are double-cream cheese with at least 9 - 11 % fat content in the initial mix, and single-cream cheese with 4. 5 - 5 % fat content in initial mix. Cream cheese was first made by using the cooked-curd method, which {{was developed in the}} early twenties, and the cold-pack and hot-pack methods were developed, and are still used at present. The products with high quality should have a uniform white to light cream color with a lightly lactic acid and cultured diacetyl flavor and aroma. The texture of the products should be smooth without lumps, grittiness, or any indication of cracking and wheying off, and with the ability to spread at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Fermentation is an {{environmentally}} friendly method to improve feed quality. Fermented liquid feed and airtight stored moist crimped cereal grain {{systems that are}} of increasing importance in agricultural practice were studied. Both rely on spontaneous microbial developments with poorly understood population dynamics, resulting in unpredictable final quality. Temperature, fermentation time and ingredients affected final properties of the feed. Molecular-based species identification showed that microbial populations changed, even when total viable counts were stable. Moisture contents in farm-stored crimped cereal grain were mostly below recommended values, resulting in insufficient lactic acid formation and growth of undesirable microbes. Adding <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> to fermentation systems influenced microbial populations. A grass silage <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> was added to liquid feed fermentations.

The experiment was carried out in SLU’s experiment stable. Six growing pigs Yorkshire purebred at an average initial live weight of (29 ± 2. 5) kg were surgically fitted with a PVTC – cannula. Four diets, 6 pigs and 6 periods were arranged in a change-over design. The fermented liquid diets were fermented dry (FD), fermented control (FC), fermented inoculated with Wickerhamomyces anomalus (FW) and fermented inoculated with Wickerhamomyces anomalus and <b>Starter</b> <b>culture</b> (FWS). Water was added to the feed in a 3 : 1 ratio. All of the treatments were fermented during an initial 7 days. When feeding commenced 1 / 2 of the contents were replaced with fresh feed and water once a day in the afternoon. The pH of the treatments was around 4. 0. There were no Enterobacteriaceae found in the feed during the 6 periods. Cfu counts for yeast in all treatments slightly fluctuated around log 7. 5 Cfu/ g grain during the experiment. Cfu counts for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in Wickerhamomyces inoculated treatments tended to be lower than that in non-inoculated treatments. Cfu counts for mould in FW and FWS were lower (approximately log 1 for FW and log 3 for FWS) than in FC in the periods that they were detected. The apparent ileal digestibility of OM was different (P 0. 05) among treatments. In conclusion, Wickerhamomyces anomalus and <b>lactic</b> acid bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> inoculated to moist crimped grain can give good hygiene in wet fermented feed and high total tract digestibility of organic matter and crude protein...|$|R

These include also bakery products with <b>lactic</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> which contain live microorganisms, vitamins of group B: B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, B 9, vitamins A, C, E, folic acid. In this article the technological aspects of the probiotic bacterial concentrate "Immunolakt" in the manufacture of bakery products were studied. The experimental product was developed on the basis of traditional technology taking into account the properties of the introduced additives to correct some technological parameters. The research resulted in {{the development}} of technology of bakery products with the introduction of probiotic bacterial concentrate "Immunolakt. ". To develop the recipes of dough products probiotic bacterial concentrates "Immunolakt" at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 % was used instead of a part of yeast in the recipe. Comparative studies of the microstructure of bakery products crumb with the addition of probiotic bacterial concentrate "Immunolakt" and the reference sample were carried out. The content of the probiotic bacterial concentrate of 40 % and 60 % promoted the formation of a more uniform pore structure and reduction in the number ruptures along their perimeter. Safety indicators of reference and test samples were determined. The number of bacteria of reference and experimental samples of bakery products are in the normal range. The number of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in the test samples is less than in the reference one. Qualimetric evaluation of the quality of finished products was carried out. The developed products are of high organoleptic quality indexes, they are physically and chemically stable, with enhanced nutritional value. Products with the introduction of probiotic bacterial concentrate allow to expand the range of functional orientation bakery products. The use of probiotic bacterial concentrates allows to adjust the course of the technological process, to form the specific properties of the dough and to improve the finished products quality...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{isolates}} from bean-sprouts {{were screened}} for anti-Listeria monocytogenes bacteriocins using a well-diffusion method. Thirty-four isolates inhibited {{the growth of}} L. monocytogenes. Ten strains, which produced the biggest zones of inhibition, were characterized. One strain, isolate 80, which exhibited the strongest inhibition against L. monocytogenes, was selected for subsequent in-depth analysis. Both ribotyping and DNA sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA demonstrated that the isolate was Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Primary characterization showed that the anti-L. monocytogenes compound was proteinaceous and the antimicrobial effects were not caused by pH, a phage or H 2 O 2, indicating {{that it was a}} bacteriocin. A plasmid cured derivative of isolate 32 was obtained. This plasmid-free strain still produced a bacteriocin, and had the same antibiotic resistance pattern as the wild type strain, indicating that the antibiotic resistance and bacteriocin genes were most likely to be chromosomally mediated. These bacteriocin-producing isolates produced nisin Z. Tests indicate that <b>lactic</b> acid <b>starter</b> <b>cultures,</b> possibly in combination with other hurdles, can be used to control the growth of L. monocytogenes in fresh-cut vegetables.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{microbiology}} of the Lebanon bologna process were studied. Manufacture of Lebanon bologna appeared {{to be similar to}} that of summer sausage and other fermented sausages and consisted of a lactic acid fermentation by lactobacilli accompanied by the production of cured meat color from the reduction of nitrate by micrococci. The traditional process consists of aging coarse ground beef at 5 C for several days. Aging the beef for about 10 days was necessary to allow development of lactic acid bacteria; for successful fermentation, the concentration of lactic acid producers must be 104 /g or more. At least 3 % NaCl was necessary to suppress the development of pseudomonads during the aging period; higher concentrations of salt suppress the development of the lactic acid-producing flora. During aging, in the presence of salt, the predominant flora developing on the meat consisted of catalase-positive, gram-positive rods and cocci; during fermentation at 35 C, the predominant flora became catalase-negative, gram-positive rods with characteristics of lactobacilli. Lebanon bologna could be made from frozen beef if the meat was thawed, salted, and aged. However, bolognas could not be made from unaged beef unless a <b>lactic</b> acid <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> was used. The microflora of several commercial bolognas is reported also...|$|R
5000|$|Salami is a raw-fermented sausage {{consisting}} of raw comminuted pork and/or beef meat, fat, and additives, such as curing salt, spices, sugar, and a <b>starter</b> <b>culture.</b> There are multiple {{different types of}} Salami meat in various markets around the world. In northern and central Europe, smoked salamis are preferred, and ripening {{is controlled by the}} addition of <b>lactic</b> acid-producing <b>starter</b> <b>cultures,</b> whereas in southern Europe, salami is slowly air-dried and mostly mold-ripened. Therefore, different preservation and drying methods are used around the world to prepare salami. Hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. The salami that is of Hungarian origin, the so-called [...] "Hungarian Winter salami", is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. Szegedi téliszalámi (winter salami) is made of mangalitsa pork breed, with horse large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months. [...] Hungarian salami is one of the world's two trade names for salami, Milano salami being the other. These fermented sausages combine smoke and mold application in one. The traditional technology used to produce them is based on the Italian pre-drying technique developed during the nineteenth century, but they are smoked and their pH does not drop below 5.5, so the final flavor of the product is not acidic.|$|R
