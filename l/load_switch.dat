40|$|Abstract Recently, a novel <b>switch</b> architecture, the <b>load</b> bal-anced (LB) <b>switch</b> {{proposed}} by C. S. Chang et al [1], [2] {{opened a new}} avenue for designing a large-capacity packet <b>switch.</b> The <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> consists of two stages. First, a load-balancing stage spreads arriving packets equally among all linecards. Then, a forwarding stage transfers packets from the linecards to their nal output destination. The <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> does not need any centralized scheduler and can achieve 100 % throughput under a broad class of trafc distributions. However, the <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch</b> may cause packets at the output port to be out of sequence. Several schemes have been proposed to tackle the out-of-sequence problem of the <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch.</b> However, they are either too complex to implement, or introduce a large additional delay. In this paper, we present a practical <b>load</b> balanced <b>switch,</b> called the Byte-Focal switch, which uses packet-by-packet scheduling to signicantly improve the delay performance over switches of comparable complexity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) based {{resistive}} damping algorithm of power swing has been simulated. Based on the angle difference signal {{extracted from the}} PMU, a resistive <b>load</b> has been <b>switched</b> on and off to damp the oscillation. The simulation {{has been done in}} SIMPOW. Three phase faults were applied to obtain transient instabilities. These instabilities were characterized by ESPRIT method (frequency of oscillation, time constant) and were damped out by <b>load</b> <b>switching.</b> Besides the simulation, measurement with a PMU has been carried out in the Power System lab of the department. The angle difference signal derived from the PMU proved to be a reliable indicator of power swing. In the simulation voltage angle difference between two buses has been taken as an indicator for power swing and a resistive <b>load</b> is <b>switched</b> on when the derivative of this angle difference signal is positive. It has been found that resistive <b>load</b> <b>switching</b> with appropriate value improves both transient stability margin and damping of the power swing.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{prospective}} time estimation was tested in two experimental variations which examine {{the influence of}} <b>load</b> <b>switch</b> in task demands on time estimation. The model predicts these influences on time estimates by means of memory processes such as spreading activation. The approach was integrated into a cognitive architecture and has previously been tested successfully. In two experiments participants had {{to work on a}} counting task with different levels of working memory demands (High/Low). The participants had to stop each trial after a perceived duration of a previously presented sample of 100 seconds (altered reproduction method) and received feedback. In the Low group most trials were performed in low load and one or two trials in high load (<b>load</b> <b>switch),</b> and vice versa for the High group. For the Low group the model predicts overestimations at load switches, but underestimations for the High group. We found that the model predictions in the first experiment only match the experimental results for the Low group, most probably due to the experimental design. In the second experiment, the design was therefore slightly changed and the timing task was embedded into a manual control task within a microworld environment. In this setting the model predictions match the time estimates for both groups. The series of experiments reported give strong evidence that the model is able to capture and to predict influences of task demands on time-estimates. The timing model may be used as a base for modeling subjective temporal reasoning and the timing of interaction with a dynamic system...|$|E
