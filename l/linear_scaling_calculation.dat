40|$|Novel low-scaling {{techniques}} for molecular electronic structure and property calculations are introduced. Through {{the use of}} rank-revealing matrix factorizations, overheads compared to canonical molecular orbital-based formulations are virtually eliminated. Asymptotic computational complexity is linear or sub-linear (depending on the property) {{through the use of}} sparsity-preserving transformations throughout. For electron correlation energy calculations within the random phase approximation, these techniques are combined with an attenuated Coulomb metric in the resolution-of-the-identity to improve the accuracy over existing low-scaling methods and to reduce the scaling compared to existing canonical methods. For the resolution-of-the-identity itself, a novel method for the compression of auxiliary bases is introduced, powered by removal of the particle-hole-interaction nullspace through projection. Furthermore, efficient schemes for the calculation of molecular response properties at the Hartree–Fock and density functional theory levels are introduced: For the <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>calculation</b> of vibrational frequencies, the exact cancellation of different long-range operator derivatives is employed in combination with Laplace-transformed and Cholesky-decomposed coupled-perturbed self-consistent field theories. Using related techniques, calculations of indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants with asymptotically constant time complexity are demonstrated and used to explore the dependence of spin-spin couplings in a peptide on the size of a surrounding solvent environment...|$|E

Hence, this scheme enables highly accurate all-electron <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>calculations</b> even for metallic systems. The inherent energy drift of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, arising from an incomplete convergence of the self-consistent field cycle, is circumvented by means of a properly modified Langevin equation.

40|$|We {{present a}} library of Gaussian basis sets that has been {{specifically}} optimized to perform accurate molecular calculations based on density functional theory. It targets {{a wide range of}} chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i. e., have a small (down to 0. 2 kcal/mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0. 1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>calculations...</b>|$|R

The stochastic GW (sGW) relies on novel theoretical concepts such as stochastic time-dependent Hartree propagation, stochastic matrix compression and spatial/temporal stochastic decoupling techniques. Beyond the theoretical interest, the formalism enables <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> GW <b>calculations</b> breaking the theoretical scaling limit for GW as well as circumventing the need for energy cutoff approximations.

40|$|Applications of {{existing}} precise electronic-structure methods based on density functional theory are typically {{limited to the}} treatment of about 1000 inequivalent atoms, which leaves unresolved many open questions in material science, e. g., on complex defects, interfaces, dislocations, and nanostructures. KKRnano is a new massively parallel <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> all-electron density functional algorithm in the framework of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's-function method. We conceptualized, developed, and optimized KKRnano for large-scale applications of many thousands of atoms without compromising on the precision of a full-potential all-electron method, i. e., it is a method without any shape approximation of the charge density or potential. A key element of the new method is the iterative solution of the sparse linear Dyson equation, which we parallelized atom by atom, across energy points in the complex plane and for each spin degree of freedom using the message passing interface standard, followed by a lower-level OpenMP parallelization. This hybrid four-level parallelization allows for an efficient use of up to 100 000 processors on the latest generation of supercomputers. The iterative solution of the Dyson equation is significantly accelerated, employing preconditioning techniques making use of coarse-graining principles expressed in a block-circulant preconditioner. In this paper, we will describe the important elements of this new algorithm, focusing on the parallelization and preconditioning and showing scaling results for NiPd alloys up to 8192 atoms and 65 536 processors. At the end, we present an order-N algorithm for large-scale simulations of metallic systems, making use of the nearsighted principle of the KKR Green's-function approach by introducing a truncation of the electron scattering to a local cluster of atoms, the size of which is determined by the requested accuracy. By exploiting this algorithm, we show <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>calculations</b> of more than 16 000 NiPd atoms...|$|R

The approach {{is based on an}} atomic-orbital-based, open-ended quasienergy derivative formalism, and is applicable for use in <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> SCF <b>calculations.</b> In order to enable the calculation of any response property, we have also developed open- ended one- and two-electron integral derivative programs, as well as a program that can calculate derivatives of exchange- correlation functionals to any order using automatic differentiation. These modules have been interfaced to both the Dalton and DIRAC programs.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{methods of}} reduced complexity for electronic structure calculations.   When quantum chemistry methods {{are applied to}} large systems, {{it is important to}} optimally use computer resources and only store data and perform operations that contribute to the overall accuracy. At the same time, precarious approximations could jeopardize the reliability of the whole calculation.   In this thesis, the self-consistent field method is seen as a sequence of rotations of the occupied subspace. Errors coming from computational approximations are characterized as erroneous rotations of this subspace. This viewpoint is optimal {{in the sense that the}} occupied subspace uniquely defines the electron density. Errors should be measured by their impact on the overall accuracy instead of by their constituent parts. With this point of view, a mathematical framework for control of errors in Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham calculations is proposed.   A unifying framework is of particular importance when computational approximations are introduced to efficiently handle large systems. An important operation in Hartree-Fock/Kohn-Sham calculations is the calculation of the density matrix for a given Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix. In this thesis, density matrix purification is used to compute the density matrix with time and memory usage increasing only linearly with system size. The forward error of purification is analyzed and schemes to control the forward error are proposed. The presented purification methods are coupled with effective methods to compute interior eigenvalues of the Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix also proposed in this thesis. New methods for inverse factorizations of Hermitian positive definite matrices that can be used for congruence transformations of the Fock/Kohn-Sham and density matrices are suggested as well. Most of the methods above have been implemented in the Ergo quantum chemistry program. This program uses a hierarchic sparse matrix library, also presented in this thesis, which is parallelized for shared memory computer architectures. It is demonstrated that the Ergo program is able to perform <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> Hartree-Fock <b>calculations.</b> QC 2010090...|$|R
