40|$|Using a {{combination}} of accelerator-based ion beam methods we have analysed PM 2. 5 particulates for a suite of 21 species (H, C, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Pb) to evaluate the contribution to Sydney (New South Wales, Australia) air associated {{with the introduction of}} MMT as a replacement for lead. MMT was discontinued in 2004. Teflon filters representing continuous sampling for a 7 year period from 1998 to 2004 were analysed from two sites: one from Mascot, a suburb close to the Central Business District [CBD (n= 718) ] and a high trafficked area, and the other, a relatively rural (background) setting at Richmond, 20 km west of the CBD (n= 730). Manganese concentrations in air at the background site increased from a mean of 1. 5 – 1. 6 ng m− 3 to less than 2 ng m− 3 at the time of greatest MMT use whereas those at Mascot increased from about 2 to 5 ng m− 3. From the maximum values, the Mn showed a steady decrease at both sites concomitant with the decreasing use of MMT. Lead concentrations in air at both sites decreased from 1998 onwards, concomitant with the phase out of leaded gasoline, attained in 2002. Employing previously determined elemental signatures it was possible to adjust effects from season along with auto emissions and soil. A high correlation was obtained for the relationship between Mn in air and lead <b>replacement</b> <b>gasoline</b> use (R 2 0. 83) and an improved correlation for Mn/ Al+Si+K and lead <b>replacement</b> <b>gasoline</b> use (R 2 0. 93). In addition, using Mn concentrations normalized to background values of Al+Si+K or Ti to account for the lithogenically derived Mn, the proportion of anthropogenic Mn was approximately 70 %. The changes for Mn and Pb detected in the particulates are attributed to the before-during-after use of MMT and decreasing use of lead in gasoline. The values measured in Sydney air are well below the reference concentration of 50 ng Mn m− 3. The incremental increases in air, however, are larger than expected given the limited use of MMT only in lead <b>replacement</b> <b>gasoline</b> and high quality monitoring should be undertaken in countries where MMT is used in all gasoline. © 2005, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Low-glycaemic index diets reduce glycated Hb (HbA 1 c) in {{patients}} with type 2 diabetes, but require intensive dietary support. Using a <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> with a low glycaemic response (GR) may be an alternative dietary approach. In the present study, we investigated whether breakfast replacement with a low-GR liquid meal would reduce postprandial glycaemia and/or improve long-term glycaemia. In the present randomised, controlled, cross-over design, twenty patients with type 2 diabetes consumed either a breakfast replacement consisting of an isoenergetic amount of Glucerna SR or a free-choice breakfast for 3 months. Postprandial AUC levels were measured using continuous glucose measurement at home. After the 3 -month dietary period, meal profiles and oral glucose tolerance were assessed in the clinical setting. The low-GR <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> reduced the AUC of postprandial glucose excursions at home compared with a free-choice control breakfast (estimated marginal mean 141 (95 % CI 114, 174) v. estimated marginal mean 259 (95 % CI 211, 318) mmol × min/l; P= 0 · 0002). The low-GR <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> also reduced glucose AUC levels in the clinical setting compared with an isoenergetic control breakfast (low GR: median 97 (interquartile range (IQR) 60 - 188) mmol × min/l; control: median 253 (IQR 162 - 386) mmol × min/l; P < 0 · 001). However, the 3 -month low-GR <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> did not affect fasting plasma glucose, HbA 1 c or lipid levels, and even slightly reduced oral glucose tolerance. In conclusion, the low-GR <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> is a potential dietary approach to reduce postprandial glycaemia {{in patients}} with type 2 diabetes. However, clinical trials into the effects of replacing multiple meals on long-term glycaemia in poorly controlled patients are required before a low-GR <b>liquid</b> meal <b>replacement</b> can be adopted as a dietary approach {{to the treatment of}} type 2 diabete...|$|R
