40|$|While sodomy {{laws have}} been {{repealed}} in many nations, such as the United States and Australia, as of May 2008, such <b>laws</b> still exist <b>in</b> 86 states which {{are members of the}} United Nations. The repeal of such <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> many countries is reflective of advances in the human rights movement globally and the increasing recognition that certain key principles of human rights, such as privacy, personal dignity, autonomy and equality, necessarily subsume within their reach the recognition of freedom with regard to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex ('LGBTI') orientation. This article will explore the factors contributing to the ultimate repeal of these <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> the United States ('US') and Australia - as well as the factors militating against the repeal of such <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia. This piece argues that the sodomy <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia should be repealed for the same reasons they have ultimately been repealed in the US and Australia. The historical experiences with the sodomy <b>laws</b> <b>in</b> all three contexts provide an insight into the evolution of the human rights movement globally...|$|R
