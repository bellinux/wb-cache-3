500|$|In Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Rivers Lamar York {{says that}} Rawlings' {{settings}} are {{an essential part}} of her plots, and that she did not choose to write about a river by accident. At a <b>low</b> <b>time</b> in her life she had taken time off and traveled the length of the St. Johns River with a friend. Later she wrote about the boat trip in [...] "Hyacinth Drift", a chapter of Cross Creek. The trip, she said, cured her depression and allowed her to live in peace, as The Secret River did for Calpurnia and her community. The river, York writes, expresses Rawlings' belief that [...] "man must know or discover a relationship to a suitable physical setting" [...] in order to survive the harshness of the world, as she herself did on the St. Johns.|$|E
2500|$|To {{ensure that}} a {{compressed}} pulse has <b>low</b> <b>time</b> sidelobes, its spectrum should be approximately bell-shaped. [...] With linear chirp pulses this {{can be achieved by}} applying a window function either in the time domain or in the frequency domain, i.e. by amplitude modulating the chirp waveforms or by applying weighting to the compressed pulse spectra.

[...] Another benefit is that the far out sidelobes, due to Fresnel ripples on the spectrum, tend to be lower than for a linear chirp with the same T×B product (4 to 5dB lower with large T×B).|$|E

5000|$|To have an output {{high time}} {{shorter than the}} <b>low</b> <b>time</b> (i.e., a duty cycle less than 50%) a fast diode (i.e. 1N4148 signal diode) can be placed in {{parallel}} with R2, with the cathode on the capacitor side. This bypasses R2 during the high part of the cycle so that the high interval depends only on R1 and C, with an adjustment based the voltage drop across the diode. The voltage drop across the diode slows charging on the capacitor so that the high time is a longer than the expected and often-cited ln(2)*R1C = 0.693 R1C.

50|$|Adaptive Gabor {{representation}} (AGR) is a Gabor {{representation of}} a signal where its variance is adjustable. There's always a trade-off between time resolution and frequency resolution in traditional short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A long window leads to high frequency resolution and <b>low</b> <b>time</b> resolution. On the other hand, high time resolution requires shorter window, with the expense of low frequency resolution. By choosing the proper elementary function for signal with different spectrum structure, adaptive Gabor representation is able to accommodate both narrowband and wideband signal.|$|E
