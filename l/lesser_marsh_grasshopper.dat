50|$|Chorthippus albomarginatus, the <b>lesser</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>{{grasshopper}},</b> is {{a common}} grasshopper of European grassland both damp-marshy and (despite its name) dry, including salt-marsh and coastal habitats.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshopper</b> extends from Finland and {{southern}} Scandinavia in the north to Spain and Italy in the south. It was once present only in the southern parts of the UK but has been expanding its range northwards.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{researcher}} and other biologists {{find a lot}} of rare plant and animal species in the Schnaakenmoor. For example a variety of different landscapes {{are to be found in}} this small area. Examples are inland dunes, hill moores, buckwheat or meadows. Animal species are e.g. warty newt, moor frog, large <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshopper</b> and crossed adder.|$|R
50|$|Grass snakes, Alpine newts, Common toads and Common frogs {{occur in}} the carrs, and great spotted {{woodpeckers}} and red-backed shrike may also be seen there. Dragonflies and damselflies thrive greatly on the brown water ponds; a total of 37 different species {{have been identified in}} the valley, including the blue hawker. Other insects living in the valley include the stag beetle, der swallowtail and the large <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshopper.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshoppers.</b> Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, southern emerald damselfly live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|R
50|$|Several pits have {{developed}} marsh and rank grassland, their principal value is for invertebrates, particularly an area close to Bowyer's Water where grasshoppers and bush-crickets are present. This orthopteran fauna {{is believed to}} be the richest in Hertfordshire and includes several species more associated with coastal sites, such as the <b>lesser</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshopper</b> and the nationally scarce roesel's bush-cricket.|$|E
50|$|Shapwick Heath is a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve It {{is a former}} raised bog lying in the basin of the River Brue. The site supports a diverse community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. National rarities are the large <b>marsh</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Stethophyma grossum) found on sphagnum moss bogs, the greater silver diving beetle (Hydrophilus piceus) and the lesser silver diving beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) which is now confined nationally to the Brue Basin Peat Moors.|$|R

50|$|Highnam Wood is {{a nature}} reserve located in Gloucestershire and {{established}} by the RSPB to protect bird species in the region. A two-kilometre nature trail passes through the park, giving tourists a view of Britain's rarest breeding woodpecker species, the <b>Lesser</b> Spotted Woodpecker. <b>Marsh</b> Tit, Nightingale, Song Thrush, and Spotted Flycatchers also frequent the park.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reserve is}} {{considered}} {{to have one of}} the best collections of wet heathland and bog plants in the county. Notable plants are bog asphodel, common cotton-grass, few-flowered spike-rush and tawny sedge. The loss of local habitat has resulted in this reserve becoming an important conservation area. Also recorded are <b>lesser</b> spearwort and <b>marsh</b> pennywort.|$|R
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{is available from the}} Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. Typical woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, early-purple orchid, primrose, ramsons (wood garlic), common dog-violet and yellow archangel. Uncommon species are meadow saffron, herb-paris, common cow-wheat, bitter-vetch and violet helleborine. The grassy rides support betony, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, common spotted-orchid, greater knapweed, greater butterfly-orchid, cowslip and yellow-rattle. The damper rides supports <b>lesser</b> spearwort, ragged-robin, <b>marsh</b> ragwort, brooklime and various sedges and rushes.|$|R
50|$|The swamp {{vegetation}} of {{the reserve}} is unique. Its composition is dominated by mesotrophic (bridge) swamps and to a <b>lesser</b> extent oligotrophic. <b>Marshes,</b> which have a covering of sphagnum, account for about 80% of all the wetlands. Eutrophic (lowland) bogs occupy 10-15% of the marshlands (the rest are intermediate marshes made up of oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes). Overall, the reserve preserves 13 plant and 25 animal species listed in the Green Book of Ukraine.|$|R
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{affected}} hundreds of kilometers of coastal wetland shorelines, including salt marshes with persistent heavy oiling that required intensive shoreline "cleanup" treatment. Oiled marsh treatment involves {{a delicate balance}} among: removing oil, speeding the degradation of remaining oil, protecting wildlife, fostering habitat recovery, and not causing further ecological damage with treatment. To examine the effectiveness and ecological effects of treatment during the emergency response, oiling characteristics and ecological parameters were compared over two years among heavily oiled test plots subject to: manual treatment, mechanical treatment, natural recovery (no treatment, oiled control), as well as adjacent reference conditions. An additional experiment compared areas with and without vegetation planting following treatment. Negative effects of persistent heavy oiling on marsh vegetation, intertidal invertebrates, and shoreline erosion were observed. In areas without treatment, oiling conditions and negative effects for most marsh parameters did not considerably improve over two years. Both manual and mechanical treatment were effective at improving oiling conditions and vegetation characteristics, beginning the recovery process, though recovery was not complete by two years. Mechanical treatment had additional negative effects of mixing oil into the marsh soils and further accelerating erosion. Manual treatment appeared to strike the right balance between improving oiling and habitat conditions while not causing additional detrimental effects. However, even with these improvements, marsh periwinkle snails showed minimal signs of recovery through two years, suggesting that some ecosystem components may lag vegetation recovery. Planting following treatment quickened vegetation recovery and reduced shoreline erosion. Faced with comparable marsh oiling in the future, we would recommend manual treatment followed by planting. We caution {{against the use of}} intensive treatment methods with <b>lesser</b> <b>marsh</b> oiling. Oiled controls (no treatment "set-asides") are essential for judging marsh treatment effectiveness and ecological effects; we recommend their use when applying intensive treatment methods...|$|R

40|$|According to {{activity}} signs left on {{the ground}} (feces, footprints, and traces of rooting), wild boars on the Doñana Reserve preferentially occupy the marsh edge and the shrub area and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, the <b>marsh</b> itself and the dryer zones of shifting or stabilized dunes. Habitat occupation follows a seasonal pattern, with the marsh edge being used progressively more from autumn to summer. The period of farrowing extends almost throughout the year, although virtually no births occur during the summer or in early autumn. Our data suggest two periods of sexual activity: an extended one during the summer, and a shorter one (although of greater influence on births) in late autumn. The basic social unit is the other group; several units may join to form larger family groups, which may comprise females with their young, rusty individuals, subadults, and sometimes male adults, although the latter tend to be solitary.

40|$|Elevation {{and climate}} are interrelated {{variables}} {{which have a}} profound affect on biota. Flying insects such as dragonflies can rapidly disperse and optimal habitat conditions at appropriate elevations. Such behaviour {{is likely to be}} especially important in geographical areas which are subject to major climatic events such as El Niño. Accordingly, we studied dragonflies and environmental variables in a series of reservoirs over an elevational range of 100 – 1350 m a. s. l. at the same latitude on the eastern seaboard of South Africa. The aim was to determine how elevation and climate (as regional processes), as well as local factors, influence species assemblage variability, habitat preference and phenology. Certain environmental variables strongly explained the main variation in species assemblage. These included local factors such as pH, marginal grasses, percentage shade, exposed rock, marginal forest and to a <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>marshes</b> and flow. Different species showed various tolerance levels to these variables. Elevation and climate as regional processes had very little influence on dragonfly assemblages in comparison with these environmental factors. These odonate species are essentially sub-tropical, and are similar to their tropical counterparts in that they have long flight periods with overlapping generations. Yet they also have temperate characteristics such as over-wintering mostly as larvae. These results indicate evolutionary adaptations from both temperate and tropical regions. Furthermore, most were also widespread and opportunistic habitat generalists. The national endemics Pseudagrion citricola and Africallagma sapphirinum only occurred at high elevations. However, the endemic Agriocnemis falcifera was throughout all elevations, suggesting regional endemism does not necessarily equate to elevational intolerance. Overall, the results suggest that many millennia of great climatic variation have led to a highly vagile and elevation-tolerant dragonfly assemblage which readily occupies new water bodies. Such an assemblage is likely to be highly tolerant of global climate change, so long as there is sufficient water to keep the reservoirs at a constant level...|$|R
40|$|Research at 10 {{locations}} in coastal subtropical Queensland, Australia, {{has shown that}} salt marshes contained heterogeneous distributions of eggshells of the pest and vector mosquito Aedes vigilax (Skuse) (Diptera:Culicidae). The eggshell distribution was related to specific vegetation assemblages, {{with a mix of}} the grass, Sporobolus virginicus (L.) Kunth (Poales: Poaceae), and the beaded glasswort, Sarcocornia quinqueflora (Bunge ex (Ung. -Stern) A. J. Scott (Caryophyllales: Chenopodiaceae), as significantly higher in eggshells than any other vegetation. There were also high numbers in the mix of S. virginicus with the arrowgrass, Triglochin striata Ruiz & Pavón (Alismatales: Juncaginaceae). Both mixed types are found in relatively wetter areas, despite very few eggshells being found generally in the low marsh. Most sites contained S. virginicus and eggshell locations were variable for this species alone. This was probably related to its life form variability in response to salinity and location on the marsh. Location on the marsh was important for eggshell distribution with most eggshells around the edges of pools and depressions, followed by, but to a significantly <b>lesser</b> extent, the <b>marsh</b> surface. Eggshells were fewest in the low marsh. Partition analysis resulted in a tree that simplified and summarised the factors important for eggshell distribution confirming the individual analyses. The potential effects of climate, sea level and other change are also briefly discussed in the context of likely changes to land cover and relative location on the marsh. For example, increased sea level may lead to low marsh conditions extending into higher marsh area with implications for oviposition and numbers of eggshells...|$|R
40|$|Six {{areas of}} Newfoundland were {{selected}} {{for the purpose of}} investigating the various bog types on the island. These study regions extended from the Avalon Peninsula (Region I) west to St. George's (Region V) and north to Daniel's Harbour (Region VI). A total of 178 peat deposits were studied, which included bogs, fens, and to a <b>lesser</b> extent, <b>marsh</b> accumulations. [...] The rate and type of accumulation of these deposits is controlled by physiographic factors, such as climate and geology. Pleistocene glaciation has played an important role by the formation of depressions and by damming water, thus creating an environment favourable for bogland development. Fire has resulted in paludification which encouraged the expansion of bogs over relatively dry ground. It was found that climate is the predominant factor controlling the growth and expansion of bogs in Newfoundland. Blanket bogs are most common in Newfoundland, especially in the coastal areas, and predominate in all but Terra Nova (Region IV). In Region IV raised bogs are more prevalent than blanket bogs; in Region I raised bogs are found but only in localized depressions surrounded by forested slopes. In some areas there are larger bogs formed by the combination of raised centers coalesced by blanket bog. Paludification in all regions result in blanket bog expansion. Wesleyville (Region III) has the largest blanket bogs, in any of the study regions, covering many square miles spreading over bare granite bedrock within the past forty years. [...] From the study of peat cores, cross-sections were compiled showing the types of peat in some Newfoundland bogs. Bog development is preceded by a growth of fen species, gradually dominated by Cyperaceae and then by the Sphagnum species. Surfaces of both blanket and raised bogs have similar species with sedges Scirpus spp. and Carex spp. more abundant in blanket bogs; Scirpus cespitosus. Sphagnum spp. and ericaceous shrubs dominate the raised bog surface. Raised bogs generally have a good regeneration complex with Sphagnum cuspidatum in flashets, Sphagnum magellanicum the dominating mat component and Sphagnum rubellum, Sphagnum fuscum, Sphagnum flavicomans and Sphagnum imbricatum the hummock-forming species. Ericaceous shrubs, lichens and bryophytes (other than Sphagnum) are commonly found occupying drier surfaces. Other species such as Myrica gale, Menyanthes trifoliata and Carex spp. are principally found in minerotrophic sites such as soaks, drainage channels or bog borders.
