The system was installed in the seven-stand hot-strip mill of voestalpine´s steel plant in Linz / Austria in 1997. It is able to predict the mechanical properties {{as well as the}} thickness and composition of the scale layer of the {{hot rolled strip}} immediately after cooling and downcoiling A simulation of all process-steps such as austenitization during reheating of the slab and dissolution of the micro-alloying elements in the reheating furnace, deformation, recrystallization and grain growth processes in the austenite, precipitation during roughing and finishing as well as phasetransformation and precipitation in the cooling line and during cooling of the coil down to room temperature is performed. The results of the pre-calculation after roughing based on the up stream parameters are used for a fully automatic in-line control of the production in the finishing mill. If the material is subjected to stretchlevelling in subsequent process-steps such as pickling the elongation caused by the stretch <b>levelling</b> <b>unit</b> is also taken into account for the prediction of the mechanical properties. The results of the calculated values are compared with the mechanical properties obtained by tensile testing. Operational experience with the CAQCsystem will be presented in the paper. 1...|$|E

40|$|Since 1970 ’s in many European {{countries}} and in North America perinatal cares are organized by local regions according to three hospital levels, corresponding to structural characteristics and to offered professional abilities; {{the same three}} levels are defined for obstetric units; in a hospital we always have obstetric and neonatal assistance units of the same level, and moreover if an upper <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> is activated, all lower <b>level</b> <b>units</b> are activated too; thus we have most hospitals with first <b>level</b> <b>units,</b> some hospitals with first and second <b>level</b> <b>units</b> and few hospitals with first, second and third <b>level</b> <b>units.</b> First <b>level</b> neonatal assistance <b>units</b> take care of newborns without ascertained pathologies, born after more than 34 gestation weeks. Second <b>level</b> <b>units</b> assist newborns characterized by mild pathologies or weight over 1500 grams, or born after more than 32 gestation weeks. Third <b>level</b> <b>units</b> generally include an intensive care unit and a sub-intensive care unit; the intensive care units assist newborns needing artificial ventilation, surgical newborns before and after surgical operations, newborns with less than 32 gestation weeks, newborns with complex malformations and/or needing invasive or specific diagnostic procedures; the sub-intensive care units assist newborns after admission {{in the intensive care}} units, after their reaching better health conditions, but not yet admissible in a second <b>level</b> <b>unit.</b> Each third <b>level</b> intensive or sub-intensive care unit is characterised by the number of places at disposition, depending on the number of special incubators and on the active specialised doctors and nurses. Birth is generally planned in a birth centre which corresponds to expected newborn conditions, on the basis of pregnancy course; however newborn conditions may present a sudden unforeseen worsening, and therefore require a quick transfer to an upper <b>level</b> neonatal <b>unit.</b> In the present paper we build up a simulation model describing third level newborn generation and movement among existing assistance structure with the aim of detecting the whole assistance network critical points and to suggest suitable adaptation by resizing structure assistance capacities, both in the current situations and in future scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1 If we were {{to apply}} the testing {{techniques}} of object-oriented systems prescribed by the XUnit framework to a car factory, {{the result would be}} an inefficient process: A tire would be created, quality assured and then thrown away, only to be recreated later to test the functionality of the whole car. XUnit makes it difficult to reuse intermediate results of low <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> tests. As a consequence a higher <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> test is forced to recreate test scenarios which were already created by lower <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> tests. This duplicated testing effort is time-consuming both for setting up new scenarios and for running the tests. To address this problem we suggest a semi-automatic approach to compose tests. First we describe how we can detect candidates of composable test cases by partially ordering their sets of covered method signatures, then we present techniques to refactor unit tests accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Integrative {{levels of}} program {{comprehension}} describe {{the evolution of}} our knowledge about a program from low-level program elements through successive and higher orders of knowledge integration. In this paper, we motivate, define, and illustrate integrative levels as a technique to organize the knowledge that we acquire {{in the course of}} program maintenance. We differentiate between understanding in extension and understanding in intension. We define five intensional integrative levels of program comprehension, the element level, the percept level, the concept level, the subject level, and the domain <b>level.</b> The intensional <b>units</b> that make up these levels emerge and evolve in an iterative comprehension process that is active at each level. The iterations of this process comprise the four phases of lower <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> organization, <b>unit</b> integration, upper <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> organization, and unit validation. We demonstrate integrative levels of program comprehension using the object-oriented testing framework jUnit as a case study. 1...|$|R

The rationale of the CS is that migrants, during their everyday life, frequent a range of ‘aggregation centres’ (such as immigrant specific services, phone centres, churches, etc.), which can be used as first <b>level</b> <b>unit</b> of analysis to select migrants (the second <b>level</b> <b>unit).</b> The CS methodology provides a scheme to estimate a set of weights to correct the initial probability of inclusion in the sample (Fasani, 2008; Kraler & Vogel, 2008; Vogel & Kovacheva, 2008).|$|R
