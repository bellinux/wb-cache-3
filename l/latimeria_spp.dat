40|$|The three extant genera of {{lungfish}} (Order: Dipnoi), {{together with}} the coelacanth <b>Latimeria</b> <b>spp.,</b> represent the closest living relatives to the tetrapods and as such signify an important stage in vertebrate evolution. We have previously found that Neoceratodus forsteri possesses a duplex retina comprised of rods and three morphologically distinct types of cones. Cones are distributed non-homogeneously across the retina with increased density in the temporal region, indicating a forward facing visual axis subserving increased spatial resolution. The molecular evolution of the photoreceptor visual pigments was examined using RT-PCR on retinal cDNA from juvenile lungfish. All five vertebrate opsin families (LWS, SWS 1, SWS 2, RH 1 and RH 2) {{were found to be}} expressed. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the RH 1 opsin gene (using the neighbour-joining method) in N. forsteri and other vertebrates, including the African lungfish Protopterus spp., places the Dipnoi and coelacanth together as a sister group to the tetrapods with a bootstrap value of 99 %. Examination of the amino acid sequence of the N. forsteri RH 1 opsin gene reveals alanine at site 292 and tyrosine at site 261, both of which are important spectral tuning sites in other vertebrates. Substitutions at these sites have previously been shown to significantly shift the spectral sensitivity of the pigment to longer wavelengths, which would be an advantage in the long wavelength-transmitting riverine environment of the lungfish. In the closely-related coelacanth the RH 1 opsin gene possesses serine at site 292 and phenylalanine at site 261, which shift the maximal wavelength of the visual pigment into shorter wavelengths, an advantage in a short wavelength-rich marine environment. The mutation to serine within the coelacanth lineage is not present in amphibia and must have occurred after the divergence from Dipnoans. Molecular genetic studies of visual pigments in these extant “fossils” continue to further our understanding of the evolution of colour vision and tuning sensitivity in vertebrates.
