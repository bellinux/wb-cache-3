5|$|In Presbyterian {{worship the}} sermon, {{which could be}} several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that {{services}} tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was <b>lining</b> <b>out,</b> by which the precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.|$|E
5|$|The town's tram, {{trolleybus}} and {{bus fleet}} was always painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> until {{the outbreak of}} World War II. The buses were notable in that they never carried exterior advertisements, with the town's crest occupying the space between decks where other bus operators placed adverts; and they carried two green lights on the front, to enable the town's ratepayers to see at night {{which was one of}} the town's own buses and not one of those of a competitor. At local government reorganisation in April 1974, the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport. The former Corporation tram/bus garage in Melverley Street is still in use by First Greater Manchester.|$|E

50|$|Connecting a low-impedance load {{such as a}} {{loudspeaker}} (usually 4 to 8 Ω) to a <b>line</b> <b>out</b> will essentially short circuit the output circuit. Such loads are around 1/1000 the impedance a <b>line</b> <b>out</b> is designed to drive, so the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> is usually not designed to source the current that would be drawn by a 4 to 8 ohm load at normal <b>line</b> <b>out</b> signal voltages. The result will be very weak sound from the speaker and possibly a damaged <b>line</b> <b>out</b> circuit.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, Ó Sé won {{his seventh}} {{consecutive}} Munster title, before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in the All-Ireland final against Offaly. Kerry {{had an easy}} win with seven players combining for a great goal. He captured his fifth All-Ireland medal that day as Kerry won by 1-12 to 0-8.|$|E
25|$|Ó Sé {{captured}} {{his second}} Munster medal in 1976 before later <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> {{in his second}} All-Ireland final. Once again it was Dublin who provided the opposition.

Jimmy Keaveney converted a penalty to help Dublin to a 3-8 to 0-10 victory and defeat for Ó Sé.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} in 1986 ‘the Cats’ {{captured}} the National League before reclaiming the Leinster championship title from Offaly, although the team were defeated by Galway GAA in the All-Ireland semi-final. 1987 saw Kilkenny retain their Leinster crown before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in another All-Ireland final. An in-form Galway side defeated Kilkenny in a low-scoring encounter. The next three years saw Kilkenny once again cast out into the hurling wilderness. However, the legendary goalkeeper Ollie Walsh took over as manager {{at the turn of}} the decade. A National League title in 1990 was followed by a Leinster title and an All-Ireland final appearance in 1991. Unfortunately, Tipperary GAA defeated Kilkenny for the first time in twenty years to win the final. In 1992 Kilkenny retained their Leinster crown before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in the All-Ireland championship decider against Cork. The team played into a strong wind in the first-half. However, they emerged as the victors on a scoreline of 3–10 to 1–12. A third consecutive Leinster title was collected in 1993 before ‘the Cats’ made a third consecutive All-Ireland final appearance. On that occasion Kilkenny retained the Liam MacCarthy Cup by a margin of five points.|$|E
50|$|Clancy also <b>lined</b> <b>out</b> with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition.

25|$|In 1922, Kilkenny won its sixteenth Leinster title before later <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in the All-Ireland final against Tipperary. In an {{exciting}} game, Tipperary were winning by three points with three minutes remaining, but Kilkenny fought back to score two goals {{to secure the}} victory. It would be forty-five years before Kilkenny would beat Tipperary in the championship again. Further Leinster titles soon followed. In 1926, Kilkenny faced Cork on a snow-covered Croke Park in the All-Ireland final. However, victory on that occasion went to ‘the Rebels’.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Gaelic Psalter was {{produced}} by the Synod of Argyll. By 1658, the first fifty psalms had been translated into ballad metre due {{to the work of}} Dugald Campbell, John Stewart and Alexander McLaine. A manuscript of the final 100 psalms {{was produced}} in 1691 with the entire Gaelic psalter, with revisions to the 'first fifty' being produced in 1694. The Gaelic Metrical Psalms are used to this day in the Scottish Highland Presbyterian Churches where the practice of <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> is used, in accordance with the Westminster Assembly of Divines Directory for Public Worship. The corpus of tunes has shrunk over the years with only about twenty-four in general use.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} Ballyhale, County Kilkenny, Shefflin first played {{competitive}} hurling whilst at school in St. Kieran's College. He {{arrived on the}} inter-county scene {{at the age of}} seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> with the under-21 and intermediate sides. He made his senior debut during the 1999 league. Shefflin has since gone on to {{play a key role in}} the forwards for Kilkenny, and has won a record ten All-Ireland medals on the field of play as well as thirteen Leinster medals and six National Hurling League medals. The All-Ireland-winning captain in 2007, he has been an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions.|$|E

25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-seventeenth {{century that}} Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to {{maintain}} until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century. The adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643 meant that the Scots adopted the English Puritan dislike of set forms of worship. The recitation of the Creed, Lord's Prayer, Ten Commandments and Doxology were abandoned in favour of the lengthy sermon of the lecture. The centrality of the sermon meant that services tended to have a didactic and wordy in character. The only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was <b>lining</b> <b>out,</b> by which the precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 McCarthy's side fell to Tipperary in the Munster semi-final. The qualifiers {{proved a}} happy hunting ground for Waterford as they won {{every one of}} their games in the round robin and topped the group. The men from the Deise later gained revenge on Tipp in the All-Ireland quarter-final before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> against Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. Once again the game {{proved to be an}} {{exciting}} and close affair, with neither side gaining any huge lead. Cork led with just seconds remaining in the game when Donal Óg Cusack, Cork's goalkeeper, saved a '65' from going over the bar. The sliothar was subsequently cleared, and Cork won the game by just a single point. After the game McCarthy came in for some criticism, however, the players insisted that he was the men to lead them again for another season.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Kilkenny regained their Leinster crown before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in the All-Ireland final. Limerick {{provided}} the opposition once again. In a close game Kilkenny beat the Munster men {{by a single}} point. 1936 saw an All-Ireland rematch between Kilkenny and Limerick. However, on this occasion Limerick had the measure of ‘the Cats’ and trounced them by 5–6 to 1–5. The following year Kilkenny {{had a chance to}} redeem themselves in their third consecutive championship decider. This time Tipperary were the opponent. However, Kilkenny collapsed on the day and gave Tipp a seventeen-point victory. This looked like the end for the great Kilkenny team of the 1930s. However, two years later in 1939 the team was back in the All-Ireland final. On the day that World War II broke out ‘the Cats’ took on Cork at Croke Park. Both sides were level throughout much of the game, the climax of which was played in a fierce thunderstorm. Terry Leahy was the hero for Kilkenny as he scored the winning point in the dying seconds of the game. Kilkenny were back in the championship decider again in 1940, their fifth in six years. On this occasion an ageing Limerick team faced an ageing Kilkenny team, but it was the Munster men who had the upper hand and claimed the victory.|$|E

25|$|Kilkenny {{retained}} the Leinster Cup in 1958. However, in a {{change to the}} format of the championship, they were beaten by Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. A third consecutive Leinster title was captured in 1959. However, the All-Ireland final against Waterford ended in a draw. The replay saw a young Eddie Keher make his debut. However, victory went to Waterford. A National League victory in 1962 gave Kilkenny the impetus to recapture the provincial trophy in 1963. In the All-Ireland final Waterford fought back from being 11-points down. However, ‘the Cats’ won by two points. Victory in the Leinster final in 1964 allowed Kilkenny a straight passage into the All-Ireland final where they were hot favourites to retain the title. Tipp. However, had other ideas and captured the title with a fourteen-point victory. Two years later in 1966 Kilkenny won the National League once again. This was later followed by another provincial title and an appearance in the championship decider. Once again, Kilkenny were red hot favourites over a youthful Cork side. However, youth trumped experience as Cork emerged as the victors. 1967 saw Kilkenny win another Leinster title before <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> in their fourth All-Ireland final of the decade. An ageing Tipp team provided the opposition; however, Kilkenny got goals at vital times and secured a famous victory. It was Kilkenny’s first triumph over Tipp in the championship since 1923.|$|E
500|$|With his 11th {{consecutive}} Opening Day {{start on}} April 5, 2015, against the Cubs, Molina {{became the first}} catcher in club history to achieve this feat.

[...] Second baseman Neil Walker caught his line drive with two runners on, then threw to third baseman Jung-ho Kang to double up Jhonny Peralta for the second out. [...] Kang briefly pirouetted the ball in his hand, albeit confused, but threw back to Walker to tag Jason Heyward for the third out. [...] Molina's first home run of the season and first in 95 games occurred against the Minnesota Twins on June 15; his previous home run dated back to June 27, 2014.|$|E
500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{recorded}} music and radio, [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience. AllMusic lists more than 7,000 recordings including re-releases and compilations as of September 2011. Its first recording is an a cappella version from 1922 by the Sacred Harp Choir. It was included from 1926 to 1930 in Okeh Records' catalogue, which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz. Demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by H. R. Tomlin and J. M. Gates. A poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the 1940s and 1950s who used the song to remember their grandparents, traditions, and family roots. It was recorded with musical accompaniment {{for the first time}} in 1930 by Fiddlin' John Carson, although to another folk hymn named [...] "At the Cross", not to [...] "New Britain". [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles, often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> and call and response, that have been practiced in both black and white folk music.|$|E

500|$|The series {{moved to}} Philadelphia {{for the third}} game, and the Phillies {{capitalized}} on their home crowd immediately, scoring four runs {{in the first inning}} of the game. Lee continued his [...] "superb" [...] postseason performance with an eight-inning shutout performance, allowing three singles and a stolen base. Lee and his batterymate Ruiz had higher offensive production in Game 3 (three hits in six at-bats, three runs scored, one run batted in) than the entire Dodger lineup (three hits in twenty-seven at bats, no runs scored). The Phillies won the game, 11–0. In Game 4, Howard continued to slug, hitting a two-run home run off of former-Phillie Randy Wolf in the first inning; with the run batted in, he tied Lou Gehrig's Major League record of eight consecutive postseason games with an RBI. The Dodgers came back to score two runs on a defensive miscue in the fourth inning, adding one run in the fifth on a Matt Kemp home run and one in the sixth on a Casey Blake single. The Phillies got one back {{in the bottom of the}} sixth on a Victorino triple and a single by Utley, but were held scoreless until the bottom of the ninth. Los Angeles closer Broxton entered the game in the bottom of the eighth—after George Sherrill allowed two runners to reach base—and coaxed Werth to fly out. Broxton returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth, inducing a ground ball from Ibáñez before walking Matt Stairs and hitting Ruiz. Greg Dobbs pinch-hit for the pitcher's spot, <b>lining</b> <b>out</b> to third base. With two outs and two runners aboard, Jimmy Rollins hit a [...] fastball to the right-center field gap, scoring Eric Bruntlett (who had pinch-run) and Ruiz. In the fifth game, the Phillies hit four home runs, including two by Jayson Werth, as Hamels allowed three runs in his second start of the series. The Phillies bullpen pitched [...] innings in the game, allowing only one run as Philadelphia defeated Los Angeles, 10–4. The win clinched the Phillies' first consecutive National League pennants in franchise history, and the first back-to-back World Series appearances by a National League franchise since the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and 1996. Howard was named the MVP of the National League Championship Series.|$|E
