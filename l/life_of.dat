40|$|A notable {{way that}} social change affects {{personal}} quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> would {{rely on the}} person’s experience with social change. This experience may influence societal quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and quality <b>of</b> work <b>life,</b> which may in turn affect personal quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Additionally, the experience of social change is possibly less detrimental to personal quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> later {{in the presence of}} higher existing personal quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> These influences over time become transparent through a three-wave panel study of 531 working people in Hong Kong, China. Findings show that although social change experienced did not generally impair subsequent quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> it tended to be more detrimental to the person with lower quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> before. In addition, social change experienced tended to erode societal quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and quality <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> experienced, which appeared to be predictors of personal quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Hence, there are possible ways for social change to predict personal quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The {{conceptualization}} <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{in terms}} <b>of</b> geography {{is based on}} two assumptions. The first assumption is that the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> consists <b>of</b> two dimensions: subjective and objective.

The second assumption {{is based on the}} recognition that quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is always a spatial dimension. The concept <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is closely linked with the concept of a good life; geographers enriched this concept by using the term ‘good place’ as a place in which the conditions are created for a good <b>life.</b> The quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for individuals in terms of a good place overlaps with the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in society, namely the societal quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The geographical conceptualisation <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is applied to settlements within the city of Liberec...|$|R
