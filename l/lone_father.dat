5000|$|In {{the reality}} of Marvel Zombies, Magneto and his Acolytes were {{a few of the}} {{survivors}} following a plague that caused an undead-like effect in [...] "super-powered beings". It is revealed in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days that he and Fabian Cortez made a deal with an unknown entity from another universe to damage the Earth to let mutants become the dominant force. Though they believe it is the zombie Sentry, the zombified Reed Richards later hypothesizes that it was with an entirely different universe unrelated to the zombie plague, and that Sentry's arrival was a coincidence misleading Magneto into believing he had led to the Earth' ruin. [...] Regretful that he has doomed the entire planet and his Acolytes either dead or having retreated to Asteroid M, Magneto returns to earth to help any non-infected beings left. He eventually hides out {{with a small group of}} human survivors, a female cop, a <b>lone</b> <b>father</b> and his daughter. He saves Ultimate Reed Richards from the Zombies and brings him to their hideout, a subway station. Magneto acknowledges the irony of working with normal humans, but believing that [...] "Beggars can't be choosers when you're down to the last few people alive". Magneto learns the zombiefied Fantastic Four of his reality had tricked Reed, in a plan to allow the zombies to cross to Reed's universe for more victims. Reed and Magneto work together, first getting diabetic medicine for the young girl, then taking the civilians back to the dimensional teleporter that Reed had emerged from, although they require the aid of the rest of the Ultimate Fantastic Four to do so (It is interesting to note that Magneto is the first person outside of the team to explicitly refer to the Ultimate FF as 'superheroes'). After Richards escapes with all three of the civilian survivors and his teammates, Magneto stays behind, not wanting to die but acknowledging that he is the only one capable of destroying Richards' dimensional transporter so that the zombies won't infect Earth-1610.|$|E
40|$|Statute and {{practice}} relating to s. 31 part IV of The Children Act 1989 allow children subject to care orders {{to be placed}} {{at home with their}} parent(s). It is not uncommon for the courts to accept a plan for children to return home at the final hearing of care proceedings at which full care orders are granted. In such instances, children retain looked-after status but, in terms of their day-to-day care, are looked after by parent(s). Whilst there are a small number of studies conducted in the 1990 s relating to children ‘home on trial’, there is a much more limited recent literature. It is important to revisit this population of children, given current concerns about the burgeoning costs of child care proceedings and the looked-after children system (LAC). This paper reports on a small-scale exploratory study in one north-west local authority area. Consisting of a file study and interviews with parents and professionals, the study examines the factors that contributed to initial removal of children to public care, the impact of the LAC system for children ‘home on trial’, stability of placements at home, as well as issues to do with the discharge of care orders. Particular attention is drawn to <b>lone</b> <b>father</b> headed households, a social group over-represented in our sample. The study aims to inform further multi-location studies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of a Confucian Welfare Regime upon lone mothers in Taiwan, where the family is {{promoted}} as the major welfare provider for individuals. Since the 1980 s, politicians and welfare scholars [...] whether New Right or Third-Way [...] in the West, particularly in the UK, have been very keen to draw lessons from the Confucian Welfare Model in East Asia. The characteristics of this welfare regime are categorised as "conservative corporatism without Western-style worker participation, solidarity without equality, laissez-faire without libertarianism, far too much social control but too little citizenship, far too little state intervention in welfare provision but too much familial welfare responsibilities"(e. g., Jones 1993). The Confucian Welfare State is in fact much deeply familialised, and the family is "the super-major welfare provider" compared to Western welfare states. This thesis will examine the Confucian Welfare Regime from the point of views of gender, and will argue that its distinctive fractures cannot be understood within existing Western comparative typologies and have not been adequately analysed in East Asian studies. How do lone mothers meet their needs within this deeply familialised welfare regime in comparison with lone fathers? In search of an answer, a qualitative approach, a feminist perspective and an East Asian standpoint were employed to conduct this study in the form of semi-structured interviews in the Taiwanese Confucian social context. The participants included 30 lone mothers and 10 lone fathers with unmarried dependent children undertaking full-time education. The situation of lone parents in combining unpaid care work: and paid work makes them a strong case for understanding the gendering of welfare regimes in the West and in East Asia. Thus the Mother-Worker-Family-Outsider Welfare Regime is created on the basis of women's' status as lifetime family outsiders in the Taiwanese social context. An understanding of this specific Confucian cultural arena is essential if we are to appreciate the situation of lone mothers-and its difference from that of lone fathers-in Taiwan. The main findings of this study confirm that the deeply familialised welfare provision affects women and men differently under the Generation-Age-Gender hierarchy of the Confucian family. The family, as the main welfare provider, {{is more likely to be}} effective for lone fathers, who are provided with more accessible childcare, childrearing, housework services, housing, financial investment and resources. They also benefit more from this familial provision to support their continuous employment experience, better career prospects and better entitlement to employment protection. But, in contrast, for the lone mothers in this study, the Confucian family is more likely to be the centre of care responsibilities for young and old, the heart of endless unpaid housework, the battlefield of domestic confrontations and sexual harassment, and the alter of sacrifice of individual well-being. The failure of the family in welfare provision also worsens the situation of lone mothers in- the labour market in terms of interrupted career, -low, wages, lower position in 'occupational hierarchy, more dead-end jobs, and more part-time work, and no or less employment protection. As a consequence of these inequalities the solutions for lone mothers are very different from those for lone fathers in this study. Thus, <b>lone</b> <b>father</b> see the reconstitution of the family via remarriage as their best solution. The retreat from marriage and the family is preferred by most lone mothers, who maintain their current status permanently. And the strategies of improving their human capital via more advanced education, establishing self-employed small business and undertaking extra part-time jobs with full-time work are adopted in order to combine mothering and rice-winning. These disadvantages experienced by lone mothers, seldom by lone fathers, have to be taken seriously into account in response to lone mothers' hopes of being equal and permanent lone parents, fully protected workers and full individual citizens. Therefore, the Mother-Worker-Family-Outsider Welfare Model needs to be transformed into the Parent-Worker-Full-Individual-Citizen Welfare Model based on the notion of "full individual citizens as parents and workers" instead of "family outsiders as selectively protected workers and non-recognised parents", by shifting welfare responsibilities from the family and the market onto the State...|$|E

For {{a total of}} 682, 919 men, we analysed mortality from different causes (1991 - 2000) among <b>lone</b> <b>fathers,</b> with and without custody of their children, and among childless men, with and without partners. Long-term cohabiting fathers with a child in their household were used as comparison group. We employed data from Swedish censuses, national health-data registers, and a Swedish register containing information about known biological relations between children and parents. We investigated {{the extent to which}} different kinds of relations were influenced by varying socioeconomic circumstances between groups, and also processes of health selection. The results suggest that <b>lone</b> non-custodial <b>fathers</b> and <b>lone</b> childless men face the greatest increase in risks, especially from injury and addiction, and also from all-cause mortality and ischaemic heart disease. Being a <b>lone</b> custodial <b>father</b> also entails increased risk, although generally to a much lesser extent, and not for all outcomes. The elevated risks found in all the subgroups considered diminished substantially when proxy variables to control for health-selection effects and socioeconomic circumstances were added to the initial model.

Next, we analyze individual labor market transitions, using longitudinal data from administrative registers. The analyses demonstrate large differences in the labor market behaviors of single and nonsingle parents in Norway, even when controlling for differences in human capital and care responsibilities. Shifting labor demand and welfare reforms that prioritize paid work have both affected the employment of lone parents, but favorable economic conditions seem to have played a larger role than stringent social policies in increasing their employment activity.

40|$|The general aims of this {{dissertation}} are {{to analyse}} how family situation, and especially lone parenting, influence health and life chances in Sweden {{and the extent}} to which possible relations are influenced by socioeconomic circumstances and health selection. In two population-based cohort studies we analysed overall and cause-specific mortality (1991 - 95), and also severe morbidity (1991 - 94) from different causes among lone mothers in comparison with mothers with partners. Information on the mothers was obtained from the Swedish Population and Housing censuses of 1985 and 1990. The outcomes considered were death or utilisation of (overnight) hospital care, with data taken from population-based national health registers. In the analyses we adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic circumstances, such as socioeconomic status, country of birth, receipt of social-welfare benefit, and housing situation. To take health-selection effects into account, we adjusted for previous inpatient history (1987 - 90). Our findings suggest that lone motherhood entails health disadvantages with regard to mortality, severe morbidity and injury. Socioeconomic circumstances were found to play a major role in accounting for increased risks, but the risks are partly independent of both socioeconomic conditions and health selection into lone motherhood. In two further studies we analysed mortality (1991 - 98), severe morbidity and injury (1991 - 99), and also educational achievement (in 1998 at ages 24 - 25 of offspring), of children who had lived in lone-parent families in comparison with children in two-parent families. We mainly used data from the Swedish censuses and national health-data registers. Living in a lone parent family was found to be associated with increased risks of a variety of unfavourable outcomes: psychiatric disease, suicide/suicide attempt, injury, addiction, and low educational attainment. Relatively poor educational performance and also health disadvantages are explicable to a large extent by socioeconomic conditions, especially a lack of economic resources (as measured here by receipt of social-welfare benefit and having rented accommodation). Educational achievement among children varies with cause of lone parenthood, with the best prospects found among the children of widows/widowers. In a fifth study we analysed mortality from different causes (1991 - 2000) among <b>lone</b> <b>fathers</b> (fathers with and without custody of their children) and childless men (with and without partners) in comparison with cohabiting fathers with children in the household. For this purpose we linked information from the Swedish censuses of 1985 and 1990 to Sweden’s Multi-Generation Register (which contains information about all known biological relations between children and parents). <b>Lone</b> non-custodial <b>fathers</b> and <b>lone</b> childless men suffer from the most pronounced elevated risks, especially of death from injury or addiction, but also from all-cause mortality and death from ischaemic heart disease. Being a <b>lone</b> custodial <b>father</b> also seems to entail an increased mortality risk, although generally to a much lesser degree, and not for all outcomes studied. The elevated risks for all subgroups fell when variables assumed to control health selection and socioeconomic circumstances were introduced into the initial regression model employed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{theoretically}} {{guided by the}} ethics of care and sociological debates over structure and agency. The key areas explored are: the types of employment practices that men adopt which take account of fathering and how fathers negotiate domestic labour and childcare. Semi-structured interviews with twenty-four fathers from two public and private sector employers, explored these issues. These gathered men's accounts of their fathering practices. In addition, five key actor {{interviews were conducted with}} representatives from organisations with policy interests in this area. It was found that fathers' employment practices were organisationally patterned. For instance, managerial fathers internalised employers' demands. Fathers in public sector roles accessed flexitime, but its use was restricted by continuous service provision. Fathers without access to formal flexible working policies made informal and occasional arrangements. It emerged that fathers' involvement in care changed in response to children's development. Playing and routine caregiving were important forms of engagement for fathers of younger children. In contrast, fathers of adolescents facilitated their independence whilst providing guidance and helping with homework. In relation to fathers' involvement in domestic labour a diverse typology was presented. This ranged from fathers who left routine tasks to partners, to “sharers” and <b>lone</b> <b>fathers</b> with responsibility for domestic routines. Fathers' felt that partners' standards could obstruct their participation, but this was related to the ownership of tasks. Fathers' care could be fostered through a gendered policy awareness, with arrangements moving beyond children's early years. Domestic labour could be given weight as an area of policy intervention.

Background : The original objectives of the first MCS survey, as laid down in the proposal to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in March 2000, were: to chart the initial conditions of social, economic and health advantages and disadvantages facing children born {{at the start of}} the 21 st century, capturing information that the research community of the future will require to provide a basis for comparing patterns of development with the preceding cohorts (the National Child Development Study, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33004, and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study, held under GN 33229) to collect information on previously neglected topics, such as fathers' involvement in children's care and development to focus on parents as the most immediate elements of the children's 'background', charting their experience as mothers and fathers of newborn babies in the year 2000, recording how they (and any other children in the family) adapted to the newcomer, and what their aspirations for her/his future may be to emphasise intergenerational links including those back to the parents' own childhood to investigate the wider social ecology of the family, including social networks, civic engagement and community facilities and services, splicing in geo-coded data when available Additional objectives subsequently included for MCS were: to provide control cases for the national evaluation of Sure Start (a government programme intended to alleviate child poverty and social exclusion) to provide samples of adequate size to analyse and compare the smaller countries of the United Kingdom The first sweep (MCS 1) interviewed both mothers and (where resident) fathers (or father-figures) of infants included in the sample when the babies were nine months old, and the second sweep (MCS 2) was carried out with the same respondents when the children were three years of age. The third sweep (MCS 3) was conducted in 2006, when the children were aged five years old, the fourth sweep (MCS 4) in 2008, when they were seven years old, and the fifth sweep (MCS 5) in 2012 - 2013, when they were eleven years old. Sub-sample studies : Some studies based on sub-samples of MCS have also been conducted, including a study of MCS respondent mothers who had received assisted fertility treatment, conducted in 2003 (see SN 5559). Also, birth registration and maternity hospital episodes for the MCS respondents are held as a separate dataset (see SN 5614). Weighting : Users should note that the weighting section in the 'Guide to the Datasets' document recommends analysis in Stata, as SPSS is not currently able to weight the data using the survey design factors. The depositor is working on a solution for SPSS, but this is not yet available. A Stata version of the dataset is available for download by registered users, alongside the SPSS and tab-delimited versions. MCS web pages : Further information about the MCS can be found on the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. Latest edition : For the eleventh edition (December 2012), an updated version of the derived variables dataset was added to the study. Syntax was also run on the parents' dataset to remove some variables that had been updated and moved to the derived variables dataset (see list in the Read file for details). A new version of the Derived Variables User Guide and an updated Guide to the Datasets have been added to the documentation. Main Topics : Interviews were conducted with the baby's mother (or other main carer) and father (or other partner of main carer). The mother or main carer interviews covered ethnicity and language, the baby's <b>father,</b> <b>lone</b> parenthood, pregnancy, labour and delivery, baby's health and development, childcare, grandparents, friends and social support, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, housing, community and local services, time with and without the baby and other interests. The interview also included a self-completion element covering baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous relationships, domestic tasks, previous pregnancies, mental health, attitudes to relationships, parenting, work, etc. The father's or main carer's partner interviews covered ethnicity and language, father's involvement with the baby, lone parenthood, baby's mother (if not resident), grandparents and friends, parental health, education and training, employment and earnings, time with and without the baby and other interests. The self-completion element of the father's/main carer's partner interview covered baby's temperament and behaviour, relationship with partner, previous partners, previous children, mental health and attitudes to marriage, parenting and work. Either parent or carer could answer the household module questions, which covered household composition and relationships, children, employment status, caring responsibilities for the baby born in 2000 and language spoken at home. Standard Measures: Subsets and adaptations of the following measures were used: Denver Developmental Screening Test Carey Infant Temperament Scale Condon Maternal Attachment Questionnaire Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State Malaise Inventory Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory (RSE) Other variables were based on questions used in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (not currently held at the UKDA) and the National Child Development Study (NCDS) (held under GN 33004). Occupation was coded to Standard Occupational Classification 2000 (SOC 2000) and National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) long and short versions. <br...|$|R
40|$|Inequalities {{in health}} have been {{demonstrated}} for over 150 years in Britain, and in recent decades have {{been the focus of}} increasing policy attention. However in order to tackle inequalities in health {{there needs to be a}} clear understanding of their underlying causes. Unfortunately, the existing literature often uses different measures of socioeconomic status (SES) interchangeably; or, pays little attention to how they are measured; is still mainly based on cross-sectional data; and, tends to ‘explain away’ associations by adjusting for numerous confounders. These characteristics are unhelpful in elucidating causal processes and hence identifying mechanisms for reducing inequalities. The set of papers presented here aimed to address these issues by focusing explicitly on the role of income in creating health inequalities in order to develop a better understanding of how policies might potentially use income as a means of reducing the health divide. The first paper based on the General Household Survey (GHS) examined the cross-sectional association between income and health. In comparison to the ‘gold standard’– net equivalent household income - other income measures tended to underestimate the strength of the association at the lower end of the distribution, as did imposing a linear function on it, when non-linear functions performed better statistically. The association was stronger for long-term measures of health status than for recent measures of health state. We also investigated the relative importance of different measures of SES for health, and found that income had a stronger association with all measures of health than did occupational class and education, but a similar association to measures of consumption based on tenure and car ownership. In the second paper, I analysed GHS data to explore the health of a particularly disadvantaged group in the UK – lone parents – and the extent to which low income might be the cause of their health disadvantage. Both <b>lone</b> mothers and <b>fathers,</b> compared to couple parents, had higher risk of ill health, across a range of measures, and income and other material resources accounted for one third to a half of this, depending on the health outcome. I also explored other possible explanations, such as health selection, other social support and length of time as a lone parent, although these analyses were limited by the data available and the cross-sectional nature of the study. The remainder of the papers employed longitudinal data to explore more effectively the relationship between income and health by considering its association over time. The third paper was the first British paper to examine income dynamics and health. Using six years of data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) we found a non-linear association between income and subsequent health, controlling for prior health. Average income, and persistent poverty, across five years were more strongly associated with subsequent overall subjective health and limiting longstanding illness, while current income was more important for recent illness and psychosocial distress (measured by the General Health Questionnaire). Decreases in income were associated with raised health risk, but increases did not lead to reduced health problems. Income volatility (i. e. the size of change irrespective of direction) was also associated with health. Controlling for prior health and measuring income before the health outcome both suggested that the association between income and health may be causal. However, it is important to understand income’s role in broader causal pathways. Paper Four employed both the BHPS and the 1958 birth cohort (National Child Development Study (NCDS)) to examine the role of income in childhood and adulthood for health. Analyses of the NCDS showed that childhood income influenced adult health only indirectly through ‘health capital’ and income potential (education) at age 23. However, in the BHPS, having controlled for earlier health and education and the key social roles – parenting, marriage and employment - that determine income levels, average adult income over five years was still a significant predictor of subsequent health, although childhood SES measures were not. This paper included a policy analysis to assess the effectiveness of policies to reduce health inequalities and found not only that they would have a modest impact, but also that they could worsen inequalities for some groups in society. The final paper examined the inter-relationships in adulthood between a key cause of income change, income and health. Using 10 years of BHPS data, we examined the extent to which financial difficulties mediated the association between employment change and health. There were complex relationships depending on gender and prior circumstances. Moving out of employment into unemployment increased psychosocial distress, while moving back from unemployment to work improved it. Men retiring from non-manual jobs experienced an improvement in their mental health, while the health of those retiring from manual jobs declined. Women leaving work for family roles experienced a decline in their mental health, while moving back to work did not significantly improve it. Financial difficulties mediated these associations, attenuating the effects by approximately 30 % for men and 16 % for women. This paper demonstrated the complexity of many associations between SES and health over time, and the importance of considering them within appropriate pathways. Overall these papers were among the first to consider the association between income and health over time, and within a lifecourse setting; to investigate issues of income measurement and functional form; and, to compare the relative importance of income with other SES measures. In doing this, I considered how the associations varied by health outcome, by gender and at different life stages, and according to whether or not respondents were from manual or non-manual backgrounds or had pre-existing health conditions. Taken together the papers clearly demonstrate a non-linear relationship between income and health, with the steepest associations at the lower end of the distribution. They show that income is part of the pathway between social roles and health, but that it is not the whole explanation. All of this suggests that low income is an important cause of health inequalities and hence fiscal policies to improve the incomes of the poorest in society are a potential mechanism for reducing the health divide...|$|R
