50|$|Memory {{dependence}} {{prediction is}} a technique, employed by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors that execute memory access operations (<b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores at instruction execution time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to speculatively execute certain <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores out of order, while preventing other <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the pipeline, memory disambiguation techniques {{are used to}} determine if the <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> unloading ramps where {{water and food}} are provided to the elk.

These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

40|$|A three-bay, space, {{cantilever}} truss is probabilistically evaluated {{to quantify}} the range of uncertainties of buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> member forces due to nonuniform thermal <b>loads,</b> applied <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> moments (mechanical <b>loads),</b> <b>and</b> combination of both. The truss members {{are assumed to be}} made from (1) aluminum tubes or (2) high modulus graphite-fiber/intermediate modulus epoxy-matrix composite tubes. Cumulative distribution function results show that certain combinations of thermal loads with mechanical loads reduce the probabilistic buckling <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> increase the magnitude of the member axial forces for aluminum truss. However, the reverse is true for composite truss due to very low coefficient of thermal expansion and higher stiffness of the composite. Finally, the sensitivities associated with the uncertainties in the structural, material, <b>and</b> <b>load</b> variables (primitive variables) are investigated.
