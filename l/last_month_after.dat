30|$|Next, we {{estimate}} a rough recovery {{time by the}} following two steps: we first average the resonance frequencies measured from all the spectral ratios traces with PGA < 100 Gal {{in the last month}} of data (07 / 12 / 2011 – 08 / 12 / 2011), and then we find the time point when the resonance frequency recover to 95 % of the average resonance frequency in the last month. As shown in Fig. 4, the obtained time corresponds to the point where most (95 %) of the co-seismic changes were recovered. In addition, we find that the average values in the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>after</b> the main shock are always lower than those before the main shock. Hence, it is possible that either lower-amplitude longer-term recovery exists, and may continue after our analysis time period, or a permanent change occurs and will never return to the pre-main shock level.|$|E
40|$|A {{new report}} adds to {{evidence}} about why some countries are more “mobile” than others, writes Peter Browne in Inside Story <b>LAST</b> <b>MONTH,</b> <b>after</b> Barack Obama invoked the American Dream at Wakefield High School in Virginia, Inside Story {{looked at what}} the statistics show about social mobility in western countries. Although a family’s socioeconomic status invariably influences children’s prospects, the data revealed the influence to be large and inequitable in some countries. In France, Italy, Britain and the United States, family background plays a very significant role in determining adult income; in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Canada the effect is much smaller. Australia falls somewhere in between, closer to Denmark than to the United States. This puts the United States {{among a group of}} countries that are regarded as class-bound and stifling of individual initiative. Our main source was a report by Anna Cristina d’Addio, a researcher in the OECD’s Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs. Now, two researchers in the organisation’s Economics Department, Orsetta Causa and Asa Johansson, have released a new report that takes account of additional research and analysis. Their broad conclusion is very similar to d’Addio’s. The more equal the socioeconomic and educational backgrounds of children in a given country, the greater the degree of social mobility – which, from an economist’s perspective, is not only fairer but also more efficient. Causa and Johansson use three main indicators – wages, secondary school achievement and post-secondary education achievement – to compare mobility across countries. Although the rankings are not identical for each indicator, these differences don’t cut across the clear messages coming out of the data [...] .

40|$|Autobiographical {{memory is}} {{commonly}} impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, {{little is known}} about the very recent past which is though highly important in daily life adaptation. In addition, the impact of sleep disturbances, also frequently reported in AD, on the consolidation and retrieval of autobiographical memories remains to be assessed. Using an adaptation of the TEMPau task, we investigated the neural substrates of autobiographical memory for recent events and the potential relationship with sleep in 14 patients with mild AD. On day 1, autobiographical memory was explored across 3 periods: remote (18 - 30 years), the last two years and the <b>last</b> <b>month.</b> <b>After</b> testing, sleep was recorded using polysomnography. The next day, AD patients benefited a resting state 18 FDG-PET scan and a second exploration of autobiographical memory, focusing on the very recent past (today and yesterday). Total recall and episodic recall scores were obtained. In addition, for all events recalled, Remember responses justified by specific factual, spatial and temporal details were measured using the Remember/Know paradigm. Retrieval of autobiographical memories was impaired in AD, but recall of young adulthood and very recent events was relatively better compared to the two intermediate periods. Recall of recent events (experienced the day and the day preceding the assessment) was correlated with brain glucose consumption in the precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, the calcarine region, the angular gyrus and lateral temporal areas. AD patients also provided more Justified Remember responses for events experienced the previous day than for those experienced the day of the assessment. Moreover, Justified Remember responses obtained for events experienced before sleep were positively correlated with the amount of slow-wave sleep. These data provide the first evidence of an association between the ability to retrieve recent autobiographical memories and sleep in mild AD patients...|$|E
