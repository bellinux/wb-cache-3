25|$|The Palais-Royal in Paris, {{which opened}} to the public in 1784 and {{became one of the most}} {{important}} marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades. The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewelry, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favorite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building. London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset. Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall.|$|E

2500|$|A 1908 {{paper by}} Geiger, On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter, {{describes}} the following experiment. He constructed a <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> tube, nearly two meters in length. [...] At {{one end of}} the tube was a quantity of [...] "radium emanation" [...] (R) that served as a source of alpha particles. [...] The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). [...] In the middle of the tube was a 0.9mm-wide slit. [...] The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. [...] A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. [...] Geiger pumped all the air out of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. [...] Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. [...] Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some gold foil over the slit at AA. [...] This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out. [...] This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. [...] The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection. [...] Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger angles—perhaps larger than 90°.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrilling induced in fibre {{reinforced}} polymer {{resulted in}} {{high rate of}} parts rejection and thus affects the in-service performance of the composite product. Therefore, the tensile testing of hybrid composite with drilled holes is necessary to render them satisfaction in industrial application. The objective of the present research is to develop long kenaf composites and <b>long</b> kenaf/woven <b>glass</b> reinforced polyester resin composites. The tensile properties of those composites with drilled holes were investigated. The measurements {{were taken from the}} residual tensile strength of impacted specimens and the open hole specimens. From there, the damage area of the composites could be predicted. It is found that the long kenaf composite was more notch sensitive than <b>long</b> kenaf/woven <b>glass</b> hybrid composite. The hybrid composite was stronger than long kenaf composite. However, the damage progression mechanisms in the two materials were similar. Failure for both kenaf composite and <b>long</b> kenaf/woven <b>glass</b> hybrid composite started around the hole. The polymer matrix failed initially followed by fibre–matrix debonding...|$|R
