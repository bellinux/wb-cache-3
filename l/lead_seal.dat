Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{improved}} in the 1930s and riders {{were allowed to}} accept a rain jacket, a spare tyre and a pump, but only in an emergency and at the judges' discretion. A change of bike was allowed only if a frame, wheel or handlebar broke, but riders were still expected to ride with spare tyres and a pump. Riders in the 1940s had to hand their bikes to officials {{the day before the}} race to have them identified with a <b>lead</b> <b>seal,</b> later with a ring similar to that fitted to racing pigeons. In that way the judges, or commissaires, could see if a rider had illegally changed bikes.|$|E
25|$|In 1384 Archibald {{attacked}} and took Lochmaben Castle, the last English stronghold in south-west Scotland, and in 1388 he inherited {{the title of}} 3rd Earl of Douglas. He thus became the most powerful magnate in the country, controlling lands across southern Scotland and castles including Douglas Castle and Bothwell Castle in Lanarkshire. He funded a rebuilding of Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, and contracted marriages for his children with the offspring of King Robert III. Although he probably spent relatively little time at Threave, he died there in 1400, the first historical reference to the castle. He was succeeded by his son Archibald, who in 1390 had married Princess Margaret, daughter of Robert III. In 1424 he led a Scottish force to fight the English in France where he was killed at the Battle of Verneuil. His wife Margaret took on the Lordship of Galloway on Archibald's death, and ruled from Threave as Countess of Douglas and Duchess of Touraine for the next 23 years, outliving her son and grandsons. In 1449 {{she was forced to}} cede Galloway to the 8th Earl of Douglas, and died at Threave soon after. Her monument stands in Lincluden Collegiate Church. A <b>lead</b> <b>seal</b> matrix made for Margaret was recovered during archaeological excavations at Threave. The seal shows her coat of arms, combining the arms of her husband with the Royal Arms of her father Robert III. Although a rare survival, the workmanship is poor suggesting {{it may have been a}} trial piece or even a forgery.|$|E

500|$|O'Neill {{states that}} bin Laden was {{standing}} behind a woman with {{his hands on her}} shoulders, pushing her forward. O'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor. Matt Bissonnette, who entered the room at about the same time, also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. Simultaneously, in these versions, one of bin Laden's wives, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah is said to have screamed at the SEALs in Arabic and motioned as if she were about to charge. The <b>lead</b> <b>SEAL</b> shot her in the leg, then grabbed both women and shoved them aside. The weapon used to kill bin Laden was an HK416 allegedly using 5.56mm NATO 77-grain OTM (open-tip match) rounds made by Black Hills Ammunition.

In the case of Russian icons, it is possible to discriminate between an Au-Ag bilayer and an alloy of these metals in the gilds. However, when applied to <b>lead</b> <b>seals</b> RBS with protons encounters a significant limitation due to some deficiency in the available computer programs used for spectrum processing.

40|$|Present {{article is}} devoted to {{studying}} functions of logothetes of the herds and comes of the stable. These two posts of the Byzantium administrative system were responsible for maintenance of army and an imperial court horses and cartage. The author used following historical sources: taktikons of IX–X centuries, {{and first of all}} Kletorologion of Philotheos, composition of Constantine Porphyrogenitus “De Ceremoniis” and data of <b>lead</b> <b>seals.</b> It is necessary to note, that the last group of sources was not involved in studying the present posts until now. Conclusions of the author boil down to the following: Comes of the imperial stable is a military post, whose basic functions consist in management and the organization of material maintenance of the cartage in an imperial transport during a military campaign. Logothetes of the herds was the department head which was responsible for cultivation of horses and draft animals for army and public services, otherwise, was an economic establishment. Structures of staffs of both departments and functions of each official have been specified. In XI century titles of logothetes of the herds and comes of the stable, according to <b>lead</b> <b>seals,</b> essentially increase, often there are cases of overlapping of two posts in one person...|$|R
