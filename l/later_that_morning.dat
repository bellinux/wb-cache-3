5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 7, the eye began to {{reappear}} and the storm turned towards the northwest and the foreword motion began to rapidly increase. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> Florence had developed a large, 35 to 40mi (55 to 65km/h) wide eye and the foreword motion continued to increase. The intensification continued and by the afternoon hours, Florence was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h). A strong extratropical cyclone located {{to the north of}} Florence was causing the storm to move towards the northwest at a rapid pace of 30mph (48km/h). Operationally, Florence was reported to have peaked at that intensity, but post season analysis determined that the storm reached its peak intensity just short of major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherstatus late on November 7. By {{the morning of}} November 8, Florence weakened slightly to Category 1 status. The large system to the north continued to cause Florence to move at 58mph (93km/h). Since the storm was very close to a cold front, Florence was expected to rapidly transition into an extratropical cyclone. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>morning,</b> Florence was absorbed into the extratropical cyclone while still maintaining hurricane-force winds.|$|E

5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th.
