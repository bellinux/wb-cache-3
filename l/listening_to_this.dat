She began <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> type of music when studying in Switzerland.

While doing her homework, she liked to listen to classical music on a radio and kept her love of it.|$|E
500|$|Geographically, {{the city}} of Varanasi is {{situated}} on the Ganges river, where two small, mostly dry rivers named Varana and Asi join the Ganges. Metaphorically, the text adds, Varana is named as it wards off errors of organs (Varayati), and Nasi is named as it destroys the sins committed by one's organs (Nasayati). Atri, after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> metaphorical answer, repeats his question, with [...] "but where is this place of Avimuktam?" [...] Yajnavalkya replies that Avimuktam is already within Atri, [...] "where his nose and eye brows meet, for there is {{the place of the}} world of heaven and highest world of Brahman." [...] This Avimuktam is the [...] "abode of Brahman".|$|E

[...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head tilted back and her eyes closed holding a cigarette between her lips. It prompted a mixed reaction from Sarah Anne Hughes for The Washington Post; while she noted that Rihanna looks [...] "perfectly coiffed," [...] she criticized the inclusion of the cigarette, and called it a [...] "social taboo." ...|$|E

500|$|... "So Appalled" [...] {{received}} mostly favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. [...] David Browne of Time {{wrote that he}} felt that the track was [...] "built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings" [...] and that it sounded as if West was [...] "marching into the apocalypse." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West's album Late Registration which found West [...] "inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks". He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song [...] "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] alone [...] "carry enough auditory sugar to make <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand." ...|$|E

RPGFan said [...] "the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside {{the context of the}} game.

[...] Game Revolution in its game review praised as one of the [...] "most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an ear drum used to be."

500|$|In the Adhyatma Ramayana, while Tara wails {{over the}} death of Vali, Rama preaches to her, saying that the body is ephemeral, while only the soul is eternal; he tells her she should not grieve over the decay of Vali's body. Tara {{questions}} him asking [...] "if the body is destructible, why does one feel pleasure and pain". Rama informs her that due to ahamkara (egoism) the mind is chained in bondage to desires. He declares that Tara will remain untouched by karma and be emancipated from the bondage of life. Having heard his sermon, and because she had been devoted to him in a previous birth, Tara thus becomes free of egoism and undergoes self-realization. This discourse of Rama also appears in Tulsidas's Ramacharitamanasa, but it is curtailed to just two verses and is possibly borrowed from the former text. Rama says that the body is perishable, but the soul is immortal and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> the enlightened Tara bows to Rama and gains the boon of supreme devotion.|$|E

Michelle Morgante from The Boston Globe picked the song {{as an example of}} Shakira's [...] "new merengue-rock hybrid that lays down bare horn riffs over a driving beat in a groove that is irresistible". Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a [...] "cheap keyboard that drives the tune reminds us of music played at weddings and quinceañeras". In 2013, Latina included [...] "Addicted to You" [...] on their list of [...] "The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish" [...] and commented that [...] "If non-Spanish speakers can’t pick up the language after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> track, then we feel bad for you, son". At the 28th International Dance Music Awards held in 2013, [...] "Addicted to You" [...] was nominated for [...] "Best Latin Dance Track". It was also nominated at the 2013 Billboard Latin Music Awards for Latin Pop Song of the Year. El Cata received an ASCAP Latin award at the Pop category for his composition of the song.|$|E
500|$|The new {{building}} opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest {{hotel in the}} world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one third of which were leased as private residences. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: [...] "The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality...marks the measure of nation's growth in power, in comfort and in artistry...an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation". There were 2,000 people in the ballroom <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> speech, {{but by the end of}} the business day, the 2,200-room hotel had only 500 occupancies. It was not until 1939 that the Waldorf-Astoria began operating at a profit. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure who Tony Rey referred to as [...] "the greatest hotelman of his era". Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf-Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947.|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers around your {{pulsating}} heart, rips it from your chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E

2500|$|Thirteen {{years after}} {{entering}} music in Vietnam, Thu Minh suddenly changed her music and style remarkably to dance-pop. The albums Ruby - Sixth Sense and Body Language are two outstanding products in this period. Arts Council's Gold Album album reviews Ruby - Sixth Sense thus: Thu Minh is an album worth <b>listening</b> <b>to.</b> <b>This</b> is a music production color consistency from music to content, and images {{at the same}} nonetheless modern and professional. The new combination of Thu Minh and Minh Khang has created strange colors and new album. With Body Language, the album is considered [...] "rich rhythmic, youthful," [...] modern civilization [...] ", the majority of content is subject to social, new tunes but close" [...] appears as [...] "breath of fresh air and practical contribution {{to the development of}} dance-pop in Vietnam". The album was nominated for Artist of the Year category at the dedication.|$|E
2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, but what a mood it is. The feeling that you get while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.” Adding, “If there are any problems that some may have with this new album {{it is going to}} be the same thing that is going to make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A score soundtrack {{was also}} released, on April 19, 2011 by Varèse Sarabande. The Scream 4 score was yet again {{developed}} by Marco Beltrami. It received mixed reviews. Filmtracks stating that [...] "Despite the memorable history Beltrami has afforded the franchise musically, Scream 4 is a substantially disappointing {{continuation of the}} narrative. He and four assistant composers handle the 2011 entry from a purely functional stance, tackling individual scenes with stylistic remnants of the previous scores while accomplishing absolutely nothing new." [...] Soundtrack-review site Sountrackgeek gave the score a highly favorable review: [...] "It is possibly the best score in the Scream series, {{because it is so}} incredibly forceful. It wants to be full of action and chills and it is. It's not the scariest of scores, but Scream has never been about the moody scares, but rather the surprise scare and crazy fight/chase scenes. It succeeds and I had a blast <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> from start to finish." ...|$|E
