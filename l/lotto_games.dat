5000|$|Dream Number was {{launched}} on 15 July 2006. It involved a random seven digit number generated {{for entry into}} the main draw. It was played independently of Lotto, or if played with Lotto one Dream Number was generated per ticket, not per Lotto entry. The cost of entry was £1. A dream number was printed on every Lotto ticket bought, whether the player had chosen to enter it into the draw or not. Unlike other <b>Lotto</b> <b>games,</b> {{it was not possible}} to choose the number entered, and the order that the numbers were drawn was significant, as the numbers had to be matched in the same order for the player to win. Players had to match with the first number in order to start winning prizes (ranging from £2 to £500,000), which meant that 90% of players lost as soon as the first ball was drawn. Draws took place on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but only the Saturday draw was televised. The Wednesday draw took place prior to the live TV show and the winning dream number was announced during the show. All money raised for good causes from Dream Number went towards the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. The National Lottery closed the Dream Number game on Wednesday 9 February 2011, which was also the date of the last Dream Number draw. It was then replaced by Lotto Plus 5.|$|E

By exploiting some basic stylized facts about the prize distribution of <b>lotto</b> <b>games,</b> a number of restrictions on preferences are found. The value function must be globally concave over the domain of positive prizes offered by the lottery, and the probability weighting function concave for low probabilities in the gain domain and concave in average for low probabilities in the loss domain.

40|$|In February, 2005 the Spanish National Lottery Agency (LAE) {{made several}} {{modifications}} {{to the design of}} one of its <b>lotto</b> <b>games.</b> The entry fee was not changed but the familiar 6 / 49 format was replaced by 5 / 54 + 1 / 10. This considerably lengthened the odds against winning a share of the grand prize. However, extra lower tiers of prizes were added and a guaranteed jackpot of € 5 m introduced. The change in rules provides an unusual opportunity to study the effect on sales of features of <b>lotto</b> <b>games</b> other than entry fee and pay-back rate. The changes in design appear in this case to have allowed the operator to achieve higher and more stable sales. Reasons for this are explored through estimation of demand models.

40|$|Lotteries {{are found}} in {{nearly half of the}} world's countries, with annual {{worldwide}} lottery ticket sales topping $ 115 billion. Despite the global presence of lottery games, there has been little research conducted on any international aspect of lotteries. This paper presents the first-ever examination and comparison of lottery games from around the world. Differences in both absolute and relative lottery expenditures are presented. Estimates for the income elasticity of demand for lottery tickets provide evidence on the distributional burden of lottery expenditures. These estimates consider each country by continental location and country income level. Further analysis reveals that lower income countries could adopt <b>Lotto</b> <b>games</b> in order to increase revenues. Recognizing that the distributional impact of lottery games {{is one of the greatest}} concerns surrounding lotteries, it is shown that the introduction of <b>Lotto</b> <b>games</b> does not significantly affect the distributional burden of lottery ticket expenditures.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the problem of}} optimal dynamic choice in discrete time for an investor. In each period the investor is faced {{with one or more}} risky investments. The maximization of the expected logarithm of the period by period wealth, referred to as the Kelly criterion, is a very desirable investment procedure. It has many attractive properties, such as maximizing the asymptotic rate of growth of the investor's fortune. On the other hand, instead of focusing on maximal growth, one can develop strategies based on maximum security. For example, one can minimize the ruin probability subject to making a positive return or compute a confidence level of increasing the investor's initial fortune to a given final wealth goal. This paper is concerned with methods to combine these two approaches. We derive computational formulas for a variety of growth and security measures. Utilizing fractional Kelly strategies, we can develop a complete tradeoff of growth versus security. The theory is applicable to favorable investment situations such as blackjack, horseracing, <b>lotto</b> <b>games,</b> index and commodity futures and options trading. The results provide insight into how one should properly invest in these situations. capital accumulation, fractional kelly strategies, effective growth-security tradeoff, blackjack, horseracing, <b>lotto</b> <b>games,</b> turn of the year effect...|$|E

Despite this, we still know relatively little about the nature of lottery regressivity. I use a new dataset on Powerball lotto sales to analyze how regressivity varies with jackpot size within a single lotto game.

An out-of-sample extrapolation of these results suggest that the lottery becomes progressive at a jackpot around $ 806 million.

40|$|Abstract- A {{number of}} studies have at-tempted to {{estimate}} demand functions for state-operated lottery games, usually with quarter/y or annual data. A few in-clude the price of a lottery bet as an in-dependent variable, with generally unsat-isfactory results. This is because the price of a lottery bet will be roughly constant over quarterly or annual time intervals. Focusing on one type of lottery game (lottos), we show that if the demand for betting on lottos is estimated on a draw-ing-by-drawing basis, a price variable can be included on the right-hand side. Doing so allows us to estimate a true demand function and to compute price elasticities. As a result, we can evaluate the extent to which state lottery agencies have struc-tured their <b>lotto</b> <b>games</b> so as to maximize tax revenues. INTRODUCIION In 1980, 14 states generated $ 1. 19 billion in net revenue from their lotteries. By 1990, the 32 states with lotteries gener-ated $ 8. 54 billion in net revenue.
