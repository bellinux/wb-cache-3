5|$|President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson {{declared}} April 7 {{a national}} day of mourning {{for the civil}} rights leader.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in spending {{was more than}} under any predecessor since <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson. The number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91,196.|$|E
5|$|The first African American {{appointed}} to the Court was Thurgood Marshall, appointed by <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson in 1967. The second was Clarence Thomas, appointed by George H. W. Bush to succeed Marshall in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} {{election}}. The final election results gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes cast. His large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson for President in the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{center in}} Houston has {{its origins in}} the Space Task Group which {{directed}} its first manned spaceflight program, Project Mercury. In 1961, it grew into a bigger organization as the Manned Spacecraft Center, and in 1962 moved into a newly built campus on land donated by Rice University. It was renamed the <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson Space Center (JSC) in honor of Texas U.S. Senator, Vice President, and President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson in 1973, the year Johnson died. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson played a decisive role in passage of the legislation which created NASA in 1958. JSC contains the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States, and directed all Space Shuttle missions and activities aboard the International Space Station. The visitor's center of JSC is Space Center Houston.|$|E
5|$|Ranch Road 1 {{begins at}} US 290 {{on the west}} side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route {{continues}} along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson National Historical Park, before entering <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B</b> Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route turns away from the riverbank to the southeast returning to US 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.|$|E
5|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC) {{located in}} Southeast Houston, sits as {{the crown jewel}} of Texas's {{aeronautics}} industry. Fort Worth hosts both Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division and Bell Helicopter Textron. Lockheed builds the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program, and its successor, the F-35 Lightning II in Fort Worth.|$|E
5|$|The current design, {{depicting}} a basketball over a hoop and basket, was first awarded in 1977 still under its original name, which was changed {{in honor of}} former NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien who served from 1975 to 1984. Before joining the NBA, O'Brien was the United States Postmaster General under President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson from 1965 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{run up to}} the 1968 presidential {{election}} saw the incumbent president, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, serving {{during a period of}} great social unrest. There were riots in the major cities despite Johnson's attempts to introduce anti-poverty and anti-discrimination legislation, and there was significant opposition to the ongoing military action in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Under Presidents <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the United States Department of Justice {{determined}} {{that it did not}} matter when Congress passed legislation increasing the salary for an office, so long as the former member of Congress was nominated before the salary increase went into effect.|$|E
5|$|Bertram Thomas Combs (August 13, 1911December 4, 1991) was an American jurist and {{politician}} {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. After {{serving on the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, he was elected the 50th Governor of Kentucky in 1959 on his second run for the office. Following his gubernatorial term, he {{was appointed to the}} Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, serving from 1967 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the 1964 Democratic ticket if Kennedy had lived. In her 1968 book Kennedy and Johnson she reported that Kennedy, told her that <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson would be replaced as Vice President.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his feature photographs, Grant {{was known for his}} work accompanying hard news stories. Grant photographed every U.S. president and vice president starting with Harry S. Truman and through the administration of George H. W. Bush. He was present for the 1961 funeral for three-time House Speaker Sam Rayburn, where he captured former Presidents Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Kennedy, House Parliamentarian Clarence Cannon, and Vice President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson standing together.|$|E
5|$|Juskalian {{returned}} to the United States in August 1964 and was posted to headquarters of Military District of Washington (MDW) as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, his last Army assignment before retirement. During his three years at MDW, he {{served as chairman of}} the Joint Military Executive Committee that was chiefly responsible for planning and carrying out all arrangements for the participation of military services in the inauguration of President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson in January 1965.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston {{is home to}} the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, {{where all}} flight control is managed for manned space missions. JSC is the lead NASA center for {{activities}} regarding the International Space Station and also houses the NASA Astronaut Corps that selects, trains, and provides astronauts as crew members for US and international space missions.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{solicited}} MacArthur's {{counsel in}} 1961. The {{first of two}} meetings was held shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems {{should be given a}} much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Space Center Houston is the {{official}} visitors' center of NASA's <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson Space Center. The Space Center has many interactive exhibits including moon rocks, a shuttle simulator, and presentations {{about the history of}} NASA's manned space flight program. Other tourist attractions include the Galleria (Texas's largest shopping mall, located in the Uptown District), Old Market Square, the Downtown Aquarium, and Sam Houston Race Park.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{prompted}} {{debate within}} the administration of United States President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson. Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam {{and the introduction of}} American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{report of}} casualties {{came in a}} special message by President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson sent to Congress on January 30, 1967. In the message, the president said 80 people {{had died in the}} smog. Johnson did not cite a source of that claim, and there is no known source concluding that 80 people died, other than those citing Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The fair {{was visited}} {{by many of}} the most notable people at the time, {{including}} Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, Princess Grace of Monaco, Jacqueline Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Ethiopia's emperor Haile Selassie, Charles de Gaulle, Bing Crosby, Harry Belafonte, Maurice Chevalier, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Marlene Dietrich. Musicians like Thelonious Monk, Grateful Dead, Tiny Tim, The Tokens and Jefferson Airplane entertained the crowds.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, {{due in large}} part to the support of President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln is not {{the only}} Lincoln ghost {{witnesses}} claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to have talked to him).|$|E
5|$|After {{lying in}} state for thirty-four {{hours in the}} Capitol rotunda, a state funeral service was {{conducted}} at the Washington National Cathedral on June 11, the day when President George W. Bush declared a national day of mourning. Later that day, after the service, Reagan's casket was transported back to California for interment at the Reagan Presidential Library. The state funeral was executed by the Military District of Washington (MDW) {{and was the first}} since that of <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson in 1973. Richard Nixon, who presided over Johnson's funeral, declined to have a state funeral in 1994. Reagan was the first U.S. former president to die in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a strategy, the aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Following the flight, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson asked Armstrong and {{his wife}} {{to take part in}} a 24-day {{goodwill}} tour of South America. Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, George Low, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong impressed dignitaries by greeting them in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born Alberto Santos-Dumont, who was regarded as having beaten the Wright brothers with the first flying machine with his 14-bis.|$|E
5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations {{to the edge of}} a nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace. The United States agrees to stop Volgin's renegade faction, destroy the stolen Shagohod and eliminate the American defector, The Boss.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. armed reconnaissance missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Keating's {{national}} {{reputation on}} the issue led President Nixon to appoint him to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, which had been begun under Nixon's predecessor, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson. The majority on the commission issued a report which concluded that pornography does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime and recommended that all federal, state, and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed. Keating, Nixon's only appointee on the 18-person commission, was the leading commission dissenter from the report.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Jarre {{was invited}} by the musical {{director}} of the Houston Grand Opera to perform a concert celebrating Texas's 150th anniversary on 5 April 1986. Although he was busy with other projects and was at first unimpressed by the proposal, on a later visit to the city, he was immediately impressed by the visual grandeur of the city's skyline and agreed to perform. Also, 1985 marked the 25th anniversary of {{the foundation of the}} <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson Space Center; and NASA asked Jarre to integrate the anniversary into the concert.|$|E
5|$|In the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, {{receiving}} 49.2percent of {{the popular}} vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7percent {{of the popular}} vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4percent {{of the popular vote}}), becoming the first Democratic incumbent since <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected president more than once. The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress. Clinton received 379, or over 70percent of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy and {{his running}} mate, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson, {{were close to}} {{securing}} their spots on the Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallas–Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Notable athletes include swimmer Sharron Davies, diver Tom Daley, dancer Wayne Sleep, and footballer Trevor Francis. Other past {{residents}} include composer {{journalist and}} newspaper editor William Henry Wills, Ron Goodwin, and journalist Angela Rippon and comedian Dawn French. Canadian politician and legal scholar Chris Axworthy hails from Plymouth. America based actor Donald Moffat, whose roles include American Vice President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>B.</b> Johnson {{in the film}} The Right Stuff, and fictional President Bennett in Clear and Present Danger, was born in Plymouth.|$|E
