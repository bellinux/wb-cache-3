5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b> The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E

5|$|Following the Grouping of railway {{companies}} in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway, and the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, increased the S15 class strength to 45 locomotives. Maunsell incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and the locomotive's <b>loading</b> <b>gauge,</b> allowing it to operate on routes with height and width restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald. Supervision of {{the building of the}} line was lax, enabling contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels. These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened. Rectifications led to a restricted <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E

The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b> They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and improve upon the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward.

5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and has only operated for 57 years in this capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all had gone by December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of unique <b>loading</b> <b>gauges</b> and bespoke rail technologies has complicated {{maintenance of the}} system, as rolling stock requires custom wheelsets, brake systems, and power systems.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{differences}} between the states, especially in regard to <b>loading</b> <b>gauges,</b> the sharpness of curves, and axle load, especially in Queensland, the design {{had to be a}} compromise, which went against {{the idea of having a}} standardised design.|$|R

50|$|One common {{method to}} avoid {{transshipment}} {{is to build}} cars to the smaller of the two systems' <b>loading</b> <b>gauges</b> with bogies that are easily removed and replaced, with other bogies at an interchange location on the border.

In Europe, stricter railway height restrictions (smaller <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and structure gauge) and overhead electrification prevent containers from being stacked two high, and containers are hauled one high either on standard flatcars or other railroad cars.
