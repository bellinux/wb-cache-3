5|$|Reclamation methods varied {{somewhat}} {{during the}} 19th century, but three basic operations featured; constructing drains at appropriate intervals; building {{a system of}} roads to allow access to the land so that materials such as clay, <b>lime</b> or <b>marl</b> could be dumped on it, to give it body; and fertilising the land by adding manure, often {{in the form of}} the euphemistically named night soil, collected from neighbouring towns.|$|R
25|$|St. Julien {{undertook}} {{the study}} of chemistry beginning in 1852. However, he did not completely forsake his previous work. When an outbreak of Yellow Fever struck Norfolk, Virginia in 1855, {{he was one of}} the first on the scene and worked throughout the epidemic to aid the patients. At his Stony Landing Plantation along the Cooper River, he experimented with the production of <b>lime</b> from <b>marl</b> deposits located along the river banks. After cement was discovered under the limestone layers, in 1856 he partnered with Clement H. Stevens to establish the Colleton Lime Works at his plantation which sold lime for 0.90c per barrel. This company would provide most of the lime used by the southern states during the American Civil War.|$|R

Gravel, <b>marl,</b> <b>lime,</b> sand and stone had to be dug. Slaves often lost their lives as they performed dangerous tasks in the Gorge. Contracts for timber and for masons to work on the bridge were authorized at vestry meetings.|$|R
40|$|Facies {{analysis}} of the upper Kimmeridgian-Tithonian of the Sierra de Arcos (Iberian Chain) allowed {{the reconstruction of the}} sedimentary evolution during the deposition of two sequences, the so called J 3. 6 and J 3. 7 sequences defined by Aurell et al. (2000). Both sequences display a thin or even condensed transgressive systems tract, and a thick highstand and forced regressive systems tracts. Development of shallover facies in the distal part of the ramp was controlled by the so-called Montalbán-Ejulve High. Peloidal and oncolitic shoals were present during deposition of sequence J 3. 6, whereas peloidal shoals and coralgal patch reefs developed during the highstand of sequence J 3. 7. These set of shallow facies prograded over outer ramp facies (i. e., <b>lime</b> mudstone and <b>marls).</b> The influence of the sedimentary high is not obvious during deposition of the forced regressive systems tract of sequence J 3. 7, when the overall southeast progradation of the oolitic shoals and associated restricted environments took place...|$|R
50|$|No {{scientific}} {{evidence has been}} published to verify that the Irish wavestones have formed in lakes. Furthermore, no wavestones have been described from present-day lakes in Ireland, which is puzzling as parts of the country, such as The Burren, are studded with lakes containing many partly-submerged Carboniferous limestone erratics. A requirement for limestone solution is that water must essentially be ‘acidic’ (pH below 7). Yet, a study of six wavestone sites in Ireland, namely Ballard Bridge, Cornaseer, Creevagh, Gortlecka, Killinaboy and Rinnamona, found that nearby lakes, in which the wavestones {{are said to have}} formed, are ‘alkaline' (pH above 7) with a pH range from 7.6 to 8.5. In fact, the water in three of the lakes, Loughs Gealáin and Ree, and Rinnamona Lough, is so alkaline that <b>marl</b> (<b>lime</b> mud) is being precipitated. The alkalinity of the lake water means that it would cushion limestone against solution rather than dissolve it. This (and other field evidence, such as wavestone morphology) indicates that the wavestones at these six sites have not formed in lakes.|$|R
60|$|Now we {{have already}} seen that this {{increased}} application of capital, other things being unaltered, is always attended with a smaller proportional return. The rise of price enables measures to be taken for increasing the produce, which could not have been taken with profit at the previous price. The farmer uses more expensive manures, or manures land which he formerly left to nature; or procures <b>lime</b> or <b>marl</b> from a distance, as a dressing for the soil; or pulverizes or weeds it more thoroughly; or drains, irrigates, or subsoils portions of it, which at former prices would not have paid the cost of the operation; and so forth. The farmer or improver will only consider whether the outlay he makes for the purpose will be returned to him with the ordinary profit, and not whether any surplus will remain for rent. Even, therefore, if it were {{the fact that there is}} never any land taken into cultivation, for which rent, and that too of an amount worth taking into consideration, was not paid, it would be true, nevertheless, that there is always some agricultural capital which pays no rent, because it returns nothing beyond the ordinary rate of profit: this capital being the portion of capital last applied—that to which the last addition to the produce was due; or (to express the essentials of the case in one phrase) that which is applied in the least favorable circumstances. But the same amount of demand and the same price, which enable this least productive portion of capital barely to replace itself with the ordinary profit, enable every other portion to yield a surplus proportioned to the advantage it possesses. And this surplus it is which competition enables the landlord to appropriate.|$|R
40|$|Minnesota has {{extensive}} {{deposits of}} calcium carbonate {{in the form}} of limestones, dolomites, and marls. This report deals primarily with the distribution and chemical composition of these carbonate deposits and the uses for which they are suited. The dolomites are the most widely distributed and the most readily available carbonate rocks in Minnesota. They are quarried in large quantities in the southeastern part of the state, where the lower Ordovician rocks are predominantly dolomitic limestones. Limestones high in calcium are far less abundant, being confined to several strata that are more limited in their distribution. Locally they have been quarried for their high <b>lime</b> content. The <b>marls</b> have been but very recently {{recognized as one of the}} valuable mineral resources of the state. These light, grayish muds underlie marshes, bogs, and lakes; they are not often visible at the surface. Most persons, therefore, are unfamiliar with the name, appearance, and distribution of marl. It can be distinguished from other muds by its light color, its abundant shell fragments, and its violent reaction with acid. The marl beds of Minnesota vary in thickness, but they are seldom more than thirty feet thick...|$|R
40|$|Scythian {{sedimentary}} rocks exposed at Strmica and Plavno near Knin represent storm-generated deposits in inner (Lower Scythian) and outer (Upper Scythian) shelf settings. The Lower Scythian {{is represented by}} Siliciclastic facies which consists of two subfacies components - thin-bedded shale-siltstone-sandstone alternations attached to the distal part of the inner shelf, and a thick-bedded sandstone-oolite subfacies attached either to the proximal part of the inner shelf or to the shoreface. Repetitive alternation of these two subfacies which form the Siliciclastic facies is interpreted as high frequency sedimentary cycles possibly related to high-frequency sea-level changes which in turn induced wave-base oscillations. This is observed as a rapid introduction of high energy proximal inner shelf or shoreface deposits into a muddy, distal part of the inner shelf environment. Upper Scythian {{sedimentary rocks}} are <b>lime</b> mudstones with <b>marls</b> in the Mud facies, and with marls and calcarenaceous siltstones in the Siltstone-mudstone facies. No obvious cyclic periodicity was observed within these two facies except the random occurence of punctuated storm layers with basal skeletal lag (Mud facies) and silty material input in normally mud dominated outer shelf sedimentary rocks (Siltstone - mudstone facies). According to the facies characteristics the Lower Triassic succession near Knin is interpreted {{as a consequence of}} a low-term, possibly third-order sea level rise compared to the global sea level rise during the Scythian...|$|R
5000|$|The whole art of {{husbandry}} {{consisted of}} a total of 15 books, published in one volume, each book divided into chapters on connected subjects. The first book has four chapters - on inclosing lands; of pastures, and meadow lands, how to improve them, and defend by banks from floods and tides; and of making hay; and of several sorts of grass seeds, as clover, sainfoin, and lucerne, - ray grass, trefoil, and several other grasses. The second book has 6 chapters - of arable land and tillage; on ploughs, of which some are figured; and the square earth board is shown and recommended for stiff clays; the Hertfordshire wheel-plough was until in the 19th century much recommended; of ploughing and laying land in ridges; of sowing corn and steeping it. The third book has three chapters, describing the different natures of soils; the ability and power of production. The fourth book has seventeen chapters: I. On the manuring and digging of lands, with observations on each sort of manure II. Of the burning of land III. Of chalk IV. Of <b>lime.</b> V. Of <b>marl</b> VI. Of fuller's earth. VII. Of clay. VIII. Of sand. IX. Of earth. X. Of sea sand and weed. XI. Of dungs. XII. Of sheep's dung. XIII. Of hog's dung. XIV. Of urine. XV. Of human ordure. XVI. Of the dung of fowls. And XVII. Of several other sorts of manures, as ashes, soap ashes, soot, rags, malt dust, and the several soils each sort of manure is best for.|$|R
40|$|New palaeontological and sedimentological {{data from}} the Lower Triassic strata of the eastern Julian Alps in Slovenia are presented., They are unusual for the Early Triassic of the Alps in {{representing}} a relatively deeper, unrestricted marine (mid-ramp) setting. There are two basic microfacies types in the section investigated (types A and B), which are organized as couplets with coarse-grained tempestitic deposits (microfacies A), overlain by laminated or bioturbated <b>lime</b> mudstones and/or <b>marls</b> (microfacies B), frequently containing ammonoids. This pattern is interpreted as storm deposition with occasional winnowing of bottom sediments {{and the formation of}} coarse-grained skeletal deposits (lags), followed by the slow settling of suspended particles, when the storm waned, in addition to background deposition. Dominantly lime mud deposition and the presence of ammonoids indicate deposition on a more distal, deeper ramp with an unrestricted connection to the open sea. Intense reworking of bottom skeletal-rich sediment and accumulation of storm lags suggest deposition above the storm wave base, possibly in a wide low-energy mid-ramp environment. Faunas from such settings have been reported relatively rarely from the Early Triassic of the Alps. The macrofauna contains ammonoids, bivalves and gastropods, whereas the microfauna is represented by foraminifer tests and conodont elements; rare fish remains also occur. In the foraminifer assemblages, species of Ammodiscus, Hoyenella, Glomospirella dominated, corresponding to the widespread “Glomospira-Glomospirella” foraminifer community, with some miliolids and nodosariids. The conodont fauna is characterized by Triassospathodus hungaricus (Kozur et Mostler), indicating an early Spathian (Olenekian) age. The fossil assemblage highlights the wide distribution of Early Triassic taxa in the Tethys and facilitates its worldwide correlation. Its relatively low diversity by comparison with shallow marine settings is interpreted as an evolutionary proximal-distal trend {{in the wake of the}} end-Permian mass extinction. Re-diversification first occurred in nearshore settings and expanded into deeper/distal marine environments through geological time...|$|R
40|$|In the hydrogeological {{image of}} Poland the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze stand out with {{numerous}} springs of differentiated yields. In the active water circulation zone {{of this region}} there are different carbonate rocks. In the near-surface zone there are mostly maastricht deposits developed into <b>lime</b> silicate rocks, <b>marls</b> or chalk which are locally covered with Paleocene gaizes, Neogene limestones and sandstones. In the plateau areas these rocks are covered with {{a thin layer of}} sand-dust sediments and locally with a thick loess cover. The usable underground water horizon occurs in the Cretaceous carbonate rocks and locally even in the Tertiary and Quaternary ones. Differentiated tectonic systems of oriented cracks strongly affect the underground water circulation and the occurence of springs. About 1550 springs were recorded in the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze of which about 1230 are still functioning. The springs with a small yield are the most common for 57 % of outflows do not reach 1 1 /s. All the springs supplied with water from the upper aquiferhorizons existing in the highest parts of drainage basins are in this group. The yield 1 - 10 l/s appears in 29 % of springs; only 13 % of springs exceeds 10 l/s. 160 springs of the yield above 10 l/s were recorded in the researched area. Out of these 11 springs permanently exceed 100 l/s and 8 such springs are located in the Roztocze and 2 more in the vicinity of this region. From the hydrological point of view the springs exceeding 10 l/s are of greatest significance They supply about 78 % of water flowing out of the springs in the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze hence they decide about the quantity of water flowing in the rivers during the precipitation-free period. In the Roztocze and {{in the western part of}} the Lublin Upland about 38 % of water directly derives from the springs and the comparable quantity of water inflows to the rivers through the direct river-bed drainage. In the precipitation-free periods 100 % of river water is derived from the underground water resources of which springs supply between 40 - 100 %. In the eastern part of the Lublin Upland the spring water supplying the rivers is decidedly lower. Spring water from the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze is of high quality. The places of outflows and spring niches should be protected against pollution and devastation. In such places physico-chemical and bacteriological properties of underground water should not be changed in any way.

40|$|Drilling on Leg 77 {{resulted}} in eight single-bit holes at five sites extending across the Yucatan Channel {{in the southeastern}} Gulf of Mexico. Sites 535, 539 (aborted hole of 7. 5 m depth), and 540 were grouped as basin sites, whereas location on up-faulted blocks at Sites 536, 537, and 538 led to their grouping as basement sites. The sedimentary record encountered across the Channel is short, intermittent, and laterally erratic, reflecting both the general instability of sedimentation and the depositional contrast between basin and basement sites. The combined record for the Cenozoic is incomplete, and that {{for most of the}} Upper Cretaceous is missing. The Lower Cretaceous record is relatively long at basin sites, including apparent Berriasian at Site 535, but the record is still discontinuous and the biostratigraphic data are sparse, frequently contradictory, and complicated by displacement and reworking. The Lower Cretaceous record is again short and erratic at the basement Sites 536, 537, and 538, where displaced shelf grainstones, with very poor recovery, and variably minor interbedded <b>lime</b> mudstones and <b>marls</b> lie on continental basement. Cenozoic cores are mostly pelagic calcareous oozes, except at Site 535, where more than 150 m of upper Pleistocene distal fan and deltaic mudstones were drilled. The Cenozoic successions are thin, fragmentary, and variable laterally, except for the Oligocene, which is well developed in basin Hole 540 and basement Hole 538 A. Planktonic foraminifers are typically abundant and well preserved, but reworking is persistent. No Cenozoic except Pleistocene was encountered at basin Site 535. The Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary was recovered in Hole 536, where a complete foraminiferal zonal sequence of the lowermost Paleocene overlies ill-defined Maestrichtian without perceptible lithic change. The Maestrichtian through Turanian interval is represented by only a few meters at Sites 540, 536, 537, and 538, and ranges from upper Maestrichtian to Santonian. Nannofossil-foraminiferal chalk is typical, but volcanogenic sandstone and coarse bioclastic limestone also occur in relative abundance. No record of this interval was found at Site 535. The Cenomanian is missing at basement Sites 536, 537, and 538, but is thick and gradational into the Albian at basin Sites 535 and 540. The passage into the Albian at Site 540 is accompanied by a change from coarse skeletal to pelagic limestones. The Cenomanian and Albian of Site 535 (535 - 17. CC to 535 - 43,CC) form a continuous, mystifying succession that may be a huge slump or canyon fill. The Lower Cretaceous of basin sites differs markedly from that of basement sites. At the latter, the Albian to Aptian displaced shelf grainstones and minor interbeds of lime mudstone are typical. Rare calpionellids in grainstone matrix, displaced trocholinid grains, and rare planktonic specimens in interbeds and grainstone matrix provide approximate ages for layers proximal to the basement, layers which range from upper Aptian (Site 536) to Valanginian (Site 537) and Berriasian (Hole 538 A). The Cretaceous of Site 535 is the most complex of the major intervals drilled during Leg 77. The sequence from 535 - 17,CC, {{at the base of the}} Pleistocene, through Section 535 - 42 - 2 (240 m) is composed of laminated limestones with some discrete biogenic turbidites and uncommon marly interbeds. Displaced and reworked biogenic materials are common, particularly in the turbidites, but definitely autochthonous planktonic foraminifers are infrequent and rare. Those found indicate a normal succession of middle and lower Albian foraminiferal zones, but rare ammonitic material indicates that the interval is Cenomanian to upper Albian. This contradiction, the extensive reworking, and the rare, small size-graded planktonic foraminifers undermined the validity of the planktonic zones and raised the possibility of an exotic origin of the interval. At Core 535 - 43 the lithofacies changes to seemingly autochthonous limestone and marls with periodic dark organic and pyritic marls, which continue to total depth at Core 535 - 79. Small recrystallized planktonic foraminifers are common in indurated limestones at the top (Cores 535 - 43 to 535 - 47), indicating an Aptian succession, but planktonic specimens are tiny and rare below. Calpionellids appear in Core 535 - 64 and become common to abundant in Core 535 - 71, below which calpionellid Zones E and D occur. Their temporal implications are contradicted, however, by rare Globuligerina and Trocholina, which suggest a lesser age than that implied by the calpionellids, and in turn undermine the ages inferred for the medial part of the interval. In the end, the discontinuous but normal succession of planktonic foraminifer and calpionellid zones identified for the Cretaceous of Site 535 during shipboard and early post-cruise work has become suspect; and the composition of the sedimentary record, the nature of the depositional environment, and the possible structural effects are uncertain...|$|R
