5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point returning to the start. Set two months after the end of series one, Mark meets Becky in a newsagent, where he is purchasing pornographic magazines. He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor's house and breaks in using Tracy's keys. However, he is forced to hide under the bed when Becky and Trevor return home. <b>Listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> having sex, he becomes optimistic when he thinks that Becky begins to shout his name ("M..."). The name turns out to be Michael (Tony Gardner), Becky's solicitor with whom she is now cheating on Trevor.|$|E

After two weeks of this obsession, he met with Clive Davis to ask for permission to license Simon & Garfunkel music for his film. Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best-selling soundtrack album. Simon was not as immediately receptive, viewing movies akin to [...] "selling out", creating a damper on his artistic integrity. However, after meeting Nichols and becoming impressed by his wit and the script, he agreed to write at least one or two new songs for the film. Leonard Hirshan, a powerful agent at William Morris, negotiated a deal that paid Simon $25,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman. Several weeks later, Simon re-emerged with two new tracks, [...] "Punky's Dilemma" [...] and [...] "Overs", neither of which Nichols was particularly taken with.

On 7 July 1967 Giridhar joined the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College in the nearby Sujanganj village of Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Vyakarana (grammar), Hindi, English, Maths, History, and Geography.

He was top of his class for four years, and passed the Uttara Madhyama (higher secondary) examination in Sanskrit with first class and distinction.|$|E

500|$|The band began {{recording}} demos of {{new material}} in 2009. All three members brought song ideas that {{they worked on}} for years. As the band got back together, Barker said that the trio immediately [...] "got inspired" [...] by practicing their old songs and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> again, {{and they decided to}} record demos.

The trio wanted to release it as a single then, but quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July.

During the tour, Barker got the phone call that DJ AM had overdosed and died in New York, which heavily affected him.
