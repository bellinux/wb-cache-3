500|$|For {{the first}} time I was flying by Jet propulsion! No engine vibrations. No torque and no lashing sound of the engine propeller. Accompanied by a {{whistling}} sound, my jet shot through the air. Later when asked what it felt <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It was as though angels were pushing." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Zoe's {{first and}} main storylines was being stalked by fellow student Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later {{commented on the}} storyline, {{deciding}} it was her most memorable: [...] "The most memorable for me {{was the one with}} my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it was a bit weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} her stage name was chosen, Aoi explained: [...] "My agency asked what color <b>I</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> blue [...] He also asked what <b>I</b> <b>like</b> in general. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> sky [...] So, she chose Aoi Sora." ...|$|R
5|$|It's like a 90's, throwback-type vibe, when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'I {{want it to}} look <b>like</b> this,' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>like</b> a TLC, Fresh Prince type vibe. <b>I</b> was <b>like,</b> 'Let's {{just get}} really silly, 90's amazing outfits, and {{just go out and}} dance around and have fun.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't look <b>like</b> that, Miriam!' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> with {{a little}} shiver. 'You seem {{to be looking at}} {{something}} a thousand miles away!' ...|$|R
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{said that}} [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] was a [...] "supremely catchy pop tune" [...] {{and that the}} video was [...] "the {{perfectly}} blissed-out accompaniment." [...] Montgomery chided the video for [...] "not making much sense" [...] but noted [...] "that hardly matters" [...] as [...] "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect formula for pop success: Don't think too big, or too much. Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> you can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't ever say she's not smart." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry. Powell {{recalled}} that [...] "I was doing some chores at home. I was sitting {{down on the floor}} folding laundry and I had that song in my head. All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I should <b>like</b> you,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{approaching}} {{as near as}} I could, for the sparks, {{like little}} fireflies on a Riviera evening, were playing profoundly round my trousers, 'I should {{like to hear from}} your own lips the reasons which have caused you to resign.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Waylon come to play {{those for}} me. He {{looked at me}} and said, 'You don't really <b>like</b> them?' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'Well, we'll do well with them, but I don't think there's one as good as what we had with the Outlaws.' He said, 'What about this one?' And that's when he played 'Mammas.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} had no cause to leave me." [...] Phineas as he heard this could not but {{remember}} all that Lady Laura had told himself, and thought that no woman had ever had a better reason for leaving her husband. [...] "There were things <b>I</b> did not <b>like,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{features}} the American rock band Phish as themselves. The idea {{to include the}} band in the episode was pitched during the episode's production. [...] "Phish plays at the rally. We thought they'd be the perfect group to use for the plot.", Jean said. Meyer, who pitched the episode's premise, was {{a fan of the}} band, but Jean did not know much of them before they appeared in the episode; [...] "I've never seen one of their concerts, so I'm not the most familiar", he said. He first became aware of the band after reading an article about them in Entertainment Weekly. As they worked on the episode however, Jean became more acquainted with the band members. [...] "They were nice", he said. [...] "Jon Fishman said to me that the band had talked from time to time about if they were to ever be on The Simpsons, what it would be <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, how close was it?' He said, 'Pretty close to what we expected.' (laughs) That was gratifying." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
2500|$|We didn't {{really have}} {{aspirations}} to make records at that point, {{when we first}} started out; it was all about playing live, really. You know, enjoying each other's company, and writing songs, and gettin' stoned, partying and having fun ... Once we started, which was 1996, we didn't really stop until 2005. And, yeah, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> we were proud of how much we toured. We were-it was a badge of honour to play as much as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{pleasure}} to work with an imaginative chap <b>like</b> yourself," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> after a pause. [...] "The way that you've brought out {{the character of the}} hero is simply wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's so <b>like</b> you. <b>I</b> always <b>said</b> you'd {{no feeling}} of real romance. If I cared {{for a woman}} I'd give her the coat off my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And she has has a {{right to}} do as she <b>likes,</b> <b>I</b> hope, Quilp,' <b>said</b> the old lady trembling, partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish son-in-law.|$|R
2500|$|While {{attending}} Boston University, Silk earned both {{an undergraduate}} degree and a Masters of Business Administration degree {{and is a}} Director of Institutional Sales in Boston. [...] When asked if Silk still ties up the skates he said “I skate maybe {{once or twice a}} year for a charity event. [...] I can’t say I miss it. [...] I’m content. [...] I’m good friends with former teammates Jack O’Callahan and also with Jack Hughes and Ralph Cox, who were the last two cuts from the team that year. [...] The friendships, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> are the most important things for me to ever come out of my time in hockey” (Carroll).|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the ESPN documentary series SportsCentury in 2002, Clemente's widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her several times {{that he thought he}} was going to die young. Indeed, while being asked by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities about when he would get his 3,000 career hit, Clemente's response was [...] "Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I'm alive, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, you never know because God tells you how long you're going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow." [...] Clemente's older stepbrother, Luis, died on December 31, 1954 and his stepsister a few years later.|$|E
2500|$|Bjelland {{was born}} in Salem, Oregon to Lynne Irene (nee Higginbotham) and Lyle Bjelland. She was raised in Woodburn, a small town near Salem. Her parents {{divorced}} when she was young, and she {{claimed to have been}} physically and verbally abused by her stepmother. [...] In the documentary, Not Bad for a Girl (1995), Bjelland revealed: [...] "You know, I really hate to talk about it because she's great now, but in my childhood she was very abusive... <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> though, it probably did help my creativity a lot. I was always grounded. I hate to talk about it because I feel like she doesn't think that she did it, but she was [...] and it influenced my life quite a great deal." ...|$|E
60|$|I suppose I bowed. Habit carries us {{mechanically}} {{through many}} impossible situations. I don't know what <b>I</b> looked <b>like</b> or what <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> anything. <b>I</b> don't suppose I betrayed my dire confusion, for Edna went off unconcernedly without another glance at me.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{will get}} {{yourself}} {{into trouble with}} the police, Mademoiselle Therese, {{if you go on}} <b>like</b> that,” <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> But she was as obstinate as a mule and assured me with the utmost confidence that many people would be ready to defend a poor honest girl. There was something behind this attitude which I could not fathom. Suddenly she fetched a deep sigh.|$|R
5000|$|When Mel Brooks {{developed}} Spaceballs, {{he wanted}} his parody to be {{as close to the}} original as possible. Even though Yogurt mentioned merchandising during the movie, Brooks's deal with George Lucas on parodying Star Wars was that no Spaceballs action figures be made. According to Brooks, [...] "Lucas said, 'Your figures are going to look <b>like</b> mine.' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> OK." ...|$|R
2500|$|Scientology minister-in-training and professed Christian, Craig Gehring, {{was quoted}} in 2007 in The Advocate as saying he thought that his belief in Jesus {{as the son of}} God did not {{conflict}} with his being a Scientologist: [...] "Personally, I believe [...] the son of God - son of man, but <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that is not a Scientology doctrine. There isn't a doctrine about [...] in Scientology." [...] I believe very much in the Christian message. Jesus says time and time again, 'The kingdom of God is at hand.' ... And that is a message you will find any Scientologist working toward." [...] Gehring said that during his time studying Scientology at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana mission, he had not encountered teachings of Scientology space opera as had been reported in 2006 in Rolling Stone.|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski led 383 laps {{on his way}} to {{his fourth}} win of the season. [...] "What a night," [...] said Keselowski. [...] "Part of me, I pulled into victory lane and I pinched myself once to make sure I wasn't dreaming. These are nights you don't forget as a driver and you live for. The Miller Lite Ford Fusion was just flying, and this is I'm couldn't ask for a better way to enter the Chase than to win and take the first seed. We're ready. We want to run for another Cup. We really feel like this team has it." [...] "You know, it's {{definitely}} frustrating not making that Chase, but <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> when you do make the Chase, {{you want it to be}} for a championship, not just ride around in it," [...] said a disappointed Clint Bowyer.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 15 {{interview}} with Elizabeth Vargas for ABC's 20/20, Lane stated: [...] "I didn't really specify {{anything in my}} contract about getting onscreen credit or anything ... I didn't do the movie to get fame or recognition or anything." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not speaking because I feel like I should be heralded .... I'm speaking because [...] are completely lying {{about the amount of}} dancing Natalie did in the movie. When those incorrect things are coming out, and they threaten the entire principle of ballet, then I feel like I need to say something." [...] When Vargas asked if it is possible that both interpretations of the [...] "math" [...] can be correct, Lane responded: [...] "It's possible, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> if you're counting the close-ups of her face as actual dancing shots. But I don't call close-ups of her face actual dancing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, you did; {{and it was}} the unkindest {{thing you}} could {{possibly}} say. It was meant to be unkind. It was monstrous. How would you <b>like</b> it if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that Sir Damask was like a hair-dresser?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is curious}} {{that you should}} talk <b>like</b> that," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> uneasily. [...] "I thought that you had made up your mind that the whole {{business}} was either illusion or trickery--I mean, the odd side of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're doing {{no good at}} all {{by going}} on <b>like</b> this," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I think you'd have been wiser if you'd hit her {{over the head with}} a stick. She wouldn't have despised you as she does now." ...|$|R
2500|$|Eto'o {{refused to}} come on as a {{substitute}} in a league match against Racing de Santander on 11 February 2007. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, [...] "He {{did not want to}} come on; I don't know why." [...] Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, [...] "These kind of things are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, {{if it is true that}} I am a problem for my team then I will go. But <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I am happy here. The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I would. I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon won {{the pole}} {{for the race}} and dominated. Kevin Harvick took the lead from Denny Hamlin with 7 laps to go, but a caution forced the race to have a green-white-checkered finish. Harvick and Ryan Newman, who were {{the top of the}} 4 {{championship}} contenders, restarted on the front row. Harvick held off Newman to score his fourth win of the season and take the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup title. “I was just holding the pedal down and hoping for the best,’’ Harvick said. [...] "This new format has been so stressful. I’m going to go sleep for a week." [...] We didn't have quite enough,” Newman said. “That's disappointing, but <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it was an awesome team effort, and I think, again, this is a great racetrack to have a race like this, and I thought there was some amazing passing, and we don't get that at every racetrack.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was easy," [...] said Charnock. [...] "The {{cooking at}} the bunk-house isn't very good, and I told our man {{to find out}} what they <b>liked.</b> In fact, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> we'd stand for it if he put up a better hash." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He does that," [...] Skinner agreed; [...] "that is what riles {{me in the}} fellow. He {{can play}} a ripping good game when he likes, but then he does not always <b>like.</b> However, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> we will give him another trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very <b>like</b> <b>I</b> did," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Pullet, [...] "for you {{remember}} when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> things, better than I can remember myself. He's got a wonderful memory, Pullet has," [...] she continued, looking pathetically at her sister. [...] "I should be poorly off if he {{was to have a}} stroke, for he always remembers when I've got to take my doctor's stuff; and I'm taking three sorts now." ...|$|R
