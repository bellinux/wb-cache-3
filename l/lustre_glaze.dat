40|$|The ceramic glazing {{techniques}} of vapour glazing, reduction lustre, Raku and fuming all require specialised firing conditions {{with the use}} of potentially hazardous kiln atmospheres and specialist kiln designs for their successful execution. The technique of reduction lustre is an ancient, highly decorative technique in which pigments or glazes containing reducible metal oxides such as copper, silver and bismuth are subjected to a reducing atmosphere which results in the formation of stable iridescent lustrous colour effects. Conventionally hydrocarbons are used to produce a reducing atmosphere, the combustion of which can lead to potentially high levels of CO. This research has concentrated on the technique of reduction lustre with the aim of producing a safe, environmentally friendly firing system. Reduction lustre effects were reproduced using a 100 litre down draft gas kiln designed and constructed for the purpose. A 40 litre electric kiln was modified for use with reducing atmospheres and a laboratory muffle kiln was also adapted to provide closely controlled firing conditions. Alternative reducing atmospheres were assessed, consisting of either 5 % H 2 in N 2 or hydrocarbon vapour in N 2 The former is reliable, safe, environmentally friendly and is recommended for studio pottery use. A theoretical design for a reduction lustre kiln incorporating a gas control system based on the use of a 5 % H 2 in N 2 gas mixture and a gas tight outer casing was developed. Thermoanalytical methods were used to investigate the reduction behaviour of raw materials, glazes and frits under different atmospheric conditions. Diffusional and topochemical models of reduction reactions occurring in a typical <b>lustre</b> <b>glaze</b> have been evaluated. In-glaze lustres reduce with thecharacteristics of diffusion processes. Water diffusion out of the glaze may be rate determining. Studies carried out using energy dispersive x-ray analysis andphoto electron spectroscopy show that lustres are associated with the presence of metallic copper, the actual colour being dependent on the surface concentration of the metal. The aesthetic results of the various firing methods developed were assessed using a perceptual study based on the use of a semantic differential test developed from a multiple sorting survey carried out using lustred tiles. The survey used both lustred tiles to represent a 2 -dimensional surface and lustred vases which represented a 3 -dimensional lustre glazed surface. The survey showed that statistically significant differences were observed between lustred ceramics fired in different systems, allowing comparisons to be made in an objective manner.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that lustre decoration of medieval and Renaissance pottery consists of silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. Here the findings of an X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) study on <b>lustred</b> <b>glazes</b> of shards belonging to 10 th and 13 rd century pottery from the National Museum of Iran are reported. Absorption spectra in the visible range have been also measured in order to investigate the relations between colour and glaze composition. Gold colour is mainly due to Ag nanoparticles, though Ag+, Cu+ and Cu 2 + ions can be also dispersed within the glassy matrix, with different ratios. Red colour is mainly due to Cu nanoparticles, although some Ag nanoparticles, Ag+ and Cu+ ions can be present. The achievement of metallic Cu {{and the absence of}} Cu 2 + indicate a higher reduction of copper in red lustre. These findings are in substantial agreement with previous results on Italian Renaissance pottery. In spite of the large heterogeneity of cases, the presence of copper and silver ions in the <b>glaze</b> confirms that <b>lustre</b> formation is mediated by a copper- and silver-alkali ion exchange, followed by nucleation and growth of metal nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|See Coversheet for system requirements. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to integrate computer technologies and environmentally - sensitive materials and processes into the practice of the ceramic designer-maker, in order {{to assess the impact of}} new technologies on practice. A critical contextual review (including analysis of visual material) revealed a developing interest in environmental issues and computer technologies in designer-maker practice. A shift away from a philosophy which historically has been anti-industrial, towards a wider spectrum of craft production was noted. This diversity was shown in the types of production and the scale of manufacture - from ‘one-offs’ to industrial manufacture. New technologies were acknowledged by critics, commentators and practitioners as facilitating this development, although concerns about the potentially detrimental affect that computer technology could have on craft skills was voiced. A link between a pragmatic philosophy of ‘craft’ practice and new approaches to computer systems design highlighted a perception of the validity of ‘craft’ as a contemporary skill. The lack of established methodologies for practice-based ceramic design research has led to the development of a naturalistic approach within this work which is both holistic and emergent. By necessity this methodology places the design researcher at the centre of the inquiry, and uses practice as the main research vehicle. Selected research outcomes were peer reviewed through two significant international touring exhibitions: ‘Hot Off the Press: Ceramics and Print’ and ‘Objects of Our Time’. Initial investigations concentrated on the development of environmentally-sensitive <b>lustre</b> <b>glazes</b> [lead and cadmium free] incorporating an innovative ‘safe’ reduction firing system. Subsequently, ceramic surface designs and three dimensional forms were developed through the integration of: computer assisted design work (CAD); computer assisted manufacture (CAM); colours and glazes; and environmentally-sensitive screen printing, and existing making methods. The outcome was new aesthetic qualities and an extension of practical capabilities. A critical framework for the analysis of research outcomes was developed in order to make explicit and transferable some of the tacit knowledge embodied in research investigations. The analysis was developed through the use of a computer database system from which an electronic document was developed, allowing the integration of a large amount of visual material into the thesis. The research demonstrated that the integration of new technologies into the holistic and emergent practice of the ceramic designer-maker was appropriate. Many advantages of computer technologies for the ceramic practitioner are identified as transferable to the wider field of designer-maker practice and embody the potential to enhance future developments in this field...|$|R

60|$|One summer {{there was}} a great drought, and the rooks, unable to get their usual food from the hard, sun-baked pasture-lands, {{attacked}} the roots and would have pretty well destroyed them if the farmer had not protected his swedes by driving in stakes and running cotton-thread and twine from stake to stake all over the field. This kept them off, just as thread keeps the chaffinches from the seed-beds in small gardens, and as it keeps the sparrows from the crocuses on lawn and ornamental grounds. One day Caleb caught sight of an odd-looking, brownish-grey object {{out in the middle of}} the turnip-field, and as he looked it rose up two or three feet into the air, then dropped back again, and this curious movement was repeated at intervals of two or three minutes until he went to see what the thing was. It turned out to be a long-eared owl, with its foot accidentally caught by a slack thread, which allowed the bird to rise a couple of feet into the air; but every such attempt to escape ended in its being pulled back to the ground again. It was so excessively lean, so weightless in his hand, when he took it up after disengaging its foot, that he thought it must have been captive for the space of two or three days. The wonder was that it had kept alive during those long midsummer days of intolerable heat out there in the middle of the burning field. Yet it was in very fine feather and beautiful to look at with its long, black ear-tufts and round, orange-yellow eyes, which would never lose their fiery <b>lustre</b> until <b>glazed</b> in death. Caleb's first thought on seeing it closely was that it would have been a prize to anyone who liked to have a handsome bird stuffed in a glass case. Then raising it over his head he allowed it to fly, whereupon it flew off a distance of a dozen or fifteen yards and pitched among the turnips, after which it ran a little space and rose again with labour, but soon recovering strength it flew away over the field and finally disappeared in the deep shade of the copse beyond.|$|R
2500|$|In England {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, William de Morgan re-discovered the {{technique}} of firing luster on tin-glaze [...] "to an extraordinarily high standard". Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced. In the 1920s and 1930s, Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell [...] and Duncan Grant decorated tin-glazed pottery for the Omega Workshops in London. [...] Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at Vallauris in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, Dora Billington encouraged her students, including William Newland and Alan Caiger-Smith, to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, Nicholas Vergette and others including the Rye Pottery made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards stoneware.

40|$|Lustre pottery {{unearthed}} at Mas Llorens constitutes one of {{most interesting}} collections of late 16 th and early 17 th centuries lustre pottery from Catalonia. The collection is formed by an unparalleled set {{of more than}} 200 complete dishes and bowls, which were buried {{in the same place}} and at the same time, thus becoming of paramount archaeological interest. Consequently, this set of lustre pottery has become of pivotal importance for the study of this type of ceramic {{not only because of the}} number and integrity of the pieces that were found, but also by its homogeneity. This multidisciplinary study has revealed the importance of this pottery in terms of economy, trade, and social status in Modern times Catalonia. The main purpose of this paper is to determine provenance and technology of production of <b>lustre</b> and other <b>glazed</b> wares from Mas Llorens. We present the results of the archaeometrical characterization of 21 ceramic sherds, recovered from the excavations of Mas Llorens. The sampling includes 11 lustre ceramics, 4 blue-on-white tin-lead-glazed ceramics, and 6 plain lead glazed objects. Chemical and mineralogical composition of the ceramic pastes were analyzed by XRF, NAA, and XRD, and statically compared to 16 th- 17 th tin-lead glazed pottery produced by the main Catalan workshops (e. g. Barcelona, Reus, Vilafranca del Penedes). The chemical data show a high homogeneity in the composition of lustreware pastes, as seen in other proto-industrial fine ceramic productions, evidencing a Barcelonan provenance. Chemical composition and microstructures of the <b>glazes</b> and <b>lustre</b> decorations were observed and analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA) and Elastic ion backscattering spectroscopy (EIBS). Successful lustre exhibits a red-copper color and metallic shine; it contains more copper than silver (average concentration, 9. 5 wt% and 3. 4 wt% respectively) with a ratio of wt% Cu/(Cu+Ag) = 62 %, in the form of copper and silver nanoparticles which are concentrated in a thin layer (< 300 nm) very close to the surface. On the contrary, in the unsuccessful brown lustre lacking metallic shine, although the copper to silver ratio is similar - wt% Cu/(Cu+Ag) = 63 % -, the copper nanoparticles are distributed in a thick layer (1 micron thickness) but in lower concentration (average concentration in the layer 3. 4 wt%), while the silver nanoparticles appear concentrated on a thinner surface layer. The lack of metallic shine in those samples is explained by the low concentration of silver and copper nanoparticles in the layer. This may be related to a deficient reducing firing capable of reducing copper to the metallic state and stopping its diffusion into the glaze.

40|$|Two hundred year's ago, Höganä's, a town {{situated}} in the north-west {{part of the county}} of Skåne, about 20 km north of the city of Helsingborg, had no local pottery tradition's. Höganä's wa's then a tiny fishing village that even lacked a harbour. Coal had now and then been quarried from an opencast mine and the local inhabitant's had collected it from the beach at low tide for their personal need's. When the mining industry started in 1797 and, with time, even the production of earthenware (1832), capital, labour, technology and pot design's were typically fetched from elsewhere. A's well a's the customer's. Nothing of thi's wa's to be found in Höganä's. The capital came from partie's interested in the mining, earthenware and brick industrie's. Here, in particular, Erik Ruuth, the Minister of Finance in Gustav III’'s parliament, wa's engaged. In 1786 he had bought the privilege's for mining coal in north-west Skåne, {{and at the same time}} established the earthenware factory, Ulfsunda, outside Stockholm where clay from the mining in Skåne wa's used. In 1792 large amount's of clay were found between thin seam's of coal in Höganä's and Ruuth brought in the mining engineer, Thoma's Stawford, from Newcastle in view of the coal mining that wa's the focu's of interest. Stawford brought with him not only mining technology to Höganä's from hi's native country but also something that resembled a town plan, including prototype's for worker's’ dwelling's. Coal mining in Höganä's wa's not a successful venture; the coal wa's difficult to mine and of poor quality and in the end attempt's were made to save the enterprise by starting to use the clay for the production of brick's and roofing tile's a's well – and from 1832 even earthenware. The kiln's were fired with coal from the mine's. In Höganä's there wa's hardly any local labour for either the mining or the earthenware factory. Russian prisoner's-of-war and children from orphanage's in Gothenburg, among other's, were used to work in the mine's. And at the start of the 1830 's the population censu's show's that potter's from Ängelholm and other town's in Skåne had been induced to move here. But the potter's in the newly established pottery work's would hardly have produced pot's like those they had been making in their previou's home town's. The piece's that were to be produced in Höganä's differed from the pottery made in the neighbouring town's under the constraint's of the local guild's with their often old-fashioned, traditional idiom's. From the outset, the focu's wa's on good's that would suit the mas's-production of more anonymou's and standardized kind's of article's for the growing market for the middle-classe's. A's early a's 1798 Ruuth sold the factory in Ulfsunda and established the Helsingborg Stoneware Factory that at the time wa's the only one in Sweden to manufacture brown, salt-glazed stoneware, chiefly household good's. In Höganä's, production of thi's type of salt-glazed stoneware wa's also started in 1835. A's with the technology, most of the model's produced at the pottery during the first decade's came from England, either directly or indirectly. However, these did not come from Newcastle in the northeast, Stawford’'s home town, but from the west Midland's and the cluster of small town's that are today amalgamated into The Potterie's, the cradle of the English industrial revolution. Here there wa's a rich flora of, in particular, ceramic industrie's a's well a's a combination of coal, clay, technology, transportation route's, market's – condition's similar to those that were also to be found in Höganä's in the 1800 's. But in actual fact it wa's a German porcelain potter, Carl Berger, who during the period of 1830 - 32 produced the first trial serie's of earthenware good's at the factory in Höganä's. Berger had most recently been working a's the foreman at the Gustavsberg factory where hi's task had been to experiment with flintware suitable for tableware and printed decoration. At Höganä's, Berger wa's to develop yellow lead-glazed ware that can be seen a's a simpler and more brittle imitation of the English flintware. A's far a's can be judged, Berger also contributed with a number of design's, reflecting English one's taken from hi's previou's activitie's at the Gustavsberg work's. During the very first year's of hi's employment at Höganä's simpler ornamental piece's were also being produced both in unglazed yellow earthenware and in black stoneware similar to basalt ware. The product's from Höganä's during the next two decade's consisted in both unglazed and lead-glazed earthenware and, from 1835, in salt-glazed ware in an increasing number of different design's. The earliest printed catalogue's (1835) cover a wide array of article's: drinking mug's, pot's with and without lip's, jam jar's, apothecary pot's, mustard pot's, serving dishe's, milk bowl's, soup terrine's, cooking pot's, flower pot's, bowl's, basin's, toilet set's, food basin's, chamber pot's, plate's, saucer's, butter dishe's, tea and coffee pot's, cream jug's, jelly mould's, soap dishe's, pipe bowl's, inkpot's, sand boxe's, small plate's, salad bowl's, deep dishe's, coffee cup's (with or without ear's), writing set's, flour sieve's, colander's, candlestick's, lamp's, salt cellar's, pepper pot's, doll's, water carafe's, oil flask's, mustard jar's, bidet's, medicine spoon's, sauce boat's, sugar bowl's… The list end's with a number of “toy's” (i. e. miniature's). In addition, there are brick's, roofing tile's, ornament's for building's etc. The range of model's on the whole goe's back to English prototype's in flintware which are also found in a number of variation's at quite a number of factorie's round the Baltic at thi's time. There are strong connection's particularly with the factorie's in Denmark such a's Ipsen's Enke, Herman A. Kähler a's well a's the Spietz and the Søholm work's on the Danish island of Bornholm out in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, many of the model's bear the stamp of the German architect, Georg Friedrich Hetsch, whose historicizing idiom, together with Bertel Thorvaldsen’'s sculpture had a considerable impact on Denmark during the first half of the 1800 's. All thi's i's reflected in the production of the 1800 's in Höganä's. In 1840, Johan Joachim Sjöcrona took over the management of the mining and earthenware production at the Höganä's factory, which time and again had been threatened with closure. He introduced a number of important social and financial reform's (school's, hospital's, pharmacie's, housing for the worker's, temperance movement's, librarie's, meeting-hall's etc.). It wa's also he who, in 1856, employed a young Danish artist, Ferdinand Ring, at the pottery. Ring wa's employed not a's a potter, but a's a sculptor and designer to produce prototype's for mas's production of, above all, variou's kind's of decorative object's, ornament's and architectural decoration's – rather typical task's at that time for a pottery that wa's aiming at meeting competition on a market larger than the one in Skåne. It wa's also probably Ring who lay behind the splendidly illustrated price catalogue over the 1859 production from the pottery. Thi's wa's the era for trade exhibition's with all they implied for internationalization and a growing importance for the visual form and marketing of the good's. The earthenware factory in Höganä's often participated successfully here, judging from the attention given by the pres's, but at the same time the financial gain wa's very small: the threat of closure loomed again in the minute's of the company board. Ferdinand Ring stayed on until 1869 and production continued, however, on a small scale. In 1889 Åke Nordenfelt entered the scene a's manager of the Höganä's company. Hi's private interest wa's one of contemporary ceramic art, in particular the polychrome majolica ware which, in a number of way's, wa's typical of the time. From hi's busines's trip's to England he brought back on hi's own initiative sample's of ceramic's that specially reflected the reformed creative design that i's associated with Christopher Dresser and other designer's, notably within the Art's & Craft's Movement. Such piece's, together with those associated with the contemporary development of artistic ceramic's in Denmark (Bindesbøll, Kähler and other's), came to be copied, on instruction from Nordenfelt, in a multitude of variation's at the Höganä's pottery. At the beginning of the 1890 's these good's caught the attention of people in the Swedish art's & craft's circle's who were interested in modern design, partly because they were mas's-produced, simple and cheap but were also now endowed with a new and energetic form, painted with colourful, running or spattered lead glaze's. These article's were regarded a's a fruitful, artistically valuable alternative to the traditional, historicizing and often overloaded ornament's of that time. The production in Höganä's wa's more or les's unparalleled in Sweden. In order to modernize the old-fashioned pottery’'s rudimentary technical equipment and work routine's, Gudmund Dahl wa's employed a's work's foreman in 1893. He introduced a number of innovation's. For instance, he developed the polychrome glaze on a white background instead of the previou's one which wa's built on a transparent lead glaze on yellow clay. He also installed pyrometer's in the kiln's to register the temperature more exactly and started a routine where each design wa's given a number which wa's stamped onto the good's and which could be found in a design's book that wa's continuously updated when new design's were introduced. Dahl also trained the future designer, Albin Hamberg (born 1875) and the future glazing master, Sigfrid Johansson (born 1879). It wa's a combination of management’'s equally arbitrary and personal interest's, a handful of young colleague's’ eagernes's and talent, the technical and social condition's, the prevailing stream's of idea's and style etc. that made possible thi's, in many way's, remarkable production. The artist, Helmer Osslund (Åslund) wa's employed a's an artistic advisor at the pottery in Höganä's during the winter of 1896 - 97. He had previously worked a's an artistic decorator at Gustavsberg, and studied art under Paul Gauguin and J. F. Willumsen in Pari's. He had even for a shorter period been in Copenhagen. Osslund wa's employed at the Höganä's work's to create a new and modern collection for the company’'s showcase at the coming art's and industry exhibition in Stockholm when the Höganä's company wa's to celebrate it's hundredth anniversary. But after only a couple of month's he got in conflict with the management of the pottery and resigned from hi's job. The avant-garde ceramic's with symbolistic root's that were shown at the exhibition in Stockholm attracted attention but gave rise to hardly any response from the company management. However, he inspired Albin Hamberg to train at the Technical College in Stockholm (the present the University College of Art's, Craft's and Design) where he spent three year's, 1897 - 1900. In a number of way's Osslund opened up a new world for Hamberg who wa's himself grandson of one of the child worker's from Gothenburg who had been employed in 1801 to work in the mine. In thi's way he got into closer contact with contemporary ceramic's which he studied and sketched at the Stockholm exhibition, in museum's and magazine's, leaving their mark in the pottery’'s design book at Höganä's. The illustrated price catalogue for 1905 show's a variety of example's of what Hamberg had seen and often skilfully transferred to glazed Höganä's clay. At thi's time, copying other producer's wa's the normal way of working for smaller factorie's. In the book of design's and the price catalogue it i's possible to trace hi's studie's and later scholarship trip's out in Europe. In Höganä's he founded a technical art school, wa's the initiator of a museum, and so on, and can be seen a's an artistic personality with the social awarenes's characteristic of the time before the turn of the last century. In 1914 he left the company’'s pottery with the intention of making a living a's a sculptor, a specialist teacher and a ceramist with hi's own workshop. Astrid Lilienberg-Sieurin worked for about one year at the pottery after Hamberg had left. She had just finished her studie's at the College of Art and made a number of piece's in decorative good's in light-coloured glaze, often in the sgrafitto technique on a light substance. In the following year, 1915, Edgar Böckman, got the job a's the artistic leader. The set's of tableware and ornament's he then produced in faience are actually among the earliest example's in Sweden of what would later be labelled “beautiful good's for daily use” (vackrare vardagsvara) with their characteristic organic and vegetable idiom and flowing ornamental pattern's painted by hand, after Böckman’'s sketche's, on the softly rounded lightly glazed ware. Thi's production actually took place a couple of year's prior to when the Swedish Society for Industrial Design started an agency in 1917 to induce industrie's to employ artistic designer's. The agency resulted in the “Home's Exhibition” at Liljevalch's during the same year where, among other's, Wilhelm Kåge and Edward Hald for the first time presented their new set's of tableware crockery. Thu's, Böckman’'s work from Höganä's had appeared earlier and wa's awarded prize's at the Liljevalch exhibition a's well. Böckman’'s idiom ha's some association with an older domestic faience tradition but the national character in the tableware ha's continental parallel's. Böckman’'s work ha's, above all, connection's with Danish decorative art from around the turn of the 1900 's, both with Thorvald Bindesbøll’'s work a's well a's with that of George Jensen – and maybe particularly with Jen's Thirslund’'s contemporary work at Herman A. Kähler’'s factory in Næstved. Moreover, Böckman developed a serie's of ornament's decorated with the lustre technique, garden urn's in terracotta in the classic style of the 20 's, and a more experimental serie's of ornament's with East Asian stoneware design's made in salt-glazed stoneware decorated with <b>lustre</b> <b>glaze's</b> which blackened at the high firing temperature in the salt-glazing kiln. In 1926 the production of set's of tableware crockery and ornament's wa's discontinued at the pottery in Höganä's (while the production of salt-glazed household ware continued until 1954).
