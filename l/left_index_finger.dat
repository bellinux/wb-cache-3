5|$|Davis {{returned}} to the lineup on December 18 against the Los Angeles Clippers with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 steals. He {{returned to}} the starting lineup in the next game with 21 points, 9 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal against Portland on December 21. He missed 7 games due to the injury. In his seventh consecutive 20-point game (all losses), Davis posted 31 points and 17 rebounds against Golden State. In the subsequent game on January 20, he helped the Pelicans snap an 8-game losing streak with 27 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 blocks against Memphis. On January 26, Davis established a new career high with 19 rebounds, in addition to posting 22 points and 7 blocks, in a 100–92 victory over the Orlando Magic. On January 27, Davis was a finalist for NBA Western Conference {{player of the week}} but lost out to Kevin Durant. The January 28 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers featuring the last three first overall NBA draft picks (Anthony Bennett, Davis, and Kyrie Irving), Davis posted 30 points, 8 blocks, 7 rebounds and 3 assists. However, he dislocated his <b>left</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> causing him to miss the next game the following night. On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend. On February 7, he was selected to replace Kobe Bryant in the 2014 NBA All-Star Game. On February 26, Davis sprained his left shoulder late in the first half against the Dallas Mavericks. He did not play {{in the rest of the}} game, and his subsequent availability was listed as day-to-day. Despite his shoulder sprain, Davis matched his career high with 32 points on February 28 against the Phoenix Suns. He was one of six Western Conference Player of the Week nominees on March 10. On March 14, Davis established a career high with 36 points against Portland. On March 16, 2014, (the very next game) Davis scored a career-high 40 points along with a career-high 21 rebounds in a 121–120 overtime win against the Boston Celtics. The performance was the first 40-point, 20-rebound effort of the 2013–14 NBA season. Davis was the fourth-youngest player (21 years and 5 days) to achieve 40/20 in a game and the youngest since Shaquille O'Neal in 1993. In addition to his career game, Davis set a New Orleans' franchise record with six straight games of at least 28 points. Glen Rice set the previous best stretch with five straight in the 1990s. It was also the first 40-point performance by a Pelican/Hornet since David West on February 26, 2010. Davis was again a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and 24.|$|E

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his <b>left</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E

EEG signals {{were collected from}} 4 healthy volunteers during imagination of six tasks that involved three limbs (<b>left</b> and right <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> and right toes) and two speeds (fast and slow) and each task repeated 40 times in random order. In a single trial, periodic fast or slow motor imagination was executed. EOG and EMG signals are eliminated by independent component analysis (ICA). Time/frequency analysis is applied to characterize mean event-related changes in the power spectrum during single trials across subjects. Grand average event-related potentials (ERPs) is filtered 2 Hz cut-off frequency by IIR filter to extract slow potentials and compared between fast and slow. The distinctive frequency bands and time ranges for significant changes in power related to motor imagination at different speeds and different limbs {{are found in the}} paper. Periodic slow motor imagination may invoke more positive slow potentials than fast motor imagination and fast movement imagination reaches at maximum positive peak more quickly than slow movement imagination. Executing periodic fast and slow motor imagination of <b>left</b> and right <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> and right toes during a single trial is a new mental control strategy paradigm for human-machine interface.

40|$|Background: Integration of afferent {{somatosensory}} input with motor-cortex {{output is}} essential for accurate movements. Prior {{studies have shown that}} tactile input modulates motor-cortex excitability, which is reflected in the reactivity of the similar to 20 -Hz motor-cortex rhythm. similar to 20 -Hz rebound is connected to inhibition or deactivation of motor cortex whereas suppression has been associated with increased motor cortex activity. Although tactile sense carries important information for controlling voluntary actions, proprioception likely provides the most essential feedback for motor control. Methods: To clarify how passive movement modulates motor-cortex excitability, we studied with magnetoencephalography (MEG) the amplitudes and peak latencies of suppression and rebound of the similar to 20 -Hz rhythm elicited by tactile stimulation and passive movement of right and <b>left</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> in 22 healthy volunteers. Results: Passive movement elicited a stronger and more robust similar to 20 -Hz rebound than tactile stimulation. In contrast, the suppression amplitudes did not differ between the two stimulus types. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that suppression and rebound represent activity of two functionally distinct neuronal populations. The similar to 20 -Hz rebound to passive movement could be a suitable tool to study the functional state of the motor cortex both in healthy subjects and in patients with motor disorders...|$|R

After each cold-water immersion of the fingers, 5 -minute rest pause was taken to observe the recovery process of the indicators. This cold-water immersion/rest pause test {{was carried out in}} a range of three ambient temperature conditions: 30 °C (warm), 25 °C (thermoneutral), and 20 °C (cool) as experienced in daily life. At the ambient temperatures of 30 °C and 25 °C, marked CIVD response occurred and the CIVD reactivity did not significantly change upon repetition of cold-water immersion. The lowered finger skin temperature also tended to recover quickly to the pre-immersion level during each post-immersion rest period. At the ambient temperature of 20 °C, however, the CIVD response weakened continuously upon repetition of immersion and almost disappeared during the final immersion. The recovery of finger skin temperature during each post-immersion rest was gradually delayed upon repetition of immersion. At every ambient temperature, finger pain and cold sensation induced by each cold-water immersion significantly decreased upon repetition of immersion and completely disappeared during each post-immersion rest period.

EEG was recorded when 4 subjects executed motor imagery of two tasks at first-person perspective that involved <b>left</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> at two speeds (4 Hz and 1 Hz, trained and paced by metronome). Relatively prominent rhythmic activities around 10 ˜ 13 Hz and 24 ˜ 26 Hz over C 3, 12 ˜ 13 Hz over Cz, and 11 ˜ 13 Hz, 8 ˜ 10 Hz, and 25 ˜ 26 Hz over C 4 were found by spectrum analysis. The most significant band 9 - 13 Hz {{was used to}} construct the feature space. The Fisher discriminant analysis method (FDA), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), and distinction sensitive learning vector quantization (DSLVQ) were applied in offline identification of imagined speeds respectively. The best average misclassification rates between fast and slow movement imagination by only three derivations C 3, Cz, and C 4 with FDA, MLP, and DSLVQ were 27. 5 ± 1 %, 31. 2 ± 3. 7 %, and 34. 6 % at 3260 ms respectively. The results showed that FDA {{in this study was}} better than MLP and DSLVQ. This study demonstrated that discrimination for imagined speeds of finger movement was possible and feasible. Classification of imagined movement speeds with high accuracy based on EEG is also possible through improving methods in the paper.
