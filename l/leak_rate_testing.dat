40|$|As {{deep space}} {{exploration}} {{continues to be}} the goal of NASAs human spaceflight program, verification of the performance of spaceflight hardware becomes increasingly critical. Suitable test methods for verifying the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> of sealing systems are identified in program qualification testing requirements. One acceptable method for verifying the air <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> of gas pressure seals is the tracer gas leak detector method. In this method, a tracer gas (commonly helium) leaks past the test seal and is transported to the leak detector where the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> is quantified. To predict the air <b>leak</b> <b>rate,</b> a conversion factor of helium-to-air is applied depending on the magnitude of the helium flow rate. The conversion factor is based on either the molecular mass ratio or the ratio of the dynamic viscosities. The current work was aimed at validating this approach for permeation-level <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> using a series of tests with a silicone elastomer O-ring. An established pressure decay method with constant differential pressure was used to evaluate both the air and helium <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the O-ring under similar temperature and pressure conditions. The results from the pressure decay tests showed, for the elastomer O-ring, that neither the molecular flow nor the viscous flow helium-to-air conversion factors were applicable. <b>Leak</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tests</b> were also performed using nitrogen and argon as the test gas. Molecular mass and viscosity based helium-to-test gas conversion factors were applied, but did not correctly predict the measured <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of either gas. To further this study, the effect of pressure boundary conditions was investigated. Often, pressure decay <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tests</b> are performed at a differential pressure of 101. 3 kPa with atmospheric pressure on the downstream side of the test seal. In space applications, the differential pressure is similar, but with vacuum as the downstream pressure. The same O-ring was tested at four unique differential pressures ranging from 34. 5 to 137. 9 kPa. Up to six combinations of upstream and downstream pressures for each differential pressure were compared. For a given differential pressure, the various combinations of upstream and downstream dry air pressures did not significantly affect the <b>leak</b> <b>rate.</b> As expected, the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> of the O-ring increased with increasing differential pressure. The results suggested that the current leak test pressure conditions, used to verify spacecraft sealing systems with elastomer seals, produce accurate values even though the boundary conditions do not model the space application...|$|R
40|$|In {{applications}} where <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> {{of components}} or systems are evaluated against a <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> requirement, {{the uncertainty of}} the measured <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> must be included in the reported result. However, in the helium mass spectrometer leak detection method, the sensitivity, or resolution, of the instrument is often the only component of the total measurement uncertainty noted when reporting results. To address this shortfall, a measurement uncertainty analysis method was developed that includes the leak detector unit's resolution, repeatability, hysteresis, and drift, along with the uncertainty associated with the calibration standard. In a step-wise process, the method identifies the bias and precision components of the calibration standard, the measurement correction factor (K-factor), and the leak detector unit. Together these individual contributions to error are combined and the total measurement uncertainty is determined using the root-sum-square method. It was found that the precision component contributes more to the total uncertainty than the bias component, but the bias component is not insignificant.

40|$|MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) are micro machines, i. e. {{freestanding}} {{very small}} devices that can move. These devices are very fragile and {{very sensitive to}} the environment. Particles might damage them, oxidation of the MEMS changes their mass and affects their properties, changes in pressure of the environment will affect their functionality, etc. For this reason, MEMS have to be encapsulated on the wafer (before dicing into chips) in a hermetic cavity. This encapsulation or package should be such that the environment inside the cavity stays stable over the lifetime of the MEMS. However, hermetical MEMS encapsulation with long-term internal environment stability is often challenging, especially for thin film packages. Due to the very small volume (normally below 100 nL) inside the thin film packages, even very small amounts of a gas will significantly increase the pressure inside the package. Thin film packages hermeticity requirements demand for an ultra-fine leak rate below 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec. The standard He storage fine leak test used in industry, with its measurement sensitivity limited to 1 × 10 - 12 mbar. l/sec, is not sensitive enough to test such an ultra-fine leak, and a more sensitive method does not exist. For this reason, {{a lot of research}} is done on new methods that allow to measure the packaging hermeticity of MEMS thin film packages and the ultra-fine level <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> <b>testing.</b> The object of this PhD is to develop a method that can measure the pressure and ultra-fine leak rate of wafer level thin film MEMS packages, and to understand the mechanisms that can contribute to any change of the atmosphere inside the SiGe MEMS thin film package through experiments with some supports by models. This includes studying of the outgassing from materials located inside the package, in-diffusion of gasses from the outside world and leakage of gasses from the interface between the package and substrate. In this thesis, we demonstrate a new systematical methodology to measure the package leakage rate and internal pressure by open/sealing the package with the focused-ion-beam (FIB). We demonstrate the methodology using the capacitance between cap and bottom of the package, using the curvature of the package cap, and using the resonance frequency of the cap. Especially the latter was shown to allow measuring the internal pressure with a very high sensitivity and to enable the measurement of an ultra-fine air leak rate below the order of 1 × 10 - 15 mbar. l/sec, highly outperforming the commonly used standard fine leak method. The methodology can be applied to various MEMS packages. As a case study, we applied the measurement method on two different real MEMS packages to test their hermeticity. It is also shown that the air leakage rate measurement can be accelerated by storing the packages in a higher pressure gas (3 bar N 2 for example). However, care has to be taken when testing the He leak rate, because He can leak in or out the package by both a leak path and by diffusion. We also report on a systematic study of the outgassing properties of typical materials used for imec’s polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) -based MEMS platform with a thin film vacuum package. We studied the outgassing by the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) method. Two different TDS techniques, atmospheric pressure ionization mass-spectrometry (APIMS) and ultra-high vacuum thermal desorption spectroscopy (UH-TDS), were used for this study. It is shown that the UH-TDS is more suitable for studying the outgassing properties of thin film materials. Table of Contents 1.

The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tests</b> on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange.

The evaluated seal design was a candidate for the main interface seal on the LIDS, which would be compressed between two vehicles, while docked, to prevent the escape of breathable air from the vehicles and into the vacuum of space. Leak tests completed at nominal temperatures of - 30, 20, and 50 C on untreated and atomic oxygen (AO) exposed test samples were examined to determine the influence of both test temperature and AO exposure on the performance of the composite seal assembly. Results obtained for untreated seal samples showed <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> which increased with increased test temperature. This general trend was not observed in tests of the AO exposed specimens. Initial examination of collected test data suggested that AO exposure resulted in higher helium <b>leak</b> <b>rates,</b> however, further analysis showed that the differences observed in the 20 and 50 C tests between the untreated and AO exposed samples were within the experimental error of the test method. Lack of discernable trends in the test data prevented concrete conclusions about the effects of test temperature and AO exposure on helium <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> of the candidate seal design from being drawn.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{contracted}} with vendors to design and build 6 CVS containment vessels {{as part of their}} effort to ship Fuel Derived Mixed Fission Product material. The 6 CVS design is based on the Savannah River National Laboratory's (SRNL) design for 9975 and 9977 six inch diameter containment vessels. The main difference between the designs is that the 6 CVS credits the inner O-ring seal as the containment boundary while the SRNL design credits the outer O-ring seal. Since the leak test must be done with the inner O-ring in place, the containment vessel does not have a pathway for getting the helium into the vessel during the leak test. The leak testing contractor was not able to get acceptable <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> with the specified O-ring, but they were able to pass the leak test with a slightly larger O-ring. ANL asked the SRNL to duplicate the leak test vendor's method to determine the cause of the high <b>leak</b> <b>rates.</b> The SRNL <b>testing</b> showed that the helium leak indications were caused by residual helium left within the 6 CVS Closure Assembly by the leak test technique, and by helium permeation through the Viton O-ring seals.

Treating the crack morphology parameters as random variables, the statistical behavior of the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> was also examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} crack morphology parameters have a strong effect on the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> and the statistical behavior of the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> can be simulated using normally distributed crack morphology parameters...|$|R

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires an annual respirator fit testing. Respirator fit can be assessed either qualitatively or quantitatively. Two studies were conducted to assess the fit testing program with specific objectives to: (1) assess <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> in full and half mask respirators; (2) assess the effectiveness of "feedback" 1 on the quality of fit; (3) evaluate the effect of daily beard growth on respirator <b>leak</b> <b>rates.</b> In the first study, {{it was found that the}} half mask respirator has a significantly lower <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> than the full face respirator. A significant reduction in <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> in both respirator types with "feedback" was also observed. The finding that half mask respirators have lower <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> directly contradicts American National Standard Institute's (ANSI) guidelines of higher Assigned Protection Factor (APF) for full mask respirator. Further studies are necessary to determine these findings and to amend respirator recommendations in the future. As expected in the second study, beard growth was associated with respirator <b>leak</b> <b>rate.</b> The effect of daily growth on <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> over a period of twelve days could be defined by a second order regression equation. An attempt was made to describe some characteristics of beard that affect the <b>leak</b> <b>rate.</b> After 12 days of beard growth, it was found that the aspect ratio (length/diameter) of hair was inversely correlated with <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> (r = 0. 64). 1 Feedback: A numerical value measuring the minimum <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> that can be gotten from a respirator fitting with a normal donning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> through cracks {{is crucial in}} applying the leak before break (LBB) concept to pipeline design in nuclear power plants. Because of its importance, several programs were developed based on the several proposed flow models, and used in nuclear power industries. As the flow models were developed for a homogeneous pipe material, however, some difficulties were encountered in estimating <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> for bimaterial pipes. In this paper, a flow model is proposed to estimate <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> in bimaterial pipes based on the modified Henry–Fauske flow model. In the new flow model, different crack morphology parameters can be considered in two parts of a flow path. In addition, based on the proposed flow model, a program was developed to estimate <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> for a crack with linearly varying cross-sectional area. Using the program, <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated for through-thickness cracks with constant or linearly varying cross-sectional areas in a bimaterial pipe. The <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> results were then compared and discussed {{in comparison with the}} results for a homogeneous pipe. The effects of the crack morphology parameters and the variation in cross-sectional area on the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> were examined and discussed...|$|R
40|$|An ''equivalent {{rectangular}} crack'' {{approach was}} employed to predict rupture pressures and <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> through laboratory generated stress corrosion cracks and steam generator tubes removed from the McGuire Nuclear Station. Specimen flaws were sized by post-test fractography {{in addition to a}} pre-test advanced eddy current technique. The predicted and observed test data on rupture and <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> are compared. In general, the test failure pressures and <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> are closer to those predicted on the basis of fractography than on nondestructive evaluation (NDE). However, the predictions based on NDE results are encouraging, particularly because they have the potential to determine a more detailed geometry of ligamented cracks, from which failure pressure and <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> can be more accurately predicted. One test specimen displayed a time-dependent increase of <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> under constant pressure...|$|R

40|$|Contamination of {{spacecraft}} components with planetary {{and foreign}} object debris is a growing concern. Face seals separating the spacecraft cabin from the debris filled environment are particularly susceptible; if the seal becomes contaminated there is potential for decreased performance, mission failure, or catastrophe. In this study, silicone elastomer O-rings were contaminated with JSC- 1 A lunar regolith and their <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> performance was evaluated. The <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> values of contaminated O-rings at four levels of seal compression were compared to those of as-received, uncontaminated, O-rings. The results showed a drastic increase in <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> after contamination. JSC- 1 A contaminated O-rings lead to immeasurably high <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> values for all levels of compression except complete closure. Additionally, a mechanical method of simulant removal was examined. In general, this method returned the <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> to as-received values...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the unsteady <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> simulation by the Method of Characteristics is discussed, and the respective numerical equations are derived. The use of the steady-state orifice equation for the computation of unsteady <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> from pipe through-crack or rupture is discussed and evaluated. Five different shapes of artificially made pipe through-cracks were experimentally considered. These types of leak sources include a circumferential crack, a loose weldment crack, multiple small cracks, a longitudinal long crack and a loose union fitting. Different values of steady-state <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> were run through each of these crack types and a leak opening dimensional coefficient analogous {{to that of the}} orifice was established. Severe transient flow through the same leak opening was then run, and the average steady-state value for this Coefficient was used to establish a <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> history throughout the transient course. A comparison between this <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> history and the corresponding measured rate was considered, and {{it was found that the}} use of the steady-state orifice equation for the computation of <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> from pipe through-crack (rupture) during transient flow conditions was accurate for normal-sized leaks...|$|R
40|$|An {{enhancement}} to {{the pressure}} decay <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> method with mass point analysis solved deficiencies in the standard method. By adding a control system, a constant gas pressure differential across the test article was maintained. As a result, the desired pressure condition was met {{at the onset of}} the test, and the mass <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> and measurement uncertainty were computed in real-time. The data acquisition and control system were programmed to automatically stop when specified criteria were met. Typically, the test was stopped when a specified level of measurement uncertainty was attained. Using silicone O-ring test articles, the new method was compared with the standard method that permitted the downstream pressure to be non-constant atmospheric pressure. The two methods recorded comparable <b>leak</b> <b>rates,</b> but the new method recorded <b>leak</b> <b>rates</b> with significantly lower measurement uncertainty, statistical variance, and test duration.

Soap screening techniques and Gasurveyor 500 series instrument were used in this study for detecting potential leaks. Leaked gas was quantified using either Hi-Flow gas sampler or bagging measurements system. The results show that the respective potential gas leaking point of City Gate Station (CGS), commercial Regulating and Metering Station (RMS), industrial RMS, residential RMS and Town Bordering Station (TBS) / District Regulating Station (DRS) are scrubber dump valve (average <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 217. 00 L/min), insulating point (average <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 4. 04 L/min), tube fitting connector (average <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 8. 00 L/min), connector (average <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 1. 55 L/min) and pressure relief valve (average <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 437. 92 L/min).

40|$|AbstractIn {{nuclear power}} plants, {{continuous}} efforts {{are made to}} ensure that plants are operated in safe, reliable and economical manner. While utmost care is taken during design, construction and commissioning of the structures, systems& components (SSCs), continued healthiness has to be ensured during operation phase {{in accordance with the}} design intent. This is primarily achieved through the establishment of a comprehensive life management programme of surveillance, condition monitoring, periodic In-service inspections (ISI) and maintenance, the purpose of which is to ensure that required safety margins are maintained for all important SSCs throughout plant service life. In any industry, the important mechanisms which lead to SSCs degradation are general corrosion, Flow accelerated corrosion, erosion, thermal effects, fatigue and mechanical wear & fretting. In a Nuclear Power Plant, in addition to these, degradation also occurs due to irradiation and creep. Therefore SSCs need to be designed with due consideration of all such degradation mechanisms. During operation phase, the limiting conditions for operation and requirements of surveillance & condition monitoring for all components important to safety are documented in Technical Specification. A plant specific ISI manual defines and elaborates the ISI internal inspection methods and acceptance criteria. The ISI requirements are decided taking into account best industry practices and operational experience and meet the requirements of existing codes and standards. Both these documents are approved by AERB. In pressurized heavy water reactors, major components covered in ISI programme are coolant channels, feeder pipes, steam generators, heavy water heat exchangers, pressure boundary components, relief valves etc. The inspection methods adopted include use of UT, ECT, DPT and visual inspection. In addition to functional checks for some of the components, ferrography, vibration monitoring and thermography etc are also utilized for rotating equipment. The SSCs where unacceptable indications are revealed by ISI are repaired, replaced or isolated. The base line data generated during Pre-Service inspection is used for comparing and trending of observations. The observations made during ISI are subjected to thorough review and analysis by qualified experts to obtain assurance that unacceptable degradation in component quality is not occurring and it remains fit for service. The containment system of a NPP plays a crucial role in minimizing dose to the public in case of an accident situation. The integrity of Primary and Secondary Containment is assessed by conducting integrated <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tests</b> in every Biannual Shut Down. The concrete structure is also subjected to NDT checks on a specified frequency to ensure continued healthiness. Indian nuclear power plants have accumulated an operating experience of more than 380 reactor years of operation. Over the years, the programmes for surveillance, condition monitoring and in-service inspections have been improved significantly and match with best in the industry. As a result, there has been no major age related failure in any of the important SSCs and thus continued safe and reliable operation of NPPs is assured. This paper brings out the ISI & health monitoring methodology adopted at Indian NPPs, to ensure safe and reliable operation...|$|R

BackgroundLSG is a multipurpose bariatric/metabolic {{procedure with}} effectiveness proven through the intermediate term. Staple-line leak is a severe complication of LSG {{for which no}} definitive method of prevention has been identified. MethodsThe systematic review study design was employed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement screening guidelines. Inclusion criteria centered on variables potentially relevant to LSG leak: <b>leak</b> <b>rate,</b> age, gender, calibrating bougie size, distance between pylorus and gastric transection line, overall complication rate, and mortality. Analysis of variance models were used to explore differences in select demographic and surgical technique variables characterizing each reinforcement group. An omnibus χ 2 test followed by independent Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare <b>leak</b> <b>rates.</b> ResultsThere were 659 articles identified; 41 duplicates removed. Of 618 remaining articles, 324 did not meet inclusion criteria. Of the 294 remaining articles, 206 were eliminated (kin studies, those not reporting staple-line or leak incidence, those reporting discontinued products). There were 88 papers included in the analysis. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} between groups across demographic and surgical variables studied (p< 0. 001). There were 191 leaks in 8, 920 patients; overall <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> 2. 1 %. <b>Leak</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 1. 09 % (APM) to 3. 3 % (BPS); APM <b>leak</b> <b>rate</b> was significantly lower than other groups (p< 0. 05).
