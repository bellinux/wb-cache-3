5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

25|$|A can {{therefore}} be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition {{and it is a}} similarity transformation. Such a matrix A is said to be similar to the diagonal matrix Λ or diagonalizable. The matrix Q is the change of basis matrix of the similarity transformation. Essentially, the matrices A and Λ represent the same <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> expressed in two different bases.

25|$|The {{right-hand}} side constant requires four indices {{and is a}} fourth-rank quantity.

25|$|In physics, a scalar is {{invariant}} under {{transformations of}} basis. In particular, a Lorentz scalar is invariant under a Lorentz transformation. The individual {{terms in the}} sum are not. When the basis is changed, the components of a vector change by a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> described by a matrix.

25|$|Thus the {{differential}} is a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation,</b> between tangent spaces, associated to the smooth map φ at each point. Therefore, in some chosen local coordinates, it {{is represented by}} the Jacobian matrix of the corresponding smooth map from Rm to Rn. In general {{the differential}} need not be invertible. If φ is a local diffeomorphism, then the pushforward at x is invertible and its inverse gives the pullback of T'φ(x)N.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} SO+(1,3) on {{the points of}} N+ does not {{preserve}} the hyperplane S+, but acting on points in S+ and then rescaling so that the result is again in S+ gives an action of SO+(1,3) on the sphere which goes over to an action on the complex variable ζ. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> of ζ variable goes over to a unique Lorentz transformation on N+, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz {{transformation}} is a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation.</b> It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz {{transformation is}} called a Lorentz boost. In Minkowski space, the mathematical model of spacetime in special relativity, the Lorentz transformations preserve the spacetime interval between any two events. This property is the defining property of a Lorentz transformation. They describe only the transformations in which the spacetime event at the origin is left fixed. They {{can be considered as}} a hyperbolic rotation of Minkowski space. The more general set of transformations that also includes translations is known as the Poincaré group.|$|E
25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any <b>linear</b> <b>transformation.</b> Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, Ito and Terwilliger {{proposed}} a problem about some <b>linear</b> <b>transformations</b> A+,A-,A+∗,A-∗ on a finite dimensional vector space V over a field F, {{which can be}} seen as a generalization of the notions of tridiagonal pair and q-inverting pair (see Problem 1. 2). In this paper, we will introduce the notion of the shape of the <b>linear</b> <b>transformations</b> A+,A-,A+∗,A-∗. Our main results are the properties of the shape: (i) The shape is symmetric and unimodal; (ii) Let σ denote an anti-isomorphism from End(V) to End(V′) with V′ a vector space over F with the same dimension as V. Assume that the <b>linear</b> <b>transformations</b> A+,A-,A+∗,A-∗ on V satisfy all conditions of Problem 1. 2. Then the <b>linear</b> <b>transformations</b> A-σ,A+σ,A-∗σ,A+∗σ also satisfy all conditions of Problem 1. 2. Moreover, A-σ,A+σ,A-∗σ,A+∗σ have the same shape as A+,A-,A+∗,A-∗...|$|R

25|$|An easy {{exercise}} in linear algebra shows that any even dimensional vector space admits a linear complex structure. Therefore, an even dimensional manifold always admits a (1, 1) rank tensor pointwise (which {{is just a}} <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> on each tangent space) such that J'p2 = −1 at each point p. Only when this local tensor can be patched together to be defined globally does the pointwise linear complex structure yield an almost complex structure, which is then uniquely determined. The possibility of this patching, and therefore existence of an almost complex structure on a manifold M is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle from GL(2n,R) to GL(n,C). The existence question is then a purely algebraic topological one and is fairly well understood.|$|E
25|$|The Mona Lisa example pictured {{at right}} {{provides}} a simple illustration. Each {{point on the}} painting can be represented as a vector pointing {{from the center of}} the painting to that point. The <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.|$|E
500|$|This {{suggests}} that [...] is a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> from the vector space Rn to the vector space Rm. In fact, {{it is possible}} to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations. [...] Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||v||, where the constant is independent of v but depends continuously on a. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities. [...] In particular, [...] is a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation</b> up to a small error term. [...] In the limit as v and w tend to zero, it must therefore be a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation.</b> Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as v goes to zero, [...] must be a <b>linear</b> <b>transformation.</b>|$|E
