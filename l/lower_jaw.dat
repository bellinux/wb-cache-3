5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> that could slide {{back and forth}} to deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> bone, {{which carries}} the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw)</b> and quadrate (a small bone {{at the back of the}} upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|According to Ian Kershaw, {{the corpses}} of Braun and Hitler were already {{thoroughly}} burned when the Red Army found them, {{and only a}} <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{unlike most}} other catfishes, the premaxillae are highly mobile, and the <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> have evolved towards a medial position, with the teeth pointed rostroventrally; these are {{important}} evolutionary innovations. The fish rotates its <b>lower</b> and upper <b>jaws</b> to scrape the substrate. Of the two, the <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> are more mobile.|$|R

5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw,</b> and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Despite these taxonomic changes, Indraloris {{remained}} {{known from}} only two specimens (the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica) until 2005. Both of those specimens—an isolated first lower molar (m1) and a mandible (<b>lower</b> <b>jaw)</b> fragment with m1, respectively—come from Haritalyangar in the Nagri Formation. In 2005, however, American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil {{sites in the}} older Kamlial Formation as a second species in the genus, Indraloris kamlialensis. The species was named after the Kamlial Formation. In addition, they suggested that two <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third, larger species of Indraloris.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial upper and <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, {{giving it the}} name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment for the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E

5|$|I. hoggi (also spelled I. boggii or hoggii), {{named by}} Owen for a <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> from the Tithonian–Berriasian-age Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous Purbeck Beds of Dorset in 1874, has been reassigned {{to its own}} genus, Owenodon.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of {{replacement}} teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none {{at the front of}} the jaw, and the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Ocular hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, {{which lead}} to a similar facial {{resemblance}} between patients. Facial abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines.

50|$|Rodrigues & Kellner {{established}} two autapomorphies of Lonchodraco giganteus. Below {{the front}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> a short blade-like crest is present. There is a density of about six tooth sockets per three centimetres of jaw edge. There is a unique combination of traits: the snout bears a crest; the front part of the snout is rounded; the front part of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> is rounded; the margins of the front tooth sockets diverge.|$|R
5|$|The extant Alligatoridae are {{two species}} in the genus Alligator, and six species of caimans grouped into three genera. They can be {{recognised}} by the broad snout, in which the fourth tooth of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> cannot be seen when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The extant Crocodylidae are twelve {{species in}} the genus Crocodylus, and two species in other genera. They {{have a variety of}} snout shapes, but can be {{recognised}} because the fourth tooth of the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> is visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The impala has {{a special}} dental {{arrangement}} on the front <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb the fur {{on the head and}} the neck and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
50|$|The holotype, ZPAL MgD-I/117, {{was found}} in the Barun Goyot Formation dating from the late Campanian. It {{consists}} of a juvenile postcranial skeleton. Other specimens were referred: MgD-Ij116, a skul and <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> of a juvenile; MgD-Ij 118, fragmentary poctcrania and <b>lower</b> <b>jaws</b> of a juvenile; MgD-Ij119, a dentary and three neural arches; MgD-IjI20, two dentaries and loose teeth; MgD-JjI21, a maxilla fragment with four teeth of a juvenile; and MgD-JjI22, teeth.|$|R

5|$|The {{mandible}} (<b>lower</b> <b>jaw)</b> looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the jaw which houses the root of the lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is {{the complete loss of}} teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. CT scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is very thick and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times {{as wide as}} long. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The <b>lower</b> <b>jaw</b> is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a quincunx pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the <b>lower</b> <b>jaw.</b> There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
