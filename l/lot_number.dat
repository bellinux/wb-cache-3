5|$|By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752–96) was in {{ownership}} of <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 17. The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April17, 1788. <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 17 {{was bound to}} the west by the Yellow Banks and the South Branch Potomac River below, to the north by <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 20, and to the south by <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 16.

The location of Valley {{was not included in}} surveyor John Mitchel's plan for Romney dated June 30, 1790, and the forested lands of Depot Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Prominent Hampshire County pioneer Peter Casey (1715–87) {{received}} the Wappocomo parcel, known as <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 21 of the South Branch Survey, from Lord Fairfax.

Nicholas Casey inherited <b>Lot</b> <b>Number</b> 21 from his father, and in 1774, Nicholas built the present mansion at Wappocomo.|$|E

5|$|In 1824 the Supreme Court {{relocated}} to Indianapolis {{with the rest}} of the state's government. Initially the Court shared space on the second floor of the Marion County Courthouse, before moving to the third Indiana Statehouse. In 1865 the Court was given its own building on <b>lot</b> <b>number</b> one in Indianapolis, where it remained until 1888, moving to its present location in the fifth Indiana Statehouse. As of 2012 the Court occupies the entire north wing of the third floor of the Indiana Statehouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the City of Troy {{bought the}} {{property}} of the Third Street Burying Ground for the site of a new city hall. This was the burial site for many of Troy's earliest inhabitants; the City had bought <b>lot</b> <b>number</b> 102 in Section N for re-interment of 146 graves. The Vanderheyden family and Jacob Lansing, founders of Troy and Lansingburgh respectively, were re-interred in Oakwood from private, family cemeteries. With these re-interments, the graves within Oakwood span the entire the history of Troy. Although it was a cemetery by definition, Oakwood quickly became a place for recreation and was used in its early days as a public park. In response to its popularity, many memorials include benches in their design, aimed to invite visitors to rest while enjoying their visit. So popular was Oakwood that in 1908 the Association began a stage service between the Oakwood Avenue and 114th Street entrances.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, an AZP event {{occurred}} in the United States in July. Frozen, pre-cooked mussels from Bantry Bay, Ireland were exported and intoxicated two people. It is estimated that each person ate between 113 and 340 grams of shellfish. Within five hours following the meal, each person experienced abdominal heaviness, vomiting (5-15 times), and diarrhea for up to 30 hours. Analysis of similar products with the same <b>lot</b> <b>number</b> revealed the presence of AZA1-3 with up to 0.244 μg AZAtotal/g tissue.

25|$|To {{cover the}} initial {{cost of the}} land, lots were sold at auction where wealthy {{citizens}} purchased graves on prominent locations overlooking the main entrance to the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows purchased <b>lot</b> <b>number</b> one. The cemetery was dedicated on September 7, 1843 {{in the presence of}} thousands of local residents who listened to a public address by Daniel Cady, Esq. Oversight of the cemetery fell under the responsibility of the village president and board of trustees while lot owners were tasked with caring for and improving their graves. In 1862, after nearly two decades of poor upkeep and minimal improvements, the village board of trustees appointed three commissioners to oversee the cemetery; Lorenzo Burrows, Lemuel C. Paine, and Henry J. Sickels. Upon their appointment, the commissioners hired the cemetery's first caretaker, Michael Hanley, who was responsible for maintaining the cemetery grounds.|$|E

25|$|Queens house {{numbering}} {{was designed}} to provide convenience in locating the address itself; {{the first half of}} a number in a Queens address refers to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or <b>lot</b> <b>number</b> from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th Street, and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern doesn't stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered cross-street. For example, Queens College is situated at 65–30 Kissena Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance is 65th Avenue.|$|E
