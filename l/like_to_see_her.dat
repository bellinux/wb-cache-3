500|$|To Soyer, {{near the}} time of departure, Florence Nightingale {{acknowledged}} favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks—he knew both women—show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: [...] "You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging." [...] When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied [...] "with a smile: 'I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'" [...] Nightingale, however, {{did not want her}} nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.|$|E
500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with {{not just because he}} is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
2500|$|Cowell: Daniel Evans – gave {{no reason}} though commented that Hylton [...] "threw it away" [...] with her last {{performance}} {{and that he}} would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> perform with more passion ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, it {{is quite}} true what Kisa said,' {{answered}} the queen; 'I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again. Perhaps, some day, she will return, and then you must bring her to me.' ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the steps}} {{he gave her}} his final instructions, and she dimpled and gurgled, {{obviously}} full of admiration for him, which was a thing he approved of, {{but he would have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> a little more serious.|$|R
60|$|After that {{meal was}} over, Mrs. Carr asked her guest {{which he would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>her</b> {{collection}} of beetles or of mummies.|$|E
60|$|That was {{all very}} good, but the steward would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> for {{that was what the}} King had sent him there for.|$|E
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. [slyly] She'd {{suit you}} better than Tavy. She'd meet her match in you, Jack. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> meet her match.|$|E
50|$|Michiru Hoshino is Hikari's younger sister. She is a sadist and {{she enjoys}} herself by inflicting pain on other. She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> sister suffer from using her new invention. She can turn her {{drawings}} into real life by using her demon-like power.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, my dear!' whispered Peggotty, 'tell {{the pretty}} little angel that I should so have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> {{only for a}} minute! And tell her that before she marries my boy, I'll come and make your house so {{beautiful}} for you, if you'll let me!' ...|$|R
60|$|Moreover, he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> casting her eye {{over the}} morning paper. She {{did it with}} a manner as though she thought the {{terrestrial}} globe a great fool, and quite {{beyond the reach of}} advice. And as though she understood and was rather amused at {{the way in which the}} newspaper people tried to keep back the real facts of the case from her.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not much}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> doing this, nor did I care to discuss our {{projects}} {{over the body}} of this rheumatic laborer.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! Please go! Mrs. Haney {{wants to}} race--I can see that; and I'd really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> ride--she sits her horse so beautifully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so; just so," [...] said Arabella, the meek. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> They {{say that}} she is very beautiful; don't they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Personally!" [...] {{said the}} squire, {{glad to have}} the subject {{presented}} {{to him in a}} view that enabled him to speak out. [...] "Oh, no; personally, I should not object to her, for I love her dearly. She is a good girl. I do believe she is a good girl in every respect. I have always <b>liked</b> her; <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> about the house. But--" ...|$|R
50|$|Adel (Aderu), dark-haired {{prince of}} Senan. As a young boy, {{he used to}} {{constantly}} bully Nakaba, particularly making fun of her red hair, because he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> cry. Later implied that he {{has an interest in}} Nakaba, but realises that her heart has been given to Caesar. Heir to the throne of Senan. Nakaba steals his crown and he says he'll never forgive her. Evidence suggests that {{he was in love with}} her.|$|R
60|$|I {{decided to}} take Milly into my confidence, and finally on the {{strength}} of that I got to sleep. In the morning I went to my hotel, had breakfast, attended to my mail, and then boarded a car to go out to Milly's house. She was waiting for me on the porch, dressed as I <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> in blue and white, and she wore violets that matched the color of her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jane? Oh! I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{out in her}} reckonings! I {{should like}} to have a laugh against her. What does she think, Marianne?' ...|$|E
60|$|This show {{of emotion}} quite upset Adrian whose nerves were delicate, and who being {{honestly}} {{attached to his}} mother did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> weeping.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lork, Mrs Richards!' cried Miss Nipper, {{taking up}} her words with a jerk. 'Don't. See her dear Papa indeed! I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> do it!' ...|$|E
60|$|An archway led {{out of the}} sitting-room into {{a smaller}} room, once the boudoir of a marquise, now Honora's library. This was in blue and gold, and she had so far {{modified}} {{the design of the}} decorator as to replace the mirrors of the cases with glass; she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> books. Beyond the library was a dining room in grey, with dark red hangings; it overlooked the forgotten garden of the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not mean}} to inflict her mercilessly on her relations," [...] said Flora, [...] "but I should <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> She is so like Blanche." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Seiji, who is kind and gentle, Hiroto is honest and strict and is sometimes acerbic with Kirari. Despite how he treats her, he truly cares about <b>her</b> and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> smile. Although he supports Kirari's feelings for Seiji throughout the series, he often worries about {{her when she}} faces difficult situations, and he is usually the one who helps her out. He is very intelligent and talented in household chores, which he teaches to Kirari to help her on jobs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Object, indeed!" [...] {{interrupted}} Teresa {{in a high}} {{voice and}} a sudden and utterly gratuitous indignation; [...] "how should she? I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is {{our only}} captive,' he said. 'The people will <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her,</b> {{and she will}} live in the lodge of the Fox, who carried her off.' ...|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. If {{there is}} not, the Ambassador will {{certainly}} {{have to be}} recalled. Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} such a party that {{continually}} grew up at Hollywell, for Mr. Edmonstone was so fond of inviting, that his wife never knew in the morning how many would assemble at her table in the evening. But she was used to it, and too good a manager even to be called so. She <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband enjoy himself in his good-natured, open-hearted way. The change was good for Charles, and thus it did very well, and there were few houses in the neighbourhood more popular than Hollywell.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I doan't know, lad, but I {{know she}} would be. I suppose it comes {{of her being}} a lass, but it beats me altogether. Why shouldn't she take it? other lasses take {{presents}} from their lads, why shouldn't Nell take one from her friend? But she wouldn't, I'd bet my life she wouldn't, and she wouldn't say, 'No, and thank you,' but she'd treat it as if I'd insulted her. No, it can't be done, lad; but it's a pity, for I should ha' <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> look nice for once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, as for that--it means nothing,' she murmured, {{with a look}} {{which some}} might have called cold, and which was the worst look that he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> upon <b>her.</b> 'It is pure sleepiness, Mr. Stockdale.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She pretends; but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> face if one {{brought her}} a chance thing to do. My eyes! if that isn't old Staples! I must absquattilate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you want}} some one along?" [...] asked Laura, who did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> brother depart {{in the company of}} such a looking {{stranger}} as Tom Shocker.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} could; and I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> try it," [...] said David, much {{impressed}} by the dramatic ability which Christie's usual quietude had most effectually hidden.|$|E
50|$|Darragh: Fainne's {{best friend}} and love interest. He does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Fainne use <b>her</b> sorcerers' gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> {{and begged}} {{her for the}} way I treated her {{the last part of}} the time there. I feel as if I could make my whole life a reparation," [...] she added passionately.|$|R
50|$|Taylor and Kylie {{arrive in}} Utah {{too late for}} the Olympic events. Taylor is upset because she would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> {{favourite}} Athlete, Alex Ryder, compete. Nonetheless, the friends decide to make their own fun by holding their own Olympics and going skiing. While skiing Taylor and a young man end up taking the ski lift together and strike conversation. His name is Alexander and they end up skiing together -but Taylor never sees his face behind his glasses and hat. It is not until a month later when she <b>sees</b> <b>her</b> picture in the paper that she realizes she had spent the day skiing with her Olympic crush Alex Ryder.|$|R
