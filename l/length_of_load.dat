40|$|Exercise on an {{isokinetic}} device involves {{three distinct}} movement phases: acceleration, constant velocity, and deceleration. Inherent in these phases are unique occurrences that may confound test data and, thereby, test interpretation. Standard methods of data reduction like windowing and other techniques consist of removing the acceleration and deceleration phases {{in order to}} assure analysis under constant velocity conditions. However, none of these techniques adequately quantify the velocity overshoot (VO) movement artifact which {{is a result of}} the devices resistance imposed to the limb. This study tested the influence of VO on isokinetic data interpretation. A computational algorithm was developed to accurately identify each movement phase and to delineate the VO segment. Therefore, the VO was then treated as a fourth and independent phase. A total of sixteen healthy men (26. 8 ± 4. 7 yrs, 1. 76 ± 0. 05 m, and 79. 2 ± 9. 4 kg) performed two sets of ten maximal concentric extension repetitions of their dominant knee (at 60 º·s- 1 and 180 º·s- 1), on separate days and in a counterbalanced order, on a Biodex System 3 Pro dynamometer. All the phases of the isokinetic exercise were measured in terms of their biomechanical descriptors and according to the developed algorithm, the windowing method, and a data reduction technique that eliminates the first and last 10 º of the total range of motion. Results showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the constant velocity phases found by each method: the largest segment was obtained with the windowing method; the second one, with the algorithm; and the smallest, with data reduction technique. The point of peak torque was not affected by none of the techniques, but significant differences (p < 0. 05) were found between the data including and not including the VO phase, concerning total work, time interval, and average <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> range: VO represents more than 10 % of the amount calculated in constant velocity phase. As a consequence, the correct removal of VO was suggested as a required procedure to adequately interpret isokinetic tests.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been done analyses to find global stiffness values of an umbilical cable, with mixed results or no results at all when subjected to bending. There have also been difficulties in finding a distinct stick-slip point during bending. In this thesis, several models have been examined to get {{a step closer to}} resolve these particular issues. To begin with, a very simple flexible cable has been tested to see if the program ANSYS LS-Dyna can provide good global stiffness values, then of course with the use of an explicit scheme. When this first analysis gave good results, it was possible to conclude that the program could handle analyzing long slender structures with good accuracy. Further it was also developed a model with the aim of predicting the stick-slip phenomenon during bending. Results from this model could imply that there existed a stick-slip point, only a short time after the bending started. Finally, a last model was developed, including two armour layers wound around a cover of polyethylene. Other analyses have had problems with the behavior of the tendons during bending, that is they have been spreading, and not been following a loxodromic curve. Different cable lengths were tested, showing relative good results for the axial- and bending stiffness, but not so good results for the torsional stiffness. In addition to be able to develop models that could give realistic global stiffness values, focus have been on reducing the CPU time as much as possible.
