In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color <b>lacquer</b> <b>line</b> for automotive painting. Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts, introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.|$|R

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a monomer {{used in the}} {{manufacture}} of many types of products, including polycarbonate plastic food storage containers (i. e., baby bottles and water car-boys), as well as the epoxy resin used as the <b>lacquer</b> <b>lining</b> of food or beverage cans and in some dental sealants. Exposure to the monomer has been reported to occur {{as a result of the}} migration of BPA out of these products when they are exposed to high heat or alkaline conditions (Brotons et al. 1995; Olea et al. 1996). Krishnan et al. (1993) reported that polycarbonate flasks leached BPA into media in the autoclaving process. Likewise, BPA is known to be released fro...|$|R
50|$|Vision - The {{successor}} to the Export and Session series drums. Vision drums originally came in 2 varieties: the VLX Lacquer finish drums and the VSX wrapped drums. Over time, the VBX (Vision Birch), VMX (Vision Maple), and VX series drums {{were added to the}} line, with the VLX being the only discontinued line. VSX and above drums feature two-ply heads and Uni-Lock tom holders (VSX and VBX drums are 900 Series, while VMX drums are 1000 Series). These drums feature new lugs and the new 900 Series hardware as standard equipment,except the vmx, which only ships with tom arms and floor tom legs. For 2011, the Vision line receives new badges and the VX, VSX, VBX, and VMX lines are succeeded by the VB (Vision Birch), VBA (Vision Birch Artisan), VBL (Vision Birch Lacquer), and VML (Vision Maple <b>Lacquer)</b> <b>lines,</b> respectively. Also, all Vision drums are now 6-ply drums, dropping the 6/8 formula from the previous lineup. For 2012, all Vision series drums (VB, VBA, and VBL) now come with Remo heads as standard equipment (UT Pinstripe on toms, UT Powerstroke on bass drums). These are made in China. The VML line was discontinued for 2013, making the VBL the highest-end of the Vision series.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{suitable}} core material we collected outcrop samples of the sedimentary succession in a field campaign (see Fig.  2 for location details). The outcrop samples might be affected by some weathering or diagenetic overprinting and therefore it cannot be guaranteed that they represent conditions of the subsurface rocks. The majority of outcrops are located close to the Al Khawd dam and only two samples of the Barzaman Formation were taken at the southern foothills of the Oman Mountains (Lat. 22.3041702; Long. 57.8264319), where the former alluvial stream deposits form complex systems of ‘raised’ or upstanding, sinuous, superimposed linear ridges and broad gravel sheets (Maizels 1987). To correlate T-logs with physical rock properties, it was necessary to obtain rock samples from the same stratigraphic intervals. Therefore, our sampling strategy focused on the sediments encompassing the uppermost 700  m of the succession. In total we took 25 samples of the Barzaman Formation, the Ma‘am reef sequence and the Seeb Formation. The thermal conductivity, effective porosity, permeability, and matrix density of each sample was determined. The rock thermal conductivity was measured with a thermal conductivity scanner (TCS, optical scanning technique). The underlying technique of the TCS has been described in detail by Popov et al. (1999). Samples were dried in an oven at 80  °C for 24  h before the thermal conductivity measurements were performed. A black acryl <b>lacquer</b> <b>line</b> was drawn on the polished and plain sample surface to avoid different mineral colors affecting the measurement. Additionally, we measured the thermal conductivity of water-saturated samples. For this, samples were saturated under vacuum in a desiccator for 3  days. The optical scanning technique is a transient method, which yields a continuous profile of thermal conductivity along the core axis of the sample. The mean thermal conductivity is determined as the arithmetic mean of all conductivities measured along the scanning line. To determine anisotropy measurements were made parallel and perpendicular to bedding planes, where developed.|$|R

40|$|The MODEST {{modeling}} language pairs modeling features from {{stochastic process}} algebra and from timed and probabilistic automata with light-weight notations such as exception handling. It {{is supported by}} the MOTOR tool, which facilitates the execution and evaluation of MODEST specifications by means of the discrete event simulation engine of the MÖBIUS tool. This paper describes the application of MODEST, MOTOR and MÖBIUS to a highly nontrivial case. We investigate the eect of faulty behavior on a hard real-time scheduling problem from the domain of lacquer production. The scheduling problem is first solved using the timed model-checker UPPAAL. The resulting schedules are then embedded in a MODEST failure model of the <b>lacquer</b> production <b>line,</b> and analyzed with the discrete event simulator of MÖBIUS. This approach allows one to assess the quality of the schedules with respect to timeliness, utilization of resources, and sensitivity to dierent assumptions about the reliability of the production lin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} laboratory {{results of}} titanium passivated and chromium passivated tinplate specimens <b>lacquered</b> in industrial <b>lines.</b> The <b>lacquered</b> materials were characterised and evaluated {{in terms of}} the chemical characteristics of the lacquer; its degree of curing; adhesion; porosity; corrosion resistance in synthetic food media; atmospheric corrosion susceptibility; and sulphur staining tendencies. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments were performed to assess corrosion protection capacity. Food cans manufactured from the lacquered materials were packed with sardines in olive oil and with tomato paste and shelf life tests were performed for up to 6 months, studying the inside of the cans by SEM and EDX techniques. Titanium passivated tinplate seems to be an acceptable alternative to conventional chromium passivated tinplate for food can applications. © 2005 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

40|$|A 61 {{year old}} male worker (Mr. T) {{previously}} employed on a <b>lacquer</b> coating <b>line</b> of a custom printing and packaging manufacturer contacted WorkCover during 2009 seeking help, {{as he was}} unable to work due to his injuries. More correctly, the pain, in combination with the amount and type of analgesic medication (including morphine patches, Vicodin, Gabapentin, etc) he was taking to control the pain of his injuries, made work impossible. Mr. T blamed his condition on his exposure to solvents at work, particularly methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). This was borne out by a test carried out in September 2006. On that occasion, Mr. T had visited his doctor after work as he was feeling very ill and near collapse. His doctor took a urine sample to test for MEK. The results came back showing a level of MEK nearly 450 times the biological occupational exposure limit (BOEL). Mr T would have been exposed to other chemicals besides MEK, as the lacquers with which he worked also contained xylene and toluene, which would have flashed off with the MEK on the line under the electrical heating elements. A definitive diagnosis of Mr. T’s condition was the first step in determining the extent of his disabilities and thus compensation. However, this was difficult to obtain and highlighted the difficulty a worker with unusual injuries has in obtaining a diagnosis. An extensive literature review with respect to MEK elucidated a number of avenues of exploration that eventually led to a definitive diagnosis. Some of the avenues explored were: • Studies that correlated urine concentrations to atmospheric levels of MEK; • Case studies of acute metabolic acidosis attributed to MEK, alcohol and recreational solvent sniffing; and • Case studies that showed neuropathies have been induced by MEK exposure along with other solvents that Mr. T had been exposed to, particularly xylene. Eventually, a dual diagnosis of chronic metabolic acidosis leading to chronic hypocalcaemia with underlying poly and peripheral neuropathy was finally made an...|$|R
