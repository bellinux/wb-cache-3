5000|$|Labex ReFi is a {{multidisciplinary}} laboratory where specialists in economics, accounting, finance and management, financial mathematics and law, from several institutions, collaborate. All these disciplines {{are concerned with}} financial regulation but from different angles, with tools, <b>language,</b> <b>incentives</b> and evaluation systems of their own. One objective of the Labex ReFi is to bring together researchers from various backgrounds to produce this set of [...] "useful" [...] research {{for the implementation of}} regulatory policies. This is an important issue because regulation has often been characterized by [...] "silo" [...] logic. Each discipline works separately and develops its own doctrine, without fully understanding questions raised by the interaction with other disciplines, which sometimes leads to erroneous visions and consequently unwelcome decisions or with consequences opposite to the effect sought after.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{language}} lies in expressing knowledge {{and that of}} knowledge in causing incentive to action. Different from language as representation and reference, the discussion herein takes language is expression that expresses itself its own nature first from which its meaning is revealed nondifferently. Moral language equally expresses its meaning but different from other sort of uses, the knowledge revealed by moral sentences with should/ought mode provides specific impetus to the incentive to do the duty the incentive of which is expressed by the moral sentence. Language and meaning are only intelligible beings that flash in our mind; mind is consciousness, is ubiquitous and flashes equally in the speakers and hearers when instrumented through tokens-that is through sounds/scripts/gestures/perceived data, etc. Flashing means the cognition expressed by <b>language</b> from which <b>incentive</b> and there upon impetus to a duty is caused. The reason for doing some action opposite to or against the expression and incentive caused there upon lies in imposition of the knowledge expressed by the moral language on our allegiances comprising our desires, fruits of our interest, etc. This, in nutshell, is due to ignorance for removal of which one should value the knowledge expressed by moral <b>language,</b> <b>incentive</b> caused by it {{and the performance of}} duty in accordance with the incentive proper. If our performance of duty follows the knowledge expressed by the moral <b>language</b> and <b>incentive</b> caused by that knowledge, it is good and if otherwise there is deviation, it is bad. Follow up of the force proper or the impetus caused by the knowledge revealed by moral language is natural and imposition of it on our allegiances is artificial and evaluation of good and bad, moral and non-moral respectively is made accordingly. A duty is the action we perform towards others as a moral agent and that is evaluated as good and bad on the basis of actions performed in accordance with or in opposition to or different from the knowledge expressed, the incentive caused by that and a duty followed consequently. Positivist???s type Verification criterion of meaning is not applicable to the moral sentences which are expressive of duty, basically an object of evaluation and are verified by the duty performed on their basis...|$|R

(2006) {{examined}} {{student mobility}} to developed countries {{from a human}} capital perspective and argued that students move due to the dearth of educational facilities in their home country. Studies by Gordon and Jallade (1996), Aslanbeigui and Montecinos (1998), and Szelényi (2006) confirm that quality differences in education between foreign and domestic degrees are among the main motivations for students to pursue university studies abroad. Van Bouwel and Veugelers (2010) uncovers a positive role for quality of education indicators in influencing both the size and direction of student flows.

40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} results of {{scientific}} research {{on the effect of}} adopting the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that have been published in the most prestigious scientific journals in the field of accounting at the international level and it identifies avenues for further research. Based on the analysis of a set of 67 articles published by the accounting journals that make up the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), published between 2000 and 2013, it is concluded that, as a general rule, IFRS adoption has a positive effect on information quality, the capital market, analysts' ability to predict, comparability, and information use. Nevertheless, this effect depends on some factors, such as country's characteristics (namely, the enforcement level) and companies' characteristics. Sharing rules is not, by itself, enough to create a common business <b>language,</b> and management <b>incentives</b> and institutional factors {{play a major role in}} framing the characteristics of financial reporting.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} utterances {{that do not}} contain a {{predicate}} (verbum finitum) {{in a number of}} varieties of the Polish language, including new types of Internet communica­ tion, along with their counterparts in the Russian language. The majority of the material in question has been collected with the help of Google search engine or comes from the author's studies on the colloquial <b>language</b> usage. An <b>incentive</b> for tackling this issue was the fact that such constructions virtually unresearched by linguists. The aim of the present paper is the study of contexts found in Polish colloquial language, on blogs and Internet forums which hamper or are conducive to the creation of structures which do not contain predicates. The results of the research can be summarised as follows: the verbs of speech, move­ ment and beating do not deserve any privileged status: they are simply left out more often than other verbs. The verbs that require a separate lexicographical description are those idioms or syntactic phrasemes which are of the Co X na Y? type. The list of constructions which would fall into such description is much shorter in Polish than in Russian...|$|R
40|$|The researcher’s {{interest}} {{in this study is}} in teachers’ perceptions and principals of the Integrated Quality Management System (IQMS). This study examines teachers’ understandings of this quality management and performance appraisal system, how teachers perceive the instrument used to manage and monitor their performance and the performance of their schools, and what lessons may be learnt regarding the implementation process of the IQMS. The investigation was carried out in three Butterworth District schools in the Eastern Cape. The researcher made use of qualitative methodology to obtain data from a sample of 3 principals, 9 teachers and 1 district official. Data were collected from these respondents by means of in-depth, semi-structured interviews and through document analysis. The study found that some of the teachers and principals felt that they did not understand the IQMS, and they complained that the system is fraught with many obstacles {{that need to be addressed}} in order to promote the effectiveness of teaching and learning. The participants also spoke of multiple factors that contribute negatively to this phenomenon, which include the fact that the teachers’ workload is increased by the IQMS, time constraints, inadequate training, vague and unfamiliar <b>language,</b> the financial <b>incentive</b> that is attached to the instrument, and the many structures in the implementation process. In addition, the system seems to encourage a bureaucratic style of management. Teachers and principals also suggested ways in which the IQMS could be structured by the Department of Education for greater efficiency in education...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge sharing (KS) {{has been}} argued {{to be the key}} driver of {{competitiveness}} for Multinational Corporations (MNCs), and the subject is well established within International Business studies. However, this study covers a new context of the new strategic Human Resource department. Human Resources role within MNCs has increased and it now plays an important strategic role within organizations. This requires certain knowledge to be present and shared within the department. Therefore, this study looks at how knowledge is being shared within the new strategic Human Resource department, {{often referred to as the}} Service Delivery Model, as well as facilitators and barriers that exist within this context. The study is performed through a qualitative case study of the Volvo Group, and through an abductive approach, it moves between theory and empirics in order to contribute with extension of previous literature and an understanding of KS within this new context. The study shows that knowledge is being shared in many different ways within the context, however; formal committees and meeting points play the most important role for KS, followed by other facilitators such as Information Technology, the corporate culture supporting KS, top management support for KS, job rotations and harmonized processes. Barriers, on the other hand, was found to prevent KS to some extent and included geographical distance, national culture and <b>language,</b> lack of <b>incentives,</b> lack of time to share, lack of understanding the value of KS, lack of integration of KS and corporate strategy, among others. Geographical distance was shown to be the most eminent barrier, however only to informal sharing of knowledge. Formal committees acted as a facilitator for formal sharing across geographical locations, however the geographical distance still negatively affected informal sharing across sites. The study contributes and extends previous literature both with an understanding of the importance of formal committees for sharing across sites, as well as a contribution with new empirical material and strengthening of previous literature.

40|$|In today's {{multicultural}} {{and changing}} world, competence in foreign languages ??assumes ever increasing {{importance to the}} economy and society. The role of both knowledge and learning is crucial, as it is directly involved in the processes of all forms of development and it contributes to the building of intellectual foundations, knowledge, skills and resources in order to manage future challenges. Furthermore, education is assigned with additional roles, including large-scale duties, starting from the prevention of possible emerging racism and xenophobia to the encouragement of active citizenship. In the early 21 st century, the Greek school is more different than the previous decades. As a mirror of society, it reflects contemporary reality, which is characterized by the pluralism of nations, cultures and language groups. Multiculturalism characterizes the modern Greek society and the modern school. At the same time it consists one of the greatest challenges of our time, since the recognition of linguistic and cultural diversity {{on the part of the}} modern school means abandoning the belief that the dominant linguistic and cultural version is the unique and legal form of communication. In today's multicultural society there is a variety of languages ??and dialects used in various social and cultural contexts. Under these circumstances, it must be redefined (a) the relationship between modern school and foreign languages taught, especially English, and (b) why their role is important to the whole educational process. The creation of a common space in order to live in concord, while keeping individuality and diversity at the same time, requires the acquisition of skills, which enable mutual understanding and effective communication among all parties. One of the dimensions of this communication has to do with the role of foreign languages ??and especially English in the whole educational process as well as the role of characteristics, including family background, determinant of foreign language learning in modern school. The field research, empirical in nature, was based on data collected by a questionnaire designed specifically for the particular purposes of it. It was conducted in schools in areas of the prefectures of Attiκi and Rhodope. The questionnaire was distributed to students following the required “permission” from the Pedagogical Institute of the Greek Ministry of National Education. The processing of the data showed that the family background, which combines high economic status and parental education, especially mother’s, facilitates english <b>language</b> learning. The <b>incentives</b> every child receives within his family, which shape his attitudes towards english language, appear to be more decisive than the abundance of financial resources, not only in their school success in English but also in their sense of "belonging" which, as a part of their social capital, constitutes the element that forms a subgroup of social cohesion facilitating and strengthening collective action in the particular school area and later in society. Students’ attitudes towards English foster the creation of a favorable climate among all members of the school unit strengthening mutual respect and therefore multicultural tolerance. This is fully in line with the association of english language with the elimination of discrimination and ethnic prejudice, mutual understanding, mutual acceptance and solidarity, firstly at school and then in society. ...|$|R
