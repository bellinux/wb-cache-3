5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

2500|$|Bono of the Irish {{rock band}} U2, {{a good friend}} of Hutchence, wrote [...] "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of", which is {{interpreted}} as an intervention with him. In a 2005 interview, Bono regretted that he had not spent more time with Hutchence. Bono's wife, Alison Hewson, had seen Hutchence prior to the Australian trip and noted [...] "he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> shaky to [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Maddux {{was drafted}} in 1982. When scouts went {{to observe the}} elder Maddux, their father Dave told them, [...] "You will be back later for the little one." [...] Some {{baseball}} scouts were unimpressed by Maddux's skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, [...] "I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country if only he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more physical." ...|$|E
2500|$|God, {{that was}} horrible. That was when Ray tried to top himself. I thought he <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> weird after the show—I didn't know that he'd taken a whole bloody bottle of weird-looking {{psychiatric}} pills. It {{was a bad}} time. Ray suddenly {{announced that he was}} going to end it all ... I think he took the pills before the show. I said to him towards the end that he was getting a bit crazy. I didn't know what happened—I suddenly got a phone call saying he was in the hospital. I remember going to the hospital after they'd pumped his stomach and it was bad.|$|E
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more plain {{than its}} sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, {{there was more}} glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger rear glass hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and heated rear window. The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|E

2500|$|Dickens {{noted that}} the {{graphics}} <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dated. Roberts was more complimentary, saying, [...] "You'll be impressed with {{the scope of the}} alien landscape". Next Generation praised the visuals as becoming [...] "more and more bizarre" [...] as Low goes deeper into the alien world. The reviewer for Maximum acknowledged that the graphics were stylistically outdated, but still considered them [...] "stunning". Young called the character animations [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "lo-res". Yee was also unimpressed, saying the graphics are [...] "a bit blocky" [...] and commenting that the characters [...] "lack fine detail". [...] Dickens felt the cut scenes animated by ILM were excellent, as did Yee, who said they have a [...] "truly grand, cinematic feel".|$|E
2500|$|Emerson {{first heard}} a Moog when a record shop owner played Switched-On Bach for him. Emerson said, [...] "My God that's incredible, {{what is that}} played on?" [...] The owner then showed him the album cover. So I said, [...] "What is that?" [...] And he said, [...] "That's the Moog synthesizer." [...] My first {{impression}} was that it <b>looked</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like electronic skiffle." [...] Without one of his own, Emerson borrowed Mike Vickers' Moog for an upcoming Nice concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Vickers helped patch the Moog, and the concert was a success. Emerson's performance of [...] "Also sprach Zarathustra" [...] (a composition most famous for its use in the 1968 film [...] ) was acclaimed. Emerson later explained, [...] "I thought this was great. I've got {{to have one of}} these." ...|$|E
