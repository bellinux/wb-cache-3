40|$|The Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health {{recommends}} expending 200 kcals "on most, {{if not all}} days of the week" (1000 to 1400 kcals/week) as {{a minimum}} quantity of exercise energy expenditure (EE) required to obtain health benefits. The ACSM recommends expending a minimum of 1000 kcals/week to receive fitness benefits. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of EE above and below 1200 kcals/week on health and fitness benefits. Twenty-six previously sedentary males and females (mean age = 47 ± 2 years), with at least one risk factor for CAD completed the 22 - 32 week endurance exercise training study. Subjects performed an initial health screening and treadmill test which included measures of heart rate, blood pressure, blood lipids, body composition at rest, and metabolic data (V 02, VE, RER) during the maximal treadmill test. Subjects began exercising with the Adult Physical Fitness Program at a self-selected amount of energy expenditure, recording heart rate, frequency, and duration of exercise on an exercise <b>log</b> <b>card</b> after every exercise session. After 22 - 32 weeks, subjects returned to the laboratory for a final evaluation identical to the first. The metabolic data from the initial and final tests, along with the data from the exercise <b>log</b> <b>card</b> was used to develop an estimation of energy expenditure/week. Subjects were then categorized into either 1200 kcal/week energy expenditure.

40|$|Inactivity is a {{risk factor}} for {{cardiovascular}} disease. The use of pedometers for measuring ambulatory physical activity is becoming increasingly popular. One of the potential benefits of wearing a pedometer is acquiring instant feedback. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether feedback from a pedometer would result in an increase in ambulatory physical activity. Methods: Thirty sedentary adults, six men and twenty-four women, (46 ± 12 years, mean + SD) and BMI, (30. 6 + 6. 1 kg•m 2, mean + SD) were recruited to wear a New Lifestyles NL- 2000 pedometer (capable of storing up to 7 days worth of data) for a total of twelve days. Subjects were divided into two groups. One group received feedback and recorded the number of steps taken four times per day on a <b>log</b> <b>card</b> for the first six days but not the second six days. The other group did not receive feedback the first six days but did the second. The order of whether or not subjects received feedback from the pedometer the first or second six days was randomized. Prior to the study, subjects were not given a recommendation as to how many steps•day' they should accumulate but were given the Surgeon General's recommendation on physical activity. The average number of daily steps for each condition was calculated at the end of each six-day period. Results: No order of effect (whether or not subjects received feedback the first or second week) was evident. Subjects accumulated (mean + SE) 7, 409 + 384 steps-day' during the feedback week and 7, 041 + 374 steps-day' during the non-feedback week; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 27). When feedback and non-feedback days were combined and averaged, there were no significant correlations between steps-day' and BMI (r = - 0. 33) or age (r = - 0. 33). Conclusions: These findings suggest that feedback from a pedometer resulted in a modest, yet insignificant increase in the number of steps•day-' in a sedentary, adult population when no target step accumulation was assigned.

40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} research {{power plant}} of the Department of Electrical Energy Engineering at the Technical University of Tampere consists of 69 solar modules in different configurations, 21 solar (SP Lite 2) and temperature (Pt 100) sensors, data measuring and <b>logging</b> <b>cards</b> (cRIO 9074, NI 9144, 2 NI 9205 and 6 NI 9217) and two weather stations with {{temperature and humidity}} sensors (HMP 155), wind sensor (WS 425) and irradiance sensors (CMP 21 and CMP 22). This thesis is about connecting these devices together and creating an {{easy to use and}} efficient but complex system which processes, collects, saves and provides data from the sensors to researchers. The main goal is to provide researchers with an easy access to the data from the sensors from extended time periods. In the thesis different options and methods to implement the parts of the system have been studied carefully before implementing. The main parts of the system implementation are the following: The data from the sensors are transmitted via cables and extension cables to the data measuring and <b>logging</b> <b>cards</b> which are connected to the local network. Sensors are either grounded from the cable or from the structure. In addition, a lightning rod was built and installed to protect the wind sensor and personnel. The data processing, collecting and saving implementations have mostly been done in LabVIEW. The data are processed by averaging the data to reduce noise and sending it at a 10 Hz rate to the host computer to be saved into a PostgrSQL database. A file-based system alternative to store the data was also implemented. A graphical user interface (GUI) implementation to the MATLAB was made to help researchers gain specific data from the database more easily. A public Internet site was created in the end for the system, and it offers limited general information to everyone who is interested. The system was successfully implemented and completed. It is running 24 / 7 and ready for researchers to take advantage. Everything in the system has been made with the focus that the system will be expanded, and it should be easy to do so in future. It is recommended to study and understand how the system works before expanding it...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation of flame propagation in a 3. 6 -meter Flame Acceleration Tube (FAT) {{by the use}} of optical probes for flame detection and dust concentration measurements. The experiments in the FAT took place in the workshop of GexCon AS at Fantoft, Bergen. Fellow Master Student Gisle A. Enstad, {{who took part in the}} shared experiments, describes the impedance flame detection method in his thesis. Flame detection and dust concentration probes were made. Preliminary tests were performed at the University of Bergen in the 20 -litre explosion vessel of the USBM type. The final design of the probes implements both the optical and impedance based measurement method. In the preliminary phase of this work, the FAT was equipped with instrumentation cables and power supplies for measurement probes and electrically operated valves. A complete logging system with cables, a <b>logging</b> <b>card</b> from National Instruments and software for running the experiments was also set up as a part of this project. Closed vessel experiments were performed with both maize starch and propane/air mixtures in the FAT. As the FAT was fitted with six circular windows at one side, the experiments could be recorder with a high-speed camera. A general trend in the results from the experiments was that the optical method detected the flame earlier than the impedance method. Video observations tended to measure the flame arrival time earlier than the optical method on gas and later on dust, while the impedance method were later than the other two. A thermocouple was also used as a reference to the other methods and it showed good correlation with the optical/impedance probe, as it measured the flame arrival time between the times measured by the two other principles...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{implementation}} of secure log file handling mechanisms {{in the light of}} recent smart card improvements. Initially, we examine how smart cards evolved from single application cards into true multi-application cards. Additionally, we present the most recent architectures (client application interfaces) that enable client applications to interface with smart card applications. Previous proposals for maintaining log files in smart cards are very limited and mostly theoretical. We examine those most related to smart cards along with presenting the very few real world examples of log files. We go on to examine the new events that required logging along with the requirements of the entities involved. Subsequently, we describe an ideal event-logging model for a multi-application smart card environment. To meet the identified requirements, we describe the details of a smart card entity that is responsible for dynamically updating the smart <b>card</b> <b>log</b> files. In that context, along with providing adequate log file space management, we propose a possible standard log file format for smart cards. In the core part of the thesis we describe three different smart <b>card</b> <b>log</b> file download protocols, the selection of which depends on the requirements of the entities involved. These protocols download audit data to another entity that does not suffer from immediate storage restrictions. Finally, we describe implementation details and performance measurements of both the log file download protocol and the standard log file format in two of the most advanced multi application smart cards...|$|R

Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and <b>logged</b> in a <b>card</b> filing system.

40|$|Version 2. 9 - 'Venster' Thursday 31 st December, 2015 Hot on {{the heels}} of the {{previous}} release comes v 2. 9 codenamed Venster (Dutch for window). This release has a specific focus on fixing all the known issues with Sonic Pi running on Windows. If you've tried Sonic Pi on Windows before and had issues, make sure to try it again with v 2. 9. If you're still having issues on Windows please do let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible. For all you Raspberry Pi and Mac OS X users - you're not left out. Sonic Pi is just as stable as it was before (if not more stable) and v 2. 9 comes with a surprising amount of tweaks and features for its short 1 month development cycle. There's two new FX to play with: tanh and gverb as well as a heavily revamped logging system which is much clearer about printing which opts are actually being used for your synths and samples. Finally, we now include of all the published MagPi magazine articles in the tutorial. We also now have Hungarian and Norwegian translations of the GUI. Happy Live Coding! Breaking Changes Rename fn invert_chord to chord_invert Sampler no longer mixes rate: and pitch_stretch: opts. It's now possible to set the rate: independent of the pitch: modification caused by pitch_stretch. New Fns block_duration - returns the duration of the given block in seconds (not scaled with the BPM). block_slept? - returns true if the contents of the block slept or synced. synth_names - returns a list of all the available synths reset_mixer! - resets the main mixer back to its default values. sample_free - unload a sample from memory to free up memory usage. sample_free_all - unload all samples from memory. use_octave - similar to use_transpose but for whole octaves. with_octave - similar to with_transpose but for whole octaves. use_merged_sample_defaults - similar to use_merged_synth_defaults but for samples with_merged_sample_defaults - similar to with_merged_synth_defaults but for samples use_cent_tuning - uniformly tune all subsequent notes in cents with_cent_tuning - uniformly tune all notes in cents within the block Synths & FX New FX tanh - for more distortion goodness. New FX gverb - a different reverb FX to play with. GUI Synths and samples now also log defaults set by use_synth_defaults and friends. Opts are logged in the order they were defined with local opts first followed by inherited opts. BPM scaling is now accounted for in logging vals. Log metadata such as run number and time is now printed in a more code-like way: as a hash of key value pairs. C-k will now kill multiple lines if lines end with,. When saving a buffer a. txt extension is automatically added to the file name if none specified. Add Hungarian and Norwegian translations of GUI. Add Spanish translation of tutorial. Add title to main window - enables Sonic Pi to be selected in screensharing app lists such as Google Hangouts and OBS. Add autocompletion for tuning systems. Documentation Add 8 complete MagPi magazine articles to the tutorial in appendix A. Add new example 'ambient experiment' by Darin Wilson. Add new example 'chord inversions' by Adrian Cheater. Change tutorial license to CC-BY-SA 4. 0. Add instructions for compiling and building on Windows. Many, many minor tweaks and improvements. Improvements Add sync: opt to live_loop and in_thread. This now syncs the live loop once on creation. Similar to the delay: opt. If both sync: and delay: are specified then the delay happens before the sync. The synth fn can now play chords with the notes: opt such as: synth :dsaw, notes: (chord :e 3, :minor). This will return a single controllable synth node representing all the notes similar to play_chord. BPM scaling and other normalisation is now honoured when controlling nodes The on: opt is now honoured when playing chords. Samplers sound signal now bypasses filter envelope when not used. It is now possible to use externally defined FX synths by passing a string as the FX name: with_fx "my_shiny_effect". This needs to be loaded manually via load_synthdefs. OS X now supports rates other than 44. 1 k provided they are similar for both audio in and out. Run code in ~/. sonic-pi/init. rb on launch if it exists. If environment variable SONIC_PI_HOME is set it will be used over ~ as the root of the user's. sonic-pi directory (used to auto-save files and store <b>logs).</b> Default sound <b>card</b> selection is now honoured on Raspberry Pi - so you may now use your IQaudIO hat (or similar) out of the box. Bugfixes Fix number of synth validation errors. Fix sporadically failing boot issues on Windows Add auto-reboot functionality for audio server. This now detects errors in the server (such as a killed or zombied process) and automatically reboots it to enable Sonic Pi to continue without a full restart. Reboots automatically reload all loaded samples and synthdefs. sample_duration now correctly takes account of TL defaults set by use_sample_defaults. Sampler opts pitch_stretch, beat_stretch and rpitch can now be used in TL defaults...|$|R
