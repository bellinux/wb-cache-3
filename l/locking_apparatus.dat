40|$|The first low {{frequency}} facility (LFF) data are presented; {{the main purpose}} of the LFF is to study the pendulum thermal noise around 10 Hz. The displacement noise floor is at the level of 10 - 13 m Hz - 1 / 2 at 10 Hz, and at about 11 Hz enters the 10 - 14 m Hz - 1 / 2 sensitivity region; this level is compatible with the electronic noise of the drivers of the actuators used to <b>lock</b> the <b>apparatus.</b> The calibration method and the seismic noise contribution are discussed...|$|R

In his evidence to the enquiry, he described this as a [...] "treadle failure", but it was ruled that the lock-up had been due to his operation of two signals in the wrong order. He was able to clear the interlocking in this case without requiring permission from any other box.|$|R

50|$|Asperoteuthis acanthoderma {{is a large}} {{species of}} squid {{belonging}} to the family Chiroteuthidae. It is characterised by the tiny, pointed tubercules present on its skin and a Y-shaped groove in the funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
50|$|A. aldrichi is characterised {{by several}} unique {{morphological}} features. It has an unusual funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> which contains a boomerang-shaped groove. Its fins {{are separated from}} each other and possess posterior lobes. The ink sac contains a dumbbell-shaped photophore.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes an {{intermediate}} siding is provided on the single line section, and the token itself, or a key {{fixed to the}} end of it, unlocks the points for shunting there. The token is <b>locked</b> in the <b>apparatus</b> there, and the driver cannot retrieve the token until the points have been set to the through running position and locked again. In special situations where the sidings at the intermediate location are extensive, the equipment is arranged for the shunting train to be put wholly inside the sidings, clear of the main line; in this situation {{an intermediate}} token instrument can be provided, enabling the driver to surrender the token so that normal through working can take place on the single line while his train is at the sidings.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, {{addition}} of KCN at low concentrations of 50 – 500 μM induced {{a transition to}} State II in vivo, as expected from its action as an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transfer (Bulte, L., Gans, P., Rebeille, F. and Wollman, F. -A. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1020, 72 – 80). However, raising the KCN concentration up to 20 mM induced {{a rise in the}} maximal fluorescence yield and resulted in an extensive dephosphorylation of the antenna proteins. The latter effect was also observed in vitro with isolated thylakoids. Thus, KCN at high concentrations <b>locked</b> the photosynthetic <b>apparatus</b> in State I by preventing phosphorylation of antenna proteins. Further investigations on the mode of action of KCN allowed us to {{rule out the possibility that}} KCN per se would hydrolyse phosphate bonds of phosphoproteins. Evidence is presented that the effect of KCN at high concentrations cannot be attributed to a stimulation of the activity of the LHC-phosphatase, but is rather due to an inhibition of the LHC-kinase. The mechanism by which KCN prevents activation of the kinase is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|While {{attempting}} {{to allow the}} South London train into the station, Childs made his third mistake; he attempted to clear the home signal for this train before setting the points correctly. This again caused the Sykes <b>apparatus</b> to <b>lock</b> up, and, on this occasion, {{it would have to}} be released by Battersea Pier box. Childs sent the bell signal, but (his fourth mistake), he pressed the wrong release button, leaving the <b>apparatus</b> <b>locked.</b> Rather than attempting the release again, or contacting Battersea Pier by telephone to investigate the problem, Childs assumed the apparatus had failed, and decided to open the case and reset it manually. He was permitted to do this by the regulations then in force, but this procedure should only have been used in an emergency. While resetting the signal slide for the South London train, Childs inadvertently also cleared the interlock for the London Bridge train, which was still standing at the home signal. This caused the block indicator at Pouparts Junction to return to [...] "Line Clear", as it was not being held on by the switch-hook circuit.|$|R
50|$|Six major {{forms of}} the funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> are {{recognised}} among teuthids (lazy-T shape, inverted-T shape, straight shape, triangular shape, oval with tragus and/or antitragus, and oval shape) and several more {{are found in the}} sepioids (including the boomerang shape and keyhole shape).|$|E
5000|$|The Cycloteuthidae are {{a family}} in the order Teuthida, {{comprising}} two genera. While physically dissimilar, molecular evidence supports the relatedness of the genera. The family is found primarily in mesopelagic tropical to subtropical waters. Cycloteuthidae are characterised by a triangular funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Asperoteuthis mangoldae, {{previously}} {{known as}} Asperoteuthis sp. A, is a chiroteuthid squid known {{only from the}} waters off the Hawaiian Islands. It differs from the closely related Asperoteuthis acanthoderma in lacking integumental tubercles and elongate fins. This species also possesses a characteristic curved groove in its funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{while the}} mirrors may enforce nodes on the allowed {{electric}} fields {{to force a}} null result of the MM test, it remains possible that the velocity of propagation of the amplitude function (which is the velocity of energy propagation) within the apparatus travels at a speed of C {{with respect to a}} preferred frame only. A non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test is thus possible, and such a test is therefore a critical new test for space-time theory. A group velocity equivalent of the MM test is possible with the recently developed technology of ultrashort laser pulses One hundred and fifty femtosecond laser pulses of fundamental angular frequency &omega; can be split in two by a beam splitter, sent through two mutually perpendicular paths and recombined. The recombined pulse can be sent through a non-linear doubling crystal to produce second harmonic (2&omega;) photons, and then through a filter to eliminate the fundamental. (Here, the entire fringe pattern passes through the doubling crystal.) The 2&omega; photon intensity can be monitored over time. Since the number of 2&omega; photons produced in the doubling crystal is nonlinear, many more photons will be produced if the two pulses arrive at the crystal simultaneously than will be produced if the two pulses arrive separately. Thus by measuring the number of 2&omega; photons produced, it is possible to measure the relative arrival time of the two pulses. If the velocity of energy propagation is C with respect to the ether, as proposed here, rotation of the device will cause a shift in the relative arrival time (following the traditional MM arguments), and this will cause a change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. If the Einstein or Lorentz theory is more representative of nature, the relative arrival time of the pulses will not change during rotation, {{and there will be no}} change in the number of 2&omega; photons produced by the crystal. Since it is known that if the path lengths of the two apparatus arms are held fixed, no fringe shift is observed, this information can be used to lock the path lengths to a constant relative value by sending a continuous wave HeNe laser beam into the apparatus through a dichroic beam splitter, detecting the interference pattern of the HeNe beam, and using a piezoelectric spacer to lock the interference pattern onto a single fringe. Thus with such a <b>locked</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the Earth’s rotation can rotate the device. The phase of reflected light is dependent upon frequency, both in metallic and dielectric mirrors, but this effect can be overcome for the proposed test. Efforts in the last ten years on ultrafast laser pulse generation have relied on the development of mirrors that reflect ultrafast pulses without broadening them to any significant extent. The relevant point is that the mirrors have flat amplitude and phase response over the bandwidth of the pulses. Such mirrors have already been developed for the pulse lengths required for a group velocity equivalent of the MM test. Note that while the axioms presented herein do allow for a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test, the axioms proposed herein do not require a non-null result. It is, of course, possible that the MM apparatus mirrors affect the group velocity of light as well. While it is best for theories to make firm predictions upon which they can be judged, in this case the theory proposed herein merely allows a non-null result of a group velocity equivalent of the MM test; no firm prediction can be made; the test is equivocal. But the Einstein and Lorentz theories do not allow a non-null result, so should a non-null result be experimentally obtained, it would be strong evidence that the best theory of space and time is that proposed herein.|$|R
50|$|The funnel-mantle <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> is a {{structure}} {{found in many}} cephalopods that connects the mantle and hyponome (funnel) and restricts their movement relative to each other. It consists of two interlocking components: one located on the mantle (often fibrous) {{and the other on}} the funnel (often cartilagenous). The apparatus may permit some anterior-posterior displacement or prevent movement altogether.|$|E
50|$|The funnel <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> is oval; its {{cartilage}} is ear-shaped {{with one}} or two projections and a central depression. In Grilmalditeuthis, the apparatus is fused (but nuchal articulation is free); in Chiroteuthis both the tragus and antitragus are present, while in Planctoteuthis, only the antitragus is present. Also absent in Planctoteuthis are the funnel valve, tentacle pads, and distal suckers on the fourth arms.|$|E
5000|$|In argonauts, {{the male}} {{transfers}} the spermatophores {{to the female}} by putting its hectocotylus into a cavity in the mantle of the female, called the pallial cavity. This is the only contact {{the male and female}} have with each other during copulation, and it can be at a distance. During copulation, the hectocotylus breaks off from the male. The funnel-mantle <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> on the hectocotylus keeps it lodged in the pallial cavity of the female.|$|E
50|$|The funnel {{is found}} under {{the head and}} the <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> has a deep, curved groove and an angled {{posterior}} pit. The mantle margin is detached from the head, and the neck cartilage is either free or fused. On the underside, the mantle shield is confined to the anterior part of the mantle. The fins are quite short and {{are attached to the}} posterior part of the mantle from which they bulge forwards. The mantle length in the adult female is about 25 millimetres.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the middle}} space is overcrowded, {{it may be}} {{impossible}} to properly close and lock the first door, thereby also {{making it impossible to}} open the second door, which of course is the only way by which people, vehicles or materials can successfully exit the controlled area. Even when the sally port has overrides installed within the door controls and <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the size of the middle space and the physical dimensions and layout of the door openings hamper quick egress of a controlled space through a sally port-type opening.|$|E
50|$|The hooked squid, family Onychoteuthidae, {{currently}} comprise approximately 20-25 species (several {{known from}} only single life stages and thus unconfirmed), in {{six or seven}} genera. They range in mature mantle length from 7 cm to a suggested length of 2 m for the largest member, Onykia robusta. The family is characterised {{by the presence of}} hooks only on the tentacular clubs, a simple, straight, funnel-mantle <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and a 'step' inside the jaw angle of the lower beak. With the exception of the Arctic Ocean, the family is found worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The mantle is {{cylindrical}} with a width 15 to 25% of {{the mantle}} length. It is widest {{in the front}} region except in gravid females. The funnel-mantle <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> (cartilaginous structure connecting the funnel to the mantle) is T-shaped, a characteristic of all ommastrephid squids. The funnel groove (depression on the bottom front part of the mantle where the funnel rests) is smooth and lacks foveola (pockets of skin found in ommastrephid squids of the subfamily Ommastrephinae). The fins are rhomboidal in shape, with a width of around 45 to 60% of the mantle length.|$|E
50|$|Argonauts {{are found}} in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters worldwide; {{they live in the}} open ocean, i.e. they are pelagic. Like most octopuses, they have a rounded body, eight arms and no fins. However, unlike most octopuses, argonauts live close to the sea surface rather than on the seabed. Argonauta species are characterised by very large eyes and small distal webs. The funnel-mantle <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus</b> is a major diagnostic feature of this taxon. It consists of knob-like cartilages in the mantle and corresponding depressions in the funnel. Unlike the closely allied genera Ocythoe and Tremoctopus, Argonauta species lack water pores.|$|E
50|$|Their arms do {{not possess}} lateral {{membranes}} and have 9 to 27 suckers on the ventral sucker series and 10 to 25 suckers on the dorsal sucker series. The left and right third arms have protective membranes greater in width than the arm width. The hectocotylus develops from {{the left or right}} fourth arm. Another distinguishing characteristic of O. bartramii is the presence of 4 to 7 toothed suckers on the tentacular club, near the nearest carpal suckers of the carpal <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This is especially useful in differentiating it from the orangeback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis pteropus).|$|E
50|$|The skin is {{rough and}} covered with small, conical tubercules on round plaques. The dark red or purple pigment is found in densely packed chromatophores {{but there are no}} photophores present on the skin. However, each eye has a large {{crescent}} shaped photophore. The head is separated from the mantle by a collar. The funnel is widely connical with a recurved end. The funnel attaches to the mantle with a <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The funnel component has the form of a human ear, while the mantle component is shaped like a human nose. Like most squids, the eyes are large and highly developed, with relatively large lobes of the brain dedicated to their control. The posterior end of the mantle has a heart-shaped fin, which extends three quarters of the way along the mantle.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{morphological}} features distinguish members of Myopsina {{from those of}} its sister group, Oegopsina. Some of the most obvious differences {{are found in the}} structure of the eyes: those of myopsid squids lack a secondary eyelid and are instead covered by a transparent corneal membrane, the opening of which is reduced to a microscopic anterior pore in most species. The arms and tentacles are ornamented with simple suckers (hooks are never present), with additional suckers usually borne on the buccal lappets. The carpal ("wrist") portion of the tentacular club lacks a <b>locking</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and a tentacle pocket is present on the head. The funnel has no lateral adductor muscles. An internalised shell is present in the form of a well-developed gladius, which is located dorsally within the mantle and extends for almost its entire length. In contrast to oegopsids, females possess accessory nidamental glands in addition to the main nidamental glands. They however lack a right oviduct.|$|E
