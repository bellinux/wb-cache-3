5|$|When {{observing the}} patient's {{spontaneous}} speech, the interviewer will note {{and comment on}} paralinguistic features such as the <b>loudness,</b> rhythm, prosody, intonation, pitch, phonation, articulation, quantity, rate, spontaneity and latency of speech.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in <b>loudness,</b> pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived <b>loudness</b> decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall <b>loudness.</b> Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
5|$|The <b>loudness</b> of {{the song}} is {{correlated}} {{with the size of}} the male {{and the quality of the}} habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, when a quieter male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping: females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male's song very loudly.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in <b>loudness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, jazz began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} rock music, and began using distortion and feedback, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Jimi Hendrix, who had strong links with jazz. The proto-punk band MC5 also used feedback and <b>loudness</b> and was inspired by the avant-garde jazz movement. Jazz musicians who have incorporated noise elements, feedback and distortion include Bill Frisell, David Krakauer Cecil Taylor, Gábor Szabó, Garnett Brown, Grachan Moncur III, Jackie McLean, John Abercrombie, John McLaughlin, Joseph Bowie, Larry Coryell, McCo Tyner, Ornette Coleman, Pat Metheny, Phil Minton, Roswell Rudd, and Scott Henderson.|$|E
5|$|Other critics view Motörhead as {{the first}} {{significant}} exponent of the movement and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal. Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer <b>loudness,</b> and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans. Motörhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour, and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends punk band The Damned. Motörhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} Japanese bands Earthshaker, <b>Loudness,</b> Anthem and other minor groups was also {{influenced}} by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England {{to be part of}} the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany, E.F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust and Nightmare from France, and Barón Rojo and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the <b>loudness</b> of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} subject to minor criticisms, at both the events {{surrounding}} the opening concerts in Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 10pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse. The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, {{and that there was}} no reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue. Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial losses due to the protest. In addition to the <b>loudness</b> of the band's crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the Dublin concerts.|$|E
25|$|Replay volume {{normalization}} {{also helps}} when listening to playlists or shuffle play where otherwise variations in perceived <b>loudness</b> of recordings results in uncomfortable <b>loudness</b> shifts.|$|E
25|$|But <b>loudness</b> jumps are {{not limited}} to inter-channel differences; they also exist between {{programme}} material within the same channel. <b>Loudness</b> differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud. Complicating this is that many broadcasters use (quasi-)peak meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived <b>loudness.</b> It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.|$|E
25|$|This {{analysis}} {{has been challenged}} {{on the basis that}} the LRA was designed for assessing <b>loudness</b> variation within a track while the EBU R128 Peak to <b>Loudness</b> Ratio (PLR) {{is a measure of the}} peak level of a track relative to a reference <b>loudness</b> level. Ian Shepherd and Bob Katz wrote that PLR is a more helpful metric in assessing overall perceived dynamic range which shows a trend toward reduced dynamic range throughout the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|To help audio {{engineers}} {{understand what}} <b>Loudness</b> Range their material consists of (e.g. to check if some compression {{may be needed}} to fit it into the channel of a specific delivery platform), the EBU also introduced the <b>Loudness</b> Range Descriptor.|$|E
25|$|Record companies, mixing {{engineers}} and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. The greater <b>loudness</b> {{is achieved by}} using higher degrees of compression and limiting during mixing and mastering; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. Hard limiting or clipping can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase <b>loudness</b> {{has been referred to}} as the <b>loudness</b> war.|$|E
25|$|With music sales {{moving towards}} {{file-based}} playback and streaming {{and away from}} CDs, {{there is a possibility}} that the <b>loudness</b> war will be blunted by normalization technology such as ReplayGain and Apple's Sound Check. Most cloud-based music services perform <b>loudness</b> normalization by default and may reduce the market pressure to overcompress material.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{continues}} regarding which {{measurement methods}} are most appropriate to evaluating the <b>loudness</b> war.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{a plethora}} of Japanese heavy metal bands formed. <b>Loudness</b> was formed in 1981 by former Lazy members Akira Takasaki and Munetaka Higuchi. In 1983, they toured the United States and Europe and soon started {{focusing}} more on an international career. In a 1985 deal with Atco Records, <b>Loudness</b> became the first Japanese metal act signed to a major label in the United States. Their albums Thunder in the East (1985), Lightning Strikes (1986) and Hurricane Eyes (1987) reached numbers 74, 64 and 190 on the Billboard chart. <b>Loudness</b> replaced singer Minoru Niihara with American vocalist Michael Vescera in 1988, in an unsuccessful attempt to further their international popularity.|$|E
25|$|This is {{exemplary}} of the <b>loudness</b> war {{and causes}} audible distortions in the music.|$|E
25|$|The {{stages of}} the CDs <b>loudness</b> {{increase}} are often split over the decades of the medium's existence.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic {{qualification}} of tinnitus {{will include}} measurement of several acoustic parameters like frequency {{in cases of}} monotone tinnitus or frequency range and bandwidth in cases of narrow band noise tinnitus, <b>loudness</b> in dB above hearing threshold at the indicated frequency, mixing-point, and minimum masking level. In most cases, tinnitus pitch or frequency range is between 5000Hz and 10.000Hz, and <b>loudness</b> between 5 and 15dB above the hearing threshold.|$|E
25|$|The book Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural History of Recorded Music, by Greg Milner {{presents}} the <b>Loudness</b> war in radio and music production {{as a central}} theme. The book Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science, by Bob Katz, includes chapters {{about the origins of}} the <b>loudness</b> war and another suggesting methods of combating the war, based on Katz's presentation at the 107th Audio Engineering Society Convention (1999) and his Audio Engineering Society Journal publication (2000).|$|E
25|$|A {{common and}} {{important}} symptom of MD is hypersensitivity to sounds. This hypersensitivity is easily diagnosed {{by measuring the}} <b>loudness</b> discomfort levels (LDLs).|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{have called}} for {{immediate}} changes {{in the music industry}} regarding the level of <b>loudness.</b> In August 2006, the vice-president of A for One Haven Music, a Sony Music company, in an open letter decrying the <b>loudness</b> war, claimed that mastering engineers are being forced against their will or are preemptively making releases louder {{to get the attention of}} industry heads. Some bands are being petitioned by the public to re-release their music with less distortion.|$|E
25|$|If the {{fluctuation}} rate {{is smaller}} than the filter bandwidth, then a single tone is perceived either with fluctuating <b>loudness</b> (beating) or with roughness.|$|E
25|$|Stress is {{a complex}} of various {{acoustic}} features, particularly <b>loudness</b> (strength and intensity). Other features such as duration, spectrum and pitch, are of lesser importance in normal speech.|$|E
25|$|Five signal {{descriptors}} were considered: RMS power, EBU3341/R128 integrated <b>loudness,</b> crest factor, EBU3342 LRA, {{and density}} of clipped samples. RMS power {{accounts for the}} signal's physical level, EBU3341 <b>loudness</b> for the perceived level. The crest factor, which {{is the difference between}} the signal's peak and its average power, is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the TT Dynamic Range Meter plug-in. Finally, EBU3342 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.|$|E
25|$|Analysis {{suggests}} that the <b>loudness</b> trend may have peaked around 2005 and subsequently reduced, with a pronounced increase in overall and minimum album DR (crest factor) for albums since 2005.|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} of hyperacusis, a frequent accompaniment of tinnitus, {{may also be}} made. The measured parameter is <b>Loudness</b> Discomfort Level (LDL) in dB, the subjective level of acute discomfort at specified frequencies over the frequency range of hearing. This defines a dynamic range between the hearing threshold at that frequency and the loudnes discomfort level. A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range is associated with subjectve hyperacusis. Normal hearing threshold is generally defined as 020 decibels (dB). Normal <b>loudness</b> discomfort levels are 8590+ dB, with some authorities citing 100dB. A dynamic range of 55dB or less is indicative of hyperacusis.|$|E
25|$|Hearing experts, such as {{a hearing}} {{researcher}} at House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, are also concerned that the <b>loudness</b> of new albums could possibly harm listeners' hearing, particularly that of children.|$|E
25|$|A calliope is {{typically}} very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There {{is no way}} to vary tone or <b>loudness.</b> Musically, the only expression possible is the pitch, rhythm, and duration of the notes.|$|E
25|$|A slide can be {{made with}} any type of smooth hard {{material}} that allows tones to resonate. Different materials cause subtle differences in sustain, timbre, and <b>loudness,</b> and glass or metal are the most common choices.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene of}} the {{confrontation}} between Brett and Jules went through several takes due to Steers making mistakes. Steers recalled {{in an interview that}} he had found acting difficult due to the <b>loudness</b> of the gunshots.|$|E
25|$|Research by Crystal {{emphasized}} the importance of making generalizations about intonation based on authentic, unscripted speech, and the roles played by prosodic features such as tempo, pitch range, <b>loudness</b> and rhythmicality in communicative functions usually attributed to intonation.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of {{tinnitus}} {{will include}} a hearing test (audiogram), measurement of acoustic parameters of the tinnitus like pitch and <b>loudness,</b> and psychological assessment of comorbid conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress {{that are associated with}} severity of the tinnitus.|$|E
