40|$|Oils {{from natural}} {{deposits}} and those {{produced by the}} petroleumindustry have a very broad range of physico-chemical properties. Viscosity, density, interfacial tension, and surface charge are among the properties which usually have an influence on the selection of an oil recovery technology and the selection of appropriate operating conditions. For example, the density of many oils {{is similar to the}} density of water, and their separation from the aqueous phase cannot be realized in a gravitational force field. In such cases, oils must be “filled” with a volume of gas, <b>light</b> <b>solvent,</b> or light solid particles to make them less dense than the processing water. One of the filling procedures is flotation, gas intrusion into the oil phase, a most popular separation technique used in oil recovery from aqueous suspensions. Froth flotation is a common separation process for the recovery of oil from oil sands (Miller and Misra, 1982; Oblad et al., 1987) and contam-inated soil (Anderson, 1993; Friend, 1996). In the froth flotation technique, two major separation steps must be accomplished: i) oil release from mineral matter, and ii) oil flotation from the slurry. Durin...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermoplastic}} {{development of}} an Australian coking coal was investigated by linking thermal swelling with changes in molecular weight of its pyrolysis products. Coal thermal swelling was investigated together with volatiles evolution and characterization of generated volatiles (including volatile tar and light gases). The molecular weight distributions of coal and its solvent extracts were measured by using laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (LDI-TOF-MS). Solvent extraction (by acetone and tetrahydrofuran (THF)) was initially used on the raw coal to aid interpretation of thermoswelling by volumetric expansion measurements. The removal of ~ 2 % solvent-soluble matter from the raw coal (the mobile phase) reduced its swelling extent during heating by up to 22 % (from 86 % down to 68 % and 64 % for acetone- and THF-residues, respectively). Volatile release after solvent treatment remained unaffected. This suggested {{that the majority of}} the coals swelling behavior could be attributed to the formation of heat-generated liquid matter (the Metaplast) during pyrolysis. Broad molecular weight changes were found in the solvent extractable component (metaplastic material extracted by acetone and THF) of the semicoke. Prior to softening (350 °C), the extractable components were composed of molecules mainly < 500 Da. The upper limit in molecular weight distribution of solvent extracts increased significantly to 1800 Da at the onset of swelling (400 - 450 °C) and decreased back to ~ 500 Da at the end of swelling (500 °C). The spectra showed that the volatile tar and acetone extract (the <b>light</b> <b>solvent</b> extract) consisted of similar repeating structures separated 12 - 14 Da apart. As the treatment temperature increased, the molecular weight distribution of volatile tar increased in molecular mass, approaching that of the acetone extract distribution (~ 600 Da). The THF extract molecular weight distribution was a mixture of 12 - 14 and 24 Da repeating units which only became apparent at molecular weight above 600 Da. The LDI-TOF-MS analysis of the solid coal showed that it contained a distribution of molecular structures centered at 2000 Da and spanning between 500 and 7000 Da. This raw coal spectrum also contained multiple repeating mass lines every 24 Da apart. Overall, these results suggested that the coal consisted of complicated structures which subsequently degraded into smaller fragments capable of forming a complex intermediate liquid phase and a distribution of lighter volatile tar species...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was focussed {{on the effects}} of <b>light,</b> <b>solvent</b> and substituents in the molybdenum-catalyzed oxidation of phenylmethyl sulfides with t-Bu 02 H and on the effect of light in the molybdenum-catalyzed epoxidation of l-octene with t-Bu 02 H. It was shown that the Mo(CO) 6 -catalyzed oxidation of phenylmethyl sulfide with t-Bu 02 H~ at 35 °C, proceeds 278 times faster underUV light than under laboratory lighting, whereas the Mo 02 (acac) 2 -catalyzed oxidation proceeds only 1. 7 times faster under UV light than under normal laboratory lighting. The difference between the activities of both catalysts was explained by the formation of the catalytically active species, Mo(VI). The formation of the Mo(VI) species, from Mo(CO) 6 was observed from the IR spectrum of Mo(CO) 6 in the carbonyl region. The Mo(CO) 6 -catalyzed epoxidation of l-octene with t-Bu 02 H showed that the reaction proceeded 4. 6 times faster under UV light than in the dark or under normal laboratory lighting; the rates of epoxidations were found to be the same in the dark and under normal laboratory lighting. The kinetics of the epoxidations of l-octene with t-Bu 02 H, catalyzed by Mo 02 (acac) 2 were found to be complicated; after fast initial rates, the epoxidation rates decreased with time. The effect of phenylmethyl sulfide on the Mo(CO) 6 -catalyzed epoxidation of l-octene waS studied. It was shown that instead of phenylmethyl sulfide, phenylmethyl sulfone, which formed rapidly at 85 °C, lowered the reaction rate. The epoxidation of l-octene was found to be 2. 5 times faster in benzene than in ethanol. The substituent effect on the Mo 02 (acac) 2 -catalyzed oxidations of p-OH, p-CHgO, P-CH 3 ' p-H, p-Cl, p-Br, p-CHgCO, p-HCO and P-N 02 substituted phenylmethyl sulfides were studied. The oxidations followed second order kinetics for each case; first order dependency on catalyst concentration was also observed in the oxidation of p-CHgOPhSMeand PhSMe. It was found that electron-donating groups on the para position of phenylmethyl sulfide increased the rate of reaction, while electronwithdrawing groups caused the reaction rate to decrease. The reaction constants 0 were determined by using 0, 0 - and 0 * constants. The rate effects were paralleled by the activation energies for oxidation. The decomposition of t-Bu 02 H in the presence of M. o (CO) 6, Mo 02 (acac) 2 and VO(acac) 2 was studied. The rates of decomposition were found to be very small compared to the oxidation rates at high concentration of catalysis. The relative rates of the Mo 02 (acac) 2 -catalyzed oxidation of p-N 02 PhSMe by t-Bu 02 H in the presence of either p-CH 30 PhSMe or PhSMe clearly show that PhSMe and p-CHgOPhSMe act as co-catalysts in the oxidation of p-N 02 PhSMe. Benzene, mesity 1 ene and cyclohexane were used to determine the effect of solvent in the Mo 02 (acac) 2 and Mo(CO) 6 -catalyzed oxidation of phenylmethyl sulfide. The results showed that in the absence of hydroxylic solvent, a second molecule of t-Bu 02 H was involved in the transition state. The complexation of the solvent with the catalyst could not be explained. The oxidations of diphenyl sulfoxide catalyzed by VO(acac) 2, Mo(CO) 6 and Mo 02 (acac) 2 showed that VO(acac) 2 catalyzed the oxidation faster than Mo(CO) 6 and Mo 02 (acac) 2 _ Moreover, the Mo(CO) 6 -catalyzed oxidation of diphenyl sulfoxide proceeded under UV light at 35 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years {{has been marked by}} high oil prices, {{apparent}} inability of traditional oil supplies to meet world energy demands, and a move towards evaluating untraditional (higher-cost) energy resources such as heavy oil, tar, and renewable energy from solar, wind, and nuclear sources. The petroleum industry has made major investments towards developing heavy oil resources, mainly located in Canada and Venezuela. The achievements of the thesis provide the industry with technology and methods to optimize heavy oil resources. The main objective of the present work is divided in two categories: (a) Modeling the thermodynamics of bitumen (heavy oils) and solvent mixtures, and (b) Optimization of thermal process. First part describes a systematic approach to model the phase behavior and viscosity of Athabasca bitumen and <b>light</b> <b>solvent</b> mixtures {{for a wide range of}} temperatures. The description of heptanes and heavier components (C 7 +) in reservoir fluids can be important for equation of state (EOS) predictions of phase and volumetric behavior. A procedure for C 7 + characterization of heavy oil based on crude assay data which are typically measured for refining and marketing applications is first described. Then a cubic equation of state (EOS) is developed to model the volumetric and phase behavior of bitumen and solvent mixtures. PVT data of pure solventbitumen mixture are analyzed and used to update the model parameters. Moreover, new technique for modeling viscosity of the bitumen and solvent mixtures is developed for a wide range of temperatures. The application of this approach for viscosity modeling is briefly described. The final EOS/viscosity model is successfully used to predict the measured PVT and viscosity data for the mixture of the Athabasca bitumen and synthetic combustion gas solvents. Finally, the developed EOS/viscosity model is used to calculate the required properties for the fluid model used by thermal simulators. The second section of the thesis provides new approach for modeling steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process. It helps to increase the speed of the computation in an optimization problem. In this approach SAGD is modeled using an isothermal black-oil (BO) reservoir simulator. The oil viscosity reduction caused by heating in the actual SAGD process is emulated by a tuned saturated pseudo-oil viscosity relation where solution gas-oil ratio is used as a “proxy for temperature”. In the black-oil formulation: (1) fully saturated oil viscosity at reservoir pressure equals the oil viscosity that would be attained at steam-chamber temperature in the actual SAGD process; (2) initial dead-oil viscosity with zero solution gas-oil ratio represents initial oil viscosity at reservoir temperature; and (3) black-oil gas properties represent steam at steam temperature. Upon careful analysis of the SAGD process, one finds that oil flows only along a narrow zone along the outer edge of the steam chamber. The temperature gradient within this narrow zone is perpendicular to the oil flow direction and is practically impossible to model with any precision because of the large temperature variation and dynamic steam chamber shape over time. The black-oil model solubility gradient also varies, analogous to temperature in a thermal model, from zero to fully-saturated with an associated drop in oil viscosity from initial oil viscosity to the viscosity at steam temperature. The proxy model saturated pseudo-oil viscosity relation used is found by history matching a full-physics thermal model performance prediction of oil rate, BHFP, and cumulative oil for a 2 D homogeneous model. It is found a singleconstant viscosity equation that yields a good match to thermal SAGD performance. The tuned pseudo-oil viscosity relation honors the measured initial reservoir and fully-heated oil viscosities. Its dependence on gas-oil ratio is not physical, but reflects the use of gas-oil-ratio as a transform variable for temperature, capturing the strong spatial variation of temperature and oil viscosity within the localized steam-oil boundary region where oil has been mobilized. The pseudo-oil viscosity relation appears to be applicable for a wide range of reservoir heterogeneity, injection and production rates, and well placement. Consequently, it should be possible to use the black-oil proxy model for SAGD optimization. Moreover, the section describes the detailed mechanism of the SAGD process for homogenous and heterogeneous viscosity along the formation using the developed fluid model from first phase of the work. Also in this section, detail analysis of solvent additives with steam in a SAGD process is studied. The mechanism is briefly described through series of numerical simulations and developed analytical approach in this work. It is also shown that under which condition the solvent-based SAGD is not efficient. Finally, Integrated-optimization of solvent-based SAGD process is developed. The optimization of reservoir, surface process and pipeline models are conducted to maximize the net-present-value defined as objective function. The work also provides recommendations for future research and development in this area. PhD i petroleumsteknologi og anvendt geofysikkPhD in Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysic...|$|E

In this work, a dinuclear cyanido-bridged Co/Fe complex, the smallest {Fe(μ-CN) Co} moiety at {{the origin of the}} remarkable physical properties of these systems, has been designed by a rational building-block approach. Combined structural, spectroscopic, magnetic and photomagnetic studies reveal that a metal-to-metal electron transfer that can be triggered in solid state by <b>light,</b> temperature and <b>solvent</b> contents, is observed {{for the first time in}} a dinuclear complex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microlenses made {{of hybrid}} organic-inorganic {{materials}} have been fabricated on glass substrates using a commercial drop-on-demand ink-jet printing {{system with a}} 50 „m diameter nozzle driven by a piezoelectric device. After deposition the drops have been polymerized by UV <b>light</b> irradiation. Viscosity, <b>solvent</b> evaporation, drop-substrate wetting condition and drop and substrate temperatures are the main parameters which govern the production of reproducible lens shapes. The shape and surface roughness of the lenses have been characterized by atomic force microscopy and profilometry. Their optical properties have been determined by light microscopy and spectrophotometric techniques. The printing technique can produce plano-convex spherical microlenses with diameters varying from 50 to 300 „m, focal lengths from 70 „m to 3 mm and f-numbers as low as 0. 6...|$|R
