50|$|A <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> {{is a type}} of {{railroad}} freight car used to transport loose bulk commodities such as coal, ore, grain, and track ballast. Two main types of <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> exist: covered <b>hopper</b> <b>cars,</b> which are equipped with a roof, and open <b>hopper</b> <b>cars,</b> which do not have a roof.|$|R

Open <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> {{are used for}} commodities such as coal, which can suffer exposure with less detrimental effect. <b>Hopper</b> <b>cars</b> {{have been used by}} railways worldwide whenever automated cargo handling has been desired.

50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad <b>cars</b> such as <b>hopper</b> <b>cars,</b> gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> obsolete. Because <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom dump doors (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R

In 2001 they've scrapped some of the extra rolling stock, along with the old steam locomotives, <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> and passenger cars.

50|$|With the {{construction}} of the coal facility, railroad <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> loaded with coal could be brought directly by way of carfloat, where a locomotive hauled the <b>hopper</b> <b>car(s)</b> off the carfloat and brought it up an incline and placed it in the elevated coal facility. The <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> had chutes on its underside and these chutes where placed over the coal bins by locomotive, and when opened, the coal would discharge into the storage bins (silo) below. These storage bins themselves were elevated above street level, and at such time when the retailers wagon or truck, located under the silo chute; the coal could be dispensed directly into the coal retailers vehicle.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hopper</b> <b>cars</b> are {{freight cars}} used to {{transport}} dry bulk commodities such as coal, ore, grain, track ballast, and the like. This {{type of car}} is distinguished from a gondola car (US) or open wagon (UIC) in that it has opening doors on the underside or on the sides to discharge its cargo. The development of the <b>hopper</b> <b>car</b> {{went along with the}} development of automated handling of such commodities, with automated loading and unloading facilities. There are two main types of hopper car: open and covered; Covered <b>hopper</b> <b>cars</b> are used for cargo that must be protected from the elements (chiefly rain) such as grain, sugar, and fertilizer. Open cars are used for commodities such as coal, which can get wet and dry out with less harmful effect. <b>Hopper</b> <b>cars</b> have been used by railways worldwide whenever automated cargo handling has been desired. Rotary car dumpers simply invert the car to unload it, and have become the preferred unloading technology, especially in North America; they permit the use of simpler, tougher, and more compact (because sloping ends are not required) gondola <b>cars</b> instead of <b>hoppers.</b>|$|R

[...] It began building <b>hopper</b> <b>cars,</b> constructed of US and Chinese origin components, in September, and delivered the first of them in December.

In February 2016, Vertex launched a subsidiary to lease railcars to customers who preferred not to own them. However, weakening demand for sand used in hydraulic fracturing in petroleum extraction led Vertex to decrease construction of its <b>hoppers</b> <b>cars,</b> which were designed to transport the sand, and lay off workers at the Wilmington plant in May, leaving the company with 221 employees.|$|R
