2500|$|Polygynous marriages play a huge role in {{maintaining}} the hold of gender roles across the continent of Africa. Even though African women {{make up more than}} half of the continent's population, women hold subordinate positions in comparison to African men. Polygyny helps uphold inequality between the two genders by creating a <b>legal</b> <b>bond</b> through marriage that binds women into a subordinate role. Women across the continent are responsible for a large portion of the production of farming (sustainable and cash crops) yet, men married to these women reap the benefits and are allowed to redistribute their gains throughout the family as they would like. Inequality between husbands and wives are common in countries where polygyny is more frequently practiced because of limited education. Polygyny continues to enforce the male domination that has been seen in societies all over with the belief that women are inferior to men with the exclusion of few matriarchal societies. In Africa polygyny was believed to be part of the way to build an empire. It was not until the post colonialism era in Africa that polygyny began to be viewed as unjust or taboo. According to Natali Exposito, [...] "in a study of the Ngwa Igbo Clan in Nigeria identified five principal reasons for men to maintain more than one wife: because having more than one wife allows the Ngwa husband to (1) have the many children that he desires; (2) heighten his prestige and boost his ego among his peers; (3) enhance his status within the community; (4) ensure a sufficient availability of labor to perform the necessary farm work and the processing of commercial oil-palm produce; and (5) satisfy his sexual urges.” Out of all of the reasons stated none are beneficial to the wives, but instead only beneficial to the husbands. In Egypt, feminist have fought for polygamy to be abolished, but it is viewed as a basic human right so the fight has been unsuccessful. In countries where polygyny is practiced less frequently, women have more equality in the marriage and are better able to communicate their opinions about family planning.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{subject on}} which more {{dangerous}} nonsense is talked and thought than marriage. If the mischief stopped at talking and thinking {{it would be}} bad enough; but it goes further, into disastrous anarchical action. Because our marriage law is inhuman and unreasonable {{to the point of}} downright abomination, the bolder and more rebellious spirits form illicit unions, defiantly sending cards round to their friends announcing what they have done. Young women come to me and ask me whether I think they ought to consent to marry the man they have decided to live with; and they are perplexed and astonished when I, who am supposed (heaven knows why!) to have the most advanced views attainable on the subject, urge them on no account to compromize themselves without the security of an authentic wedding ring. They cite the example of George Eliot, who formed an illicit union with Lewes. They quote a saying attributed to Nietzsche, that a married philosopher is ridiculous, though the men of their choice are not philosophers. When they finally give up the idea of reforming our marriage institutions by private enterprise and personal righteousness, and consent to be led to the Registry or even to the altar, they insist on first arriving at an explicit understanding that both parties are to be perfectly free to sip every flower and change every hour, as their fancy may dictate, in spite of the <b>legal</b> <b>bond.</b> I do not observe that their unions prove less monogamic than other people's: rather the contrary, in fact; consequently, I do not know whether they make less fuss than ordinary people when either party claims the benefit of the treaty; but the existence of the treaty shews the same anarchical notion that the law can be set aside by any two private persons by the simple process of promising one another to ignore it.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 on firms with {{securities}} cross-listed on U. S. exchanges in order to (i) test the importance of the <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> motive for cross-listing into the U. S. market and (ii) measure the benefits and costs of SOX. The two research questions are interrelated, because a potential benefit of SOX is to increase the extent of <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> from a U. S. listing. We exploit SOX being an exogenous change in investor protection for cross-listed firms, which allows us to overcome self-selection issues that have made it difficult for prior research to answer our research questions.

Our event study evidence indicates that SOX’s costs exceed its benefits for cross-listed firms, but that incremental <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> does provide a benefit.

30|$|A key {{mechanism}} {{through which}} cross-listed firms improve shareholder protection is the bonding effect (also known as functional convergence). Cross-listing subjects the firms to {{the provisions of}} securities law and the accounting standards of the host country. Therefore, {{to the extent that}} the host country’s legal system and accounting standards are more stringent than those of the home country, the <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> hypothesis of Coffee (1999) and Stulz (1999) contends that cross-listing increases the expected costs of extracting private benefits for managers and, therefore, that cross-listed firms protect minority shareholders’ interests better. On the other hand, Siegel (2005) finds that very few Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions have been taken against foreign firms listed in US, which casts doubt on the <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> effects.|$|R
30|$|While cross-listing is {{typically}} {{found to be}} positively associated with corporate governance, the <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> hypothesis does not naturally extend to corporate social responsibility {{for at least two}} reasons. First, cross-listed firms generally carry out their business in their home countries (this is particularly true for our sample firms; see the details in the next section). Cross-listing does not subject them to the environmental regulations or labor laws in the host market. For example, it is unlikely for Baidu.com, a Chinese Internet content provider listed in NASDAQ (ticker: BIDU), to apply American labor laws to its employees in Beijing. Second, CSR calls for firms to go beyond the minimum requirements of law. Despite the various conceptualizations of CSR in the literature, CSR in general refers to firm actions that meet demands from stakeholders other than shareholders and creditors. This means that CSR activities are likely to be beyond the minimum requirement of law. Therefore, cross-listed firms may not improve their CSR practices through <b>legal</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|R

However, GDRs are issued predominantly by firms in emerging markets, while ADRs are issued mostly by firms in developed markets.

This analysis serves to dilute one of the long-standing negative implications of the traditional <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> account [...] that reverse cross-listings by issuers from jurisdictions with stronger investor protections into weaker investor protection markets exhibit abnormal negative price effects, allegedly because of market expectations that the foreign listing will facilitate conduct impermissible in the home market. More importantly, this analysis allows for a more nuanced understanding of the bonding hypothesis along either vector, and why firms cross-list into foreign jurisdictions, regardless of the receiving legal and regulatory environment. Those other factors include: the simple quest for capital, the possibility of higher initial valuations in capital controls-segmented markets and eventually higher secondary market values with the easing of such controls and thus enhanced global liquidity, the reduced cost ensured by listing in a less burdensome regulatory and enforcement environment, and a cluster of reasons which we describe as 2 ̆ 2 consumer-commercial markets bonding 2 ̆ 2, distinct from the legal and regulatory system bonding that has featured so long in the traditional <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> hypothesis.

40|$|Cross-listing {{refers to}} firms listing their {{equities}} {{on more than}} one stock exchange. Cross-listing is an interesting topic of international finance. This is because along with the deeper integration of the global financial market, we should see lesser importance of geographic factors. Thus, the motivations and effects of listing a firm on exchanges of different regions should have essential economic implications. The reputation bonding hypothesis suggests that U. S. cross-listing improves the information environment of a firm because of the higher disclosure standard and more analyst coverage. The <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> hypothesis argues that U. S. cross-listing improves the investor protection and corporate governance of a firm since the firm is under more stringent law and regulation. The firm growth hypothesis points out that U. S. cross-listing lowers the external capital cost of a firm and thus enables the firm to achieve a higher growth rate. Using a sample with 12532 firms of 23 developed regions from 2006 to 2011, this thesis tests the three hypotheses of cross-listing. Firstly, my empirical results show that a cross-listing on the U. S. exchanges improves the equity returns predictability of institutional investors. I find a stronger positive correlation between the changes in institution ownership level and future equity returns of U. S. cross-listed firms. This suggests that the information environment is improved after a U. S. cross-listing. However, the improvement in information environment exists only in non-crisis period. Secondly, the results support the firm growth hypothesis. The U. S. cross-listing event only has a positive effect on equity returns of firms with younger age and lower dividend yield. This effect becomes less obvious during the crisis period. Thirdly, the <b>legal</b> <b>bonding</b> effect of U. S. cross-listing only exists during the crisis period, when the financial market is volatile. During the crisis period, a U. S. cross-listing increases the equity returns of the firms form non-common-law regions, but not the firms from common-law regions...|$|R

Contrary to the predictions of corporate governance convergence theories, there is little evidence of convergence-related migration to a dispersed ownership structure on cross-listing.

In contrast, firm-level characteristics are more important predictors of a control change to a foreign owner.

40|$|Using {{the change}} in {{ordinary}} dividend payout {{as a proxy for}} improved governance, I show that cross-listing in the U.

I believe that their ability to pay lower dividends post-listing is primarily due to their ability to credibly commit to fair treatment of their minority investors, given their record for equitable treatment of their ordinary shareholders. They achieve this reputation by consistently paying out a sizable proportion of their earnings as dividends. I find that the firm-level governance of Level 1 firms, as measured by the number of closely held shares improves in the post-listing period. I find no such effect for Rule 144 a traded firms. My results also have important implications for the agency models of dividends. ...|$|R
