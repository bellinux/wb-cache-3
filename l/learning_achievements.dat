School meals greatly impact recipient children's education status by increasing school enrollment and attendance, decreasing drop-out rates, and improving cognitive abilities and <b>learning</b> <b>achievements.</b> Generally, sending children to a school in which school-meals are served offsets the financial and opportunity costs of schooling, and thus families are incentivized {{to send their children to}} school. Additionally, school feeding programs may serve as an incentive for students to go to school to receive food rather than missing out on food by staying home. [...] The increased nutrition status of children, as a result of school feeding programs, also enhances students' cognitive abilities and performance in school.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} study aims {{to investigate the}} direct effect of the intelligence capacity on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> and the indirect effect of the intelligence capacity on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> through listening and reading. This study employed the explanatory survey design. The sample, consisting of 112 students of SMAN in Bandung City, was selected by using the multi-stage cluster sampling technique. The research instruments were tests. The statistical test employed was the path analysis. The research findings show that the intelligence capacity has a direct effect on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> and an indirect effect on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> through listening and reading. The intelligence capacity will have a greater effect on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> if it {{is supported by the}} reading ability. The effect of the intelligence capacity on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> through listening is smaller than the direct effect of the intelligence capacity on <b>learning</b> <b>achievement.</b> Key words: intelligence capacity, listening ability, reading ability, learning achievemen...|$|R

5000|$|According to {{researcher}} Eduard Pogorskiy: ICT {{and communications}} {{technology can be}} a powerful tool for personalized learning as it allows learners access to research and information, and provides a mechanism for communication, debate, and recording <b>learning</b> <b>achievements.</b> However, personalized learning is not exclusive to digital technologies or environments. In the rhetoric around 21st Century Skills, personalized learning is often equated with 'customization' (as found in the business world), with digital personalization used to the frame the learning experience as highly efficient. Problematic in this is the discounting of the highly relational and socially constructed space well defined in the research on learning. Narrowing personalized learning to its digital form also raises the concern of the echo chamber effect emerging in (hyper)personalized online experiences.|$|E

National assessment is conducted across the country in five subjects each for Grade - 4 & 8 on sample basis after every four years. This report is meant to reflect the health of the education system for better understanding of the stakeholders. The report also aims at pointing out the pluses and minuses of the education system and the facts about students’ <b>learning</b> <b>achievements</b> along with recommendations on the findings for effective implementation. This practice is not peculiar to Pakistan, as the last decade has seen many ups and downs affecting national assessment at various subjects and grade - levels.|$|E
5000|$|Education {{is a key}} {{component}} in school feeding programs and global development because overall, a more educated person has an increased amount of opportunities in life, earns more money, and has {{a higher standard of}} living than an uneducated individual. School meals greatly impact recipient children’s education status by increasing school enrollment and attendance, decreasing drop-out rates, and improving cognitive abilities and <b>learning</b> <b>achievements.</b> Generally, sending children to a school in which school-meals are served offsets the financial and opportunity costs of schooling, and thus families are incentivized {{to send their children to}} school. Additionally, school feeding programs may serve as an incentive for students to go to school to receive food rather than missing out on food by staying home. [...] The increased nutrition status of children, as a result of school feeding programs, also enhances students’ cognitive abilities and performance in school.|$|E

There are so many kinds of examination faced by the students, one of it is national examination. Therefore, the national examination should be prepared well by the students, school, and parents since it is a tool to measure students competency of achievement which held by education unit in order to obtain learning confession and it is a requirement of finishing education level. This research is aimed to describe and differentiate the preparation of students with high <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> and the students with low <b>learning</b> <b>achievement</b> in facing national examination. This is a comparative quantitative descriptive approach supported with interview. The target of the research is students of SMA Adabiah Padang, with 327 students as the population. There are 80 students placed as sample.
