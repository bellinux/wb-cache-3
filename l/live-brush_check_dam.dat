40|$|ABSTRACT Debris flows {{are one of}} {{destructive}} {{natural disasters}} in mountain areas. Most of the debris flows are triggered by slope failure and landslide during heavy rain. Debris flows move very rapidly down slope and carry {{a large amount of}} sediment and wood from mountain areas to downstream open areas. As a result, the debris flows sometimes cause tremendous damage to inhabitants living in open areas. To reduce the hazards from debris flows, structural measures, such as <b>check</b> <b>dams,</b> are common practice. Recently two types of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> are used; one is a closed type and the other is an open type. These <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> cannot effectively capture debris flows, when the storage area is filled up with sediment. Their storage area for trapping sediment should be kept empty until debris flows occur. In particular, the closed type of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> is difficult to maintain the empty situation except the case when trapped sediments are continuously removed. On the other hand, open <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> allow finer sediment to pass through at lower discharge and coarser sediment to be trapped at higher discharge such as debris flow. Therefore, open type of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> may keep their trapping capacity. The effectiveness of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> for the prevention of debris flow disasters has been examined in several studies. However the knowledge of function of these <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> are still not sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effect of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> against debris flows through field survey and laboratory experiments. The present study is composed of three steps. The first step is to examine the effect of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> against debris flows by field survey. The second step is to simulate behavior of wood and sediment deposited behind the open <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> by laboratory flume experiments. The third step is to compare the function of a closed type and an open type of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> from the laboratory flume experiments. Chapter 1 introduced background and objective of the present study, including briefly reviews of the previous research related to this dissertation. Chapter 2 described case study of the debris flow control by <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> Debris flow events occurred in Hofu City area, Japan on July 21, 2009. The mountainous region in this city was selected as study area. The situation of sediment and wood deposition was investigated at the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in the Tsurugi and the Hachimandani River after the debris flow event. The field investigation results indicated that the debris flow event caused significant sediment deposition at the closed <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in the Tsurugi River and at the open <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in the Hachimandani River. In the Hachimandani River, wood pieces accumulated in the opening of the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> so that the accumulation obstructed the sediment transport to the downstream direction. In the Tsurugi River, on the other hand, wood pieces did not accumulate at the <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> but in the central region of the river bend. The upstream <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in these rivers had sediment deposition profile of around 2 o, whereas the downstream ones had deposition profile of around 1. 3 o. The ratio of sediment deposition volume in the downstream <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> to that in the upstream ones was 0. 3 : 1. The total amount of sediments trapped by the two successive <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> was estimated at around 9, 500 m 3 in each river. Chapter 3 simulated the depositional process of wood and sediment from sediment-water-mixture flows at the open <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> by laboratory experiments. The results show that the pieces trapped by the open <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> increases in volume with the whole pieces moving down on the fixed bed. However, trapping wood pieces at the open <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model requires sufficient number and volume of wood pieces moving from the upstream side. In the case without wood pieces moving on the fixed bed, most of sediment in the mixture flow passed through the open <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} small scale of pieces, most of sediment and pieces in the mixture flow passed through the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model. The ratio of the size of the opening of the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> to the scale of pieces is important for trapping the pieces. Furthermore, the accumulation depth of trapped pieces determines sediment deposition behind the trapped pieces. Chapter 4 showed a comparison between a closed type and an open type of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> by laboratory experiments. The closed <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model made most of wood pieces pass through the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model and most of sediment grains stop in the water pool behind the closed <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model. Therefore, closed <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> can reduce outflow of sediment but it may cause outflow of wood pieces to downstream areas. On the other hand, the open <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> model trapped 60 70...|$|R
50|$|A <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> is a small, {{sometimes}} temporary, dam constructed {{across a}} swale, drainage ditch, or waterway to counteract erosion by reducing water flow velocity. <b>Check</b> <b>dams</b> {{themselves are not}} a type of new technology; rather, they are an ancient technique dating {{all the way back}} to the second century A.D. <b>Check</b> <b>dams</b> are typically, though not always, implemented as a system of several <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> situated at regular intervals across the area of interest.|$|R

The <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> should be spaced such that the toe of the upstream <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> {{is equal to the}} elevation of the downstream <b>check</b> <b>dam's</b> crest.

For this purpose, a number of streams with many stabilized <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> which were more than 27 years old were selected. For each stream, three <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> (one at the far beginning (upstream), the second one at the middle and the third one at the far downstream) were selected. In each stream, a number of samples were taken from retained sediment behind the selected <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> and also original soil was taken {{from both sides of}} the same <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> Laboratory analysis on the size of particles and also texture of soil and sediment samples showed that in general, soils taken {{from both sides of the}} <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> were finer than sediment behind the same <b>check</b> <b>dams.</b> Comparison of particle sizes showed in all streams except Joobkhaleh (with extensive tree coverage) the performance of the third <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> (far downstream) in fine sediment retention is much better than the second one (at the middle) and the second one is more effective than the first one (upstream).

This research formulated a simple approach in estimating the carbon retention effects of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> in Yan'an prefecture of the Loess Plateau region of China based on <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> inventory data and benefit transfer approach. Results indicated that the large and medium sized <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> had retained about 42. 3 million tons of soil organic carbon (SOC) with a high spatial variability. This is a significant amount similar to about 1. 48 % of the SOC stored in the 0 - 40 cm soil layer across the whole Loess Plateau or roughly 4 % of the estimated carbon emission from fossil fuel in China in 2000. Total volume of <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> is the most important influencing factor for carbon retention effects at both <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> and county-levels. Years after construction is also a significant factor at <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> level. The numbers of <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> and land use as well as topographical factors have impacts on the respect of <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> carbon retention of varied significance at the county-level. The effectiveness of carbon retention decreased from north to south. The results of this research can be used as important decision support for <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> development planning at the local context.

During the four years of operation, the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> (storage capacity of 25, 000 m 3) recharged the aquifer with an average of 3. 1 million m 3 of the 10. 4 million m 3 year− 1 of streamflow (30 %). The lower and upper uncertainty limits of the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> recharge were 0. 1 and 9. 6 million m 3 year− 1, respectively. Recharge from the upstream stretch was 1. 5 million m 3 year− 1. These results indicate that <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> are valuable structures for increasing groundwater resources in semi-arid regions...|$|R

40|$|Although {{numerous}} <b>check</b> <b>dams</b> {{have been}} constructed in many countries, {{and its effect on}} physical factors were well documented, only a few reports were available on its effect on biotic component in adjacent area. This research aims to address effects of the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> on reptile assemblage in an ephemeral stream based on an assumption that reptile live in the stream and adjacent area may be susceptible to prolonged hydroperiod after <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> construction. Ten stream transects and 40 terrestrial strip transects, including 5, 10, 25, and 50 m from the stream, were used to monitor reptile diversity and composition in a deciduous forest of northern Thailand during April 2009 to February 2011. Physical factors related to water pattern in the stream and the terrestrial habitats were also collected. Results on physical factors indicated that the water pattern and soil moisture in the stream, as well as leaf litter moisture in the terrestrial habitat were increased {{as a result of the}} <b>check</b> <b>dam.</b> However, rarefaction curve indicated that reptile diversity was not significantly different between pre- and post-check dam periods in every transect. Moreover, Morisita’s index of similarity indicated that reptile composition between pre- and post-check dam periods was approximately the same (86 % - 100 %). These results indicated that reptile assemblage was not affected by the <b>check</b> <b>dam.</b> It can be concluded based on data of one year after the <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> construction that <b>check</b> <b>dam</b> can effectively prolong water and moisture to the habitat with minimal effect on reptile assemblage in the area...|$|R
