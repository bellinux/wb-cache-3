40|$|ICCVAM {{develops}} {{performance standards}} {{to facilitate the}} efficient validation of modified versions of adequately validated alternative test methods. ICCVAM recently developed performance standards based on the ICCVAM-recommended LLNA protocol (ICCVAM 1999). The protocol was revised recently to reduce the minimum number of mice per dose group from five to four, and to provide guidance on {{reducing the number of}} positive control animals and determining the appropriate highest test dose. The performance standards include essential test method components, a minimum <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> substances, and <b>standards</b> for accuracy and reliability. Essential test method components are the structural, functional, and procedural elements of a validated test method that must be included in a modified method in order for it to be evaluated using the established performance standards. Essential components of the LLNA include topical application of the test substance to the ears of mice, measurement of lymphocyte proliferation in the lymph nodes draining the area of test substance application, and use of the maximum soluble dose that does not result in systemic toxicity or excessive local irritation. The minimum <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> substances for these LLNA performance standards includes 13 sensitizers and 5 nonsensitizers. The accuracy and reliability standards to be achieved by a modified LLNA are based on the performance of the traditional LLNA. These LLNA performance standards will facilitate rapid and efficient validation of modified LLNA protocols, such as those using non-radioactive markers of lymphocyte proliferation. New versions of the LLNA that provide improved performance or other advantages are expected to result in broader use of the LLNA, which will further reduce and refine animal use for allergic contact dermatitis assessments while ensuring human safety.

(The official date for these revisions is stated on the next page.) Errata Readers should review this section {{to determine if they}} are affected by any of the changes. Symbols—New text is enclosed in symbols and set off from the current official text as shown in the following example:. new text. Where the symbols appear together with no enclosed text, such as [...] , it means that text has been deleted and no new text was proposed to replace it. In all revisions, the closing symbol is accompanied by an identifier that indicates the issue of a given PF volume. Errata—Errata are considered to be text, erroneously published in the USP–NF or its Supplements, that do not accurately reflect the intended official requirements of the Council of Experts. At the end of the Interim Revision Announcement sec-tion in this publication is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> errata and corrections to the USP–NF. The page number indicates where the item is found in USP–NF. Errata lists are updated as necessary in each Pharmacopeial Forum and also appear on USP’s website (www. usp. org).

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> related bias on estimates of plain radiograph reading performance using studies conducted in clinical practice. Data were extracted on study eligibility, clinical and <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> characteristics and reading performance. The choice <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> and the prevalence of bias are presented descriptively. Associations between bias and reading performance are estimated using a regression model that produces relative diagnostic odds ratios (RDOR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Three of the 20 eligible studies addressed all five <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> related biases; 15 studies addressed three or more. When the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> report is influenced by knowledge of an observer's opinion this is associated with a significant overestimation in reading performance (RDOR, 3. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 6 to 8. 3; p¿=¿ 0. 01). There is limited evidence that reading performance is inflated when the observer is aware <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> report before commenting on the radiograph (RDOR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 6 to 5. 1) and deflated when a less valid <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> is used (RDOR, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 1 to 2. 5). There is no evidence that reading performance is affected by application <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> depending on an observer's opinion and using different <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> in the same study. In conclusion we found variation in the choice and application <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> in studies <b>of</b> plain radiograph reading performance, but only when <b>reference</b> <b>standards</b> report in the knowledge of an observer's opinion does this contribute to a significant overestimation in reading performance...|$|R
