40|$|In recent {{financial}} liberalisation debates, increasing {{attention has}} been paid to the role of financial intermediation on the economy. Little research addressing the behaviour of bank lending interest rates under a financial <b>liberalisation</b> <b>system</b> has been articulated. This paper, therefore, draws a parallel between a completely liberalised microfinance and independent banks under financial liberalisation to indicate that in the presence of imperfect information there is a high probability of banks exhibiting a monopolistic behaviour.

The lessons that can be drawn from a comparison with the French experience may seem limited since, in the 1980 s, France was facing capital outflows, whereas emerging economies are now often facing speculative capital inflows. However, while the challenge has become more demanding, successful financial liberalisation for EMEs still rests on the same two key conditions that applied to France: Building a resilient domestic financial system while or before opening the capital account; and shaping appropriate institutions and policies. capital account liberalisation, financial <b>liberalisation,</b> financial <b>system,</b> emerging market economies, France, Economics, Finance...|$|R

40|$|Openness {{and trade}} {{liberalisation}} variables are consistently {{estimated to have}} significant positive coefficients in panel growth regressions. Many arguments have been advanced as to why and how more open or liberalised economies might grow faster, but the specific channels this process uses have begun to be investigated only recently. We continue these efforts by including a variable identifying the date of trade <b>liberalisation</b> in a <b>system</b> of equations that captures the determinants of growth in per capita income. Four ‘channels’ are considered: capital formation, the share of government, the economy’s openness to trade and its price distortions. We include the liberalisation variable in the equation explaining each channel, and allow for thresholds on its coefficient depending on the ‘years since liberalisation’. These estimated coefficients can also differ by region. In this way, we can identify the channels through which trade liberalisation affects growth and uncover {{the timing of the}} adjustments involved...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{recognition}} that current energy systems are unsustainable and require fundamental restructuring. While {{this is a significant}} engineering challenge it {{is not a matter of}} replacing one set of technologies with another. Technologies are embedded in a wider set of political, social and economic institutions which means that the transition from one energy system to another also requires an understanding of the interactions between the technical and non-technical. This thesis contributes to knowledge in this area by paying specific attention to energy distribution networks; the pipes and wires which deliver our energy services. It is argued that existing approaches to the study of transitions in energy systems have largely black-boxed the network components, tending to concentrate on production and demand. However, infrastructure networks have unique technical and institutional characteristics which require a more systematic treatment. Therefore the aim of the thesis is to make more visible the interplay between actors, institutions and technologies in reproducing and transforming energy distribution networks. For this purpose a novel analytical framework is developed which draws from economics and science and technology studies and incorporates insights from the governance literature. The framework is applied to the cases of electricity and heat distribution in the UK. It is found that following the <b>liberalisation</b> of energy <b>systems,</b> the governance of distribution networks has been siloed from the mainstream energy regime which has focused on promoting competition in other segments of the value chain. Therefore efforts to decarbonise energy supply in the UK have tended to be market based with a short term focus, rather than integrated solutions which recognise the role that flexible distribution networks can play in this transition. A number of policy recommendations are made which inform debates surrounding the development of local heat infrastructures and the reconfiguration of electricity distribution system...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of Distributed Generation (DG) in MV distribution networks is continuously growing, being {{supported by the}} improving performances of small generation units, by the renewable incentives introduced to meet the environmental targets and by the current electrical <b>system</b> <b>liberalisation</b> process. A high DG penetration, however, can be limited by technical factors, especially if consumers and generators are not optimally located and their consumption and generation diagrams are of random and intermittent nature. The network operator will thus have to face some new constraints (e. g. redeployment of power flow along feeders, possible feeder ampacity violations, impact on voltage) which may severely limit the maximum number and size of connectable DG plants, {{in order to avoid}} irregular system operations. For the purpose of coping with the electrical grid constraints arising from extensive DG penetration, the adoption of appropriate energy storage systems, together with the introduction of suitable ancillary service markets for promoting user participation to the network regulation, is envisaged to be of crucial importance. Distributors are called to adopt in the next future innovative network controllers to coordinate the operation and the management of their electrical systems and energy storage systems may thus provide interesting features. In this work the feasibility of exploiting storage systems for strategically differing distributed generator and load curves is evaluated, aiming to improve the overall network performance while increasing the level of DG penetration. Issues deriving from the adoption of energy storage systems have been extensively investigated for islanded systems, whereas this work deals with their use in distribution networks, and aims to provide a tool enabling Distributors to easily assess the optimal sizing, siting and managing strategy for grid connected storage systems. The method presented in this paper determines, on the basis of suited preliminary analysis, a reference profile for an ideal storage system and, subsequently, the operation profile for the energy storage system, accounting for its size, capacity and integral operational constraints. Results on a realistic MV system case study are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vulnerability of the European {{electrical}} infrastructure {{appears to}} be growing due to several factors: - demand is always growing, and, although this growth may be forecast, it cannot be anytime easily faced; - transactions increase, following electrical <b>system</b> <b>liberalisation,</b> and this involves operating the whole infrastructure closer to the system capacity and security limits; - an increased control systems complexity, required for secure system operation, may in turn raise system vulnerability, due both to accidental faults and malicious attacks; - critical infrastructures, and the electrical system primarily, are well {{known to be a}} privileged target in warfare, as well as terrorist attacks. In recent years, both Europe and America have experienced a significant number of huge blackouts, whose frequency and impact looks progressively growing. These events had common roots in the fact that current risk assessment methodologies and current system controls appear to be no longer adequate. Beyond the growing complexity of the electrical system as a whole, two main reasons can be listed: - system analysis procedures based on these methodologies did not identify security threats emerging from failures of critical physical components; - on-line controls were not able to avoid system collapse. This report provides a state-of-the-art of the technology on both regards: - as far as risk assessment methodologies are concerned, an overview of the conceptual power system reliability framework is provided, and the current N- 1 principle for risk assessment in power systems is introduced, together with off-the-shelf enforcement methodologies, like optimal power flow. Emerging methodologies for dynamic security assessment are also discussed. The power system reliability approach is compared with the global approach to dependability introduced by computer scientists, and the conceptual clashes pointed out. Ways ahead to conciliate both views are outlined. - concerning power system controls, the report overviews the existing defense plans, making specific reference to the current Italian situation. The two major recent blackout events in the American North East and Italy are analysed, and the drawbacks of the existing arrangements and the installed control systems are discussed. Emerging technologies, such as phasor measurement units and wide area protection are introduced. Their likely impact on the existing control room is discussed. Finally, potential cyber vulnerabilities of the new control systems are introduced, the role of communication standards in that context is discussed, and an overview of {{the current state of the}} art is presented.

40|$|Uganda started {{financial}} sector {{reforms in the}} early 1990 s {{as part of the}} broader objective of a shift to market-determined prices and private sector led growth. It was hoped that liberalisation of interest rates combined with a reduction in the participation of government in ownership would promote efficiency in the allocation of resources and promote competition within the sector. The implementation of the initial reforms was slow as there was tension between the broad objective and a residual constituency in support {{of the role of the}} state in allocation of resources, facilitating outreach of services to the poor and rural areas, and in setting of prices, especially for interest rates. However, there were other issues of sequencing associated with the reform that were not fully appreciated at the start of the reform. In particular, Uganda opted for a parallel process of implementing reforms in both the commercial and central banking segments of the financial system. This presented a challenge in effective supervision and regulation of licensed institutions. This was further complicated by the transition from a shared role in regulating and licensing of financial institutions between the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. The experience of Uganda is quite rich and provides key lessons for a country embarking on a reform of the financial system. The reforms have in a large degree eliminated segmentation arising from distortions from government interference in the price setting mechanism. Significant progress has been recorded overtime on a number of financial indicators including reducing the risk of bank failure. However, the strengthening of a financial system alone does not necessarily provide an efficient and competitive financial <b>system.</b> <b>Liberalisation</b> needs to be complemented by a programme of strengthening the regulatory capacity and framework plus strengthening institutions that support financial reforms such as land registry, commercial courts and credit reference bureaux if the objective of a strong and efficient {{financial sector}} is to be achieved. Large margins on interest rates remain, and competition and provision of long-term lending have remained largely elusive. The sale of state-owned bank also presented challenges in its implementation, resulting in a costly and lengthy process. In spite of the challenges in implementation of the reforms, the sector is in a far stronger position when compared with the pre-reform period. Copyright The author 2007.

40|$|Malaysia’s {{determination}} {{to become a}} hub for Islamic banking in Southeast Asia has led the Central Bank of Malaysia to grant licenses to foreign Islamic banks {{to operate in the}} country. Due to the intense competition among Islamic banks, the introduction of more innovative products is projected to tap investment opportunities not only for Malaysia but also for the rapidly growing Southeast Asian region. This research assesses the significance of Malaysian Islamic banking since the introduction of the first Islamic bank two decades ago, and evaluates the competition among the Islamic banks in the country. The research evaluates the impact of foreign Islamic banks in Malaysia by measuring their contribution to the growth of the Malaysian Islamic banking industry. In relation to this, the study is designed to address three primary areas. First, to measure the performance of the Islamic banks in Malaysia by using financial ratios, data envelopment analysis (DEA), and the Malmquist Productivity Index. Second, to compare and evaluate the nature of competition and market structure of the Islamic banks in the country by employing the bank concentration ratio (CRk), Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), and the Panzar-Rosse (PR) model. Lastly, to validate the relationship between competition among Islamic banks in Malaysia and their financial performance. The selected financial ratios indicated that domestic Islamic banks performed better during the 2005 to 2012 period in terms of profitability, but the foreign Islamic banks excelled in terms of liquidity, risk, and solvency ratios. DEA results showed that the domestic Islamic banks are considered more efficient with the majority of domestic Islamic banks outperforming the foreign Islamic banks. Banks like Maybank Islamic, CIMB Islamic, and Alliance Islamic are considered among the top performers for technical efficiency and scale efficiency. The study also found that based on the Malmquist Productivity Index, the least efficient banks based on DEA have improved in technical efficiency, technology, and total factor productivity (TFP). The study also found that between 2008 and 2012, the Malaysian Islamic banking industry operated in monopolistic competition conditions with a moderately concentrated market structure. The introduction of foreign Islamic banks caused the market structure to become more competitive and less concentrated by comparing the results that include foreign Islamic banks against results generated with a subsample of domestic Islamic banks only. BNM’s financial reform and <b>liberalisation</b> of financial <b>system</b> proved to induce competition making the financial system more resilient, competitive, and dynamic. The Islamic banks have recorded consistent increased annual performance with the under-performing Islamic banks catching up to the top performers. ...|$|R
