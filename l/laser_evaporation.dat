Bottom-up growth methods include <b>laser</b> ablation, <b>evaporation,</b> solution-based methods and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).

Among these metals, Au as catalyst has been the most popular and most widely investigated due to its chemical inertness and low eutectic temperature of Au-Si system.

40|$|An {{advanced}} PLD technique combining {{laser ablation}} and <b>laser</b> induced thermal <b>evaporation</b> {{was introduced to}} deposit thin films onto the inner surfaces of components. Beside the well known film properties of the classical PLD, like high reproducibility, smooth surface and high thickness precision, this novel combination of <b>laser</b> ablation and <b>evaporation</b> is characterized by improved or extended properties in terms of microstructure, deposition rate and possible layer thickness. The extension of the conventional PLD process allows for the co-deposition of dense, amorphous films as well as columnar grown or even porous films with thick nesses up to several tens of micrometers. In a first successful application of the novel process, tailored thermal barrier coatings (TBC s) for combustion chambers were realized. A remarkable result was that these coatings sustained very large strains of about 5 % without notable delaminations. Under hot gas testing in model combustion chambers, the PLD-TBC s showed very promising behavior with excellent adhesion. Super hard, amorphous carbon films (DLC) deposited onto the inner surfaces of small components by this PLD technique are characterized by a Young s modulus of about 400500 GPa and a low friction coefficient of about 0. 1.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{retrospective}} evaluation of the treatment results of CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>evaporation</b> for 27 cases of leukoplakia of the lip. The data were derived from 23 patients who presented with leukoplakia of the lower lip during the period 1978 - 96. Four patients developed a second primary leukoplakia of the lip resulting in 27 cases of leukoplakia. All lesions were treated with a CO 2 laser equipped with an operation microscope and micromanipulator. Short-term evaluation showed complete epithelialisation 4 weeks after CO 2 laser evaporation; there was minimal scar formation and no subsequent interference with normal lip function. During long-term evaluation, four recurrences (14. 8 %) were diagnosed which developed between 5 and 31 months after treatment; these were retreated with CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>evaporation.</b> There was no development of squamous cell carcinoma in the CO 2 laser-treated area. Selective removal of affected epithelium with minimal damage to surrounding structures is possible using CO 2 <b>laser</b> <b>evaporation,</b> followed by excellent wound healing and good functional result. Treatment can be performed under local anaesthesia on an outpatient basis. The recurrence rate is low compared with the recurrence rate after surgical excision.
