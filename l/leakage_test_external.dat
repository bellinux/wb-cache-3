40|$|AbstractConfirmation {{of virus}} filter {{integrity}} {{is crucial for}} ensuring the safety of biological products. Two main types of virus filter defects may produce inconsistent and undesirable performance in virus removal: improper pore-size distribution across the membrane; and specific damage, such as tears, broken fibers, or pinholes. Two integrity tests are performed on each individual filter manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical to ensure the absence of these defects prior to shipment. In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planova™ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution. Damage occurring during shipment and use (e. g., broken fibers or pinholes) can be detected by end-users with sufficient sensitivity using air–water diffusion based <b>leakage</b> <b>tests.</b> We prepared and tested filters with model pinhole defects of various sizes to develop standard acceptance criteria for the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> relative to porcine parvovirus infectivity logarithmic reduction values (LRVs).

In group B (n 64), fat emulsion revealed 87 leakage points in 37 patients, and saline revealed three additional points in three patients. There were no significant between-group differences in the number of leakage points detected by the first test, total number of leakage points or postoperative complications. Significantly more leakage points were detected by the second test in Group A (fat emulsion) than in Group B (saline).

40|$|This Master`s Thesis {{deal with}} {{integrity}} and barrier philosophy. A special {{focus has been}} on internal leakage through barrier elements. There is an increasing discussion about what a primary and secondary barrier is, how many barriers there should be, their permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria and their integrity. Subsea Christmas tree (XMT) is considered as a pressure barrier element in subsea production systems. Rules and regulations require frequent <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of subsea XMT valves. Applicable standards include NORSOK D- 010, ISO 10423 and 13628 - 4 and API RP 14 B. Due to the remoteness, of the subsea well head, testing is more complicated compared to testing of platform trees (dry trees). Applicable standards specify a maximum permitted leakage rate. However, when considering testing of valves using small fluid test volume the model has limitations. A challenge is to determine if the <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> criteria are fulfilled or not. Leak testing of subsea XMT valves is an engineering challenge. Engineers must meet leak rate standards as well as they have to understand all aspects of the leak testing procedure. Operators address a {{question of whether or not}} their correlation tool of pressure to leak rate is accurate enough. Another question regards the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B; how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes – typical XMT volumes. By this Master`s Thesis, an issue that does not have an ideal solution today is highlighted. The issue that operating companies faces is: In questionable situations whether a valve has fulfilled the criteria or not – how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes, how to decide whether a XMT have to be pulled, how to increase planning security, how to save money, time and estimate the lifetime of different valves on the XMT. The problems that the Operating Company meet regarding <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of XMT valves may be that the differential pressure across the valve is lost in a couple of minutes. This questions the leak test procedure; is the permitted leak rate acceptance criteria or the test interval too large? To be on the safe side when evaluating <b>leakage</b> <b>tests,</b> the Operating Company has included new permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria into their work procedures. Service personnel fear that such a strict acceptance criteria can result in an unmanageable situation with a numerous of exceptions. Another problem that may be faced is that there is no procedure of when to initiate the <b>leakage</b> <b>test.</b> This results in difficulties in comparing historical and recent <b>leakage</b> <b>tests.</b> Also, this can result in a <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> that shows a smaller leakage than it actually do. Data from previous <b>leakage</b> <b>tests</b> of production Master – and –Wing valve on the XMT are collected. The data are used to evaluate today`s procedure of <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> and for correlating pressure to leak rate. Both, the new internal leakage acceptance criteria that the Operating Company uses and the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B are evaluated. Today, a basic tool for correlating pressure to acceptable leak rate exists. From the technical advisors point of view it is desirable with a more accurate software tool that can correlate pressure to leak rate. To evaluate today`s practice of correlating pressure to leak rate the MultiProScale simulation tool is used. It is assumed that the simulation tool correlates the most correct leak rate due to the complexity of the simulation tool. However, this Master`s Thesis shows that such a powerful tool is not needed for correlating pressure to leak rate. Based on this Master`s Thesis, the contribution to the <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> procedure is an improved calculation tool of correlating pressure, temperature and compressibility changes to actual leak rate. A presentation of this Master`s Thesis is presented for the Technical advisor of Well Technology, Hilde Brandanger Haga at Statoil. She agreed with the challenges and solutions that were presented. The improved calculation tool was also introduced. A proposal was presented that not only could the calculation tool be used onshore, but it could be used to show the actual leak rate during <b>leakage</b> <b>testing</b> of the PMV and PWV offshore. The advantage with this tool is that it can ensure the competence, it helps the decision-making process, it increases planning, it decreases cost and safeguard barriers. Other contributions are recommended changes both to the leak testing procedure and the data documentation. In relation to both of the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria, the main conclusions are: To apply the internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API 14 B to the subsea XMT, the leakage time interval have to be reduced from 10 – to 2 minutes. This will not result in an increased number of valves that does not fulfill the acceptance criteria. Or to apply the acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B, the test volume has to be > 50 liters. And, the additional internal leakage acceptance criteria that are implemented by the Operating Company are stricter than the one governed by API RP 14 B. A decrease in time interval from 10 – to 2 minutes gives an increased number of valves that do not fulfill the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background : Pancreatic fistula is {{major source}} of {{postoperative}} morbidity or mortality. Soft pancreas has been considered {{to be one of}} the most important risk factors for pancreatic fistula. The purpose of the study is to clarify the relationship among extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump, the pancreatic texture and clinical pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods : For nineteen patients who were treated between July 2007 and August 2008, we performed intraoperative pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> to confirm the extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump. Degree of fibrosis at the cut surface of the pancreas was reviewed blindly. Results : Serum pancreatic amylase increased on first postoperative day (POD) and returned to preoperative level on 3 POD. These change were inversely correlated with fibrosis (P < 0. 001), namely the amylase level in patients with normal to mild fibrotic pancreas showed marked increase on 1 POD, but not in those with moderate to severe fibrotic pancreas. Positive pancreatic <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> was recognized in five patients (26. 3 %), four of 9 patients with soft pancreas (44. 4 %) and one of 10 with hard pancreas (10. 0 %). In soft pancreas, all four cases showing positive <b>leakage</b> <b>test</b> developed pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy, while one positive case in hard pancreas did not develop pancreatic fistula. Conclusion : The extravasation of pancreatic secretions from the pancreatic stump occurred frequently in soft pancreas, which might result in postoperative pancreatic fistula. Therefore we should take care in treating branched duct as well as main pancreatic duct at the pancreatic stump of soft pancreas. 【はじめに】膵液漏は膵切除術合併症で特に問題となる合併症である．Soft pancreasは膵液漏の危険因子と言われている．今回膵切離断端からの膵液の漏れと，膵の繊維化の程度，膵液漏の発生との関連性を明らかにした．【方法】膵頭十二指腸切除を行った 19 症例に対して，切除端の膵管からアトムチューブを挿入しインジコカルミン溶液を注入し断端からの色素の漏れの有無を調べ，切除膵の繊維化の程度と組織学的になし，軽度，中等度，高度に郡別し比較．【結果】血清アミラーゼ値は，術後 1 日目に上昇し， 3 日目には術前値に戻っていたが， 1 日目の上昇は繊維化がないほど有意に高値を示した．リークテスト陽性を 5 例に認めたが， 1 例をのぞきsoft pancreas症例であった．リークテスト陽性であったsoft pancreas症例 4 例は全例膵液漏を生じたが，リークテスト陽性であったhard pancreas症例は膵液漏を生じなかった．【まとめ】Soft pancreasにおいては膵断端の分枝膵管からの漏れも多く，膵液漏の原因である可能性があり分枝膵管にも注意を払うべきと考えられる...|$|R
