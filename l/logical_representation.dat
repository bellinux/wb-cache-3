25|$|In A1, if we {{view the}} number n'm as the {{function}} type m→n, and m'n as the application m(n), we can reinterpret the numbers i, j, ĵ, and ioĵ as functions of type i:(m→2)→2, j:m→((n→2)→2), ĵ:(n→2)→(m→2), and ioĵ:(n→2)→2. The definition (ioĵ)v= i'ĵ'v in A1 then translates to (ioĵ)(v)= i(ĵ(v)), that is, ioĵ is defined to be composition of i and ĵ understood as functions. So {{the content of}} A1 amounts to defining term application to be essentially composition, modulo the need to transpose the m-tuple j to make the types match up suitably for composition. This composition is the one in Lawvere's previously mentioned category of power sets and their functions. In this way we have translated the commuting diagrams of that category, as the equational theory of Boolean algebras, into the equational consequences of A1 as the <b>logical</b> <b>representation</b> of that particular composition law.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{word sense disambiguation}} (WSD) approach based on syntactic and <b>logical</b> <b>representations.</b> The objective here is to run a number of experiments to compare standard contexts (word windows, sentence windows) with contexts provided by a dependency parser (syntactic context) and a logical analyzer (logico-semantic context). The approach presented here relies on a dependency grammar for the syntactic representations. We also use a pattern knowledge base over the syntactic dependencies to extract flat predicative <b>logical</b> <b>representations.</b> These <b>representations</b> (syntactic and <b>logical)</b> are then used to build context vectors that are exploited in the WSD process. Various state-of-the-art algorithms including Simplified Lesk, Banerjee and Pedersen and frequency of co-occurrences are tested with these syntactic and logical contexts. Preliminary results show that defining context vectors based on these features may improve WSD by comparison with classical word and sentence context windows. However, future experiments are needed to provide more evidence over these issues. 1...|$|R

This is generally achieved by mapping the derived meaning into a set of assertions in predicate logic, then using logical deduction to arrive at conclusions.

This contrasts with common practice for SQL DBMSs in which performance tuning often requires changes to the logical model.|$|E
50|$|Di Giacomo {{maintains}} that, {{in order}} to tackle {{the issue of the}} image today, it is necessary to refuse both an interpretation of the image as a mere mirror of things and its interpretation as an exclusively self-referential system of signs. Based on his reading of Wittgenstein, he draws the conclusion that <b>logical</b> <b>representation</b> entails something that manifests itself and, while doing so, remains ‘other’, distinct from the visibility of the representation itself. Thus, in presenting itself, the image manifests the other of the visible, of the representable: that other which reveals itself in the visible, by hiding from it. And this is precisely how the image becomes an icon of the invisible.|$|E

40|$|Bag-of-words {{methods to}} the {{problems}} of semantic text classification and textual entailment have seen some successful applications [3], their straightforward applications are known to break when the training data is sparse, the number of classes is large, or classes do not have clear syntactic boundaries (for example when negational, conditional sentence markers significantly affect classification). These are, however, properties of a typical semantic classification problem in the domain of natural language tutoring systems. Recently formal methods have been evaluated for reasoning about entailment using the <b>logical</b> <b>representations</b> of natural language propositions [5]. This work extends those methods to account for uncertainty in generating <b>logical</b> <b>representations</b> of natural language sentences by using Bayesian networks with observable nodes representing the logical propositions in the domain of the tutorial dialogue corpus, latent nodes corresponding to domain rule applications, and semantic class label nodes. The problem of sparseness of training data is dealt with by using logical inference engine to generate the network structure, and using informative priors for parameter estimation. The results demonstrate improved performance over the formal reasoning approaches and other baselines...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the verbal system of Tagalog through an event structure analysis, arguing that “focus forms ” exhibited by base predicates are expressions of different event structures {{determined by the}} semantic feature of telicity. It provides tests to examine the telicity property of the predicates and proposes their corresponding <b>logical</b> <b>representations.</b> These telicity tests and <b>logical</b> <b>representations</b> illuminate the syntactic behaviour of the focus forms in Tagalog. The thesis further demonstrates that the (a) telicity property of the predicates and the event structure they denote trigger the semantic interpretations {{of the participants in}} the clause, i. e. the ANG-phrase, NG-phrase and SA-phrase. The study concludes with an elucidation of the interplay between event structure and viewpoint aspect in Tagalog’s verbal expressions. i Acknowledgments This thesis would not be possible without the encouragement, support, and insights of the following: My deepest gratitude to The University of Melbourne for the scholarships awarded that gave me the opportunity to pursue this project, and to learn and grow as a researcher...|$|R
