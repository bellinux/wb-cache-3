This paper develops measures for temporal and spatial imbalances in freight flows, and applies these measures to a major trucking network. Fundamentally, the randomness inherent to a system of terminals is mitigated by pooling freight flows among terminal groups, and by pooling freight flows over many time periods. In the terminal network that we examined, long-run freight imbalances ensure that empty equipment movements must equal or exceed 13. 3 % of <b>loaded</b> <b>movements</b> at individual terminals and 8. 2 % of <b>loaded</b> <b>movements</b> at terminal groups. Due to short-run freight imbalances, the number of empty movements could increase by about 50 % over the long-run average; greater increases would occur if equipment flows must be balanced on each travel lane.

In this paper, we consider {{a new model}} for <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> in synchronous parallel and distributed machines. In each step of our model, each processor can transfer load to at most one neighbor; also, any amount of load can be moved along a communication link be-tween two processors in one step.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{solutions}} {{have been}} proposed to tackle the load balancing issue in DHT-based P 2 P systems. However, all these solutions either ignore the heterogeneity nature of the system, or reassign loads among nodes without considering proximity relationships, or both. In this paper, we present an efficient, proximity-aware load balancing scheme by using the concept of virtual servers. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first work to use proximity information in load balancing. In particular, our main contributions are: 1) Relying on a self-organized, fully distributed k-ary tree structure constructed on top of a DHT, load balance is achieved by aligning those two skews in load distribution and node capacity inherent in P 2 P systems—that is, have higher capacity nodes carry more loads; 2) proximity information is used to guide virtual server reassignments such that virtual servers are reassigned and transferred between physically close heavily loaded nodes and lightly loaded nodes, thereby minimizing the <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> cost and allowing load balancing to perform efficiently; and 3) our simulations show that our proximity-aware load balancing scheme reduces the <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> cost by 11 - 65 percent for all the combinations of two representative network topologies, two node capacity profiles, and two load distributions of virtual servers. Moreover, we achieve virtual server reassignments in Oðlog NÞ time. Index Terms—Proximity-aware, peer-to-peer, virtual server, load balancing. ...|$|E

40|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{in mountain}} streams is {{closely linked to}} streambed structures. Strambed structures are arrangements of boulders and cobbles deposited during extreme floods, in a stable configuration exhibiting high dissipation of flow. Field experiments were carried out in a mountain stream in Yunnan, southwestern China, studying bed <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> on three typical streambeds, i. e., with well developed, partially developed, and no structures. An underwater observation and video-capturing system was designed to observe and measure the movement of bed load particles. The initiation mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of bed load particles under the three conditions were observed and analyzed. Results showed that the bed <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> was highly associated with streambed condition. With well-developed structures, bed load particles moved intermittently through saltation and the bed load transport rate was very low. For partially-developed structures most bed load particles moved through saltation but a portion of sediment moved in sliding and rolling. In the case with no streambed structure (plane bed) contact load motion (sliding and rolling) gradually became dominant. Moreover, laminated load motion occurred and became {{the main component of}} bed load transport when the flow discharge and incoming sediment load were very high. Laminated load motion was a special form of bed load motion with an extremely high intensity. Bed load transport and streambed structure both acted to dissipate flow energy and were mutually constraining. High rates of bed load transport occurred in the streams with no or poor bed structures, and low bed load transport was associated with well developed structures. The bed load transport rate was inversely correlated to the degree of streambed development...|$|E
40|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{in mountain}} streams {{is very difficult}} to be determined since it strongly correlates to streambed structure (roughness structure). Based on a specially designed underwater observation and video-capturing system, experiments on bed <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> under three streambed structure development scenarios, i. e., well developed, partially developed, and no streambed structures (plane bed), was conducted in a mountain stream in southwest China. Dynamic features of bed load transport (starting mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration velocity) under these three typical streambed conditions were observed and analyzed. The streambed structure development degree was measured by a specially manufactured instrument to analyze correlation between bed load transport and streambed structure development. Bed <b>load</b> <b>movement</b> strongly depends on streambed conditions of mountain streams. For channels with well-developed streambed structures, bed load mainly move in intermittent saltation, and almost no other motion form occur, bed load transport rate is often very low under this condition. For channels with partially-developed streambed structure, saltation motion is still the main motion form, and contact motion also occurs. When no streambed structure develops (plane bed), both saltation and contact motion occur, contact motion gradually become the main motion form, and if flow intensity and incoming sediment reach the critical high values, laminated load motion occur and will be the main part of bed load transport. In essence, bed load transport and streambed structures both form flow resistance (dissipate flow energy) and are inter-restricted. For a specific stream power, the bed load transport rate is inversely proportional to the development degree of streambed structures in a logarithmic coordinate system for the same stream reach...|$|E

30|$|The use of {{the digital}} camera {{permitted}} the characteristics of failure to be observed and commented upon. With increased loading, usually in the loading to failure phase, the proximal tendon shortened slightly and appeared to bulk up as the suture tightened, the accordion effect (Figs. 4, 5 & 6). In vivo, {{the consequences of this}} shortening effect may be minimized by pre-conditioning and then ensuring tendon end-to-end apposition with knots tied with the ankle placed in plantar flexion compared to the non-injured ankle. This operative “over-tightening” compensates by subsequent elongation with <b>loading,</b> <b>movement</b> and remodeling (Heikkinen et al., 2016; Pajala et al., 2009; Schepull et al., 2012; Silbernagel et al., 2012). Another biomechanical property observed was that the absorbable sutures were notably more elastic than the non-absorbable sutures with more stretching and recoil rather than that observed with the stiffer non-absorbable suture. This elastic nature of absorbable monofilament repair may be functionally beneficial in avoiding stress shielding of the repair although this must be considered against knot stability and pre-conditioning characteristics.|$|R
