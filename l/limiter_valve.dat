50|$|The British Leak company used an EM84 {{indicator}} as a {{very precise}} tuning-indicator in their Troughline FM tuner series, by mixing the AGC voltages from the two <b>limiter</b> <b>valve</b> grids at the indicator sensing-grid. By this means accurate tuning was indicated by a fully open sharp shadow, whilst off-tune the indicator produced a partially closed shadow.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{appears to}} us to be a sound and {{explicit}} discussion of means for limiting overspeeds of adjustable-blade turbines of great practicable and commerical value. However, {{we feel that the}} author is too casual in dismissing the substitution of a properly installed blade-tilt solenoid instead of the <b>limiter</b> <b>valves</b> to bring the runner blades to high-blade angle in order to reduce overspeeds. Considerable initial cost can be saved by the elimination of the <b>limiter</b> <b>valves</b> if this can be done without sacrificing safety. He appears to consider the blade-tilt solenoid as unreliable becaus...|$|R

Primary components of device are flow rate control <b>valve,</b> <b>limiter</b> accumulator, and shutoff <b>valve.</b> <b>Limiter</b> may {{be incorporated into}} other hydraulic systems to prevent undue wear on hydraulic actuators and associated components...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{flow through}} {{acoustic}} mufflers {{is a complex}} phenomenon that has been investigated for many years due to its importance in compressor efficiency. The intake system of a compressor {{plays an important role}} on the performance of reed type valves of small hermetic refrigeration compressors, especially suction valves designed without an opening <b>limiter.</b> The <b>valve</b> affects directly volumetric and energy losses and may have some influence on the compressor noise level as well. A number of methods have been proposed to analyze gas pulsations in intake and discharge systems. If pulsations are small compared to the mean pressure...|$|R

Understanding the noise source generation and propagation needsa well-modelled pressure cycle in the compressor. Modelling the pressure behaviour ina cylinder requires a robust thermodynamical/mechanical {{model in which}} both physicsinteract. A Piao-McLinden model is proposed here to simulate the behaviour of a real gaslike refrigerant. The motion of the valves is formulated as a one dimensional damped massspringsystem characterized {{by means of a}} Rayleigh method. Each model is comparedto experimental data before simulating the whole coupled system: compressor gas/reedvalve motion...|$|R
