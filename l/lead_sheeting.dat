25|$|In {{her debut}} story, Kara Zor-El {{is the last}} {{survivor}} of Argo City of the planet Krypton. Although Argo, which had survived {{the explosion of the}} planet, drifted through space as a self-sustaining environment, the soil of the colony eventually turned into Kryptonite; and though Kara's father Zor-El placed <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> above the ground to protect the citizens from radiation, meteorites pierced the sheeting, and the Kryptonians died of radiation poisoning instead of replacing the metal.|$|E
25|$|Since {{panels of}} {{infinite}} dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear {{radiation from the}} moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted {{from the rear of}} the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, visco-elastic materials (e.g., mineral-loaded bitumen) or thin <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> applied to the interior enclosure walls.|$|E
25|$|In the Byzantine period, domes were {{normally}} hemispherical and had, {{with occasional}} exceptions, windowed drums. All {{of the surviving}} examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding {{to the number of}} windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting.</b> Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead enamelwork. In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminum, instead of the original ribbed <b>lead</b> enamel work <b>sheeting.</b> In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the {{subterranean}} termite {{consists of}} anything that contains wood fiber (homes, building, live trees), crops, and plants. Live trees include oak, ash, and water-bound cypress. Crops include sugarcane.Like many other termites, the Formosan termite feeds on wood and other materials that contain cellulose, such as paper and cardboard. Bacteria and other single-celled organisms live in the termite digestive system and digest cellulose, providing nutrition and energy for these termites. Although they feed mostly on wood, they eat other cellulose-containing materials such as cardboard and paper. However, they are known to chew through foam insulation boards, thin <b>lead</b> and copper <b>sheeting,</b> plaster, asphalt, and some plastics.|$|R
50|$|The Hellenic Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have {{continued}} investigations at Antikythera. In 2014 and 2015 they conducted robotic mapping surveys {{over the two}} ancient wreck sites, cooperating with the Australian Centre for Field Robotics of the University of Sydney. Subsequent excavations of the Antikythera Wreck in 2014-2016 delivered new finds from the ship itself: wood elements from the hull or decks, components of two anchors made of lead, an enormous lead salvage ring, <b>lead</b> hull <b>sheeting,</b> several bronze nails and spikes, and a bronze rigging ring. The wreck also relinquished many luxury goods including two large bronze spears from statues, the left hand of a marble statue, ornate glass bowls, intact ceramic jars of several different styles, and a gold ring {{very similar to the}} example recovered in 1976. One extraordinary find is an ancient weapon known as a dolphin, a 100 kg lead bulb tipped with an iron spike, intended to be dropped from the ship’s yardarm through the deck and hull of an attacking vessel. This is the only example of a war dolphin ever discovered. On 31 August 2016, a 2000-year old human skeleton nicknamed Pamphilos was discovered at the shipwreck.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} domes in the Middle East {{were built}} with mud-brick and, eventually, with baked brick and stone. Domes of wood allowed for wide spans {{due to the}} relatively light and flexible nature of the material and were the normal method for domed churches by the 7th century, although most domes were built with the other less flexible materials. Wooden domes were protected from the weather by roofing, such as copper or <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting.</b> Domes of cut stone were more expensive and never as large, and timber was used for large spans where brick was unavailable. Brick domes were the favored choice for large-space monumental coverings until the Industrial Age, due to their convenience and dependability. Ties and chains of iron or wood {{could be used to}} resist stresses.|$|E
25|$|The hull {{had been}} {{sheathed}} in three layers of <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> {{to protect the}} timbers from shipworms; as there are none in fresh water lakes, this design feature was not only costly but useless. It {{is evidence that the}} ships hulls were constructed following standardized Roman shipbuilding techniques rather than being purpose-built. The topside timbers were protected by paint and tarred wool with many surfaces decorated with marble, mosaics and gilded copper roof tiles. There was a lack of coordination between the structure of the hull and that of the superstructures, which suggests that naval architects designed the hulls, while civil architects then designed the superstructure to use the space available after the hulls were completed. After their recovery, the ships hulls were found to be completely empty and unadorned.|$|E
25|$|T-55A (Ob'yekt 155A) - Produced 1963–1981, in Poland 1964–1979. The T-55A MBT was {{primarily}} developed to incorporate a new antiradiation lining and full PAZ/FVU chemical filtration system. One {{of the major}} internal additions {{was the use of}} a plasticized <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> for antiradiation protection. This was evident externally due to use of an enlarged driver's hatch and enlarged combings over the commander's and loader's hatch to accommodate the new material. Improved POV anti-radiation protection (leading to visibly protruding turret hatches) and NBC filtration, dispensed with bow machine gun. The coaxial SGMT machine gun was replaced with a PKT machine gun. The hull machine gun was removed, which made room for six more 100mm gun rounds Since 1970, T-55A tanks began to receive a new turret fitting for the 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E
40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) has {{developed}} a Large Scale Demonstration Project (LSDP) at the Chicago Pile- 5 Research Reactor (CP- 5) at Argonne National Laboratory-East (ANL). The objective of the LSDP is to demonstrate potentially beneficial Deactivation and Decommissioning (D and D) technologies in comparison with current baseline technologies. The Dual Arm Work Platform (DAWP) demonstration focused {{on the use of}} the DAWP to segment and dismantle the CP- 5 reactor tank and surrounding bio-shield components (including the graphite block reflector, <b>lead</b> and boral <b>sheeting)</b> and performing some minor tasks best suited for the use of teleoperated robotics that were not evaluated in this demonstration. The DAWP system is not a commercially available product at this time. The CP- 5 implementation was its first D and D application. The demonstration of the DAWP was to determine the areas on which improvements must be made to make this technology commercially viable. The results of the demonstration are included in this greenbook. It is the intention of the developers to incorporate lessons learned at this demonstration and current technological advancements in robotics into the next generation of the DAWP...|$|R
500|$|The term [...] "Byzantine", {{invented in}} 1557 by {{historian}} Hieronymus Wolf, became {{popular in the}} 19th century and is {{used to refer to}} the medieval eastern Roman Empire with its capital at Constantinople, the former town of Byzantion. In the Byzantine period, a supporting structure of four arches with pendentives between them allowed the spaces below domes to be opened up. Pendentives allowed for weight loads to be concentrated at just four points on a more practical square plan, rather than a circle. Domes were important elements of baptisteries, churches, and tombs. They were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|E
60|$|Casanova went first, on all fours, and {{thrusting}} {{the point}} of his spontoon between the joints of the <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> so as to obtain a hold, he crawled slowly upwards. To follow, Balbi took a grip of Casanova's belt with his right hand, so that, in addition to making his own way, Casanova was compelled to drag {{the weight of his}} companion after him, and this up the sharp gradient of a roof rendered slippery by the mist.|$|E
60|$|Having made {{a bundle}} of the fine taffeta suit {{in which he had}} been arrested, his gay cloak of floss silk, some stockings, shirts, and handkerchiefs, he and Balbi passed up to the other cell, {{compelling}} Soradici to go with them. Leaving the monk to make a parcel of his belongings, Casanova went to tackle the roof. By dusk he had made a hole twice as large as was necessary, and had laid bare the <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> with which the roof was covered. Unable, single-handed, to raise one of the sheets, he called Balbi to his aid, and between them, assisted by the spontoon, which Casanova inserted between the edge of the sheet and the gutter, they at last succeeded in tearing away the rivets. Then by putting their shoulders to the lead they bent it upwards until there was room to emerge, and a view of the sky flooded by the vivid light of the crescent moon.|$|E
50|$|Galena is {{the primary}} ore of lead, which is mainly used in making {{lead-acid}} batteries; however, significant amounts are also used to make <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> and lead shot. Galena is often mined for its silver content, such as at the Galena Mine in northern Idaho.|$|E
50|$|Brothers Richard and Ernest Teich {{founded the}} company “Teich OHG” in Weinburg, Austria in 1912 and began rolling tin and <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> with 4 employees. The first {{aluminum}} band rolling stands were constructed in 1927; flexographic printing {{was incorporated into}} the production program in 1952/53 and the intaglio printing process in 1962.|$|E
50|$|A {{rectangular}} semi-enclosed structure, the Dome of Yusuf sits upon a solid {{stone wall}} and {{is supported by}} three pointed open arches. On the northern face of the southern wall, there are stone carvings and a marble-faced blind-niche. The exterior of the dome is covered in <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> and the interior is decorated with a ribbed pattern.|$|E
50|$|A wooden {{colonnade}} {{was added}} to protect the benches and steps surrounding the Fountain of Qasim Pasha from rain and the summer-time sun in the 1920s restoration by the Supreme Muslim Council. The Dome was rebuilt during the restoration, and covered with lead panels that bestowed upon it a pointed shallower profile. In 1998, the <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> {{was replaced by a}} finely crafted stone.|$|E

50|$|The hoard {{had been}} {{protected}} by <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> of some kind. The coins {{date from the}} late 9th and early 10th centuries, providing a terminus post quem for dating the hoard. The first theory as to a likely 10th-century occasion for such a careful burying was that it had belonged to a wealthy Viking leader during the unrest that followed the conquest of the Viking kingdom of Northumbria in the year 927 by the Anglo-Saxon king of a unified England, Athelstan (924-939). Another brief period of Viking rule in Northumbria also followed Athelstan’s death in 939; it lasted until the expulsion and murder of the Viking king of Jórvík (modern-day York), Eric Bloodaxe, in 954.|$|E
50|$|The {{auditorium}} {{is defined}} by an elegant thin-shell structure of reinforced concrete, one-eighth of a sphere rising to a height of 50 feet, and sliced away by sheer glass curtain walls so that it comes to earth on only three points. Thin-shelled concrete technology was innovative for the times. The dome weighs only 1200 tons and is currently clad with copper. It was originally covered with smooth, bright, orastone which was then replaced with <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> attached with stainless steel wires. The dome was originally supported only at the three corners, In 1980, cracks {{were found in the}} structure and the auditorium was closed immediately for repairs. Copper replaced the lead at that time and the walls now carry part of the roof load.|$|E

50|$|The Parish Church of St Michael at Brent Knoll had {{its origins}} in the {{eleventh}} century, with further construction work {{taking place in the}} fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a restoration in the nineteenth century. It is built of coursed and squared rubble stone, with <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> on the roofs apart from the chancel roof, which is slated. There are cruciform finials on the gable ends. The church is built mostly in the Perpendicular style, the plan being the nave, the chancel, the north aisle, the fourteenth century south porch and the south transept, now used as a vestry. The fourteenth century tower is at the west end and has three stages with set-back buttresses. It is topped by a parapet with pinnacles, and gargoyles to shed the water. The Norman doorway in the south porch has chevron decorations.|$|E

5000|$|The hoard can be dated {{from the}} date of the last coin that was {{included}} in the hoard and this came from 1647 or 1648. This date {{is at the end of}} English Civil War and these troubles are the probable reason for the hoard being deposited. There are over 200 hoards that date from the time of the civil war. This was the first civil war hoard found in Pembrokeshire. These goods were hidden by an outbuilding of the Tregwynt Mansion. They were discovered in 1996 as a result of building work resulting from the construction of a tennis court. Because a few coins had been found, the ground was searched by a metal detector and Roy Lewis discovered many more coins. By the end, a JCB digger was involved and in addition to the coins they also found <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> which is thought to have covered the hoard and a ring with a motto inside it. The inscription reads [...] "Better death than false of faith" [...] (spelling updated).|$|E
5000|$|Maritime {{archeology}} {{and ancient}} manuscripts from classical antiquity show evidence of vast Roman commercial fleets. The most substantial remains from this commerce are the infrastructure remains of harbors, moles, warehouses and lighthouses at ports such as Civitavecchia, Ostia, Portus, Leptis Magna and Caesarea Maritima. At Rome itself, Monte Testaccio {{is a tribute}} to the scale of this commerce. As with most Roman technology, the Roman seagoing commercial ships had no significant advances over Greek ships of the previous centuries, though the <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> of hulls for protection seems to have been more common. The Romans used round hulled sailing ships. Continuous Mediterranean [...] "police" [...] protection over several centuries {{was one of the main}} factors of success of Roman commerce, given that Roman roads were designed more for feet or hooves than for wheels, and could not support the economical transport of goods over long distances. The Roman ships used would have been easy prey for pirates had it not been for the fleets of Liburna galleys and triremes of the Roman navy.|$|E
50|$|The brick {{magazine}} {{was used as}} a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to {{the east side of the}} magazine building. At this time the ridge ventilator, lightning rods and copper earthing straps were still in place. The lightening rod assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about 4 inches in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes (1/2 inch thick by 2 feet long, or 12.7mm by 609.6mm) to jut out at angles, so that the tips were 2 feet apart. Two 2 inch (50.8mm) copper straps at least ¼ inch (6.35mm) thick led down the sides of the building to be earthed. In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. <b>Lead</b> <b>sheeting</b> from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering.|$|E
50|$|In pre-Crisis continuity, Zor-El was a climatographer on Krypton, {{and one of}} {{the only}} {{scientists}} to believe his older brother Jor-El's predictions about the impending destruction of Krypton. When the planet exploded, Argo City was somehow blown safely into space with a life-giving bubble of air around it (a later version of the story in Action Comics #316 (September 1964) has the city saved by weather dome that Zor-El had constructed). The explosion had turned the ground beneath Argo City into Kryptonite, but Zor-El and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead. The Kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years, and Kara was born a short time after the destruction of Krypton. The end for Argo City came when a meteor storm punched holes into the <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting,</b> exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation. Zor-El managed to build a rocket and use it to send his daughter Kara to Earth. Fearing that Superman would not recognize her because he had left Krypton as an infant, Kara's parents provided a costume based closely on the Man of Steel's own.|$|E
50|$|Roof {{shingles}} {{are almost}} always highly visible and so are {{an important aspect of}} a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof shingles, like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of shingle is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some shingles can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All shingle roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the edge seams offset to avoid leaks. Many shingle installations benefit from being placed on top of an underlayment material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the shingles {{on one side of the}} roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting.</b> An asphalt shingle roof has flexible asphalt shingles as the ridge cap. Some roof shingles are non-combustable or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of shingles with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood shingles and organic-based asphalt shingles have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt shingles. No shingles are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional underlayment materials.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 To {{distinguish}} americium- 241 {{in human}} lungs from translocated {{activity in the}} tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN), two intrinsic germanium detectors were collimated with 0. 3 -cm <b>lead</b> <b>sheeting.</b> A tissue- equivalent phantom containing either 620 nCi (22. 9 kBq) in the lungs or a 2200 nCi (81. 4 kBq) TBLN point source was counted; as chest wall thickness increased, net count rate per unit activity generally decreased exponentially for two of three counting positions. Phantom calibration curves were compared to data obtained by the same detection system for a human male with a known lung deposition of 2. 4 nCi (88. 8 Bq) of americium- 241. The relation of the data to the calibration curves indicated the activity was restricted to the lungs. If activity had translocated to the smaller TBLN, the specific dose would have increased and the TBLN might have been designated the critical organ.
