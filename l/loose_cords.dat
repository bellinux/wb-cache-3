6000|$|By {{throwing}} down a partition-wall, Mrs. Blyth's {{room had}} been so enlarged, as to extend along the whole breadth of {{one side of the}} house, measuring from the front to the back garden windows. Considerable as the space was which had been thus obtained, every part of it from floor to ceiling was occupied by objects of beauty proper to the sphere in which they were placed: some, solid and serviceable, where usefulness was demanded; others light and elegant, where ornament alone was necessary--and all won gloriously by Valentine's brush; by the long, loving, unselfish industry of many years. Mrs. Blyth's bed, like everything else that she used in her room, was so arranged as to offer her the most perfect comfort and luxury attainable in her suffering condition. The framework was broad enough to include within its dimensions a couch for day and a bed for night. Her reading easel and work-table could be moved within reach, in whatever position she lay. Immediately above her hung an extraordinary complication of <b>loose</b> <b>cords,</b> which ran through ornamental pulleys of the quaintest kind, fixed at different places in the ceiling, and communicating with the bell, the door, and a pane of glass in the window which opened easily on hinges. These were Valentine's own contrivances to enable his wife to summon attendance, admit visitors, and regulate the temperature of her room at will, by merely pulling at any one of the loops hanging within reach of her hand, and neatly labeled with ivory tablets, inscribed [...] "Bell," [...] "Door," [...] "Window." [...] The cords comprising this rigging for invalid use were at least five times more numerous than was necessary for the purpose they were designed to serve; but Mrs. Blyth would never allow them to be simplified by dexterous hands. Clumsy as their arrangement might appear to others, in her eyes it was without a fault: every useless cord was sacred from the reforming knife, for Valentine's sake.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to describe the slip, trip, and fall injury experience and trends in a population of nursing home workers, identify risk factors for slip, trip, and fall injuries, and develop prevention strategies for slip, trip, and fall hazards. Workers' compensation injury claims data and payroll data from 1996 through 2003 were obtained from six nursing homes and used to calculate injury incidence rates. Narrative information was used to describe details of slip, trip, and fall events. A total of 86 slip, trip, and fall-related workers' compensation claims were filed during the 8 -year period. Slip, trip, and fall claim rates showed a nonsignificant increase during the 8 -year period. Most slips, trips, and falls were attributed to hazards that can be mitigated (e. g., water on the floor or <b>loose</b> <b>cords</b> in a walkway). Nursing home workers experience more slip, trip, and fall-related injury claims than workers in other industries. Preventive programs should be implemented and evaluated in this industry.

40|$|Background: Patient {{falls in}} {{hospitals}} are common and affect approximately 2 % to 17 % of patients during their hospital stay. Patient falls are a nursingsensitive quality indicator {{in the delivery}} of inpatient services. Objective: To assess the effect of educational training program on nursesâ€™ knowledge and performance regarding prevention of fall at one of the health insurance organization hospitals in Alexandria. Setting: The study was conducted at 284 bed general hospital affiliated with the Health Insurance Organization in Alexandria. Design: A quasi-experimental design was followed. Participants: The study sample included all nurses of different ranks working at four departments namely, orthopedic, medical, surgical, ICU unit. Results: There was a significant difference regarding all factors under study before and after the educational programme except for two individual factors, old age (p = 0. 84), overall poor health status (p = 0. 38), and two health factors, uses aids (p = 0. 50), treatment by heparin (p = 1. 00), and two environmental factors, poor lighting (p = 0. 34), <b>loose</b> <b>cords</b> or wires (p = 0. 30) and bells (p = 0. 30), and one miscellaneous factor, patient education (p = 0. 85) and tidy environment(p = 0. 85).

40|$|Work-related slip, trip, {{and fall}} {{incidents}} can frequently result in serious disabling injuries that impact a healthcare employee's {{ability to do}} his or her job, often resulting in lost workdays, reduced productivity, expensive worker compensation claims, and diminished ability to care for patients. According to the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [2009], the incidence rate of lost-workday injuries from slips, trips, and falls (STFs) {{on the same level}} in hospitals was 38. 2 per 10, 000 employees, which was 90 % greater than the average rate for all other private industries combined (20. 1 per 10, 000 employees). STFs as a whole are the second most common cause of lost-workday injuries in hospitals. An analysis of workers' compensation injury claims from acute-care hospitals [Bell et al. 2008] showed that the lower extremities (knees, ankles, feet) were the body parts most commonly injured after STFs and the nature of injury was most often sprains, strains, dislocations and tears. In addition, STFs {{were significantly more likely to}} result in fractures and multiple injuries than were other types of injuries. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Part I.

40|$|Background: Entanglement of the {{umbilical}} cord around the fetal neck (nuchal cord) is quite a common fi nding at delivery. It is often assumed that nuchal cord causes cord compression and thus low birth weight and intrapartum complications. Aim: The aim {{of this article is}} to study the eff ect of nuchal cord on the mode of delivery, complications and fetal outcome. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out on 386 deliveries, 60 of them with nuchal cord, during 1 year from November 2009 through October 2010. Their mode of delivery, complications and fetal outcome were studied and a comparison was established between nuchal cord group and the rest of the deliveries. Nuchal cord group was subdivided into <b>loose</b> nuchal <b>cord</b> (cord could easily be uncoiled before complete delivery of the baby) group and tight nuchal cord (cord was needed to be clamped and cut before delivery of the baby) group. Furthermore, the mode of delivery and fetal outcome were compared between these subgroups. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical soft ware version 12. 0 (Chicago Illinios, USA). The results were expressed as percentages. Test for signifi cance was done using Chi-square, and a P< 0. 05 was considered as signifi cant. Results: The nuchal cord group did not have any signifi cant diff erence in the mode of delivery or fetal outcome compared with the control group. However, the subgroup having tight cord around the neck had signifi cantly higher proportion of low Apgar scores and meconium staining at birth. Conclusions: Nuchal cord does not increase the chances of cesarean delivery. However, tight cord around the neck may result in low Apgar scores and increased incidence of fetal distres...|$|R

While down there in the dark he had heard the firing on shore, and, after a long while, the firing from the deck, and other shots near by. All this had so excited him that he managed to get one hand <b>loose</b> from his <b>cords,</b> and then had speedily unfastened the rest, and had quietly crept to a hatchway, where he could watch what was going on without showing himself. He had seen the two men on deck, ready to fire on the approaching boat. He had recognized Captain Horn and the people of the Miranda in the boat. And then, when there was but one man left on deck, and the boat was afraid to come nearer, he had rushed up behind him and tumbled him overboard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Bactec MGIT 960 {{system is}} a rapid and {{reliable}} automated method for drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) that yields {{a high percentage of}} agreement with the standard method. The microscopic cord morphology of M. tuberculosis in liquid medium is characteristic, and readily differentiates MTBC from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The goals of this study were to describe the microscopic and macroscopic growth morphology of MTBC in antimicrobial-containing MGIT tubes and to evaluate the usefulness of the growth appearance during purity checking. The macroscopic cotton wool-like appearance of MTBC isolates in isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), rifampin (RMP), and ethambutol (EMB) -containing tubes was observed in 97, 90, 93, and 71 % of the isolates, respectively. The percentage of typical <b>cord,</b> <b>loose,</b> or frayed rope microscopic features in smears prepared from MTBC-positive cultures of INH, SM, RMP, and EMB-containing tubes was 96, 86, 97, and 71 %, respectively. The sensitivity of the macroscopic morphology for predicting the purity of drug-containing MGIT tubes was 93 %, while the microscopic morphology predicted the purity with a sensitivity rate of 92 %. We found that simply examining the macroscopic morphology of the antimicrobial-containing MGIT tubes of drug-resistant MTBC isolates is useful in preventing false resistant results of susceptibility testing by the MGIT 960 system...|$|R

6000|$|Nevertheless, by {{the time}} I had buried {{the last of my}} companions my stock of {{provisions}} was so small that I hardly thought I should live long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing, while I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always bringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort and luxury that I had left. But luckily for me the fancy took me to stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sight {{in the depths of the}} cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me. This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again at some distant spot. Why should I not build a raft and trust myself to its swiftly flowing waters? If I perished before I could reach the light of day once more I should be no worse off than I was now, for death stared me in the face, while there was always the possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star, I might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land. I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a stout raft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to spare lay strewn upon the beach. I then made up many packages of rubies, emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and bound them upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and then I seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had fashioned laid ready to my hand, and <b>loosed</b> the <b>cord</b> which held it to the bank. Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy archway, and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly forward by the rapid river. On I went as it seemed to me for many nights and days. Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow escape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I took the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales. Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive, the inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel of food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of hunger. Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep, and when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day; a beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was tied to the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black men. I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I could not understand a word of their language. Feeling perfectly bewildered by my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to myself in Arabic, [...] "Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven will change thy fortune from evil to good." ...|$|R

I think that the can from which he poured out â€“ the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser.
