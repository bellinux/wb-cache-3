Thereafter, she has said that she intends to [...] "slow down" [...] by focusing on her teaching, although she has remarked: [...] "There is really no such thing called a swan song, and I won't like to keep still after being so active. ... I will keep dancing as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> body will say yes to me".|$|E
500|$|The {{practices}} of individual schools and teams {{have changed in}} response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the [...] "Warriors" [...] nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a [...] "circle of courage" [...] logo with eagle feathers and has also [...] "updated" [...] the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: [...] "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." [...] However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.|$|E
2500|$|Howard, {{who turned}} 64 in July, {{declined}} {{to answer questions}} about whether he would serve a full three-year term if his government was re-elected. [...] "I will serve as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> party wants me to," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, dearest papa! I will go {{with you}} all the same!" [...] whimpers one of the {{kneeling}} party. [...] "And I will wait--oh!--as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>my</b> dearest father wants me!" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "My {{fraternity}} {{did something}} for me when I was in school. It helped me {{to learn to live}} with others and to develop my own personal, moral, and social attributes, so that I could fit better into the society which I found when I left the University. The services of fraternity supplemented those of my family, my church and my teachers. For this reason I am willing to continue to work for my fraternity -- so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> fraternity is working to serve its individual members." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Onze notations were {{an early}} attempt to orchestrate eleven of the Douze notations pour piano (1946). In the mid-1970s Boulez {{embarked}} on a second, more radical transformation of these short piano pieces into extended works for large orchestra, a project which pre-occupied him {{to the end of}} his life, nearly seventy years after the original composition. This is only the most extreme example of a lifelong tendency to revisit earlier works: [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> ideas have not exhausted every possibility of proliferation they stay in my mind." [...] Piencikowski characterises this in part as [...] "an obsessional concern for perfection" [...] and observes that with some pieces (such as Le Visage nuptial) [...] "one could speak of successive distinct versions, each one presenting a particular state of the musical material, without the successor invalidating the previous one or vice versa"—although he notes that Boulez almost invariably vetoed the performance of previous versions. Reflecting on the relatively small number of works Boulez completed, the composer George Benjamin wrote: [...] "The world today doesn't need huge numbers of pieces, as it did in, say, Haydn's time. What are needed, surely, are essential statements, singular and unique works. And these he has provided, without question." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
