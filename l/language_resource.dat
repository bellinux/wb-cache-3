The creation of <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> can be subject to two models: 1) the contract model and 2) the exception model. Both models have their advantages and disadvantages. The models are analyzed in the light of developments at the EU level. Before <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> can be distributed, it is necessary to transfer copyright covering resources to a partner of the Center of Estonian <b>Language</b> <b>Resources.</b> The rights are transferred within employment or contractually. For this purpose, CLARIN deposition license agreement templates have been developed. Before end users can access <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> they have to accept CLARIN Terms of Service. The scope of the article is not confined to the explanation of CLARIN agreement templates. The article also highlights the latest amendments to these templates...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the infrastructure of}} a basic <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> set for Bulgarian {{in the context of}} BLARK initiative requirements. We focus on the treebanking task as a trigger for basic <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> compilation. Two strategies have been applied in this respect: (1) implementing the main pre-processing modules before the treebank compilation and (2) creating more elaborate types of resources in parallel to the treebank compilation. The description of <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> within BulTreeBank project is divided into two parts: language technology, which includes tokenization, morphosyntactic analyzer, morphosyntactic disambiguation, partial grammars, and language data, which includes the layers of the BulTreeBank corpus and the variety of lexicons. The advantages of our approach to a less-spoken language (like Bulgarian) are as follows: it triggers the creation of the basic set of <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> which lack for certain languages and it rises the question about the ways of <b>language</b> <b>resources</b> creation...|$|R
