Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a flashlight {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a <b>little</b> <b>old</b> man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist and {{sometimes}} bassist Bill Pitman factored prominently {{in much of}} the Wrecking Crew's work. [...] For a brief time in the late 1950s he provided guitar lessons for a young Phil Spector, before Spector formed the Teddy Bears, who went on to record the surprise hit [...] "To Know Him Is to Love Him" [...] in 1958. [...] Pitman ended up playing on Spector-produced records in the 1960s such as [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by the Ronettes. [...] He can be heard on numerous hits from the period such as [...] "The <b>Little</b> <b>Old</b> Lady (from Pasadena)" [...] by Jan & Dean, and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] by the Byrds.

[...] He provided the flamenco-influenced guitar licks in the 5th Dimension's [...] "Up and Away" [...] as well as the guitar intro to the popular M*A*S*H theme. [...] Billy Strange was one of the top guitarists with the Wrecking Crew and played on hits such as [...] "The <b>Little</b> <b>Old</b> Lady (from Pasadena)" [...] and the Beach Boys' version of [...] "Sloop John B". [...] Guitarist Bill Aken divided his time between L.A. and Nashville, playing for Pappy Daily of Musicor Records for such artists as George Jones. [...] Like Mike Melvoin, Aken was also classically trained at Juilliard.

The vents of such geysers are artificial, but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems. These so-called artificial geysers, technically known as erupting geothermal wells, are not true geysers. <b>Little</b> <b>Old</b> Faithful Geyser, in Calistoga, California, is an example. The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century.

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer.

[...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate.

As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, {{a lot of them}} were recorded in Montreal... when I had a very, very different voice, I kind of sounded like a <b>little</b> <b>old</b> man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga. Wainwright claimed the box set's release shortly after his father's (Loudon Wainwright III) box set 40 Odd Years was [...] "totally serendipitous".|$|E
