Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced {{hallucinations}} {{are caused}} by the consumption of psychoactive substances such as deliriants, psychedelics, and certain stimulants, which are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Some psychedelics such as <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> and psilocybin can cause hallucinations that range from a spectrum of mild to severe.

25|$|League for Spiritual Discovery (LSD) was {{a spiritual}} {{organization}} {{inspired by the}} works of Timothy Leary, and strove for legal use of <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD) {{for the purpose of}} meditation, insight, and spiritual understanding. It was in existence during the mid-to-late 1960s, and eventually closed by Leary. The New York Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery, in existence for around a year, was co-founded by Timothy Leary and Nina Graboi in 1966. The center was the first LSD-based meditation center in Manhattan.|$|E

In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference & Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.|$|E

According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realm. His early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of psychedelic substances such as <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, dipropyl-tryptamine (DPT), and methylene-dioxy-amphetamine (MDA). Later, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathwork.|$|E
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of ergot alkaloids also make them useful {{in the treatment of}} headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages. Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{metabolism}} of o-lysergic <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD) by human liver microsomes was investigated. Tandem mass spectrometric techniques, using precursor and neutral loss scans, {{were employed in}} the initial search for drug metabolites. The determination of LSD human liver in vitro metabolites was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Two new in vitro metabolites, <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> elhylamide (LAE) and 2 -oxo-LSD, were positively identified; their structures were established by comparing with reference standards. Several other possible in vitro metabolites detected were suggested to be mono-and trioxylated metabolites of LSD. The major metabolic route of LSD by human liver microsomes is deethylation. Some results with lSD-positive human urine are presented.

"It's All Too Much" [...] {{reflects}} George Harrison's {{experimentation with}} the hallucinogenic drug <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide,</b> {{commonly known as}} LSD or [...] "acid".

500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] in {{the early}} part of 1966, the year in which his songwriting matured in terms of subject matter and productivity. As a {{secondary}} composer to John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the Beatles, Harrison began to establish his own musical identity through his absorption in Indian culture, as well as the perspective he gained through his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD). According to author Gary Tillery, the song resulted from a [...] "creative surge" [...] that Harrison experienced at the start of 1966. During the same period, the Beatles had been afforded an unusually long time free of professional commitments due to their decision to turn down A Talent for Loving as their third film for United Artists. Harrison used this time to study the Indian sitar and, like Lennon, to explore philosophical issues in his songwriting while preparing to record the band's next album, Revolver.|$|E
500|$|While Roby and Schreiber {{assert that}} Hendrix first used LSD {{when he met}} Linda Keith in late 1966, {{according}} to the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek, the earliest that Hendrix {{is known to have}} taken it was in June 1967, while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross, the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith's New York apartment; when one of Keith's friends offered Hendrix acid, a street name for <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide,</b> Hendrix asked for LSD instead, showing what Cross described as [...] "his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics". Before that, Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs, with his experimentation limited to cannabis, hashish, amphetamines and occasionally cocaine. After 1967, he regularly smoked cannabis and hashish, and used LSD and amphetamines, particularly while touring. According to Cross, by {{the time of his death}} in September 1970, [...] "few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi".|$|E

Rather, American groups emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass.

2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ergotism could explain cases of bewitchment has {{been subject to}} debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael's article, historians Spanos and Gottlieb argued against the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb's rebuttal to Caporael's article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation. For example, they argued that, if the food supply was contaminated, the symptoms would have occurred by household, not individual. However, historian Leon Harrier said that even if supplies were properly cooked, residents suffering from stomach ulcers had a risk of absorbing the toxin through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the bloodstream. Being similar to <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>diethylamide</b> (LSD), ergot would not survive in the acidic environment of a typical human's stomach, especially in properly cooked food. [...] But if some but not all residents were malnourished and suffering from bleeding stomach ulcers, only they could be affected by ingesting contaminated grains, leaving the majority unaffected, explaining why ergotism was not previously recognized. [...] Harrier argued that the numbers could have been larger, possibly including the entire town, but due to the trials on bewitchment and heresy, {{and the fear of}} being accused and subsequently executed, few could come forward while suffering from legitimate medical conditions.|$|E
