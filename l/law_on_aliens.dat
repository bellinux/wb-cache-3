50|$|When {{immigrants}} began flooding into Greece {{in large}} numbers {{for the first time}} in the 1990s, the Greek government was not properly prepared for the management and control of so many migrants. Until 1991, legislation on immigration dated back to the 1920s. In 1991 the first <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Aliens</b> (Law 1975/1991) was enacted, Greece's first attempt to deal with the massive influx of immigration. This law was exclusively concerned with restricting migration into Greece and discouraging the entrance of foreigners into Greece. The only way a foreigner could work in Greece was to obtain a residence and work permit before arrival. Any attempt to enter the country illegally under Law 1975 could be punished with imprisonment ranging from three months to five years. Additionally, migrants were not eligible for any kind of welfare schemes or first aid, apart from in the case of an emergency, unless they have a residence permit. This law was a failure and did nothing to curb illegal immigration and resulted only in the expulsion of massive numbers of illegal immigrants throughout the 1990s, particularly of Albanian migrants. Throughout the 1990s, nearly 2 million migrants, the overwhelming majority of which were males, were deported, with nearly 200,000 deported annually on average; over two-thirds of them were Albanian.|$|E
5000|$|Non-U.S. {{citizens}} {{wishing to}} practice before the USPTO {{in their own}} country may also register by meeting the same requirements if the individual is registered to practice before the patent office in their country of residence AND if their country has a reciprocity agreement with the U.S. Currently, only one country, Canada, has such an agreement; while the Canadian Intellectual Property Office does not recognize this reciprocity. [...] Moreover, the USPTO makes no effort to verify; the requirement exists merely on paper and has no force. Such registration is granted for the limited purpose of representing patent applicants from the individual's country of residence before the USPTO. Non-U.S. citizens legally residing in the United States, having a valid nonimmigrant work visa, and already employed by a patent firm in a patent prosecution role (often referred to as a [...] "technical specialist") may take the exam in order to gain limited recognition to act as a patent agent for applications being handled through their employer. [...] This <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Aliens,</b> 37 C.F.R. 11.6(c), is not enforced by the USPTO Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED). However, employees of the USPTO must be U.S. citizens and this is verified in a background check; patent agents who want to work for the USPTO must first become U.S. citizens.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was only}} in 1997 that two Presidential decrees {{introduced}} the first regularization program in Greece. Presidential decrees 358/1997 and 359/1997 were ill-designed, mismanaged, and {{made it difficult for}} migrants to be successfully regularized, but they laid the first foundations for an institutional framework in Greece that tried to actually deal with immigration in a way that went beyond deportation. A New <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Aliens</b> introduced in 2001 concentrated on short-sighted regulation of migration through restrictive legal migration channels, and a larger regularization program and more comprehensive policy framework to deal with immigration in the long term. There were some benefits to this law, such as the right to be informed in a language one understood while in detention, and obligatory nine-year education for migrant children. However, certain aspects of the law, such as the need to renew visas every year, neglected the needs of local labor markets to fill positions in a relatively short time, and almost completely ignored the fact that many immigrants would still try to migrate illegally. Lawful residence of migrants who had not already been in Greece before 2001 was very difficult under this law. The immigration law was also still discriminatory regarding citizenship acquisition and made distinctions between co-ethnic returnees and [...] "foreigners" [...] or [...] "aliens". In 2004 the government decided to issue permits of two-year duration, as opposed to one-year, which cut down on time and monetary costs of applying for a visa, but there were still many issues with regularization. The small number of work permits, their limited duration, and the general policy orientation of the Greek government was not conducive to creating sustainable immigration policy.|$|E

40|$|Protection of {{refugees}} in India is solely regulated at policy level by national administrative authorities as India {{is neither a}} party to the protocol 1951 Refugee Convention nor has it adopted national refugee legislation. However, India is hosting around 190, 000 refugees originating from various countries of the world. Refugees in India are facing uncertainty on their rights because of the absence of codified protection strategy and specific national <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> <b>aliens</b> which made no distinction between refugees and foreigners. The paper analyses national initiatives, UNHCR’s role {{and the role of the}} judiciary towards achieving refugee protection in India. Finally, the paper argues that India should develop own national refugee legislation.
