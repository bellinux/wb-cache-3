25|$|The Dominican anole {{spends much}} of the time in trees but mainly hunts on the ground. Insects make up the bulk of its prey, with soft-bodied {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates hunted less frequently. Long-living and <b>late</b> <b>maturing</b> for anoles, the Dominican anole can usually breed from around two to three months of age. Females lay eggs, and breeding can occur at any time of year. Clutches number one or sometimes two eggs and are laid under rocks or leaves on the ground. Although presently widespread and common on Dominica, it faces competition from the Puerto Rican crested anole, an invasive species which has begun to supplant it in part of its range.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. <b>Late</b> <b>maturing</b> boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

40|$|A {{large sample}} of {{terminal}} (apical) twigs was marked in a l-yr study of crown growth of juvenile, early <b>mature,</b> and <b>late</b> <b>mature</b> Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud. (Myrtaceae) trees. Populations of terminal twigs in upper crowns of juvenile, early, and <b>late</b> <b>mature</b> trees increased by 10 %, 33 %, and 5 %, respectively. Vegetative flushing occurred {{at all times}} of the year. Length of dormancy before bud-break was variable and not synchronized among twigs. Mature trees showed temporal peaks in flowering that were not the same for early and <b>late</b> <b>mature</b> trees. The greatest differences in crown growth processes among the three life states were associated with intensity of flowering and spatial organization of the region of high vegetative growth. Juvenile trees showed apical control with strong flushing in the upper branches, but a low rate of flushing and {{a high rate of}} twig death in the lower crown. They did not flower. Sampled branches of the two mature life states were divided into those that showed {{an increase in the number}} of terminal twigs (high growth) and those that did not (low growth). No spatial separation of the two groups was evident. Branches with low growth had higher rates of flowering, and rate of flowering was higher in <b>late</b> <b>mature</b> than in early mature trees. Rates of vegetative flushing were higher in trees in mature life states than in juvenile trees, indicating no reduction of meristematic activity with aging. In <b>late</b> <b>mature</b> trees, many of the twigs formed early in the sample year flushed a second time, producing inflorescences. Thus, the net increase in the number of twigs in their crowns was very small...|$|R

500|$|As {{with most}} ancestral species, {{alligator}} gar are long living, and sexually <b>late</b> <b>maturing.</b> [...] Most females do not reach sexual maturity until {{after their first}} decade of life while males reach sexual maturity in half that time. [...] The conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur. [...] Preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended photoperiod and rising water temperatures, but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event. [...] When rivers rise and spread over the floodplain, they create oxbow lakes and sloughs, and inundate terrestrial vegetation which in turn provides protection and a nutrient rich habitat for larval fishes, and fry. [...] Once the water temperature has reached , {{and all the other}} criteria are met, gars will move into the grassy, weed-laden shallows to spawn.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{scientists}} {{have called for}} an end to subsidies paid to deep sea fisheries. In international waters beyond the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones of coastal countries, many fisheries are unregulated, and fishing fleets plunder the depths with state-of-the-art technology. In a few hours, massive nets weighing up to 15 tons, [...] dragged along the bottom by deep-water trawlers, can destroy deep-sea corals and sponge beds that have taken centuries or millennia to grow. The trawlers can target orange roughy, grenadiers, or sharks. These fish are usually long-lived and <b>late</b> <b>maturing,</b> and their populations take decades, even centuries to recover.|$|E
2500|$|For girls, early {{maturation}} {{can sometimes}} {{lead to increased}} self-consciousness, though a typical aspect in maturing females. Because of their bodies' developing in advance, pubescent girls can become more insecure and dependent. Consequently, girls that reach sexual maturation early {{are more likely than}} their peers to develop eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa). Nearly half of all American high school girls' diets are to lose weight. In addition, girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature. In addition to having earlier sexual experiences and more unwanted pregnancies than <b>late</b> <b>maturing</b> girls, early maturing girls are more exposed to alcohol and drug abuse.

2500|$|Dominican anoles are {{relatively}} long-living and <b>late</b> <b>maturing</b> compared to mainland anole species. [...] Males mature at a size of 35mm SVL, and females mature at 40mm SVL, {{which they are}} likely to attain at an age of two or three months old. [...] They breed throughout the year, with a peak {{at the end of the}} dry season, particularly in areas such as the north Caribbean coast that have more seasonal rainfall variation. [...] Females are oviparous, and lay multiple clutches of eggs each year, with a short period between clutches. [...] Females in captivity have produced eggs every 14 days. [...] Each clutch typically contains only one egg, though clutches of two can occur without apparent relationship to season, location, or size of the females. [...] Egg production alternates ovaries and overlaps cycles, with one ovary ending its cycle after the opposite ovary has begun. [...] Eggs are laid sheltered under ground litter such as rocks or leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Sturgeons are long-lived, <b>late</b> <b>maturing</b> fishes. Their average {{lifespan}} is 50 to 60 years, {{and their}} first spawn {{does not occur}} until they are around 15 to 20 years old. Sturgeons are broadcast spawners, and do not spawn every year because they require specific conditions. Those requirements {{may or may not}} be met every year due to varying environmental conditions, such as the proper photoperiod in Spring, clear water with shallow rock or gravel substrate where the eggs can adhere, and proper water temperature and flow for oxygenation of the eggs. A single female may release 100,000 to 3 million eggs but not all will be fertilized. The fertilized eggs become sticky and will adhere to the bottom substrate upon contact. It takes 8–15 days for the embryos to mature into larval fish. During that time, they are dependent on their yolk sac for nourishment. River currents carry the larvae downstream into backwater areas, such as oxbows and sloughs where the free-swimming fry will spend their first year feeding on insect larvae and crustacea. During their first year of growth, they will reach [...] in length and migrate back into the swift-flowing currents in the main stem river.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to model {{developmental}} changes in explosive power based on the contribution of chronological age, anthropometrical characteristics, motor coordination parameters, and flexibility. Methods: Two different longitudinal, multilevel models were obtained to predict countermovement jump (CMJ) and standing broad jump (SBJ) performance in 356 high-level, youth soccer players, age 11 - 14 yr at baseline. Biological maturity status was estimated (age at peak height velocity [APHV]), and variation in the development of explosive power was examined based on three maturity groups (APHV; earliest P 66). Results: The best-fitting model for the CMJ performance of the <b>latest</b> <b>maturing</b> players could be expressed as: 8. 65 + 1. 04 x age + 0. 17 x age(2) + 0. 15 x leg length + 0. 12 x fat-free mass + 0. 07 x sit-and-reach + 0. 01 x moving sideways. The best models for average and earliest maturing players were the same as for the <b>latest</b> <b>maturing</b> players, minus 0. 73 and 1. 74 cm, respectively. The best-fitting model on the SBJ performance could be expressed as follows: 102. 97 + 2. 24 x age + 0. 55 x leg length + 0. 66 x fat-free mass + 0. 16 x sit-and-reach + 0. 13 jumping sideways. Maturity groups had a negligible effect on SBJ performance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that different jumping protocols (vertical vs long jump) highlight the need for special attention in the evaluation of jump performance. Both protocols emphasized growth, muscularity, flexibility, and motor coordination as longitudinal predictors. The use of the SBJ is recommended in youth soccer identification and selection programs because biological maturity status has no effect on its development through puberty...|$|R
