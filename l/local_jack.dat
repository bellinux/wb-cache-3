50|$|The final signed {{confession}} by Self contained notable discrepancies; in the confession, Self stated he had dumped Shaw and Johnson's {{bodies in}} El Largo, which was over twenty {{miles from the}} marsh where police discovered the remains. Self also wrote in his confession that he strangled both girls to death, though reports from the medical examiner showed no evidence of strangulation. Three days after his confession, on June 23, 1972, Self provided further details to police in an oral confession that conflicted with his initial written confession. In an interview with Deputy Sheriff W.A. Turner and Deputy Sheriff Frank Beamer, Self claimed that he had picked up Shaw and Johnson from a Sizzler steakhouse, and that the two had driven around the El Largo neighborhood and gotten food from a <b>local</b> <b>Jack</b> in the Box restaurant. According to Beamer, Self claimed to have pulled over in a secluded area, and struck the girls {{over the head with}} a Coca-Cola bottle, and that he had stripped their clothes and thrown them on the highway; this conflicted {{with the fact that the}} girls' clothing was discovered with their remains. He then claimed to have thrown the girls' bodies in a culvert on Choate Road.|$|E
50|$|In the Trimline version {{designed}} for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone (or {{to all of the}} jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one <b>local</b> <b>jack</b> used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks {{in other parts of the}} house. The early Trimline and Princess phone dial light incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric-made Princess version had no dial light.|$|E
