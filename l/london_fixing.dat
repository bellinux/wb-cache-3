40|$|Fixing in {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} market, in Tokyo at 10 am and in London at 4 pm, is a market practice that determines the bid-ask-mid-point exchange rate at a scheduled {{time of the day}} in Japan. The fixing exchange rate is then applied to the settlement of foreign exchange transactions between banks and retail customers including broker dealers, institutional investors, insurance companies, exporters and importers, with varying bid-ask spreads. The findings for the Tokyo fixing are summarized as follows. (1) Price spikes are more frequent than the <b>London</b> <b>fixing.</b> (2) The customer orders are biased toward buying the foreign currencies, and this is predictable. (3) Trading volumes and liquidity concentrate on the USD/JPY. (4) Before 2008, the fixing price set by banks was biased upward, and higher than the highest transaction price during the fixing time window; the banks were earning monopolistic profits, but this gap disappeared after 2008. (5) The fixing price is still above the average transaction prices in the fixing window, suggesting that banks make profits, but that can be understood considering the risk of maintaining the fix {{for the rest of the}} business day. And (6) calendar effects also matter for the determination of the fixing rate and the price fluctuation around fixing. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we studied}} {{the gold and}} silver {{relationship}} using stochastic-parameter regression models. We formulated their time-varying relationship as a state-space model and used the Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the stochastic regression parameters for gold and silver prices. The data set used in this thesis covers 31 years using the <b>London</b> <b>fix</b> prices between January 1969 and December 2000. The start date {{was selected as the}} first full year silver prices were included in the <b>London</b> <b>fix</b> prices. Our stochastic parameter regression model explained well the time-varying relationship between gold and silver prices. As a special case of the stochastic parameter regression model, we also fitted the random walk, the random walk with drift model and random coefficient model. The random walk with drift model appeared to have the closest fit with 12 -month forecast errors minimal among those four models considered in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|Fixing” of the {{exchange}} rate (price) is a rule among the Forex market participating institutions to set a reference/settlement price for the day. Major fixings occur at 9 : 55 am Tokyo time for transactions between Japanese banks and their customers, and at 4 : 00 pm London time for transactions between European and US banks and their customers. The two fixings have different regulations and institutions. The London fix is calculated as an average price during the one minute window around 4 : 00 pm. We empirically examine the movement of prices {{around the time of}} fixing. Regulators in the UK and the US have accused banks of colluding by manipulating the price around the <b>London</b> <b>fixing</b> time. It has been mentioned in the media that there was evidence of “chats” among traders of different institutions in order to carry out this collusion. But, is there evidence of price manipulation? We found little evidence of volatile movement (or spikes) in prices around the fixing time. In fact, liquidity provision at the fixing time is larger than other times, which makes the price impact of any trade smaller. At the Tokyo fixing, however, financial institutions can fix the price by themselves based on the market price. Although the market provides deep liquidity at the Tokyo fixing as well, such financial institutions had announced prices to be more favorable for banks up until 2008. Such deviation of the fixing price from the market price might be related to the settlement needs of importers, as well as banks wanting {{to reduce the risk of}} being caught with a dollar shortage later in the day...|$|E

The brothers were estimated to hold {{one third of the}} entire world supply of silver (other than that held by governments).

Bank assets more than doubled between 1980 and 1984, and loans became concentrated to a few borrowers, including Mahmoud Sipra and his El Saeed group, Rajendra Sethia and ESAL Commodities, and Abdul Shamji. The quality {{of some of these}} loans turned out to be worse than expected, such as the £21 million lent to Abdul Shamji of Gomba Holdings (the then owner of Puddle Dock and the Mermaid Theatre in London). The size of the loans grew to exceed the level of the bank's capital. (Shamji was sentenced to 15 months in prison for lying about his assets during a High Court inquiry into the bank's collapse.) Because JMB was one of five members of the <b>London</b> Gold <b>Fixing,</b> Bank of England officials were worried that if it became insolvent confidence in the other bullion banks would be undermined, and panic could spread {{to the rest of the}} British banking system. To prevent a wider banking crisis the Bank of England organized a rescue package on the evening of 30 September 1984, purchasing JMB for £1.

The partners were Louis Balfour (a Sharps partner since 1916), Stewart Pixley, grandson of the founder of Pixley & Abell, with his son, also Stewart. The Pixleys moved into Sharps' offices in Great Winchester Street.
