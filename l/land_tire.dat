2500|$|Tires are {{the most}} often dumped {{hazardous}} waste. In 2007 the United States generated 262 million scrap tires. Thirty-eight states have laws that ban whole tires being deposited in landfills. Many of these discarded tires end up illegally dumped on public <b>lands.</b> <b>Tires</b> can become {{a breeding ground for}} insect vectors which can transmit disease to humans. Mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water, can transmit West Nile virus and malaria. Rodents nest in accumulated tires and can transmit diseases such as Hantavirus ...|$|R
5000|$|When a plane <b>lands,</b> the <b>tires</b> are not spinning. The time {{it takes}} for the tires to get up to speed is {{referred}} to as [...] "spin up time" [...] (Speidel, 2002). During this time the tires are effectively dragging on the runway as well as being put under pressure by the weight of the airplane. This {{can be seen in the}} slight puff of smoke that comes from a <b>landing</b> aircraft's <b>tires</b> as they first touch the runway surface. The friction built up causes the rubber to polymerize and harden to the runway surface.|$|R

50|$|During the shuttle's {{landing at}} KSC on April 19, 1985, {{extensive}} brake damage was suffered, and a <b>landing</b> gear <b>tire</b> ruptured. This prompted future shuttle flights {{to land at}} Edwards Air Force Base, California, until effective nose wheel steering could be implemented to reduce risks during landing.|$|R
50|$|Other {{necessary}} modifications, {{apart from}} those already described, were replacing the rudders with strengthened units, all main <b>landing</b> gear <b>tires</b> were replaced {{and the main}} gear leg structures reinforced. APQ-13 radar sets had to be fitted. Finally, long range fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bays.|$|R

40|$|The National Tire Modeling Program (NTMP) {{is a joint}} NASA/industry {{effort to}} improve the {{understanding}} of tire mechanics and develop accurate analytical design tools. This effort includes fundamental analytical and experimental research on the structural mechanics of tires. Footprint local forces, areas, and aspect ratios were measured. Local footprint forces in the vertical, lateral, and drag directions were measured with a special footprint force transducer. Measurements of the local forces in the footprint were obtained by positioning the transducer at specified locations within the footprint and externally loading the tires. Three tires were tested: (1) one representative of those used on the main landing gear of B- 737 and DC- 9 commercial transport airplanes, (2) a nose <b>landing</b> gear <b>tire</b> for the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and (3) a main <b>landing</b> gear <b>tire</b> for the Space Shuttle Orbiter. Data obtained for various inflation pressures and vertical loads are presented for two aircraft tires. The results are presented in graphical and tabulated forms...|$|R

6000|$|At Easter-time, the Barons {{assembled}} at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, in proud array, and, marching near to Oxford {{where the}} King was, delivered {{into the hands}} of Stephen Langton and two others, a list of grievances. 'And these,' they said, 'he must redress, or we will do it for ourselves!' When Stephen Langton told the King as much, and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage. But that did him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the Barons with lies. They called themselves and their followers, 'The army of God and the Holy Church.' Marching through the country, with the people thronging to them everywhere (except at Northampton, where they failed in an attack upon the castle), they at last triumphantly set up their banner in London itself, whither the whole <b>land,</b> <b>tired</b> of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join them. Seven knights alone, of all the knights in England, remained with the King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent the Earl of Pembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of everything, and would meet them to sign their charter when they would. 'Then,' said the Barons, 'let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the place, Runny-Mead.' ...|$|R

25|$|The MiG-21 uses a {{tricycle}} type undercarriage. On most variants {{the main}} <b>landing</b> gear uses <b>tires</b> that are 800mm {{in diameter and}} 200mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660x200mm. The wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87° and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar.|$|R
50|$|After Mercury, the {{pressure}} suit {{was used for}} the early development phases for the Gemini program, but because {{of the success of the}} X-15 high altitude pressure suit, the bigger room on the Gemini spacecraft, and the need to develop a suit for Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) outside the spacecraft, the Mercury suit was phased out of NASA service and was replaced with the basic G3C version of the X-15 suit. Since then, NASA has used either the David Clark Company, ILC Dover, Hamilton Sundstrand, or Oceaneering International for all pressure and spacesuit needs. B.F. Goodrich would only be used after Mercury for the production of the <b>landing</b> gear <b>tires</b> for the Space Shuttle, but this has since been done by Michelin.|$|R
25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the <b>landing</b> gear <b>tires</b> with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|R

Its 28.4 ft span wing has an area of 127.7 sq ft, is supported by [...] "V" [...] struts and features fiberglass drooped wingtips. The main landing gear {{is made from}} sprung steel and mounts drum brakes. The elevator trim system is electric. The aircraft's recommended engine the [...] Hirth F-23 two-stroke powerplant. Tricycle <b>landing</b> gear, tundra <b>tires</b> and floats are under development. Construction time from the supplied kit is estimated as 200-300 hours.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{skidding}} {{process that}} occurs when a heavy aircraft’s main <b>landing</b> gear <b>tires</b> touchdown, since the 1940 s, a number of ideas have been patented to improve tire safety and decrease the substantial wear and smoke during every landing by spinning the gear wheels before touchdown. In this paper, a coupled structural–thermal transient analysis in ANSYS {{has been used to}} model a single wheel main landing gear as a mass-spring system. This model has been chosen to analyze the wheel’s dynamic behavior and tire tread temperature during the short period from static to a matching free-rolling velocity in which the wheel is forced to accelerate by the friction between the tire and ground. The tire contact surface temperature has been calculated for both the initially static and prespun wheels in order to compare the temperature levels for different initial rotations and to validate the use of the prespinning technique...|$|R

5000|$|Weapons play a {{key role}} in winning the game. All {{vehicles}} come with a pair of mounted machine guns. They are weak in power, but have unlimited ammunition. However, the guns can overheat if used for too long at a time, preluded by the overheat light on the bottom-right corner of the screen blinking red. When the light becomes fully red, the machine guns will cease to function and the player will have to allow the guns to cool off before they can be used again. Additional weapons scattered throughout the environments can be picked up and utilized if the player drives through them. These weapons include a variety of missiles, <b>land</b> mines, <b>tire</b> spikes and oil slicks. All vehicles can carry up to 30 weapons. The words [...] "MAX CARRYING CAPACITY" [...] will appear on screen whenever a vehicle attempts to carry more than 30 weapons.|$|R
