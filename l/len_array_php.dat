The setup usually consists of a Fourier lens and two identical regular microlens arrays - {{often referred to as}} tandem lens array - where the second one is placed in the focal plane of the first microlenses. Due to the periodic structure of regular arrays the output intensity distribution is modulated by equidistant sharp intensity peaks which are disturbing the homogeneity. The equidistantly located intensity peaks can be suppressed when using a chirped and therefore non-periodic microlens array. A far field speckle pattern with more densely and irregularly located intensity peaks results leading to an improved homogeneity of the intensity distribution. In contrast to stochastic arrays, chirped arrays consist of individually shaped lenses defined by a parametric description of the cells optical function which can be derived completely from analytical functions. This gives the opportunity to build up tandem array setups enabling to achieve far field intensity distribution with an envelope of a top-hat. We propose a new concept for fly's eye condensers incorporating a chirped tandem microlens array for the generation of a top-hat far field intensity distribution with improved homogenization under coherent illumination. The setup is compliant to reflow of photoresist as fabrication technique since plane substrates accommodating the arrays are used.

The focus and lens aberration problems have challenged photographers since the very beginning therefore light field photography was proposed to solve these problems. <b>Lens</b> <b>array</b> and multiple camera systems are used to capture 4 D light rays, by reordering the different views of scene from multiple directions. The coded aperture is another method to encode the angular information in frequency domain. However, infrared light field sensing is still widely opening to research. In the paper, we will propose micro plane mirror optics together with compressive sensing algorithm to record light field in infrared spectrum. The micro mirror reflects objects irradiation and forms a virtual image behind the plane in which the mirror lies. The Digital Micromirror (DMD) consists of millions microscale mirrors which work as CCD array in the camera and it is controlled separately so as to project linear combination of object image onto lens. Coded aperture could be utilized to control angular resolution of infrared light rays. The carbon nanotube based infrared detector, which has ultra high signal to noise ratio and ultra fast responsibility, will sum up all image information on it without image distortion. Based on a number of measurements, compressive sensing algorithm was used to recover images from distinct angles, which could compute different views of scene to reconstruct infrared light field scence.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between the surface materials and the body dynamics complicate the characterization of space objects from their optical signatures. One method for decoupling these two effects on the observed signature is to obtain simultaneous measurements using multiple spectral filter bands. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that it provides spectral resolution between the filter bands to identify the different materials based on their optical properties as a function of wavelength and temporal resolution between samples to identify the periodic, quasi-periodic, and transient fluctuations characteristic of the object motions, including attitude control, maneuvers, and station-keeping. We have developed algorithms to extract and to analyze light curve data from unresolved resident space objects (RSO) collected at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO) using the Multi <b>Lens</b> <b>Array</b> (MLA) camera coupled to the 2. 4 -m telescope. The MLA camera produces 16 spectrally-filtered and temporally synchronous sub-images ranging from 414 nm to 845 nm. We have developed a filter band calibration using a set of stellar observations to remove the atmospheric refraction and absorption effects and differences in the optical paths across the different filter bands using catalogued spectrophotometric data. We apply wavelet analysis to the RSO optical signature light curves to obtain the time-frequency characteristics of the signal for each band. This information allows us to obtain information about the body motions as a function of time. We next attempt to correlate these characteristics across the different MLA filter bands to derive constraints on the types of surface materials. In this presentation, we will present results from several case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and to provide guidance on the effectiveness of different spectral bands for space object characterization. 2...|$|R

The assembly s relatively low concentration ratio, accompanied by a large radiative area, provides for a low cell operating temperature, and eliminates many of the thermal problems inherent in high-concentration-ratio designs. Unlike other reflector technologies, the FACT concentrator modules function on both z-fold and rolled flexible solar array blankets, as well as rigid array systems.

Mega-ROSA's inherent broad power scalability is achieved while retaining ROSA s solar array performance metrics and missionenabling features for lightweight, compact stowage volume and affordability.
