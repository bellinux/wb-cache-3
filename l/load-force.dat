40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear servo-control design based on Fuzzy model for safer and comfortable levitation of an electromagnetic suspension stage consisting of triple arrangement of hybrid electromagnets, since conventional linear control design can give satisfactory results only around a specified linearization point for tiny displacements. The authors have proposed compensation principle {{for a proper}} control action according to change of operational points through fuzzy inference algorithm. Fuzzy reasoning acts as a gain scheduler among approximate local linear controllers derived from various gap operating points. The authors integrate a zero-order disturbance observer for estimating gap velocity and winding currents, {{as well as for}} improving performance of the system under external <b>load-force</b> changes. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodology is verified through several experiments...|$|E

The whole setup {{can be considered as}} a «tip-CNT-substrate» junction. By imaging individual CNTs, we were able to deduce their intrinsic radial resistance from the global one measured experimentally and the electrical contact ones calculated across the junction via a series-parallel resistance network model. Using a conductive Pt/Ir tip, we found a high resistance value of about 105 Ω for a cantilever <b>load-force</b> of about 16 to 80 nN with our AFM setup. For an application in electronic devices, this suggests the need to reduce the contact resistance by applying a more important load and to optimize the CNTs functionalization. Through this study, parasitic phenomena were also evidenced with diamond tips for negative bias voltages as well as some high positive ones, causing an irreversible increase of the measured electrical resistance. This observation was attributed to the redox reactions at the tip and/or sample surface leading to a local surface modification of the CNTs and substrate.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of modern}} control theory to produce an {{electrical}} motor simulation of a Formula 1, Grand Pnx, passive motorcycle front suspension shock absorber is investigated. It is shown, using a test-rig comprising two permanent magnet DC motors directly coupled, that desired shock absorber responses to load forces can be achieved using model reference control. The controller feedback in this test rig is provided via a high resolution rotary position sensor. A stochastic Kalman filter is used to produce estimates of the load(disturbance), force and velocity from this position information. All states are then used in the controller. A mass, spring and damper model is chosen as a suitable representation of a shock absorber, and is assumed sufficiently complex to justify the control techniques used. This linear model is translated using mathematical techniques into a rotary equivalent that is compatible {{for use in the}} controller. This translation takes into account thermal effects, as well as kinematic requirements encountered by the motor on the basis of <b>load-force</b> data taken from the front suspension of a Formula 1 motorcycle in race conditions. The parameters of the mass spring and damper model are found from simple static tests using the shock absorber removed from the bike...|$|E
40|$|Fred Olsen is {{currently}} testing their latest {{wave energy converter}} (WEC), Lifesaver, outside of Falmouth Bay in England, preparing it for commercial operation at the Wavehub test site. Previous studies, mostly focusing on hydrodynamics and peak to average power reduction, have shown that this device has potential for increased power extraction using reactive control. This article extends those analyses, adding a detailed model of the all-electric power take-off (PTO) system, consisting of a permanent magnet synchronous generator, inverter and DC-link. Time domain simulations {{are performed to evaluate}} the PTO capabilities of the modeled WEC. However, when tuned towards reactive control, the generator losses become large, giving a very low overall system efficiency. Optimal control with respect to electrical output power is found to occur with low added mass, and when compared to pure passive loading, a 1 % increase in annual energy production is estimated. The main factor reducing the effect of reactive control is found to be the minimum <b>load-force</b> constraint of the device. These results suggest that the Lifesaver has limited potential for increased production by reactive control. This analysis is nevertheless valuable, as it demonstrates how a wave-to-wire model can be used for investigation of PTO potential, annual energy production estimations and evaluations of different control techniques for a given WEC device.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} this device has potential for increased power extraction using reactive control, but so far these investigations have focused on the hydrodynamics of the device and on reducing the peak-to-average power ratio while omitting the effect of the electric power take off system. This thesis shows the development of the hydrodynamic model of the device as well as a detailed model of the all-electric power take-off system consisting of a permanent magnet synchronous generator, inverter and DC-link. Vector Control is used to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator, and field weakening control of the generator is applied in order allow over-speed operation. Time domain wave-to-wire simulations are performed to evaluate the power take off capabilities of the modelled wave energy converter with different control parameters. When tuned according to approximate complex conjugate control the accumulated average generator losses become large, giving a very low overall system efficiency. Optimal control with respect to electrical output power is found to be with low added mass, and when compared to pure passive loading a 1 % increase in annual energy production is achieved. The main factor that reduces the effect of reactive control is found to be the minimum <b>load-force</b> constraint of the device, which cannot be lower than 1 ton. Example simulations on a device with different force constraint are performed which verifies this characteristic. These results suggests that the Bolt 2 has limited potential for increase in power extraction by implementing reactive control.

40|$|Crevecoeur F, McIntyre J, Thonnard J-L, Lefevre P. Movement {{stability}} under uncertain {{internal models}} of dynamics. J Neurophysiol 104 : 1301 - 1313, 2010. First published June 16, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /jn. 00315. 2010. Sensory noise and feedback delay are {{potential sources of}} instability and variability for the on-line control of movement. It is commonly assumed that predictions based on internal models allow the CNS to anticipate the consequences of motor actions and protect the movements from uncertainty and instability. However, during motor learning and exposure to unknown dynamics, these predictions can be inaccurate. Therefore a distinct strategy is necessary to preserve movement stability. This study tests the hypothesis that in such situations, subjects adapt the speed and accuracy constraints on the movement, yielding a control policy that is less prone to undesirable variability in the outcome. This hypothesis was tested by asking subjects to hold a manipulandum in precision grip and to perform single-joint, discrete arm rotations during short-term exposure to weightlessness (0 g), where the internal models of the limb dynamics must be updated. Measurements of grip force adjustments indicated that the internal predictions were altered during early exposure to the 0 g condition. Indeed, the grip force/load force coupling reflected that the grip force was less finely tuned to the <b>load-force</b> variations {{at the beginning of}} the exposure to the novel gravitational condition. During this learning period, movements were slower with asymmetric velocity profiles and target undershooting. This effect was compared with theoretical results obtained in the context of optimal feedback control, where changing the movement objective can be directly tested by adjusting the cost parameters. The effect on the simulated movements quantitatively supported the hypothesis of a change in cost function during early exposure to a novel environment. The modified optimization criterion reduces the trial-to-trial variability in spite of the fact that noise affects the internal prediction. These observations support the idea that the CNS adjusts the movement objective to stabilize the movement when internal models are uncertain...|$|E
