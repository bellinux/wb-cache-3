5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystem.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystem</b> and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} fields of {{research}} at the Resources and Environment Area of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), environmental systems have played a significant role ever since the establishment of the Institute. In 1977, {{as a result of an}} IIASA workshop on Water Quality Modeling, it was decided to focus particular attention on the water quality problems of natural lakes and man-made impoundments (storage reservoirs). It was felt that IIASA could make an important contribution to the use of models for water quality control and management purposes by attempting to bridge the gap between the natural sciences and policy-oriented disciplines. Accordingly, two specialized workshops were convened. The first of these was the workshop on Geophysical and Ecological Modeling of Deep Lakes and Reservoirs (1977) and the second one was the workshop on Hydrological and Ecological Models of Shallow Lakes and Reservoirs (1978). Based on the discussions at these workshops, the needs for methodological developments and for comparative studies involving <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in IIASA's National Member Countries were identified. In 1979 a case study on Lake Balaton was initiated as a comparative venture between IIASA and several Hungarian organizations, led by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1980 the set of IIASA's lake-related case studies was enriched by the initiation of a study on <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in Austria. This work was started with the generous support of the Austrian "Fonds zur Foerderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung" and was conducted in close collaboration with several Austrian organizations led by the Institute of Limnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In this paper, Dr. Kurt Fedra, Principal Investigator for the Austrian <b>Lake</b> <b>Ecosystems</b> Case Study, reports on the project achievements, problems, and plans for further research a seen after the first year of the study. It contains a thorough description of the <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> studied as well as a discussion of methodological achievements and problems. IIASA's studies on <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are designed to enhance understanding, to extend and develop new methods of analysis, and to assist analysts and decision-makers concerned with the utilization of these systems and the preservation of their natural values. The implementation of these goals obviously calls for establishment of direct contacts, not only with the research community, but also with decision-makers interested in using the results of our analytical work. And this is why particular stress is laid in this paper on expanding collaborative ties with representatives of various scientific' disciplines and decision-making organizations.

40|$|The healthy {{development}} of <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{is a global}} issue. Bacteria are not only an integral component of food webs, but also {{play a key role}} in controlling and regulating water quality in <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Hence, in order to provide some suggestions for maintaining the long-term and healthy {{development of}} <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> this review discusses and analyses concepts and assessment of bacterial diversity, the distribution of bacteria communities, mechanisms of formation, and the ecological functions of such communities in lake water bodies. In total, there are 21 freshwater bacterial phyla typically found in lake waters at present. Among them, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia are the most important. The Beijerinck and Baas-Becking perspective and the meta- community hypothesis suggest that bacterial community diversity and species distributions in lake water bodies are caused by the combinedaction of stochastic and determinate processes. Research on the function of lake bacteria has mainly focused on processes that bacteria are involved in, for example water quality and elemental biogeochemical cycles. Despite efforts over the past 10 years, knowledge on lake bacterial community diversity and function is still very limited. Lake bacterial ecology is still a young science, which restricts people further understanding of microbial communities in lake bodies. Future research is required on: (1) integrating bacterialphenotype, genotype, phylogeny and ecological features to define the concept of bacterial “species”; (2) the dispersal of bacteria between different locations at a regional scale; (3) bacterial community diversity and functional characteristics at the micro scale; (4) ecological theories and hypotheses of bacterial community diversity in <b>lake</b> <b>ecosystems</b> to improve the theoretical framework of microbial ecology...|$|R
