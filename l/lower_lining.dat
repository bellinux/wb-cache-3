The blow was soft {{as if something}} had eased the shock and the fellow's shape was bulky about his hips.

50|$|A. The <b>lower</b> <b>line</b> of {{the bass}} stave is {{considered}} the first degree, or lowest sound in the general scale of music; no tune should be keyed so low, but that {{a note on the}} <b>lower</b> <b>line</b> of the bass could be distinctly sounded by a medium voice. You will therefore ascend the degrees of sound in regular succession, either by the order of the notes, or by numbers, one, two, three, &c., from the <b>lower</b> <b>line</b> of the bass, or first degree, to the second or fourth, the places of the natural sharp and flat keys.:Although Jones's directions are somewhat obscure and do not account for the possibility of transposition to accommodate varying vocal ranges, their mere presence appears to be unique in a Southern tunebook.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new method for video script {{identification}} which is essential before choosing an appropriate OCR engine for identifying text lines when a video frame contains more than one language. The input for script identification is the text lines obtained by our text detection method. We extract upper and lower extreme points for each connected component of Canny edges of text lines. The extracted points are connected to study the behavior of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lines.</b> The direction of each 10 -pixel segment of the lines is determined using PCA. The average angle of the segments of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lines</b> is computed to study the smoothness and cursiveness of the lines. In addition, to discriminate the scripts accurately, the method divides a text line into five equal zones horizontally to study the smoothness and cursiveness of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lines</b> of each zone. We evaluate the method by conducting experiments on different combinations of languages such as English and Chinese...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2008, the {{government}} announced a further £2m of investment from its [...] "Parklands" [...] fund, to be invested in pathways, lighting, entrances and a pedestrian bridge connecting the Great Lines to Fort Amherst. Then MidKent College, who built a new campus on part of the <b>Lower</b> <b>Lines,</b> gave £7million to the Heritage Park to improve the <b>Lower</b> Lines.The <b>Lower</b> <b>Lines</b> Park is 5.5 hectares of the open land linked to the Lines fortifications. It has been re-developed with new signs, paths, planting areas, children play area and wildlife trail. In January 2010 the park was {{opened to the public}}. On 2 June 2010, it was officially opened to the public by Admiral Sir Ian Garnett with the Mayor of Medway, Cllr David Brake, project director for the construction of MidKent College's Medway Campus and the <b>Lower</b> <b>Lines</b> Park, Jane Jones, and Chairman of the Park's Charitable Trust, John Spence. The ceremony was also attended by local sea cadets who performed a guard of honour.|$|R

The first period (lesson) {{of the day}} is as usual, but followed by Mass, for which <b>Lower</b> <b>Line</b> must change into suits. This is followed by a lunch which {{takes the form of a}} Christmas dinner for <b>Lower</b> <b>Line.</b> In the afternoon, pupils and staff are allowed to change into casual clothing and Rhetoric host the Rhetoric Fair in the Ambulacrum for the whole school, with stalls and entertainment, the proceeds from which go to the school's charity, Learning to Care. In the evening a formal dinner is held for Higher Line.|$|R
