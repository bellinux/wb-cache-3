500|$|The Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la {{description}} du Cabinet du Roi is {{the work}} that the Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) is remembered for. He worked on it for some 50 years, initially at Montbard {{in his office in}} the Tour Saint-Louis, then in his library at Petit Fontenet. 36 volumes came out between 1749 and 1789, followed by 8 more after his death, thanks to Bernard Germain de Lacépède. It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the [...] "natural sciences", a broad term that includes disciplines which today would be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings. Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early comparative anatomist. [...] "L’intérieur, dans les êtres vivants, est <b>le</b> <b>fond</b> du dessin de la nature", he wrote in his Quadrupèdes, [...] "the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design." ...|$|E

The belief or tradition that Bonivard's prison is [...] "below the surface of the lake," [...] for which Shelley as well as Rousseau is responsible, but which Byron only records in verse, may be traced to a statement attributed to Bonivard himself, who says (Mémoires, etc., 1843, iv. 268) that the commandant thrust him [...] "en unes croctes desquelles <b>le</b> <b>fond</b> estoit plus bas que le lac sur lequel Chillon estoit citue." [...] As a matter of fact, [...] "the level [of les souterrains] is now three metres higher than the level of the water, and even if we take off the difference arising {{from the fact that the}} level of the lake was once much higher, and that the floor of the halls has been raised, still the halls must originally have been built about two metres above the surface of the lake."--Guide, etc., pp. 28, 29.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Jean Alphonse, Roberval's {{pilot in}} Canada in 1642, {{one of the}} most skilful navigators of his time, and who has given remarkably minute and {{accurate}} direction for sailing up the St. Lawrence, showing that he knows what he is talking about, says in his [...] "Routier" [...] (it is in Hackluyt), [...] "I have been at a bay as far as the forty-second degree, between Norimbegue [the Penobscot?] and Florida, but I have not explored the bottom of it, and I do not know whether it passes from one land to the other," [...] i.e. to Asia. (" [...] J'ai été à une Baye jusques par les 42 degres entre la Norimbegue et la Floride; mais je n'en ai pas cherché <b>le</b> <b>fond,</b> et ne sçais pas si elle passe d'une terre à I'autre.") This may refer to Massachusetts Bay, if not possibly to the western inclination of the coast a little farther south. When he says, [...] "I have no doubt that the Norimbegue enters into the river of Canada," [...] he is perhaps so interpreting some account which the Indians had given respecting the route from the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic by the St. John, or Penobscot, or possibly even the Hudson River.|$|E
6000|$|I {{feel as if}} it were {{scarcely}} discreet {{to indicate}} the whereabouts of the chateau of the obliging young man I had met on the way from Nimes; I must con- tent myself with saying that it nestled in an en- chanting valley, - dans <b>le</b> <b>fond,</b> as they say in France, - and that I took my course thither on foot, after leaving the Pont du Gard. I find it noted in my journal as [...] "an adorable little corner." [...] The principal feature of the place is a couple of very ancient towers, brownish-yellow in hue, and mantled in scarlet Vir- ginia-creeper. One of these towers, reputed to be of Saracenic origin, is isolated, and is only the more effective; the other is incorporated in the house, which is delightfully fragmentary and irregular. It had got to be late by this time, and the lonely castel looked crepuscular and mysterious. An old house- keeper was sent for, who showed me the rambling interior; and then the young man took me into a dim old drawing-room, which had no less than four chimney-pieces, all unlighted, and gave me a refec- tion of fruit and sweet wine. When I praised the wine and asked him what it was, he said simply, [...] "C'est du vin de ma mere!" [...] Throughout my little joumey I had never yet felt myself so far from Paris; and this was a sensation I enjoyed more than my host, who was an involuntary exile, consoling him- self with laying out a manege, which he showed me as I walked away. His civility was great, and I was greatly touched by it. On my way back to the little inn where I had left my vehicle, I passed the Pont du Gard, and took another look at it. Its great arches made windows for the evening sky, and the rocky ravine, with its dusky cedars and shining river, was lonelier than before. At the inn I swallowed, or tried to swallow,a glass of horrible wine with my coach- man; after which, with my reconstructed team, I drove back to Nimes in the moonlight. It only added a more solitary whiteness to the constant sheen of the Provencal landscape.|$|E
