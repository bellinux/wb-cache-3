500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Intense hedonic states trigger {{psychological}} pro-cesses {{that are}} designed to attenuate them, and thus intense states may abate more quickly than mild states. Because people are unaware of these psychological processes, they may mis-takenly expect intense states to last <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> mild ones. In Study 1, participants predicted that the more they initially disliked a transgressor, the longer their dislike would last. In Study 2, participants predicted that their dislike for a trans-gressor who hurt them a <b>lot</b> would last <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> their dislike for a transgressor who hurt them a little, but precisely the op-posite was the case.

500|$|Jon Hornbuckle of So So Gay {{described}} [...] "DNA" [...] as [...] "an addictive {{slice of}} dark pop, with the chorus breakdown remaining {{not only a}} highlight on this track, but of the entire album." [...] The song was well received by Vicky Newman from Shields Gazette, who felt that it demonstrates the group's [...] "stunning" [...] harmonies and allows their voices to [...] "shine". Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish". [...] "DNA" [...] was described as [...] "pop perfection" [...] by Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who highlighted the song's [...] "spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and gothic choir finale". John Earls from British newspaper, Daily Star, positively reviewed the single, calling it [...] "a winning formula," [...] in addition to awarding it a {{nine out of ten}} rating. Earls went on to mention that the song is [...] "A regal anthem that'll have all of Girls Aloud wondering how they didn't release it first, the Little Mixers are sounding huge at last.". [...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger". According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves the girls {{have what it takes to}} keep up with the best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations to be around for a <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> most of 's winners." [...] Nicky Diaz of The Miami Hurricane said that [...] "DNA" [...] shows the group's edgier side. Diaz went on to praise the track's harmonies and lyrics, writing, [...] "The stand-out harmonies on this song are incredible and the lyrics are catchy". Matt Collar of AllMusic called the track [...] "a truly catchy, infectious cut".|$|E

50|$|Another {{thing that}} {{also can be}} seen on KNMI charts is the fact that snow cover is bigger and last a <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> in Middelburg <b>than</b> the coast especially, but also to all other parts of the province. The explanation, at least since 2002, is that lake effect snow showers do reach the city, but the mild air {{frequently}} does not. In those situations, amateur stations directly on the coast note temperatures well above freezing and even rain while in Middelburg the mercury remains just or well below zero with snowfall. Just a couple of kilometers more inland the snowshowers break up and no snowfall is recorded. In this way, Middelburg seems to be in just the right (or wrong) position. An example is the period 27 November 2010 to 30 December 2010 in which Middelburg had 26 days with snow cover, Wilhelminadorp 18, and Vlissingen 17 days (KNMI data). The cumulative snow cover in Middelburg was between 161 cm and 223 cm (two KNMI stations) while coastal stations (Westkapelle) reached 84 cm over that period.|$|R

2500|$|The term [...] "Eurovision Week" [...] is used {{to refer}} to the week during which the Contest takes place. As it is a live show, the Eurovision Song Contest {{requires}} the performers to have perfected their acts in rehearsals for the programme to run smoothly. In addition to rehearsals in their home countries, every participant is given the opportunity to rehearse on the stage in the Eurovision auditorium. These rehearsals are held during the course of several days before the Saturday show, and consequently the delegations arrive in the host city many days before the event. Journalists and fans are also present during the preceding days, and so the events of Eurovision last a <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> a few hours of television. A number of officially accredited hotels are selected for the delegations to stay in, and shuttle-bus services are used to transport the performers and accompanying people to and from the contest venue.|$|E
2500|$|Wila (Bryoria fremontii), {{like almost}} all of the 23 other species of Bryoria found in North America, is a dark brown hair lichen that grow on trees (mostly conifers). [...] Differentiating the {{different}} species of Bryoria can be difficult. [...] The simplest characteristic that distinguishes wila from the other species of Bryoria is that its main branches grow to be quite thick (greater than 0.4mm wide), and usually become somewhat flattened, twisted, and wrinkled in older specimens. [...] Other species of Bryoria usually have narrower main branches. [...] Wila can also grow to be a <b>lot</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> other species of Bryoria, and is the only species in this genus in North America that regularly grows longer than 20cm (occasionally reaching 90cm in length). [...] Wila is often slightly darker in colour than most other species of Bryoria, although there is much variation in this characteristic. [...] Soredia and apothecia are uncommon, but when they are present they are very distinctive, as they are both bright yellow.|$|E
