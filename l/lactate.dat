5|$|<b>Lactate</b> uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because <b>lactate</b> is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of <b>lactate</b> occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and <b>lactate</b> is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of <b>lactate,</b> any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E

In experiment 1, blood samples were collected every 10 min from nonlactating (n = 5) and <b>lactating</b> (n = 5) ewes for 4 h before and during stress. In experiment 2, ewes (n = 6) were allocated to 1) nonlactating, 2) <b>lactating</b> with lambs absent, 3) <b>lactating</b> with lambs present but unable to suckle, and 4) <b>lactating</b> with lambs present and able to suckle. Blood samples were collected over 8 h with no stress (control day) and for 4 h before and 4 h during stress (stress day). In experiment 1, the mean (±SEM) cortisol concentrations increased significantly (P < 0. 05) in nonlactating ewes during stress but did not change in <b>lactating</b> ewes. In experiment 2, cortisol did not vary on the control day or pretreatment of the stress day but increased (P < 0. 05) during stress in all groups except <b>lactating</b> ewes with lambs present and able to suckle. The greatest cortisol response occurred in nonlactating ewes followed by <b>lactating</b> ewes with lambs absent and <b>lactating</b> ewes with lambs present but unable to suckle. During stress, the ACTH concentrations increased (P < 0. 05) in nonlactating ewes and <b>lactating</b> ewes with lambs absent but not in <b>lactating</b> ewes with lambs present.

The experimental cows were assigned into a Randomized Block Design with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. The first factor was using of somatotropin (bST) with three levels (non bST injection, biweekly injection and three weekly injection). The second factor was <b>lactating</b> time with two levels (4 th <b>lactating</b> time and 6 th <b>lactating</b> time) Parameters measured were heart rate, respiration frequency, rectal temperature, milk production efficiency, milk production, 4 % FCM (fat corrected milk.), Milk composition, weigh gain, milk quality consist of protein, fat, pH. Bovine somatotropin significantly increased heart rate and respiration rate. Also bovine somatotropin injection at 4 th <b>lactating</b> time significantly increased milk production. There were an interaction between bST dan <b>lactating</b> time on milk production and weight gain.

40|$|We {{investigated}} how free-ranging mares of {{two species}} of equids (donkeys and Shetland ponies) modify their foraging behaviour to meet the increased nutritional requirements induced by lactation. We initially hypothesised that <b>lactating</b> mares would graze for a longer time and/or graze faster than non-lactating (dry) mares. The grazing behaviour of free-ranging animals. foraging in two low-productive dune areas, was recorded during I year. Results show that in both species <b>lactating</b> animals did. not spend more time grazing than non-lactating mares. However, <b>lactating</b> animals took more bites, and therefore achieved a higher bite rate than dry mares. Several factors affected the differences between <b>lactating</b> and non-lactating animals, <b>Lactating</b> mares took more bites only in grassy and rough vegetations and they did this only in patches with a short sward height. In addition, <b>lactating</b> mares took more bites of grasses only and not of forbs or woody plants. We con- clude that the extra grazing effort of the <b>lactating</b> animals was not distributed randomly. <b>Lactating</b> mares invested their extra grazing effort principally towards those items that are the most grazed by the equids in general. We propose some hypotheses to explain why <b>lactating</b> mares increase their bite rate instead of augmenting the time spent grazing...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study neuroendocrine and {{behavioural}} stress responses in female rats post partum we aimed {{to establish a}} relevant emotional stressor - the maternal defence test based on maternal aggression of a <b>lactating</b> resident towards a virgin or <b>lactating</b> intruder approaching the cage. Exposure to maternal defence significantly elevated corticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone responses of the residents and of virgin or <b>lactating</b> intruders, with an attenuated response in <b>lactating</b> residents and <b>lactating</b> intruders. Exposure to maternal defence increased plasma oxytocin in virgin intruders only. The aggressive behaviour displayed by the residents was directly correlated {{with the amount of}} defensive behaviour of the intruder and independent of the intruder's reproductive state. However, the amount of maternal and explorative behaviours displayed by the <b>lactating</b> residents was significantly higher when exposed to a <b>lactating,</b> compared to a virgin, intruder. ACTH responses in <b>lactating</b> residents exposed to virgin intruders were significantly correlated to the amount of offensive (direct correlation) and maternal (inverse correlation) behaviours they displayed. Plasma prolactin concentrations, elevated in <b>lactating</b> compared to virgin rats under basal conditions, were found to be reduced in the <b>lactating</b> residents and intruders in response to exposure to the maternal defence test, whereas it was unchanged in virgin intruders. To test for the involvement of brain oxytocin in neuroendocrine and behavioural responses of the <b>lactating</b> residents an oxytocin receptor antagonist (0. 1 μg/ 5 μL) was infused icv 10 min prior to testing. This treatment increased basal, but not stress-induced, ACTH, corticosterone and oxytocin secretion. Whereas parameters of aggressive behaviour were unchanged, the antagonist reduced signs of maternal behaviour during maternal defence. In summary, the maternal defence test has been characterized as a relevant emotional stressor for female rats which is useful for studying neuroendocrine and emotional responses in females, in particular in the context of reproductive adaptations...|$|R
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., <b>lactate,</b> ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface.

5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces <b>lactate,</b> through the enzyme <b>lactate</b> dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

Four groups of rats received isocaloric diets containing 170 g protein/kg or 60 g protein/kg from pregnancy until the 14 th day of lactation: control non-lactating, control <b>lactating</b> (both fed a control diet), low-protein non-lactating and low-protein <b>lactating.</b> Energy intake, body composition, energy balance. serum insulin and leptin concentrations {{and the relationship between}} these hormones and several factors related to obesity were analysed. Low-protein-intake <b>lactating</b> rats exhibited hypoinsulinaemia, hyperleptinaemia, hypophagia and decreased energy expenditure compared with control <b>lactating</b> rats. the protein level in the carcasses was lower in the low-protein <b>lactating</b> group than in the control <b>lactating</b> group, resulting in a higher fat content in the first group compared with the latter. Body fat correlated inversely with serum insulin and positively with serum leptin level. There was a significant negative correlation between serum leptin and energy intake, and a positive relationship between energy intake and serum insulin level in <b>lactating</b> rats and in the combined data from both groups. Energy expenditure was correlated positively with serum insulin and negatively with serum leptin in <b>lactating</b> rats and when data from control non-lactating and <b>lactating</b> rats were pooled. <b>Lactating</b> rats submitted to protein restriction, compared with <b>lactating</b> control rats, showed that maternal reserves were preserved owing to less severe negative energy balance. This metabolic adaptation was obtained, at least in part, by the hypoinsulinaemia that resulted in increased insulin sensitivity favouring enhanced fat deposition, hyperleptinaemia and hypophagia.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Lactating</b> adenomas {{are rare}} benign breast tumors, most {{commonly}} found during pregnancy and lactation. They are usually slow growing and smaller than 3  cm in maximal diameter. Rare cases of giant <b>lactating</b> adenomas and rapid postpartum enlargement have been reported, but none {{have shown a}} giant <b>lactating</b> adenoma with rapid antepartum enlargement or antepartum surgical management. Case presentation: A 27 year-old pregnant woman presented at 28 weeks gestation with a 5  cm left breast mass that doubled to 10  cm within six weeks and was increasingly tender. Histopathologic examination of a core biopsy was consistent with a <b>lactating</b> adenoma. The mass was excised at 31 weeks gestation with no complications. Discussion: <b>Lactating</b> adenomas are common during pregnancy {{and need to be}} distinguished from breast cancer, a commonly diagnosed malignancy in pregnancy. They can be distinguished from carcinoma and other benign tumors like fibroadenoma under histopathologic examination. Rare cases of giant <b>lactating</b> adenomas with rapid postpartum enlargement that were managed by postpartum excision have been reported. However, a giant <b>lactating</b> adenoma with rapid antepartum enlargement, managed by excision in the third trimester of pregnancy, has not been reported.

The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of <b>lactate</b> after exercise; a failure of the <b>lactate</b> to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
