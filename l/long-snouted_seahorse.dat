50|$|Hippocampus guttulatus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse,</b> is a marine fish belonging to the Syngnathidae family, native from the northeast Atlantic, including the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the temperate {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean from the south coast of the United Kingdom to the Netherlands and south to Morocco, including the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
40|$|Mate {{competition}} and mate choice {{are not mutually}} exclusive behaviors. Both behaviors may drive sexual selection in one or both sexes of a population. One of several factors affecting which behavior is exhibited by which sex is the operational sex ratio (OSR) in the study population. The present study combines behavioral observations in the field with controlled experiments in aquaria to investigate social interactions and mate choice in both male and female <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorses</b> Hippocampus guttulatus {{in the context of the}} population OSR. Compared with the more readily studied pipefishes, data on OSR and mate choice in seahorses are scarce in the published literature. Our field data provide novel evidence of social promiscuity, size-assortative mating, and an OSR that varies from being unbiased early and midseason to male biased at the end of the breeding season. Our mate choice experiments revealed intersexual differences in mate preference with males significantly preferring larger females to familiar ones. Taken together, our field and experimental results suggest that mate choice rather than intrasexual competition could drive sexual selection in seahorses.

5000|$|Three species {{live in the}} Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse),</b> H. {{hippocampus}} (the short-snouted seahorse), and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males {{stay within}} [...] of habitat, while females range about one hundred times that.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> has a {{carnivorous}} {{diet and}} feeds on small crustaceans, larvae, fish eggs and other planktonic organisms.It is ovoviviparous {{and it is}} the male who broods the eggs in its ventral brood pouch. The latter includes villi rich in capillaries that surround each fertilized egg creating a sort of placenta supplying the embryos. When fully grown, pups will be expelled from the pocket and evolve in complete autonomy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> is a small-sized {{fish that}} can reach a maximum length of 21.5 cm {{but the average}} size {{is more or less}} 12 cm.The body is slender, the snout is long and the tail is prehensile.Its head and dorsal ridge have often some more or less long and {{numerous}} dermal filaments which can be simple or bifid.Its color ranges from dark green to different variants of brown to yellow, the body is often speckled with small white dots.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> is {{relatively}} rare and limited data exist on its population {{and about the}} volume {{and the impact of}} trade for the traditional chinese medicine and for the aquarium, thus the species is considered as [...] "Data Deficient" [...] on the IUCN Red List.Internationally, it is also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) this means that it is on the list of species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.|$|E
40|$|Understanding of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} and habitat use in {{different stages of}} a life cycle represents the essential aspect of threatened species management and conservation. In the present paper, the spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use in juvenile and adult life stages of the <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> Hippocampus guttulatus in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Apulia—Italy) (40 ° 28 ′N, 17 ° 16 ′W) were examined. From October 2012 to January 2014, monthly visual censuses were conducted in six coastal habitats of a focal area (Buffoluto site). Of a total of 317 individuals of the <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> that were sighted, 148 were juveniles, 82 adult females and 87 adult males. Our results showed {{significant differences in the}} habitat use between adult and juvenile life stages of H. guttulatus. Adult individuals were mainly concentrated within Cladophora prolifera beds and the wood poles of a mussel farm at 2 – 4  m of depth, while juvenile individuals were mainly present in shallower water (0. 4 – 1  m) on artificial hard substrates covered by a brown algae turf. Assessing and describing the habitat use within different life stages of H. guttulatus represent a useful tool to support species conservation by protecting the habitats it uses...|$|E

The species {{can be found in}} the Eastern Atlantic from the British Isles to Morocco, including the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores (2).

Hippocampus ramulosus Leach, 1814 is regarded as an invalid synonym of this species, although this name is still widely used for what is now H. guttulatus (2). The sampling station where Hippocampus guttulatus was found is situated between the sandbanks Buiten Ratel en Oost Dyck (UTM 5674450 - 460236. 7), on the French-Belgian border (Fig. 1). This station was investigated dur-ing a sampling campaign on August 20 th (2003) with the research vessel ‘Zeeleeuw’. The sample was taken with a rectangular neuston net (2 m x 1 m, 1 mm mesh) from which only the lower 50 cm is immersed, thereby sam-pling the upper 50 cm of the water column. Identifications of the specimens, which were preserved in a 10 % formal-dehyde-seawater solution, are based on characteristics described by LOURIE et al. (2). The neuston sample contained two well-preserved juveniles (approximately 3 to 4 weeks old) of the species Hippocampus guttulatus. Most of the examined charac-teristics (Table 1) are within the range for both Hippoc-ampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus (i. e. number of trunk rings, number of tail rings, number of pectoral fin rays, number of dorsal fin rays). However, the ratio of snout length to head length (> 1 / 3) certainly suggests that these specimens are H. guttulatus or the European <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse,</b> and the number of pectoral fins on one of the specimens is consistent with it being H. guttulatus. Both specimens lack a mane of thick skin fronds on neck and head, usually seen in adults (Fig. 2) ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus guttulatus) (Cuvier, 1829), {{was used}} to {{validate}} the pre-dictive accuracy of three progressively realistic models for estimating the realized annual fecundity of asyn-chronous, indeterminate, multiple spawners. Underwater surveys and catch data were used to estimate {{the duration of the}} reproductive season, female spawning frequency, male brooding frequency, and batch fecun-dity. The most realistic model, a generalization of the spawning fraction method, produced unbiased estimates of male brooding frequency (mean ±standard deviation [SD]= 4. 2 ± 1. 6 broods/year). Mean batch fecundity and realized annual fecundity were 213. 9 (± 110. 9) and 903. 6 (± 522. 4), respectively. However, females prepared significantly more clutches than the number of broods produced by males. Thus, methods that infer spawning frequency from patterns in female egg production may lead to significant overestimates of realized annual fecundity. The spawning fraction method is broadly applicable to many taxa that exhibit parental care and can be applied nondestructively to species for which conservation is a concern. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Knowledge on {{seahorses}} {{is generally}} scarce {{but has been}} increasing in recent years due to their conservation status. Seahorse culture is a quite recent activity {{in the field of}} marine aquaculture in most countries attempting it, and captive breeding techniques are available only for some species. With the aim of contributing to the development of breeding in captivity for conservative purposes, broodstocks of the European <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus guttulatus) were established with 32 wild seahorses captured in Galicia (NW Spain). This study describes the methodologies applied to the maintenance of the broodstocks, with special reference to aquaria design, feeding, growth and breeding. Procedures of seahorse identification (morphologically and genetically) as a tool for broodstock management are also considered. The results achieved during the first year demonstrate a rapid adaptation of wild seahorses to captive conditions. Seahorses were fed exclusively on enriched adult Artemia and displayed high growth rates. However, fatty acid analyses performed on unfertilised eggs of captive broodstock showed a progressive decrease with time in the content of essential fatty acids (DHA, EPA), suggesting the need for improvement in the nutritional quality of broodstock feed. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} morphological {{description of}} the feeding apparatus in Hippocampus reidi, a <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse,</b> and Dunckerocampus dactyliophorus, an extremely long-snouted pipefish, revealed specialized features that might {{be associated with the}} fast and powerful suction feeding, like the two ligamentous connections between the lower jaw and the hyoid, the saddle joint of the latter with the suspensorium and the vertebro-pectoral fusion that articulates on three points with the cranium. Despite the conserved morphology of the feeding apparatus, it was found that in H. reidi the orientation of the occipital joint is ventrocaudal, the sternohyoideus and epaxial muscles are more bulky and both have a short tendon. In D. dactyliophorus, on the other hand, the protractor hyoidei muscle is enclosed by the mandibulo-hyoid ligament, the sternohyoideus and epaxial tendons are long and a sesamoid bone is present in the latter. These features were compared to other syngnathid species with different snout lengths to evaluate the implications of snout elongation on the musculoskeletal structure of the cranium. The arched path of the adductor mandibulae and the greater rigidity of the lower jaw might be related to elongation of the snout, as it yields an increased mechanical advantage of the lower jaw system and a reduced torque between the elements of the lower jaw during protractor hyoidei muscle contraction, respectively. Nevertheless, most observed features {{did not seem to be}} related to snout length, but might be associated with different force-generating strategies.

40|$|Population abundance, {{distribution}} and habitat preference of the Mediterranean sympatric seahorses Hippocampus guttulatus and Hippocampus hippocampus were investigated in a semi-enclosed sea system (Apulian coast, Ionian Sea). A total of 242 individuals of seahorses were sighted in the 11 transects surveyed in summer 2011. Hippocampus guttulatus (n = 225) were 14 times more abundant than H. hippocampus (17). The mean abundance of H. guttulatus {{for all the}} pooled sites was 0. 018 m- 2 (SE ± 0. 003) ranging from a maximum of 0. 035 (SE ± 0. 007) to a minimum of 0. 008 (SE ± 0. 002). The size structure of <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> shows a population ranging from 7 to 14 cm (SL) with a peak at 10 cm (TL). Juveniles (96. 0 ± 8. 0 mm) represent a significant fraction of the population, accounting more than 21 % of the sighted individuals. In Mar Piccolo, H. guttulatus is able to shelter both in monotonous habitats, including the algal beds, and diversified ones, such as the rich filter-feeder communities that colonize hard substrates. By contrast, H. hippocampus is mainly associated with habitats of low complexity. Today, the Mar Piccolo di Taranto {{is among the most}} heavily polluted water bodies in South Italy, with trace metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides and organic wastes affecting both biotic and abiotic matrices. However, despite the high level of degradation, the presence of a large mussel farm has avoided the impact of towed fishing gears, and eutrophication of water bodies has ensured a high trophic level that supports large crustacean populations, potential prey for seahorses...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{examined}} {{the implications of}} life history and ecology for population-level responses of the European <b>long-snouted</b> <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus guttulatus Cuvier 1829) to habitat alteration, exploitation and a recommended minimum size limit for seahorse management. The research employed a mark-recapture study, underwater visual censuses (UVCs) and catch data from an unrelated experimental sampling program in the Ria Formosa Lagoon (southern Portugal). These small-bodied fish are characterized by rapid growth rate, early age at maturity, high natural mortality, short generation time, short life span and multiple spawnings per year, traits that are usually associated with resilience to exploitation. However specialized parental care, complex social interactions, small adult home ranges and benthic habit confer risk to H. guttulatus. Population-level responses to experimental reductions in non-selective fishing effort differed in magnitude and direction between H. guttulatus and its smaller congener, Hippocampus hippocampus: the abundance of H. guttulatus increased significantly while its congener decreased in abundance. Hippocampus guttulatus preferred more complex, vegetated habitats, while H. hippocampus preferred more open, sparsely vegetated habitats. Thus it seems probable that H. guttulatus fared better in the more complex habitats that developed when seining stopped, whereas H. hippocampus fared better in the less complex habitat arising from repeated seining. I used an age-structured stochastic simulation to evaluate the biological implications of a recommended generic strategy (10 cm minimum size limit) for managing the exploitation and international trade of seahorses, using H. guttulatus as a model. The smallest size limit that was robust (using the magnitude of population decline and probability of quasi-extinction as criteria) {{to a range of}} fishing rates, maximum population growth rates (rmax) and models of density-dependenc...|$|E
