40|$|Variations in inter-line {{gaps and}} skewed or curled text-lines {{are some of}} the {{challenging}} issues in segmentation of handwritten text-lines. Moreover, overlapping and touching text-lines that frequently appear in unconstrained handwritten text documents significantly increase segmentation complexities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unconstrained handwritten text-line segmentation. A new painting technique is employed to smear the foreground portion of the document image. The painting technique enhances the separability between the foreground and background portions enabling easy detection of text-lines. A dilation operation is employed on the foreground portion of the painted image to obtain a single component for each text-line. Thinning of the background portion of the dilated image and subsequently some trimming operations are performed to obtain a number of separating lines, called candidate <b>line</b> <b>separators.</b> By using the starting and ending points of the candidate <b>line</b> <b>separators</b> and analyzing the distances among them, related candidate <b>line</b> <b>separators</b> are connected to obtain segmented text-lines. Furthermore, the problems of overlapping and touching components are addressed using some novel techniques. We tested the proposed scheme on text-pages of English, French, German, Greek, Persian, Oriya and Bangla and remarkable results were obtained. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Line {{separators}} {{are used}} to segregate text-lines from one another in document image analysis. Finding the separator points at every line terminal in a document image would enable text-line segmentation. In particular, identifying the separators in handwritten text could be a thrilling exercise. Obviously it would be challenging to perform this in the compressed version of a document image {{and that is the}} proposed objective in this research. Such an effort would prevent the computational burden of decompressing a document for text-line segmentation. Since document images are generally compressed using run length encoding (RLE) technique as per the CCITT standards, the first column in the RLE will be a white column. The value (depth) in the white column is very low when a particular line is a text line and the depth could be larger at the point of text line separation. A longer consecutive sequence of such larger depth should indicate the gap between the text lines, which provides the separator region. In case of over separation and under separation issues, corrective actions such as deletion and insertion are suggested respectively. An extensive experimentation is conducted on the compressed images of the benchmark datasets of ICDAR 13 and Alireza et al [17] to demonstrate the efficacy.

While theoretical models and simulations of magnetic reconnection often assume symmetry such that the magnetic null point when present is co-located with a flow stagnation point, the introduction of asymmetry typically leads to non-ideal flows across the null point. To understand this behavior, we present exact expressions for the motion of three-dimensional linear null points. The most general expression shows that linear null points move in the direction along which the magnetic field and its time derivative are antiparallel. Null point motion in resistive magnetohydrodynamics results from advection by the bulk plasma flow and resistive diffusion of the magnetic field, which allows non-ideal flows across topological boundaries. Null point motion is described intrinsically by parameters evaluated locally; however, global dynamics help set the local conditions at the null point. During a bifurcation of a degenerate null point into a null-null pair or the reverse, the instantaneous velocity of separation or convergence of the null-null pair will typically be infinite along the null space of the Jacobian matrix of the magnetic field, but with finite components in the directions orthogonal to the null space.

Piping materials for geothermal systems have been of numerous types with great variation in cost and durability. The temperature and chemical quality of the geothermal fluids, in addition to cost, usually determine the type of piping network material used. In this paper, four suitable types of piping materials according to chemical quality and temperature of the fluid were taken into consideration for Meshkinshahr 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. Pipelines consist of two lines that transport the mixture of brine and steam from wellhead to <b>separators,</b> two steam <b>lines</b> from <b>separator</b> to power house and two brine <b>lines</b> from <b>separator</b> to reinjection wellheads. The design parameters; number of expansion loops and legs, pressure drop, wall thickness, weight span. pipe weight and length of the pipe are variable with different pipe materials. Each parameter has a specific significance in each line. For example, in steam lines, pressure drop {{is more important than}} that in other lines and less pressure drop in steam lines lead to increase the inlet pressure of turbine and more output power. Also, these parameters directly affect the cost of piping, fewer expansion loops and legs lead to use less pipe length and less pressure drop, larger weight spans result in less pipe supporting costs, and different thicknesses make different pipe unit weight and different transportation costs. In this paper we tried to select pipe material for a 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. ej 201...|$|R
