5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple {{snapshot}} of the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asteroids {{at any one time}} because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps.

5|$|The <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station entrances are all {{south of}} 96th Street. In 2009, {{there was a}} debate over the {{placement}} of the location of the street entrances.

5|$|The tablets {{constitute}} one of {{the oldest}} archives and libraries ever found; there is tangible evidence of their arrangement and even classification. The larger tablets had originally been stored on shelves, but had fallen onto the floor when the palace was destroyed. The <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fallen tablets allowed the excavators to reconstruct their original positions on the shelves; they found the tablets had originally been shelved according to subject.|$|E

5|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made recently to identify the exact <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{excavation}} {{was undertaken}} by George Marçais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted {{a more thorough}} excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few results have been published from these earlier excavations, and no records were made of the stratigraphic <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stucco fragments that were found.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial.

As the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments.|$|E
5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before.
