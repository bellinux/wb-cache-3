40|$|AbstractFour 16. 7 km-long tunnels with diameters {{ranging from}} 12. 4 to 14. 6 m {{are now under}} {{construction}} at Jinping II hydropower station along the Yalong River. The tunnels pass through Triassic rocks below Jinping Mountain. The tunnels are characterized with high overburden, long alignment and complex geological conditions. Brittle failure in marble and squeezing in schist are the primary problems in tunnelling. This paper introduces the studies of laboratory tests on Jinping II marble as well as numerical prediction of excavation damaged zone (EDZ) of tunnel section in brittle marble and determination of reinforced concrete <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> for restraining time-dependent deformation in the schist tunnel section. Laboratory tests indicate that Jinping II marble presents a complex brittle-ductile-plastic transition behavior of post-peak response with increasing confining pressure. Such behavior can be described numerically with the Hoek-Brown model. The EDZ was calibrated and predicted using both fast Lagrangian analysis of continua (FLAC) and particle flow code (PFC). The predicted result of EDZ in sections with different qualities of rock mass under various overburden pressures is quite helpful in understanding EDZ characterization and support design. A power-law creep model was used to support the lining design, especially in determining the <b>lining</b> <b>thickness.</b> Field convergence measurement data over 19 months were used to calibrate the creep model properties, followed by a sensibility analysis of reinforced concrete <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> that was launched to present the maximum lining compressive stress...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} brake <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> due to wear on drum brake squeal. Brake lining will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of brake lining, i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different <b>lining</b> <b>thickness.</b> In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

It is used to support radial loads under high speed operating conditions. During this transient period, direct contact between the journal and bearing induces high friction and bushes become progressively worn-out, thus inducting certain disabilities. The bushes are provided with a <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> of Cu-Pb-Sn material which is found in the range of 450 to 600 micron. The aim of present experimental work is to determine effect of variable load, speed and acceleration on depth of wear of <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> (dw) of Cu-Pb-Sn material bush, which is widely used as bush material in automobile engine.

40|$|Spray-applied {{membranes}} for waterproofing of {{sprayed concrete}} tunnels {{have led to}} the possibility of shear transfer between primary and secondary linings through the membrane interface, with potential for reducing overall <b>lining</b> <b>thickness.</b> Laboratory tests have shown a reasonable degree of composite action in beam specimens. In this paper, a numerical model previously calibrated against such tests is applied to a whole tunnel, considering soil-structure interaction and staged lining construction. The model shows composite action and load sharing between the lining layers is expected in the tunnel as in the beams. Parametric studies over the practical range of interface stiffnesses show that composite action is maintained, although at high interface stiffness too much bending may be attracted to the secondary lining, requiring additional reinforcement. An efficient composite shell design with minimal additional reinforcement is achievable if the secondary <b>lining</b> <b>thickness</b> is reduced from current practice. Robustness of the system measured in terms of the interface’s ability to transfer stress under unequal loading, causing distortion on the tunnel, is found to be generally adequate. However, adjacent construction in close proximity may give insufficient margin on membrane tensile debonding, especially if membrane conditions are partially or fully saturated. ...|$|R
