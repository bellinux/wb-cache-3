The band <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> studio output was not as easy to re-create live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances.|$|E
5|$|From their {{beginnings}} to {{the present}} day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those {{coming up in the}} profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> craft in B movies. They are where actors such as John Wayne and Jack Nicholson first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.|$|E
5|$|In 1717, François-Marie Picoté de Belestre {{established}} {{the post of}} Ouiatenon (modern Lafayette, Indiana) to discourage the Wea from coming under British influence. In 1732, François-Marie Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, established a similar post near the Piankeshaw in the town that still bears his name. Although the forts were garrisoned by men from New France, Fort Vincennes was the only outpost to maintain a permanent European presence until the modern day. Jesuit priests accompanied many of the French soldiers into Indiana {{in an attempt to}} convert the natives to Christianity. The Jesuits conducted missionary activities, lived among the natives and <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> languages, and accompanied them on hunts and migrations. Gabriel Marest, one of the first missionaries in Indiana, taught among the Kaskaskia as early as 1712. The missionaries came to have great influence among the natives and {{played an important role in}} keeping the native tribes allied with the French.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} optimal pricing {{to consumers}} who are privately informed about both their valuations {{for the product}} and when they <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> valuations. Initially, consumers have private information about the distribution of their valuations and when they will <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> valuations, and over time, consumers privately <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> valuations. Because of its importance in many revenue management problems, we focus mainly on the case in which consumers with higher expected valuations, e. g., business travelers, <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> true valuations later than consumers with lower expected valuations, e. g., leisure travelers. Using a mechanism design approach, we show that the optimal selling mechanism is a menu of expiring refund contracts. Consumers purchase the good in advance but {{have the option to}} return it for a refund immediately after <b>learning</b> <b>their</b> valuations. We identify conditions under which the firm can implement the first-best or complete information allocation, thereby extracting the entire (expected) consumer surplus. We also characterize the optimal menu of refund contracts when the first best cannot be achieved. ...|$|R

Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and soon <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historian}} Adrian Tinniswood, {{the most}} notorious corsairs were English and European renegades who had <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> trade as privateers, and {{who moved to the}} Barbary Coast during peacetime to pursue their trade. These outcasts brought up-to-date naval expertise to the piracy business, and enabled the corsairs to make long-distance slave-catching raids as far away as Iceland and Newfoundland. The English corsair Henry Mainwaring later returned to England after gaining a royal pardon. He was knighted, elected to Parliament, and appointed a vice admiral of the Royal Navy.|$|E

25|$|The First Presbyterian Church {{building}} of 1905 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{is said to}} be unique in that it uses Tiffany windows that partially make use of painted glass. Use of the colored glass itself to create stained glass pictures was motivated by the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement and its leader William Morris in England. Fellow artists and glassmakers Oliver Kimberly and Frank Duffner, founders of the Duffner and Kimberly Company and John La Farge were Tiffany's chief competitors in this new American style of stained glass. Tiffany, Duffner and Kimberly, along with La Farge, had <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> craft at the same glasshouses in Brooklyn in the late 1870s.|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} that the prevalence of three founder mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes is over 2 % in Ashkenazi Jews has resulted in numerous epidemiological research studies of this ethno-religious group. To {{determine the effects of}} incorporating research into clinical practice, a psychological impact study of women participating in an epidemiological study was conducted. Sixty women of Ashkenazi Jewish background who underwent genetic testing for founder mutations were assessed using mailed, self-administered questionnaires with validated measures of psychological outcome. Forty-three women elected to <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> results and 17 women declined to do so. Women who elected to <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> results were also assessed 7 - 10 days, 4 months, and 12 months after results disclosure. Women who chose to <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> results had significantly higher baseline breast cancer anxiety, compared to those who elected not to <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> results (z=- 2. 27; p = 0. 023). Unaffected women who elected to <b>learn</b> <b>their</b> results showed a significant decrease in breast cancer anxiety 4 months (z=- 2. 37, p = 0. 018) and 12 months (z=- 3. 06, p = 0. 002) post-notification compared to baseline. Genetic testing for mutations common in Ashkenazi Jewish women with result disclosure does not lead to adverse psychological outcomes...|$|R

25|$|The banjo {{player and}} fiddler Bascom Lamar Lunsford, {{a native of}} the North Carolina mountains, {{collected}} much traditional music during his lifetime, also founding the old-time music festival in Asheville, North Carolina. Notable North Carolina traditional banjo players and makers include Frank Proffitt, Frank Proffitt, Jr. and Stanley Hicks, who all learned to make and play fretless mountain banjos from a family tradition. These players, among others, <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> art primarily from family and show fewer traces of influence from commercial hillbilly recordings. The Proffitts and Hicks were heirs to a centuries-old folk tradition, and through the middle to late 20th century and they continued to perform in a style older than the stringbands often associated with old time music. Their style has been recently emulated by contemporary musician Tim Eriksen.|$|E
25|$|Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole {{language}} and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by {{majority of the}} Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after {{the arrival of the}} Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of Chabacano were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where it all began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish – a pidgin language that later developed into a mixed, or creole language. The fact that the first Chabacanos <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.|$|E
25|$|The news of {{the battle}} reached France much faster than Jones did, and the Americans were welcomed as heroes. As for the British, they had <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> lesson well—the Royal Navy could not defend British shipping, nor British coasts, nor even its own {{fighting}} vessels against American raiders. Militia regiments were hastily redeployed to coastal areas; seaports equipped themselves with artillery to defend themselves against further raids; and the gentry banded together in volunteer battalions as a last line of defence. Thenceforward, the press paid very close attention to every move John Paul Jones made; struggling to reconcile the malicious rumours of his murders and piracy with the evidence of his chivalrous and far from bloodthirsty behaviour on the Ranger mission (back in France, he wrote kind and thoughtful letters to the Earl of Selkirk, and {{to the family of}} Lieut. Dobbs, who had died within a couple of days).|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} period what has {{affected}} the indigenous languages most has been the pressure of social marginalization put on the indigenous populations by a growing mestizo class and a growing institutionalization of Hispanic society. Indigenous languages have been seen by the governing classes as a hindrance to building homogeneous nation states and as an impediment to social progress. These viewpoints sparked {{a renewed interest in}} the hispanization of indigenous communities and while the introduction of compulsory education in Spanish has undoubtedly resulted in a more homogeneous society it has also done much for the decline of indigenous languages throughout the 20th century. In a number of indigenous communities it has become practice to learn Spanish first and the indigenous language second. Parents have refrained from teaching their children their own language in order not to subject them to the social stigma of speaking an Indian language – and youths have <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> languages only when they came of age and started taking part in the adult society.|$|E
25|$|In early February 1972, guitarist O'List {{quit the}} group {{abruptly}} after an altercation with Paul Thompson, {{which took place}} at their audition for David Enthoven of EG Management. When O'List didn't {{show up for the}} next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band's sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst {{to the rest of the}} group, Manzanera had <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O'List's permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as David Gilmour, who was a friend of his older brother, and Soft Machine's Robert Wyatt.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but the time has come now for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat <b>learned</b> <b>their</b> whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E
