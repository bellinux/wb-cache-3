5|$|A Dongan Charter Parade {{was held}} in 1936 for the 250th anniversary celebrations, {{and as part of}} the ceremonies the United States Congress {{authorized}} the minting of an Albany Charter half dollar coin. Tricentennial celebrations held in 1986 included a re-enactment of the signing and awarding of the charter by Governor Mario Cuomo playing Governor Dongan, and Mayor Thomas Whalen playing Mayor Schuyler. Other events during the tricentennial were fireworks, music, the unveiling of a tricentennial clock, a hot-air balloon <b>lift-off</b> from Lincoln Park, and a cake large enough to feed thousands. Mayors from other Albanys around the world were among the visiting dignitaries who were invited to the ceremonies and given a tour of the city by Mayor Whalen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for <b>lift-off.</b> Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that {{there will not be}} enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E

25|$|Jules Verne was {{launched}} into low Earth orbit atop the maiden {{flight of the}} Ariane 5ES carrier rocket. <b>Lift-off</b> from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, occurred at 04:03:04 UTC on 9 March 2008. The spacecraft separated from its carrier rocket one hour, six minutes and 41 seconds after <b>lift-off,</b> and navigation systems were subsequently activated. Two days later, on 11 March, the four main engines of the ATV were fired for the first time, marking the beginning of several orbital insertion boosts. The Overberg Test Range {{played a part in}} relaying ATV telemetry data from a mobile station deployed in New Zealand during the launch phase.|$|E
25|$|On January 28, 1986, CNN was {{the only}} TV network to provide live {{coverage}} of the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger to the public. However, NASA TV provided the live coverage to schools nationwide. The Space Shuttle Challenger abruptly disintegrated just 73 seconds after <b>lift-off.</b> Seven astronauts, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, were killed in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|GSLV Mk III-D1 {{carrying}} {{communication satellite}} GSAT-19 lifted {{off from the}} second launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on 5 June 2017 and placed the advanced communication satellite into the geosynchronous transfer orbit 16 minutes after takeoff. GSAT-19 satellite with a <b>lift-off</b> mass of 3136kg, is the communication satellite of India, configured around the ISRO’s standard I-3K bus.|$|E
25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control. A key difference is that perforating penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15–45cm) of formation around the wellbore, whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow {{through all of the}} filtrate-invaded zone around the wellbore and <b>lift-off</b> of the mud filter cake.|$|E
25|$|Video {{taken during}} <b>lift-off</b> of STS-107 was {{routinely}} reviewed {{two hours later}} and revealed nothing unusual. The following day, higher-resolution film that had been processed overnight revealed the foam debris striking the left wing, potentially damaging the thermal protection on the Space Shuttle. At the time, the exact location where the foam struck the wing could not be determined due to the low resolution of the tracking camera footage.|$|E
25|$|The Retro module {{contained}} four solid-fuel TE-M-385 Star-13E retrorockets, each spherical {{in shape}} except for its rocket nozzle, which were structurally attached to two beams that {{reached across the}} diameter of the retro module, crossing at right angles in the center. Re-entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time. Abort procedures at certain periods during <b>lift-off</b> would cause them to fire at the same time, thrusting the Descent module away from the Titan rocket.|$|E
25|$|His first shift as {{a flight}} {{controller}} {{was during the}} launch of the unmanned Apollo 6. The launch {{turned out to be a}} memorable one, as two engines cut out on the second stage of the Saturn V booster less than five minutes after <b>lift-off.</b> Although the mission was not aborted, it was a challenging launch for the Flight Dynamics officer—the spacecraft diverged from its intended trajectory so severely that Greene was nearly forced to call an abort.|$|E
25|$|The Atlas {{first stage}} was a booster skirt with two engines burning liquid fuel. This {{together}} with the larger sustainer second stage gave it sufficient power to launch a Mercury spacecraft into orbit. Both stages fired from <b>lift-off</b> with the thrust from the second stage sustainer engine passing through {{an opening in the}} first stage. After separation from the first stage, the sustainer stage continued alone. The sustainer also steered the rocket by thrusters guided by gyroscopes. Smaller vernier rockets were added on its sides for precise control of maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|On an orbital mission, the Atlas' rocket engines were ignited {{four seconds}} before <b>lift-off.</b> The launch vehicle {{was held to}} the ground by clamps and then {{released}} when sufficient thrust was built up at <b>lift-off</b> (A). After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum dynamic pressure against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations. After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center sustainer engine running (B). At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket (C). The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, {{at an altitude of}} , the sustainer engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit (D). This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth. Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle. Just before orbital insertion and sustainer engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight). In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180°, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5° downward and kept this attitude {{for the rest of the}} orbital phase of the mission, as it was necessary for communication with the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Aviation Safety Board {{was unable}} to {{determine}} the exact sequence of events which led to this accident. The Board believes, however, that the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, shortly after <b>lift-off,</b> the aircraft experienced an increase in drag and reduction in lift {{which resulted in a}} stall at low altitude from which recovery was not possible. The most probable cause of the stall was determined to be ice contamination on the leading edge and upper surface of the wing. Other possible factors such as a loss of thrust from the number four engine and inappropriate take-off reference speeds may have compounded the effects of the contamination.|$|E
25|$|GSLV-Mk III is {{a launch}} vehicle. It is capable to launch four tonne {{satellites}} into geosynchronous transfer orbit. GSLV-Mk III is a three-stage vehicle with a 110 tonne core liquid propellant stage (L-110) {{flanked by two}} 200 tonne solid propellant strap-on booster motors (S-200). The upper stage is cryogenic with a propellant loading of 25 tonne (C-25). The vehicle has a <b>lift-off</b> mass of about 640 tonnes and be 43.43 metres tall. According to ISRO, the payload fairing has a diameter of 5 metres and a payload volume of 100 cubic metres. It will allow India to become less dependent on foreign rockets for heavy lifting.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trenches}} at launch pad 39A that channels flames {{away from the}} shuttle during <b>lift-off</b> was significantly damaged. The subsequent mishap investigation found that the damage {{was the result of}} carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors which held the refractory bricks in place. These had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters. Repairs to the trench were completed before the STS-125 mission's then scheduled launch attempt on 8 October 2008. In fact STS-125 finally launched in May 2009, and in the meantime STS-126 (November 2008) and STS-119 (March 2009) had both been successfully launched from pad 39A.|$|E
25|$|STS-133 (ISS {{assembly}} flight ULF5) was the 133rd {{mission in}} NASA's Space Shuttle program; during the mission, Space Shuttle Discovery docked with the International Space Station. It was Discoverys 39th and final mission. The mission launched on 24 February 2011, {{and landed on}} 9 March 2011. The crew consisted of six American astronauts, {{all of whom had}} been on prior spaceflights, headed by Commander Steven Lindsey. The crew joined the long-duration six person crew of Expedition 26, who were already aboard the space station. About a month before <b>lift-off,</b> one of the original crew members, Tim Kopra, was injured in a bicycle accident. He was replaced by Stephen Bowen.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 Corvette Sting Ray {{not only}} had a new design, but also newfound {{handling}} prowess. The Sting Ray was also a somewhat lighter Corvette, so acceleration improved despite unchanged horsepower. For the 1963 model year, 21,513 units would be built, which was up 50 percent from the record-setting 1962 version. Production was divided almost evenly between the convertible and the new coupe – 10,919 and 10,594, respectively – {{and more than half}} the convertibles were ordered with the optional <b>lift-off</b> hardtop. Nevertheless, the coupe wouldn't sell as well again throughout the Sting Ray years. In fact, not until 1969 (by which time the coupe came with removable T-tops) did the closed Corvette sell better than the open one. Equipment installations for 1963 began reflecting the market's demand for more civility in sporting cars. The power brake option went into 15 percent of production, power steering into 12 percent. On the other hand, only 278 buyers specified the $421.80 air conditioning; leather upholstery – a mere $80.70 – was ordered on only 1,114 cars. The cast aluminum knock-off wheels, manufactured for Chevy by Kelsey-Hayes, cost $322.80 a set, but few buyers checked off that option. However, almost 18,000 Sting Rays left St. Louis with the four-speed manual gearbox – better than four out of every five.|$|E

500|$|In 2067, at the {{conclusion}} of an investigation into the loss of Zero-X, the Inquiry Board of the Space Exploration Center reaches a verdict of sabotage. In the meantime, a second Mars mission has been planned. Days before the launch of the new Zero-X, International Rescue agrees to a request to organise security in view of the possibility of another sabotage threat. Jeff Tracy dispatches Scott to Glenn Field in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil in Thunderbird 2 and Alan in Thunderbird 3 are assigned to escort Zero-X as it leaves the atmosphere. Posing as a reporter at the pre-launch press conference, Lady Penelope ensures that Travers and the other four crewmembers are delivered St. Christopher brooches. Ostensibly for luck, these are in fact homing devices (a plot device previously used in the episode [...] "The Duchess Assignment"). The next day, a search for Dr Grant's brooch checks negative. Scott unmasks the man waiting for <b>lift-off</b> on board Zero-X as the Hood in another of his disguises. The saboteur flees Glenn Field in a car, which Penelope and Parker pursue in FAB1. The Hood transfers to a speedboat, and then a helicopter piloted by an accomplice; Parker shoots the aircraft down with the Rolls-Royce's built-in machine gun and the Hood is seemingly killed. Meanwhile, the real Grant is returned to Zero-X and the spacecraft launches without further incident.|$|E
500|$|The Apollo 16 mission {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972. The launch was nominal; the crew experienced vibration {{similar to that}} of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket performed nominally; the spacecraft entered orbit around Earth just under 12 minutes after <b>lift-off.</b> After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn of the third-stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage's attitude control system, but eventually resolved or compensated for them as they prepared to depart towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at about [...] Six minutes after the burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for [...] before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB. Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the docking tunnel connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie [...] "barbecue" [...] mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even heat distribution about the spacecraft from the Sun. After further preparing the craft for the voyage, the crew began the first sleep period of the mission just under 15 hours after launch.|$|E
