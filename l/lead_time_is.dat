40|$|URL] audienceEfficient {{replenishment}} {{planning is}} a very important problem in Supply chain management. A poor inventory control policy leads to overstocking or stockout situations. In the former, the generated inventories are expensive and in the later there are shortages and penalties due to unsatisfied customer demands. Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a commonly accepted approach for replenishment planning in major companies (Axsäter, 2006). The MRP software tools are accepted readily, the majority of industrial decision makers are familiar with them through all the existing production control system software. MRP software has a well developed information system and has <b>been</b> proven over <b>time.</b> However, MRP <b>is</b> based on the supposition that the demand and <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> known. This premise of deterministic environment seems somewhat off base since most production occurs stochastically. Component and semi-finished product <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> and finished product demands are rarely forecasted reliably. This is because there are some random factors such as machine breakdowns, transport delays, customer demand variations, etc. Therefore, in real life, the deterministic assumptions embedded in MRP are often too limited. Fortunately, the MRP approach can be adapted for replenishment planning under uncertainties by searching optimal values for its parameters. This problem is called MRP parameterization under uncertainties. The planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> parameters of MRP. For the case of random <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> the planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> calculated as the sum of the forecasted and safety <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> These safety <b>times</b> <b>are</b> obtained as a trade-off between overstocking and stockout while minimizing the total cost. The search for optimal values of safety <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> and, consequently, for planned <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> <b>is</b> a crucial and challenging issue in Supply chain management with MRP approach...|$|R

If, on the other hand, orders can cross in time, then optimal solutions are still "lumpy" in the sense that each order will satisfy a set, not necessarily consecutive, of the demands. An example shows how this characterization can be used to find a solution to a problem where interdependence of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>is</b> critical. This characterization of optimal solutions facilitates dynamic programming approaches to this problem. inventory/production: stochastic models, dynamic programming: applications...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, lot sizing {{decisions}} in inventory management trade-off {{the cost of}} placing orders against the cost of holding inventory. However, when these lot sizes are to be produced in a finite capacity production/inventory system, the lot size has an important impact on the <b>lead</b> <b>times,</b> which in turn determine inventory levels (and costs). In this paper we study the lot sizing decision in a production/inventory setting, where <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> determined by a queueing model that is linked endogenously to the orders placed by the inventory model. Assuming a continuous review (s,S) inventory policy, we develop a procedure to obtain the distribution of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> {{and the distribution of}} inventory levels, when <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> <b>are</b> endogenously determined by the inventory model.

We numerically show that ignoring the endogeneity of <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> may <b>lead</b> to inappropriate lot sizing decisions and significantly higher costs.
