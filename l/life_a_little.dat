500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to <b>life</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart convened with Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios {{to create new}} material. In the studio, Stewart was [...] "messing around with a walloping hi-hat sound", which he found in the free music software GarageBand, which is included in all Mac computers. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: [...] "Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?". When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi-hat, [...] "immediately the word popped into [...] head"; {{he went to the}} vocal booth and started singing. Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track. They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the hook while [...] " [...] would put the next chord". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a demo of the track. The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single [...] "Me Against the Music". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had [...] "her personal <b>life...</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of control" [...] at the time, needed a hit as musical comeback. Spears was working on her fifth album, Blackout, so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.|$|E

2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along.
