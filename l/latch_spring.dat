40|$|Trap-jaw ants are {{characterized}} by high-speed mandibles used for prey capture and defense. Power-amplified mandibles have independently evolved {{at least four times}} among ants, with each lineage using different structures as a <b>latch,</b> <b>spring</b> and trigger. We examined two species from the genus Myrmoteras (subfamily Formicinae), whose morphology is unique among trap-jaw ant lineages, and describe the performance characteristics, spring-loading mechanism and neuronal control of Myrmoteras strikes. Like other trap-jaw ants, Myrmoteras latch their jaws open while the large closer muscle loads potential energy in a spring. The latch differs from other lineages and is likely formed by the co-contraction of the mandible opener and closer muscles. The cuticle of the posterior margin of the head serves as a spring, and is deformed by approximately 6 % prior to a strike. The mandibles are likely unlatched by a subgroup of closer muscle fibers with particularly short sarcomeres. These fast fibers are controlled by two large motor neurons whose dendrites overlap with terminals of large sensory neurons originating from labral trigger hairs. Upon stimulation of the trigger hairs, the mandibles shut in as little as 0. 5 ms and at peak velocities that are comparable with other trap-jaw ants, but with much slower acceleration. The estimated power output of the mandible strike (21 kW kg(- 1)) confirms that Myrmoteras jaws are indeed power amplified. However, the power output of Myrmoteras mandibles is significantly lower than distantly related trap-jaw ants using different spring-loading mechanisms, indicating a relationship between power-amplification mechanism and performance...|$|E

50|$|Correlated magnet pairs can be {{programmed}} to attract or repel with a prescribed force and engagement distance, or, to attract or repel at certain a spatial orientation. Correlated magnets can {{be programmed}} to interact only with other magnetic structures that have been coded to respond.

Compared to conventional magnets, the correlated magnet provides much stronger holding force to the target and stronger shear resistance.

Micro-Fresnel lenses {{play a very}} important role in micro-optics because of their thin film structures and their ability to achieve very short fo-cal lengths. Although micro-Fresnel lenses have been studied and well understood [11, the lens planes usually are restrained {{on the surface of the}} substrate. Therefore, their abilities of integra-tion with other optoelectronic components in micro-optics are limited. In this paper, we present a vertical three-dimensional binary-phase micro-Fresnel lens which overcomes the disadvantage of conventional micro-fresnel lenses and is able to rotate out of the plane and stands perpendicular to the substrate. This lens and other similarly constructed micro-optical elements can shrink the whole free-space optical system to a single micro-chip.

5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead bolt is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the <b>spring</b> <b>latching</b> capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to improve the power efficiency of robotic locomotion through the use of series elastic actuation, with a focus on swimming motion. To achieve high efficiency, electromechanical drives need to be actuated at high speed and low torque. However, in many robots, the drives are actuated in a low speed and high torque mode, resulting in lower efficiency. Implementing gear trains is one option to rise the input speed and lower the input torque. However gear trains have their own loss which are particularly severe at high gear ratios, and are not back drivable in some cases. In this thesis, we envision and design a new pulse drive type of series elastic electromechanical actuators that seeks to break such tradeoffs and improve overall robotic propulsion drive efficiency. An energy storage element, such as a spring, is installed between the EM actuator and the load. In the fast actuation phase, a pulse displacement/ torque trajectory is applied to the actuator shaft so that the spring is rapidly charged with potential energy. In the slow driving phase, the actuator shaft is locked by a low power mechanical <b>latch</b> and the <b>spring</b> slowly transfers energy into the load. We analytically determine that the most efficient pulse condition is reached when the frequency of the pulse trajectory is close to the natural frequency of the actuator inertia-spring system. Our first low power hardware demonstration without the gearbox transmission shows that the pulse drive achieves an energy efficiency of 80 % compared to an efficiency of 50 % achieved in the conventional direct drive where an electromechanical actuator is driving a viscous load equal to its own motor constant. Another low power hardware demonstration using gear motors at two loads, whose impedances are 10 times and 20 times as high as the driver motor constant, shows that the pulse drive using a motor with a one-stage gearbox transmission achieves an efficiency of 50 %, which are approximately 20 % higher than the conventional drive with either a one-stage or a two-stage gearbox transmission. An analytical study on the influence of motor size shows that the efficiency gain of the pulse drive becomes larger at smaller motors and that the best option for the pulse drive is to use a motor with a one-stage gearbox. In a third hardware demonstration, we scale up the power level to match that of a small robotic fish, and use a real viscous load. By using the same brushless motor with a one-stage gearbox, we achieve a pulse drive efficiency of 70 % compared to 15 % in the conventional gear drive. Some potential targets are robots with cyclical propulsions and high impedance load, e. g., tail actuation in fish-like swimming robots, wing actuation in flying robots and crawling and other motions in snake-like robots. by Zhen Sun.
