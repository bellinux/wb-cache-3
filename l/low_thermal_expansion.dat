5|$|There {{are many}} types of glass, and it is most common to weld using the same types. Different glasses often have {{different}} rates of thermal expansion, which can cause them to crack upon cooling when they contract differently. For instance, quartz has very <b>low</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> while soda-lime glass has very high thermal expansion. When welding different glasses to each other, it is usually important to closely match their coefficients of thermal expansion, to ensure that cracking does not occur. Also, some glasses will simply not mix with others, so welding between certain types may not be possible.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1900 <b>low</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> {{materials}} were developed which, when used as pendulum rods, made elaborate temperature compensation unnecessary. These were only {{used in a}} few of the highest precision clocks before the pendulum became obsolete as a time standard. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume invented the nickel steel alloy Invar. This has a CTE of around 0.5 µin/(in·°F), resulting in pendulum temperature errors over 71°F of only 1.3 seconds per day, and this residual error could be compensated to zero with a few centimeters of aluminium under the pendulum bob (this {{can be seen in the}} Riefler clock image above). Invar pendulums were first used in 1898 in the Riefler regulator clock [...] which achieved accuracy of 15 milliseconds per day. Suspension springs of Elinvar were used to eliminate temperature variation of the spring's restoring force on the pendulum. Later fused quartz was used which had even lower CTE. These materials are the choice for modern high accuracy pendulums.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with <b>low</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury thermometers. Subsequently, English and Gehlhoff et al. published similar additive glass property calculation models.
