They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; {{and when they get}} there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E

5|$|Though {{she did not}} {{participate}} in any major engagement, her story became widely publicized and inspired a number of works of art and literature. She is a national heroine in Poland and Lithuania, all formerly parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate {{a higher level of}} intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur evolution {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E

5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E

25|$|Megalomys desmarestii, a {{very large}} oryzomyine that became extinct by about 1900. It was closely related to Megalomys luciae, which {{occurred}} further south on Saint Lucia. It was as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cat.|$|E
25|$|The mouse deer, a small tusked deer as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toy dog or cat, mostly can {{be found}} on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The gaur, a {{gigantic}} wild ox larger than even wild water buffalo, is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.|$|E
25|$|A second, {{quite common}} type {{looks like a}} Schuko socket, but adds a central {{earthing}} hole. This design can accept CEE7/4 (German), CEE7/7 (German/French), and Italian 10A plugs. Some of these sockets may also have figure-8 shaped holes to accept Italian 16A plugs as well. Its drawback {{is that it is}} twice as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normal Italian socket and the price is higher; for those reasons Schuko and bipasso-Schuko socket have been rarely installed in Italy until recent times.|$|E

25|$|In {{heavy-duty}} industrial high-current applications, a grid resistor {{is a large}} convection-cooled lattice of {{stamped metal}} alloy strips connected in rows between two electrodes. Such industrial grade resistors can be as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, {{with a range of}} resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms. They are used in applications such as dynamic braking and load banking for locomotives and trams, neutral grounding for industrial AC distribution, control loads for cranes and heavy equipment, load testing of generators and harmonic filtering for electric substations.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Togawa {{spoke with}} a local hunter {{who claimed to have}} killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He {{disposed}} of the body, and Haemi on {{the southern part of the}} island, where the body was disposed of, was searched. The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away. He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> house cat's, and greenish striped fur.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Proteus {{is close to}} a sphere with a radius of about 210km, {{although}} deviations from the spherical shape are large—up to 20km; scientists believe it is about as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated {{in the direction of}} Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters.|$|E

25|$|At that time, NA {{was not yet}} {{recognized}} by society at <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places {{that would allow them}} to meet, and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members protection because at that time an old law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.|$|E
25|$|In December 2002, a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B. This {{structure}} {{houses the}} Federal Inspection Station and has one jetway for deboarding aircraft. Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, {{which included the}} building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures will be handled from the existing terminal complex.|$|E
25|$|Gulls are monogamous {{and colonial}} breeders that display mate {{fidelity}} that usually lasts {{for the life}} of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony. Colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other birds. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as <b>large</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 5-m radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.|$|E
40|$|Background: Accurate {{taxonomy}} is best maintained if {{species are}} arranged as hierarchical groups in phylogenetic trees. This {{is especially important}} <b>as</b> trees grow <b>larger</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of a rapidly expanding sequence database. Hierarchical group names are typically manually assigned in trees, an approach that becomes unfeasible for very large topologies...|$|R
50|$|Madripoor is {{estimated}} to be 100 mi in diameter. Its coastline is pockmarked with deep water bays and inlets. The center of the island is a large plateau with steep cliffs.
