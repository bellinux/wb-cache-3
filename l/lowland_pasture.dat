30|$|Pastoralism in {{southeast}} Turkey has two forms: village-based sedentary pastoralism and pastoralism with vertical or horizontal movements. The latter takes many forms. It {{may take the}} form of local transhumance, normal (sheep are based in the villages of the plain and ascend the mountain pastures in summer) or reverse (sheep are based in mountain villages and come down during the winter onto <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures),</b> or it may comprise regional or interregional trips, sometimes with double migration (sheep are based in villages in the foothills, descend to the <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures</b> in winter, and climb to the mountain pastures in summer). Transhumance is carried out by seminomads or nomads on foot, truck, or a mix of both. Kurdish nomadism involves the mobility of a part of the family group depending on the season.

In addition, the effect of finishing on C after M on growth and meat quality was assessed (Experiment 2). Animals on C and M had on average similar live weight gain and carcass weight in the first experiment. However, the performance depended on year as gain and carcass weight was higher on C than on M in the first year and vice versa in the second year. In the second experiment the calves on M had lower gain and carcass weight than on C. Three week finishing on C after M compensated to some extent for the lower growth rate on M. Overall, the results indicate that mountain grazing may yield similar growth rates and slaughter weights as improved <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> depending on year. There were only small effects of pasture type on carcass and meat quality traits like conformation, fatness, intramuscular fat and protein content, and fatty acid (FA) composition. The variation in FA composition could to a large extent be explained by difference in fatness with increase in monounsaturated and decrease in polyunsaturated FA with increasing intramuscular fat content, in turn varying between pasture type, experiment and year. There was a tendency that M led to higher proportion of C 18 : 1 n- 9 and lower proportion of C 18 : 1 n- 7 than C, which may be due to difference in milk and forage intake.

40|$|The special {{quality of}} foods from alpine grazing systems {{concerning}} their fatty acid (FA) composition is well established. However, {{the contribution of}} different specific vegetationtypes and the animal’s genotype to this alpine effect is still unclear. In the present study,the FA profiles of muscle and adipose tissue lipids were determined in lambs that hadgrazed either an intensively managed <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> or one of three characteristic alpinevegetation types differing in plant species number and composition, forage quality andamount, and composition of phenolic compounds and FA. On each vegetation type and intwo subsequent years, two groups of lambs (seven Engadine sheep, ES; and seven ValaisianBlack Nose sheep, VS) grazed for 9 weeks and were subsequently slaughtered (total n = 110 lambs). Forage samples, meat (Longissimus dorsi muscle, LD) and perirenal adipose tissuewere analysed for their FA composition. Forages were additionally analysed for contentsof phenolic compounds. Although proportions of a-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3) and linoleicacid (C 18 : 2 n- 6) in plant biomass were clearly higher in the lowland compared to the alpinevegetation, the proportions of these FA were increased in the adipose tissue of alpine graz-ing sheep by 20 – 87 % and by 26 – 58 % in muscle compared to lowland grazing, dependingon the alpine vegetation type. The levels of these two FA in body tissues differed betweenlambs having grazed different alpine pastures and were clearly positively associated withthe contents of phenolic compounds in the vegetation but not with its lipid composition. Compared to the <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture,</b> conjugated linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11) in the tissues waslower when the lambs grazed alpine pastures, but did not differ between the alpine vegeta-tion types. Slight breed differences were found, with a trend for higher proportions of longchain polyunsaturated FA at cost of saturated and monounsaturated FA in the VS comparedto the ES. In conclusion, vegetation type {{is an important factor}} determining the FA com-position in lamb meat and differentiating the alpine effect in this respect. The data clearlysuggest that the plant secondary compounds in the swards prevented part of C 18 : 3 n- 3 andC 18 : 2 n- 6 from being hydrogenated in the rumen.

As an alternative to full scale conversion, some simple pasture management techniques, such as limiting access of cattle to the riverbed in <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures</b> (see dark red areas in the centre of Figure 7), could prove to be comparatively low cost and highly effective measures to reduce turbidity levels close to the water intake point of CEDAE.|$|R
50|$|The Whitefaced Woodland {{is one of}} {{the largest}} hill breeds, with ewes {{sometimes}} weighing more the 60 kg (132 lbs) when kept in <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures.</b> Unlike most Pennine breeds it has a white face and legs and short, fine wool. The staple length of the wool is between 10 cm (4.7 inches) to 15 cm (7.1 inches) with a spinning count of 50's to 54's. The average fleece weight is 2 kg (4.5 lb) to 3 kg (6.5 lb). Its main use has been as a meat breed. However, its wool is used in carpet. Both sexes are horned and the ram horns are heavily spiraled.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the bone development of two mountain sheep breeds during natural summer grazing either in the lowlands or on different characteristic alpine pastures. Pasture types differed in topographic slope, plant species composition, general nutritional feeding value, Ca and P content, and Ca:P ratio of herbage. Twenty-seven Engadine sheep (ES) lambs and 27 Valaisian Black Nose sheep (VS) lambs were divided into four groups of 6 to 7 animals per breed and allocated to three contrasting alpine pasture types and one <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> type. The lambs were slaughtered after 9 wk of experimental grazing. The steep alpine pastures in combination with a high (4. 8) to very high (13. 6) Ca:P ratio in the forage decreased total bone mineral content as measured {{in the middle of}} the left metatarsus of the lambs from both breeds, and cortical bone mineral content and cortical bone mineral density of ES lambs. Breed × pasture type interactions occurred in the development of total and cortical bone mineral content, and in cortical thickness, indicating that bone metabolism of different genotypes obviously profited differently from the varying conditions. An altitude effect occurred for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D with notably higher serum concentrations on the three alpine sites, and a breed effect led to higher concentrations for ES than VS. Despite a high variance, there were pasture-type effects on serum markers of bone formation and resorption...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide further}} {{insights}} into ruminant lipid digestion and metabolism, and into cis 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 synthesis, 12 growing Engadine lambs grazing either mountain pasture (2, 250 m above sea level; n = 6) or <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> (400 m above sea level; n = 6) were studied. Both pastures consisted exclusively of C- 3 plants. Before the experiment, all animals grazed a common pasture for 6 wk. Grasses and perirenal adipose tissues {{of the sheep}} were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography. Stable C-isotope ratios (delta C- 13 values in % vs. the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard) were determined in the composite samples by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The delta C- 13 of the individual fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The delta C- 13 value of the entire mountain pasture grass was - 27. 5 % (SD 0. 31), whereas that of the <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> grass was - 30. 0 % (SD 0. 07). This difference {{was reflected in the}} perirenal adipose tissues of the corresponding sheep (P < 0. 05), even though the delta C- 13 values were less in the animals than in the grass. The delta C- 13 values for cis- 9 16 : 1 and cis- 9 18 : 1 in perirenal fat differed between mountain and lowland lambs (P < 0. 05). The 16 : 0 in the adipose tissue was enriched in C- 13 by 5 % compared with the dietary 16 : 0, likely as a result of partly endogenous synthesis. The d 13 C values of cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 (cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA) in the adipose tissue were smaller than those of its dietary precursors, cis- 9, cis- 12 18 : 2 and cis- 9, cis- 12, cis- 15 18 : 3; conversely, the delta C- 13 values of trans- 11 18 : 1 were not, suggesting that large proportions of perirenal cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 were of endogenous origin and discrimination against C- 13 occurred during Delta(9) -desaturation. The same discrimination was indicated by the isotopic shift between 16 : 0 and cis- 9 16 : 1 in the mountain grazing group. Furthermore, the delta C- 13 values of cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 were smaller relative to the precursor fatty acids in the mountain lambs compared with the lowland group. This result suggests a reduced extent of biohydrogenation in lambs grazing on mountain grass in comparison with those grazing on lowland grass. This was supported by the smaller cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 concentrations in total fatty acids found in the adipose tissues of the lowland lambs (P < 0. 001). The results of this study demonstrate that natural differences between delta C- 13 values of swards from different pastures and the adipose tissue fatty acids could be used as tracers in studies of lipid metabolism in ruminants...|$|E
40|$|The {{northwest}} of Scotland is a stronghold {{for two of}} the UK’s rarest bumblebee species, Bombus distinguendus and Bombus muscorum. The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial {{to a wide range of}} flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of <b>lowland</b> <b>pasture</b> had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific ‘bird and bee’ conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas...|$|E
40|$|Cobalt {{and copper}} {{concentrations}} were measured in 599 lamb livers collected at slaughter from 58 sheep flocks in 6 {{different parts of}} Norway in 1993. Information about pasture, additional feeding and mineral supplements in the flocks was obtained through a questionnaire. Average hepatic levels of cobalt in the lamb flocks varied from < 0. 003 to 0. 22 μg/g ww, and of copper from 5 to 240 μg/g ww. Flocks with deficient or marginal cobalt status were found {{in all parts of}} southern Norway, but primarily in the west and south-west. Some flocks with marginal copper status were found in the south-west, while flocks with signs of excessive hepatic copper concentrations were found mainly in inner parts of central and northern Norway. Hepatic copper concentrations were significantly higher in lambs that had grazed mountain pastures than in those that had grazed <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures</b> in the summer. </p...|$|R

His first verse collections Nji fyell ndër male (A flute in mountains) and Kanga e Vërrinit (Song of the <b>lowland</b> <b>pastures)</b> were published in Pristina in 1953 and 1954 respectively. His first major prose work was Djella, published in Rome in 1958. His next novel Rrathë (Circles) was published in Munich in 1978. Rrathë, which is Camaj's largest work, took him fifteen years to complete and {{is regarded as the}} first psychological novel written in Albanian. The novel is divided in the three cycles of water, fire and blood, which symbolize recurrent metaphysical and social themes. In 1981 a collection titled Shkundullima (Quaking) that included five short stories and one play of Camaj was published. His last novel Karpa, which was published in 1987 in Rome, is a dystopian work set in 2238.|$|R
