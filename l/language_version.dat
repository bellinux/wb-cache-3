5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier {{was busy}} rehearsing for Orpheus, an English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four {{performances}} at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose {{not to have the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story has}} been {{described}} in the book Non dirmi che hai paura ("Never say you are afraid") by Italian writer and journalist Giuseppe Catozzella. The rights for the English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of the novel was acquired by Penguin Books, and there was interest in turning the work into a film. In 2015, German graphic novelist Reinhard Kleist published his graphic novel Der Traum von Olympia – Die Geschichte von Samia Yusuf Omar ("An Olympic Dream – The Story of Samia Yusuf Omar") at Carlsen Verlag. It was named the Luchs book {{of the year for}} 2015. The graphic novel was translated into English and published by SelfMadeHero in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Empathic Civilization was {{published}} in January 2010 by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., an imprint of Penguin Group (USA), in North America and by Cambridge Polity Press in the United Kingdom. Cambridge Polity Press also published the book in Australia and New Zealand beginning in March 2010. A German translation {{was published}} by Campus Verlag and Spanish <b>language</b> <b>version</b> was released by Mexican publisher Paidós Méxicana. Excerpts {{were published in the}} Huffington Post and Arianna Huffington named it one of the best books of the year.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Tintin {{were also}} {{released}} as radio dramas on LP and compact cassette recordings in French <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> in Belgium, France and Canada, German <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> in West Germany, Swedish <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> in Sweden, Danish <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> in Denmark and Norwegian <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> in Norway.|$|R

50|$|Polnareff {{also made}} <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> {{of the song}} in German ("Meine Puppe sagt non"), Italian ("Una bambolina che fa no, no, no"), and Spanish ("Muñeca que hace no") which helped the song get airplay all over Europe and become hits in <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> by local artists in 1966.|$|R
5|$|The English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of StarCraft II has Robert Clotworthy and James Harper reprising {{their roles}} from StarCraft as {{the voices of}} Jim Raynor and Arcturus Mengsk. Notable {{absences}} included Tricia Helfer replacing Glynnis Talken as Kerrigan, Michael Dorn replacing Michael Gough as Tassadar, and Fred Tatasciore filling in for the late Jack Ritschel as Zeratul. The voice director for the game was Andrea Romano. Over 58 voice actors were hired for the game, some of whom voiced multiple characters.|$|E
5|$|Byte {{magazine}} {{published an}} assembly <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of Spacewar in 1977 that {{ran on the}} Altair 8800 and other Intel 8080-based microcomputers using an oscilloscope as the graphical display and a lookup table for orbits, {{as well as a}} three-dimensional variant in 1979 written in Tiny BASIC. More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist are kept in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, where demonstrations of the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw a {{proliferation}} of recordings, many of live performances. Plácido Domingo first recorded Cavaradossi in 1973, and continued to do so at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976 he was joined by his son, Plácido Domingo Jr., who sang the shepherd boy's song in a British recording with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of Tosca in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{people who}} operate in {{different}} languages necessitates {{the use of multiple}} <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> of an assessment. However, different <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> of an assessment are not necessarily equivalent. In this paper, the psychometric properties of different <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> on an international employee attitude survey are evaluated. This survey was administered to more than 50, 000 employees of a large telecommunications company using both paper-and-pencil and Web administration formats. The structural equivalence of the survey was evaluated across <b>language</b> <b>versions,</b> cultural groups, and administration formats using multidimensional scaling. The statistical equivalence of English, French, and Spanish versions of the survey items was evaluated using analysis of covariance. The results indicate the structure of the survey is consistent across the groups studied, and that the different <b>language</b> <b>versions</b> of the items functioned similarly. The implications of the results for future research in this area are discussed. (Contains 3 figures, 4 tables, and 38 references.)

5|$|There was an {{apparent}} misconception among video game fans that the SNES title Secret of Evermore {{was released in}} lieu of an English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, no one {{who worked on the}} Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made available on the internet as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection on June 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The English <b>language</b> <b>version</b> of the Dragon Ball manga is {{licensed}} for North America by Viz Media. Viz {{originally published}} the first 194 chapters as Dragon Ball and chapters over 195 as Dragon Ball Z {{to mimic the}} names of the anime series, feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers. They initially released both series simultaneously, chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998, before stopping in 2000 to switch to a graphic novel format similar to the Japanese tankōbon. In 2000, while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format, Viz began to censor the manga in response to parental complaints about sexual innuendos. Viz changed their publishing format for the series again in 2003; the first ten collected volumes of both series were re-released under their Shonen Jump imprint. They have slightly smaller dimensions. The manga was completed in English with Dragon Ball in 16 volumes between May 6, 2003, and August 3, 2004, and Dragon Ball Z in 26 volumes from May 6, 2003, to June 6, 2006. However, when publishing the last few volumes of Z, the company began to censor the series again by changing or removing gun scenes and changing the few sexual references. Dragon Ball Z, from Trunk's appearance to chapter 226, was published in Viz's monthly magazine Shonen Jump from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005.|$|E
