40|$|In {{almost all}} modern {{buildings}} today, HVAC equipment {{is used to}} provide a conditioned indoor environment while using large amounts of energy <b>to</b> <b>cool,</b> <b>filter,</b> and dehumidify the air in these structures. This {{is especially true for}} buildings located in hot and humid climates around the world. International engineering organizations, such as ASHRAE, have developed indoor air quality standards which stipulate substantial requirements for fresh outside air to be introduced into a building?s air conditioning system. Internal loads and additional outside ventilation air all generate considerable latent loads on these systems and exacerbate the already difficult moisture control problem. A manifestation of this load is the liquid water condensate that is typically drained away from the air conditioning equipment and routed to the nearest sanitary drain. This project investigated sustainability issues associated with the collection and storage of this condensate water from selected air conditioning equipment for an institutional building located on the Education City Campus in Doha, Qatar. Simplified modeling of the condensation potential from the existing air conditioning systems, means for tapping into existing condensate drainage systems for re-routing to a storage facility, metering of collected condensate water, and potential impact for this water capture and re-use technique were studied. This project demonstrated the potential to capture over 6 million liters (1. 6 million gallons) of condensate water each year from the air conditioning systems for this building...|$|R

50|$|Ganz {{recognized}} that {{to develop his}} factory {{he had to make}} products that are mass-produced. In 1846 the Pest-Vác railway line was built. In that time the European foundries made wrought iron rims for spoked wagon wheels. They poured the casts in shapes in the sand, and <b>leave</b> it there <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> down. Meanwhile, in the United States and England they used a better method, the chill casting which was invented by the Englishman John Burn in 1812. The essence of this process is if you cool down the cast faster, the metal will be harder, and wear-proofer. That is possible if the casting frame is made of a good heat conductor. Ganz could made one in 1853 for the first time. And he could also improve this method by using antimony. He got a patent for this invention in 1856.|$|R
