50|$|In 2007, Halifax (Ireland) {{announced}} that {{it would be the first}} bank in the Republic of Ireland to offer a Visa Debit card rather than the Laser debit card (Halifax was never a member of <b>Laser</b> <b>Card</b> Services Limited). In 2008, Ulster Bank dropped the <b>Laser</b> <b>card</b> in favour of the Visa Debit card. Permanent TSB withdrew Laser cards and began to replace them with Visa Debit cards in September 2010.|$|E
50|$|Since 2006, Irish {{banks have}} {{progressively}} replaced Laser with international schemes, primarily Visa Debit and by 28 February 2014 the <b>Laser</b> <b>Card</b> system had been withdrawn entirely {{and is no}} longer accepted by retailers.|$|E
50|$|In July 2011, AIB {{announced}} that it would cease issuing Laser Cards from 2011, leaving National Irish Bank as the final issuer in the <b>Laser</b> <b>Card</b> system, leading to speculation that the scheme would close in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|In Ireland, Laser, {{which was}} co-branded with Maestro, has been {{replaced}} by Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard. The <b>Laser</b> debit <b>card</b> has been phased out by all banks and ceased to operate from March 2014. Irish <b>Laser</b> <b>cards</b> carried Maestro co-branding from 2008 onwards. They were intended to be used with chip and PIN POS systems. The chip on the card was programmed with two applications, one for Laser and one for Maestro. POS transactions were normally processed over the Laser network in Ireland and the Maestro network when the card was used abroad. Some POS terminals prompted users to manually select Laser or Maestro before completing the transaction. <b>Laser</b> <b>cards</b> could be processed as Maestro in most POS terminals worldwide for chip and PIN or swipe and sign transactions (where still accepted). Internet and telephone-based retailers, however, needed to be set up specifically to accept Irish Laser/Maestro cards. Transactions made with these cards were often secured by MasterCard's SecureCode system to verify the cardholder's identity. These cards were usually multi-functional and operated as a debit card as well as an ATM Card which could be used for accessing ATMs. Some banks also allowed customers to use their cards to deposit or withdraw money over the counter or at An Post post offices using their debit card and PIN. Historically the cards often contained a Cheque guarantee card function indicated by a hologram. This scheme was shut down in 2011. Foreign-issued Maestro cards are still accepted in Ireland in ATMs and by many POS machines. However, acceptance of Visa and MasterCard debit/credit cards is more reliably universal at POS terminals.|$|R
5000|$|Technologies: An {{array of}} boosts and special abilities, {{which must be}} {{researched}} for several turns {{before they can be}} put into play. Technology cards are placed face down on the table. The owner may move one ship from a planet onto the card at the start of any player's turn. Once the number of ships on the card meets the card's cost, the technology is [...] "completed," [...] the ships return, and the card is flipped face up. The power of technology cards varies wildly. The Xenon <b>lasers</b> <b>card</b> costs two ships, and its owner may change encounter scores by one point. The Omega missile card costs eight ships, and destroys a planet.|$|R
50|$|From 2005, some <b>Laser</b> <b>card</b> holders were {{provided}} with co-branded Laser/Maestro cards; from 1 January 2008, all Laser cards were co-branded. The co-branded cards were chip and PIN cards with both Laser and Maestro functions. The Laser facility was {{for use in the}} Republic of Ireland only whereas the Maestro facility was, in theory, used both domestically and internationally, but international Maestro payments were quite often rejected. The Maestro facility was not usable internationally online or by telephone. While it was possible for any bank in the Single Euro Payments Area, regardless of location, to join the <b>Laser</b> <b>card</b> scheme, no interest in joining the scheme was expressed by banks outside Ireland.|$|E
50|$|When {{purchasing}} {{goods or}} services with a <b>Laser</b> <b>card</b> up to €100 cashback could be given to cardholders and this value was simply added to the purchase price. Some retailers set a lower maximum cashback value, depending on what cash was available {{to them in the}} till or their own policy. Many Irish businesses that operate online accepted Laser Cards prior to their discontinuation.|$|E

50|$|Laser was a {{debit card}} scheme in Ireland. The Laser scheme was {{maintained}} {{and operated by}} <b>Laser</b> <b>Card</b> Services Ltd., a not-for-profit body owned by four leading financial institutions in Ireland and overseen since 2008 by the Oversight Unit of the Central Bank. The scheme was launched in 1996 and in 2010 there were almost 3 million Laser cards in circulation. 195 million transactions worth almost €11.2 billion were carried out on those cards in 2009. From 2007, the financial institutions which had issued Laser cards began to replace them with Visa or MasterCard debit cards. Laser cards were withdrawn from the market on 28 February 2014.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} that banks were turning away from Laser because of some difficulties encountered by consumers in making online purchases. However, customers began to complain almost immediately about numerous difficulties caused by the premature withdrawal of Laser cards. Some retailers {{who were able to}} give cashback on Laser cards were unwilling or unable to do so on the replacement cards; Permanent TSB issued a second replacement Visa Debit Card to its customers in April 2011 due to the initial replacement chip and some older terminals not being compatible (i.e. refusing cashback). Other retailers who had been charged a small flat-rate per-transaction fee for Laser transactions found that they were charged a percentage {{of the value of the}} transaction for the replacement cards. Organisations such as Betfair which did not charge customers for <b>Laser</b> <b>card</b> deposits began to charge these customers 1.5% commission on deposits using the replacement Visa debit cards. Merchant Services companies did not advertise whether there were any differences in their charges for the two types of debit card. Some customers reported being charged foreign usage fees on Visa debit cards in Northern Ireland, which had not been charged on the old cards.|$|E

50|$|The system first {{launched}} as a swipe & sign {{card and}} {{could be used in}} Ireland {{in much the same way}} as a credit card and were compatible standard card terminals (online or offline, although they were usually processed online). They could also be used in cardholder-not-present transactions over the phone, by mail or on the internet or for processing recurring payments. Laser also offered 'cash back' facilities where customers could ask retailers (where offered) for an amount of cash along with their transaction. This service allowed retailers to reduce volumes of cash in tills and allowed consumers to avoid having to use ATMs. Laser adopted EMV 'Chip and PIN' security in 2002 in common with other credit and debit cards right across Europe. In 2005, some banks issued customers with <b>Lasers</b> <b>cards</b> that were cobranded with Maestro. This allowed them to be used in POS terminals overseas, internet transactions were usually restricted to sites that specifically accepted Laser.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} real-time optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the detection of standard and nonvisible subthreshold laser irradiation. METHODS. We used an integrated platform consisting of a slit-lamp, a digital camera, a slit-lamp mounted OCT, and a 532 -nm laser photocoagulator (Topcon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The laser aiming beam and the OCT scan were aligned to obtain real-time tomographic imaging of the irradiated area during laser exposure. Standard and subthreshold laser irradiation and simultaneous OCT acquisition were tested in artificial and biological samples. <b>Laser</b> testing <b>cards</b> were chosen as artificial samples. Freshly enucleated pig eyes were used for iris irradiation. RESULTS. Ophthalmoscopically visible reference burns {{were placed on the}} <b>laser</b> testing <b>card</b> in 2 parallel lines. Then, a series of laser spots with the same size and duration but different power were placed between the reference burns. Online OCT during laser irradiation detected changes in the reflectivity profile of the artificial sample at a power of 200 mW, in absence of ophthalmoscopically visible lesions. Similarly, reference burns were placed on pig iris and between them various laser spots were performed at ranging powers. Changes in the iris optical properties, as detected with online OCT, were produced with a power of 860 mW in absence of visible endpoint. CONCLUSIONS. Online OCT is able to identify non-ophthalmoscopically visible lesions during subthreshold laser irradiation either in artificial samples or in pig iris. © 2011 Wichtig Editore...|$|R
40|$|A {{new form}} of patient record has been devised in which a <b>laser</b> {{imprinted}} <b>card</b> is coupled to a p. c. for data input and output. Entry of data is simple and recall of any datum requires only a keystroke.

30|$|Flip-chip {{technology}} has been widely used in high-performance and high-density microelectronics packaging [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] due to shorter possible leads, lower inductance, higher frequency, better noise control, smaller device footprints, and a lower profile, such as smart <b>card,</b> <b>laser</b> emitting diode, and surface-acoustic-wave filter in telecom applications [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Flux coating {{is one of the}} key processes during flip-chip packaging; flux is applied on the solder bumps or substrate to remove the oxides, pre-bonding flip chip on the substrate before reflow, and increases the wettability of the solder bump and improve assembly reliability [14, 15, 16]. Usually, flux coating can be achieved through dipping flux, ultrasonic flux, printing flux, and so on [17]. Chip to wafer (C 2 W) flip-chip bonding is more suitable at present for IC integration with expected process flexibility [18]. A flux dipping method was applied to C 2 W bonding [19]. Manna [20] and Nyamannavar et al. [21] reported that effect of fluxing chemical on wire surface by hot dip process and Heat Flux Transients at Solder/Substrate interface. The dipping quantity of flip-chip bumps affects the flip-chip bonding effect. Little flux can result in unbonding, excessive flux influence reliability of flip-chip.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{advent of}} {{microprocessors}} {{has opened up}} several product opportunities that simply did not exist earlier. These intelligent processors have invaded and embedded themselves into all fields of our lives be it the kitchen (food processors, microwave ovens), the living rooms (televisions, airconditioners) or the work places (fax machines, pagers, <b>laser</b> printer, credit <b>card</b> readers) …etc. As the complexities in the embedded applications increase, use of an operating system brings in lot of advantages. Most embedded systems also have real-time requirements demanding the use of Real time Operating Systems (RTOS) capable of meeting the embedded system requirements. Real-time Operating System allows realtime applications to be designed and expanded easily. The use of an RTOS simplifies the design process by splitting the application code into separate tasks. An RTOS allows one to make better use of the system recourses by providing with valuable services such as semaphores, mailboxes, queues, time delays, time outs…etc. This report looks at the basic concepts of embedded systems, operating systems and specifically at Real Time Operating Systems {{in order to identify}} the features one has to look for in an RTOS before it is used in a real-time embedded application. Some of the popular RTOS have been discussed in brief, giving their salient features, which make them suitable for different applications. I...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are {{the most}} {{advanced}} technologies to fight road accidents. Within ADAS, an important role is played by radar- and lidar-based sensors, which are mostly employed for collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control. Nonetheless, they have a narrow field-of-view and a limited ability to detect and differentiate objects. Standard camera-based technologies (e. g. stereovision) could balance these weaknesses, but they are currently not able to fulfill all automotive requirements (distance range, accuracy, acquisition speed, and frame-rate). To this purpose, we developed an automotive-oriented CMOS single-photon camera for optical 3 D ranging based on indirect time-of-flight (iTOF) measurements. Imagers based on Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays offer higher sensitivity with respect to CCD/CMOS rangefinders, have inherent better time resolution, higher accuracy and better linearity. Moreover, iTOF requires neither high bandwidth electronics nor short-pulsed lasers, hence allowing the development of cost-effective systems. The CMOS SPAD sensor is based on 64 × 32 pixels, each able to process both 2 D intensity-data and 3 D depth-ranging information, with background suppression. Pixel-level memories allow fully parallel imaging and prevents motion artefacts (skew, wobble, motion blur) and partial exposure effects, which otherwise would hinder the detection of fast moving objects. The camera is housed in an aluminum case supporting a 12 mm F/ 1. 4 C-mount imaging lens, with a 40 °× 20 ° field-of-view. The whole system is very rugged and compact and a perfect solution for vehicle’s cockpit, with dimensions of 80 mm × 45 mm × 70 mm, and less that 1 W consumption. To provide the required optical power (1. 5 W, eye safe) and to allow fast (up to 25 MHz) modulation of the active illumination, we developed a modular laser source, based on five <b>laser</b> driver <b>cards,</b> with three 808 nm lasers each. We present the full characterization of the 3 D automotive system, operated both at night and during daytime, in both indoor and outdoor, in real traffic, scenario. The achieved long-range (up to 45 m), high dynamic-range (118 dB), highspeed (over 200 fps) 3 D depth measurement, and high precision (better than 90 cm at 45 m), highlight the excellent performance of this CMOS SPAD camera for automotive applications. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
