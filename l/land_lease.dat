5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near the Lawn and boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a <b>land</b> <b>lease</b> and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of these houses cost up to $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South, using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial <b>land</b> <b>lease</b> agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impacts of local {{government}} <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue on house price. Econometric analysis was employed. The results show that: (1) there was a positive correlation between local government <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue and house price, namely local government <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue has positive effects on house price; (2) impacts of local government <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue on house price have regional differences and time differences; (3) regional differences are mainly reflected in the differences of regional economic development level, time differences are mainly reflected in the differences of government policies at different stages. It is concluded that: local government <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue plays a very important role in the process of housing prices. In order to stabilize housing prices, it is not enough to reduce the local government <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> revenue, and it is necessary to make comprehensive use of various control policies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Since ancient {{time this}} type of {{agreement}} was thought {{to have a special}} utility in exploiting the land property. The <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> agreement is a juridical instrument specific for exploiting agricultural goods at present time as well. Therefore, after 1990, the <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> agreement was regulated by Law no. 16 / 1996 of the <b>land</b> <b>leasing,</b> complemented by the dispositions of the Civil Code in 1864. The new Civil Code regulates the <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> agreement in art. 1836 - 1850 and although mainly keeping the old regulation which, it also comprises aspects of novelty referring to several notions that define the contract, as well as the form, duration, parties’ ability, managing risks or termination of the <b>land</b> <b>leasing</b> agreement. Thus, an improved and better adapted to the new realities juridical regime is shaped, and we aim at analyzing it in the present study...|$|R
5|$|The 1899 Rock Island Railroad Bridge {{across the}} Arkansas River, {{originally}} leading to Choctaw Station, {{has been converted}} into a pedestrian bridge connecting to North Little Rock. On the fifth anniversary of the library's opening, Clinton said that construction on the project would begin in 2010, but full funding had not yet been secured, as the project was still short about $3 million. The Clinton Foundation had originally planned to renovate the bridge for $4 million in exchange for a $1-a-year <b>land</b> <b>lease</b> from the state. In 2009, Arkansas governor Mike Beebe agreed to use $2.5 million of stimulus funds to fund part of the renovation. A previous $8 million earmark for the project had failed to pass the state legislature. In 2010, fundraising was finally completed for the bridge, renamed as the Clinton Park Bridge, and construction began on May 28, 2010. On September 30, 2011, Clinton spoke at a dedication ceremony for the bridge, which opened to the public on October 2, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Yankee Stadium is {{accessible}} by car via the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87), with {{connections to the}} Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95), Bruckner Expressway (I-278), and other highways and roads. Aside from existing parking lots and garages serving the stadium, construction for additional parking garages is planned. The New York State Legislature agreed to $70 million in subsidies for a $320 million parking garage project. On October 9, 2007, the New York City Industrial Development Agency approved $225 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of three new parking garages that will have 3,600 new parking spaces, and renovation of the existing 5,569 parking spaces nearby. Plans initially called for a fourth new garage, but this was eliminated before the final approval. The garages will be built (and renovated) by the Community Initiatives Development Corporation of Hudson, New York, a nonprofit entity that will use the parking revenue to repay the bonds and pay a $3 million yearly <b>land</b> <b>lease</b> to the City of New York. Parking is expected to cost $25 per game.|$|E
