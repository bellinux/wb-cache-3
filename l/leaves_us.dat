The road heads through wooded areas, {{narrowing}} to six lanes, before coming to an interchange with MD 70 (Rowe Boulevard). At this interchange, the unsigned I-595 designation ends, while US 50, US 301, and MD 2 continue northeast on the John Hanson Highway. The route passes under MD 436 (Ridgely Avenue) and runs near residential neighborhoods before crossing over the Severn River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. After crossing the Severn River, the road comes to an interchange with the Governor Ritchie Highway.

He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: [...] "I will tell you, Histiaeus, {{the truth of this}} business: it was you who stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on." [...] Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.|$|E

500|$|Juster had {{not read}} Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{when he wrote}} The Phantom Tollbooth, but the two books, each about a bored child plunged {{into a world of}} absurd logic, have {{repeatedly}} been compared. According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, [...] "Alice is clearly Milo's closest literary kin". Milo's conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the Cheshire Cat. The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the Queen of Hearts' arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift. Alice's sovereigns, representing the authority figures of Victorian childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-World War II world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm. His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well—Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> uncertain if Alice has learned anything from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.|$|E
500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman. With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human, a composition which <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E

Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> unsure whom we can trust or what will happen next, and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|E

It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E
500|$|There {{are very}} few extant sources of {{information}} on the individual trobairitz. Almost all information which exists about them come from their vidas (biographies) and razós (contextual explanations of the songs), the brief descriptions that were assembled in song collections called chansonniers. The vidas are notoriously unreliable, since they frequently consisted of little more than romanticized extrapolations from the poems of the trobairitz themselves. The names of about twenty female poets from the 12th and 13th centuries survive, with an estimated thirty-two works attributed to the trobairitz. There are about 5 percent as many trobairitz as there are troubadours, and the number of surviving compositions by trobairitz amounts to around 1 percent of those we have by the troubadours. The earliest surviving lyric written by a trobairitz is that of Bels dous amics, written by Tibors around 1150. Only one survives with musical notation intact, [...] "A chantar" [...] by Comtessa de Diá (see below). Some works which are anonymous in the sources are ascribed by certain modern editors to women, as are some works which are attributed to men in the manuscripts. For comparison, of the 460 male troubadours, about 2600 of their poems survive. Of these, about one in 10 survive with musical notation intact. Only two trobairitz have left us with more than one song apiece.
