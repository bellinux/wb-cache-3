Half throttle engine with constant 2500 rpm setting was maintained throughout the wear debris and lube oil analysis such as {{for a period of}} twenty hours for each fuel system. The sample of lube oil was collected through a one - way valve connected to the crankcase sump at the interval of four hours. When the engine warmed up, first sample has collected immediately. The same conventional lubricating oil SAE 30 was used for each fuel system. To measure wear metal debris and lubricating oil additives depletion of used lubricating oil, Multi element oil analyzer (MOA) was used. To measure the viscosity of <b>lub</b> <b>oil</b> an ISL automatic houillon viscometer (ASTM D 445) has been used. Very satisfactory results have been obtained by comparing the <b>lub</b> <b>oil</b> analysis results of Ordinary Diesel and Palm Oil Diesel and their emulsions with 10 percent water by volume. In crankcase oil samples, accumulation of wear metal debris was lower with Palm Oil Diesel and emulsified fuels compare to baseline Ordinary Diesel fuel. Both Ordinary Diesel and Palm Oil Diesel emulsions with 10 per cent water by volume showed promising trends for resisting wear...|$|E
