For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a white powder that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent</b> for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E
25|$|S. cerevisiae {{is used in}} baking; {{the carbon}} dioxide {{generated}} by the fermentation {{is used as a}} <b>leavening</b> <b>agent</b> in bread and other baked goods. Historically, this use was closely linked to the brewing industry's use of yeast, as bakers took or bought the barm or yeast-filled foam from brewing ale from the brewers (producing the barm cake); today, brewing and baking yeast strains are somewhat different.|$|E

50|$|Since {{chemical}} {{expertise is}} required to create a functional chemical leaven without producing off-flavors from the chemical precursors involved, such substances are often mixed into premeasured combinations for maximum results. These are generally referred to as baking powders. Sour milk and carbonates {{were used in the}} 1800s. The breakthrough in chemical <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> occurred in the 1930s with the introduction of monocalcium phosphates (Ca(H2PO4)2). Other <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> developed include sodium aluminium sulfate (NaAl(SO4)2·12H2O), disodium pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7), and sodium aluminium phosphates (NaH14Al3(PO4)8·4H2O and Na3H15Al2(PO4)8). These compounds combine with sodium bicarbonate to give carbon dioxide in a predictable manner.|$|R
25|$|In cooking, sodium bicarbonate, {{referred}} to as baking soda, is primarily used in baking as a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, soda bread, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, cream of tartar, lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa and vinegar. Baking soda may be used together with sourdough, which is acidic, making a lighter product with a less acid taste.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrian Church of the East uses leavened {{bread for}} Eucharist, like most churches of Eastern Christianity, {{but it is}} the only Church to include the {{additional}} ingredient of Holy Leaven. Holy Leaven is a powder added to sacramental bread before it is baked. Despite the name, Holy Leaven does not actually contain a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Instead, khmira, fermented dough from previously used sacramental bread, is added and acts as leaven. What the Holy Leaven does contain is remainder from the original Holy Leaven, renewed annually by mixing it with common ingredients. The original Holy Leaven is said to contain residue from the original bread used at the Last Supper, mixed with the blood of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Bread was {{primarily}} made from barley flour during the Iron Age ( [...] , [...] ), as barley was more widely and easily grown, and was thus more available, cheaper, {{and could be}} made into bread without a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent</b> even though wheat flour was regarded as superior. It was presumably made from dough that was a simple mixture of barley flour and water, divided into small pieces, formed by hand into round shapes and then baked.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leavening</b> <b>agents</b> {{are used}} with some {{varieties}} of flour, {{especially those with}} significant gluten content, to produce lighter and softer baked products by embedding small gas bubbles. Self-rising (or self-raising) flour is sold premixed with chemical <b>leavening</b> <b>agents.</b> The added ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the flour which aids a consistent rise in baked goods. This flour is generally used for preparing scones, biscuits, muffins, etc. It was invented by Henry Jones and patented in 1845. Plain flour {{can be used to}} make a type of self-rising flour although the flour will be coarser. Self-raising flour is typically composed of the following ratio: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Leavening</b> <b>agents</b> cause {{dough to}} rise by {{producing}} carbon dioxide. Baker's yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as {{baking powder and}} baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids.|$|R
2500|$|Cereals {{formed the}} staple diet. The two main grains were wheat ( [...] sitos) and barley ( [...] krithe). Wheat grains were {{softened}} by soaking, then either reduced into gruel, or ground into flour ( [...] aleiata) and kneaded and formed into loaves ( [...] artos) or flatbreads, either plain or mixed with cheese or honey. Leavening was known; the Greeks later used an alkali ( [...] nitron) or wine yeast as a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Dough loaves were baked {{at home in}} a clay oven ( [...] ipnos) set on legs. Bread wheat, difficult to grow in Mediterranean climates, and the white bread made from it, were associated with the upper classes in the ancient Mediterranean, while the poor ate coarse brown breads made from emmer wheat and barley.|$|E
50|$|The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, {{containing}} {{a small amount}} of chemical <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent,</b> e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar.|$|E

50|$|Quick {{bread is}} any bread leavened with <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> other than yeast or eggs. An {{advantage}} of quick breads is {{their ability to}} be prepared quickly and reliably, without requiring the time-consuming skilled labor and the climate control needed for traditional yeast breads.|$|R
2500|$|Jewish cooks {{use both}} matzo meal and potato starch for {{pastries}} during Passover. [...] Whisked whole eggs or egg whites are frequently {{used to make}} pastries without <b>leavening</b> <b>agents,</b> such as angel and sponge cakes (potato starch replacing cake flour) and coconut and almond macaroons.|$|R
50|$|Originally, jumbles were {{twisted into}} various pretzel-like shapes, and boiled.

50|$|Traditional springerle recipes use hartshorn salt (ammonium carbonate, or baker's ammonia) as a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Since hartshorn salt can be {{difficult}} to find, many modern recipes use baking powder as the <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Springerle made with hartshorn salt are lighter and softer than those made with baking powder. The hartshorn salt also imparts a crisper design and longer shelf-life to the springerle. The leavening causes the biscuit to at least double in height during baking.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> {{include a}} weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, {{to create an}} acid—base {{reaction}} that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called [...] "soda bread"). Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> are egg whites mechanically beaten to form stiff peaks, {{as in the case}} of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid—base combinations include: ...|$|R
50|$|For the dough, most {{versions}} {{still use}} 19th century ingredients such as potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate as <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> {{to get the}} sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture.

50|$|Beer bread can be {{made with}} simply flour, beer, and sugar. Some bottled beers, {{especially}} craft beers, may intentionally have visible live, but dormant, yeast sediment {{at the bottom of the}} bottle. However, many mass market beers have the live yeast filtered out. Without sufficient leavening from the beer, a loaf of beer bread will be fairly dense and heavy unless an additional <b>leavening</b> <b>agent,</b> e.g., baking soda and/or baking powder, or baker's yeast and sugar, is added. Self-raising flour may be used because it is a mixture of flour and <b>leavening</b> <b>agent.</b> Beer bread without a <b>leavening</b> <b>agent</b> is very sturdy and tends not to lose moisture if it is overcooked. The only consequence of overcooking tends to be a thicker crust. Pre-packaged Beer Bread mixes may also be purchased with the dry ingredients and leavening agents already included.|$|E

50|$|During the {{chemical}} <b>leavening</b> process, <b>agents</b> (one or more food-grade chemicals—usually a weak acid and a weak base) are added into the dough during mixing. These agents undergo a chemical reaction to produce carbon dioxide, {{which increases the}} baked good's volume and produces a porous structure and lighter texture. Yeast breads often take hours to rise, and the resulting baked good's texture can vary greatly based on external factors such as temperature and humidity. By contrast, breads made with chemical <b>leavening</b> <b>agents</b> are relatively uniform, reliable, and quick. Usually, the resulting baked good is softer and lighter than a traditional yeast bread.|$|R
