50|$|Liquid {{paraffin}} {{is considered}} to have a limited usefulness as an occasional laxative, but is unsuitable for regular use as it can seep from the anus and cause irritation. It can also interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, be absorbed into the intestinal wall, and may cause foreign-body granulomatous reactions. If it enters the lungs, it can cause <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Exogenous lipid {{pneumonia}} {{is rare in}} the general population, but occupational accidents may not be uncommon in fire performers. Diagnosis is usually {{made on the basis}} of history of exposure to hydrocarbon fuels, symptoms, and radiological findings.

For this reason, <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> may mimic many other diseases, and the diagnosis is often delayed.|$|E
5000|$|Mineral oil {{should not}} be given {{internally}} to young children, pets, or anyone with a cough, hiatus hernia, or nocturnal reflux, because it can cause complications such as <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> [...] Due to its low density, it is easily aspirated into the lungs, where it cannot be removed by the body. In children, if aspirated, the oil can work to prevent normal breathing, resulting in death of brain cells and permanent paralysis and/or retardation.|$|E
50|$|The US Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products {{reported}} between 2008 and {{the beginning}} of 2012, 47 cases of adverse effects associated with e-cigarettes, of which eight were considered serious. Two peer-reviewed reports of <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were related to e-cigarette use, as well as two reports in the media in Spain and the UK. The man from the UK reportedly died from severe <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in 2011. Reports to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for minor adverse effects identified with using e-cigarettes include headache, chest pain, nausea, and cough. Major adverse effects reported to the FDA included hospitalizations for pneumonia, congestive heart failure, seizure, rapid heart rate, and burns. However no direct relationship has been proven between these effects and e-cigarette use, and some of them may be due to existing health problems. Many of the observed negative effects from e-cigarette use concerning the nervous system and the sensory system are probably related to nicotine overdose or withdrawal. Since e-cigarettes are intended to be used repeatedly, they can conveniently be used {{for an extended period of}} time, which may contribute to increased adverse effects. E-cigarettes were associated with fewer adverse effects than nicotine patches.|$|E
50|$|Concern exists {{regarding}} the immunological effects of e-liquid, and analysis on animals demonstrate that e-liquid vapor, {{appear to have}} adverse effects on the immune system. There were reports of e-cigarettes causing an immune system reaction involving inflammation of the gastrointestinal system. Long-term use could {{increase the risk of}} tuberculosis. It is possible that e-cigarettes could harm the periodontium because of the effects of nicotine on gum tissues and the immune system. Some health effects associated with e-cigarette use can include recurring ulcerative colitis, <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, sub-acute bronchial toxicity, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia.|$|E
50|$|Mycobacterium wolinskyi is {{a rapidly}} growing {{mycobacterium}} most commonly seen in post-traumatic wound infections, especially those following open fractures and with associated osteomyelitis. Mycobacterium wolinskyi is clearly clinically significant, and occurs in the same settings as Mycobacterium smegmatis {{and members of the}} Mycobacterium fortuitum complex; they differ from members of the Mycobacterium fortuitum complex in the type of chronic lung disease they produce, with essentially all cases occurring in the setting of chronic <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> either secondary to chronic oil ingestion or chronic aspiration (usually achalasia).

50|$|Oil, {{which must}} be used to {{lubricate}} the compressor's internal parts, can be harmful if it contaminates the breathing gas and is inhaled as a mist. Petroleum-based oils cannot be absorbed and metabolized by the body and will coat the internal surfaces of the lungs, causing a condition known as <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and leading to asphyxiation and death. For this reason, compressors must be carefully designed and maintained to ensure that oil contamination of the breathing gas is within safe limits. Oils used should {{be approved by the}} compressor manufacturer and rated as safe for breathing air compressors. A range of mineral based and synthetic oils are supplied by several lubricant manufacturers for this application.|$|E
50|$|The primary base {{ingredients}} {{of the liquid}} solution is propylene glycol and glycerin. About 20% to 27% of propylene glycol and glycerin-based liquid particles are inhaled. The long-term effects of inhaled propylene glycol has not been studied, and is unknown. The effects of inhaled glycerin are unknown. Being exposed to propylene glycol may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The risk from the inhalation of propylene glycol and glycerin is probably low. Propylene glycol and glycerin have not {{been shown to be}} safe. Some research states that propylene glycol emissions may cause respiratory irritation and raise the likelihood to develop asthma. Long-term inhalation of propylene glycol indoors could increase risk to children to develop asthma. To lessen the risks, most e-cigarettes companies began to use water and glycerin as replacement for propylene glycol. The inhaled glycerin could cause <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{analyze and}} {{identify}} the fatty acids found in homemade ghee and in olive oil and compare those to fatty acids found in bronchoalevolar lavage of children with <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Methods: The fatty acids found in homemade fat ”Ghee” and olive oil were analyzed by gas chromatography. Methyl ester derivatives suitable for GC analysis were prepared directly from olive oil or from Ghee using anhydrous methanolic-HCl. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalevolar lavage was performed in eight children aged between 2 and 4 years, all with history of using homemade ghee and/or olive oil in the recumbent position. Results: The analysis of fatty acids in Ghee and olive oil show similar gas chromatographic pattern as those of bronchoalevolar lavage.

40|$|Background: Exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is an {{uncommon}} condition caused by inhalation or aspiration of a fatty substance. It usually presents as chronic respiratory illness mimicking interstitial lung diseases. Acute exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is uncommon and typically {{is caused by}} an episode of aspiration of a large quantity of a petroleum-based product. Radiological findings vary and may imitate many other diseases. Case Report: We present a rare case of acute exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in a fire-eater who aspirated liquid paraffin during his flame-blowing show (fire-eater's lung). He {{was admitted to the}} hospital with productive cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain and dyspnea. Diagnosis was {{made on the basis of}} history of exposure to fatty substance, characteristic findings in CT examination and presence of lipid-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusions: Acute exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is a very rare disease that typically occurs in fire-eaters and is called a fire-eater's lung. The diagnosis is made on the basis of typical history and radiological, as well as histopathological findings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcute {{exogenous}} <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> {{is a rare}} {{disorder in}} adults. A treatment of choice for <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> has not been established, and systemic corticosteroid use remains controversial. We report {{the case of a}} 32 -year-old man with schizophrenia who presented with kerosene-induced acute exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> that was treated with a systemic corticosteroid. In this case, supportive therapy did not improve the patient's condition, so systemic corticosteroid therapy was commenced four days after he ingested the kerosene. After corticosteroid commencement, the patient's symptoms and hypoxia improved within a few days. Although some radiological characteristics of this disorder have been reported previously, the process of radiological improvement of exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is not well known. In this case, computed tomography findings changed dramatically after corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Extensive bilateral consolidations that were observed on admission improved. Although pneumatoceles developed two weeks after corticosteroid commencement, they were nearly gone after two months of the treatment. While corticosteroid therapy is not suitable for all cases, it should be considered for severe or refractory cases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is {{an unusual}} and {{uncommon}} form of pneumonia caused by aspiration of fatty substances. Hydrocarbon pneumonitis following aspiration of diesel {{is a form of}} exogenous <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> wherein, aspirated diesel reaches the alveoli rapidly without evoking any significant cough, but initiates an intense inflammatory reaction in the pulmonary parenchyma. This is a rarely described clinical scenario, although the practice of diesel siphonage from automobiles is a common practice in developing countries. We herein describe a 40 -year-old male patient, in whom the diagnosis of <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> was delayed for a long duration and highlight the importance of taking a detailed occupational exposure history in patients with non-resolving pneumonia to rule out the underlying possibility of this rare clinical entity...|$|E
30|$|Although {{exogenous}} <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (ELP) typically presents with consolidation, that {{is typically}} low in attenuation (− 100 HU), {{it may also}} manifest with geographic areas of ground-glass attenuation surrounded by interlobular septal thickening, representing a “crazy paving” pattern. In terms of HRCT, distinctive features that favour <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> over alveolar proteinosis are the presence of ill-defined centrilobular nodules and the coexistence of consolidation [28]. Transbronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage {{and a history of}} oil ingestion are usually diagnostic for ELP.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lipoid</b> <b>{{pneumonia}}</b> {{is a rare}} form {{of pneumonia}} caused by accumulation of exogenous or endogenous lipids in the pulmonary system.

40|$|The {{exogenous}} <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> {{uncommon in}} adults, {{is the result}} of the inhalation and/or aspiration of lipid material into the tracheobronchial tree. This is often confused with bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis due to a nonspecific clinical and radiologic picture. It presents acutely or chronically and may result in pulmonary fibrosis. We describe here a case of <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in a gas station attendant who siphoned gasoline to fill motorcycles; he was hospitalized due to presenting with a respiratory infection that was hard to resolve. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, which, on cytochemical (oil red O) evaluation, was slightly positive for lipid material in the foamy cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages. Due to his occupational history and radiographic abnormalities suggestive of <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> a lung biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was serially treated with segmental lung lavage and showed clinical, functional, and radiological improvement...|$|E

Chest High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed ground-glass attenuation with thickening of septal lines, wh create the so-called “crazy-paving appearance”. Although bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) and transbronchial biopsy were performed to aid in diagnosis, the findings did not reveal any conclusive information. Improvements on chest radiographs and in the patient's symptoms were observed without any therapeutic intervention; however, one year later, her chest X-ray showed deteriorative changes. Surgical lung biopsy was performed, and the pathological findings were consistent with those of <b>lipoid</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> The patient showed spontaneous remission of the disease.
