5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the <b>local</b> <b>network</b> situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the <b>local</b> <b>network</b> of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{development}} potential of <b>local</b> inter-firm <b>networks</b> in Newly Industrializing Countries.

Transnational software companies located in Ireland developed extensive <b>local</b> supply <b>networks.</b> <b>Local</b> social <b>networks</b> and a <b>local</b> culture of innovation contributed to the growth of an indigenous software development sector. While <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> can generate significant competitive advantage for a region they are inevitably internationalized as successful firms organize globally or as the region attracts further foreign investment. Corporations utilize <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> to solve problems of cost, control and innovation management in the globalization of production and corporate organization. While fostering <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> can be an effective public policy, it is not sufficient for development. The role of the state in supporting, guiding and bargaining with local firms in these networks remains a crucial aspect of development strategy...|$|R

5|$|StarCraft II {{does not}} offer the ability to play {{directly}} over a local area network (LAN), as is possible with StarCraft; all network games are routed through the Internet via Blizzard's gaming servers. The latency delay between commands issued and game response when played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in-game units; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result. Over 250,000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II, before the game's release. Currently, Blizzard {{has no plans to}} support LAN play. Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard's servers, a Players Near You feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2.0.4, to help with organizing games with other players on the same <b>local</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and <b>local</b> <b>network.</b> The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E
5|$|When Japanese forces {{took control}} of the Indies in 1942, the empire's Dōmei Tsushin news agency {{established}} a branch office in Jakarta. Antara was renamed Yashima on 29May, and it was eventually absorbed by the Dōmei news network three months later. Press activity flourished as Dōmei opened offices in major cities throughout Java. When Indonesia's independence was proclaimed on 17August 1945, Adam Malik obtained a copy of the text and dictated it by telephone to his colleagues at the agency. The resulting news bulletin slipped past Japanese censors and was broadcast throughout Dōmei's newswire network. Dōmei officials attempted to retract the bulletin, but a courier was able to deliver a copy of the proclamation using the agency's name to the Hōsō Kanrikyoku radio station in midst of the confusion. Antara assumed control of Dōmei's <b>local</b> <b>network</b> when the Japanese surrendered to Allied forces weeks later and reopened under private management on 3September.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} intra- and inter-organisational {{barriers to}} commercialisation 0 f rural weavers in KwaZulu-Natal {{and evaluate the}} role of <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> in procurement, processing and marketing activities {{in order to reduce}} transaction costs. The study specifically investigates the way <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> a san alternative organisational mode can become a solution to minimise transaction costs of rural weavers. The expectation is that weaving groups incur less transaction costs during commercialisation when they have well established <b>local</b> <b>networks.</b> This follows as transaction costs give a reflection of the market given the operating environment. The access to market information, assets, extension services and remunerative markets is of commercial importance. An exploratory analysis suggests that existing networks in craft businesses in northern KwaZulu-Natal have an impact in reducing some of the transaction costs of weavers, thereby improving weavers' economic performance and commercialisation process. <b>Local</b> <b>networks</b> have therefore shown to be not only a pre-condition for non-local networks, but an important vehicle for information exchange, co-ordination of fragmented activities, conducting training services, and guarding against market failures for weavers. However, the two fundamental questions to be asked for future research are how to create <b>local</b> <b>networks</b> to improve supply chain functions in similar or different socio-economic settings to this study's cases and how to assure the sustainability of networks.
