As of 2009, it received, depending on sources, between 800,000 and over 1,000,000 visits per year. In 2010, its promotion was incorporated in the Youth on the Move campaign launched by the European Commission to extend opportunities for <b>learning</b> <b>mobility</b> to all young people in Europe by 2020.

More particularly, over the last decade, one observes an increasing interest in so-called North-South <b>learning</b> <b>mobility,</b> between ‘industrialised’ and so-called ‘non-industrialised’ countries in the South. The University College Leuven anticipated this trend, organising an Advanced Bachelor ‘International Cooperation North South’ which consists of an intensive two-month preparation of students and a six-month work placement and research project in a (development) organisation in the South. Based on its long-term experience with sending students to the south, Leuven University College has elaborated a sound vision on North-South <b>learning</b> <b>mobility</b> of young people. It adopts a holistic approach by focussing on what are considered to be the fundamental aspects for organising qualitative North-South mobility: a good (substantive as well as methodological) preparation trajectory for outgoing students, close follow-up of students during and after their stay in the South; and sustainable partnerships with receiving organisations and institutions in the southern countries. In this paper, the Advanced Bachelor ‘International Cooperation North South’ is presented as ‘good practice’.

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{knowledge}} necessary for adoption {{and implementation of}} the Assessment of <b>Learning</b> Powered <b>mobility</b> use (ALP) tool in different practice settings for both adults and children. To consult with a diverse population of professionals working with adults and children, in different countries and various settings; who were learning about or using the ALP tool, as part of exploring and implementing research findings. Method: Classical grounded theory with a rigorous comparative analysis of data from informants together with reflections on our own rich experiences of powered mobility practice and comparisons with the literature. Results: A core category learning tool use and a new theory of cognizing tool use, with its interdependent properties: motivation, confidence, permissiveness, attentiveness and co-construction has emerged which explains in greater depth what enables the application of the ALP tool. Conclusions: The scientific knowledge base on tool use learning and the new theory conveys the information necessary for practitioner’s cognizing how to apply the learning approach of the ALP tool in order to enable tool use <b>learning</b> through powered <b>mobility</b> practice as a therapeutic intervention in its own right.

40|$|The modular {{representation}} of concerns is imperative {{in the design}} modeling of multi-agent systems (MASs).

Without an explicit modeling of such MAS properties, designers can not properly communicate and reason about them and their broadly-scoped effects.

40|$|This {{research}} {{claims that}} investing European Union (EU) Structural Funds in <b>Learning</b> <b>Mobility</b> (LM) {{might lead to}} further regional polarization. LM {{is a type of}} labour mobility finalized to acquire new knowledge (human capital) and social networks (social capital). Historically, LM has been supported by space neutral policies, like the ERASMUS programme. However, after the mid-tem review of the Lisbon strategy (2005), also Cohesion Policy started to invest in LM and today it is considered an important priority by 1 / 3 of European Social Fund national programming documents (EU, 2010 i). This, even though {{there is no evidence of}} LM being consistent with the historical objective of Cohesion Policy: real convergence (Molle, 2007). Human capital theory predicts investment in education to improve labour market outputs. However, when it comes to lagging regions this might not be the case both because of brain drain (Becker, 1964) and because of their inefficient labour markets (Rodr-Pose and Vilalta-Buf, 2005). In order to shed light on these issues, this paper relies on a case study: the programme Master and Back (M&B). M&B is an early example of Structural Funds devoted to <b>learning</b> <b>mobility</b> and has been carried out since 2005 by the Italian region Sardinia. It consists of financing young Sardinian residents endowed with excellent CVs to take masters and PhDs in the best world universities and then of facilitating their return by means of economic incentives. In order to evaluate the impact of the programme, the labour market outputs of the recipients have been compared to those of a suitable control group by means of Propensity Score Matching (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). In particular, the following outputs have been considered: odds of employment, earnings and odds of emigration. Both administrative data and web survey data have been collected. Overall 207 treated units and 1, 201 control units have participated to the survey, corresponding respectively to 50...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Several {{concerns}} {{in the development of}} multi-agent systems (MASs) cannot be represented in a modular fashion. In general, they inherently affect several system modules and cannot be explicitly captured based on existing software engineering abstractions. These crosscutting concerns encompass internal agent properties and systemic properties, such as <b>learning,</b> code <b>mobility,</b> error handling, and context-awareness. In this context, it is important to systematically verify whether emerging development paradigms support improved modularization of the crosscutting concerns relative to MASs. This paper reports some lessons learned based on our experience in using aspect-oriented techniques and methods to address these problems. In the light of these lessons, related work and a set of future research directions are also discussed. ...|$|R

I go on to explore other dynamic consequences of integration. The entry of multinationals makes the lifetime earning profiles of host country workers steeper. At the same time, if agents learn fast enough, integration creates unequal opportunities, thereby widening inequality. The ex-workers of foreign multinationals also found new firms which are, on average, larger than the largest firms under autarky.
