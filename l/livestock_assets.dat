In Afar culture, {{there is a high}} degree of reciprocity—if a household loses its <b>livestock</b> <b>asset</b> due to rustling, epidemics, or other agents, the risk is divided among the whole clan; thereby, the household gets some stocks for rebuilding its stock asset.

40|$|AbstractWe present {{evidence}} from Rwanda's Girinka (‘One Cow per Poor Family’) {{program that has}} distributed more than 130, 000 <b>livestock</b> <b>asset</b> transfers {{in the form of}} cows to the rural poor since 2006. Supply side constraints on the program resulted in some beneficiaries receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, and other households not receiving such training with their cow. We exploit these differences to estimate the additional impact of receiving complementary training with the cow transfer, on household's economic outcomes up to six years after having received the <b>livestock</b> <b>asset</b> transfer. Our results show that even in a setting such as rural Rwanda where linkages between farmers and produce markets are weak, the provision of training with asset transfers has permanent and economically significant impacts on milk production, milk yields from livestock, household earnings, and asset accumulation.

30|$|We {{conclude}} that the emergence of income diversification among pastoral households is only a short-term strategy designed to bring relief from immediate risks to the household members in the settlements {{who do not have}} access to key <b>livestock</b> <b>assets.</b> This is a practice that is particularly used by destitute pastoral households that are seeking alternatives to replenish lost <b>livestock</b> <b>assets</b> and incomes. However, income diversification cannot be sustained without the security and support of the base livestock livelihood. The underlying and long-term structural patterns of income diversification observed in this study include complementarity to the base livestock livelihood. Engaging in NPIs is therefore a quest to adapt to the livestock livelihood risks associated with change in household mobility for the less-wealthy households, rather than a wealth accumulation strategy associated with optimizing opportunities. More broadly, the nature and patterns of income diversification in pastoral settlements indicate the need for development interventions that are responsive to these dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the intertemporal dynamics of poverty using microeconomic data often hints at the existence of poverty traps, where some find themselves trapped at a low-level stable equilibrium while others enjoy a higher stable equilibrium.

Given the dramatic policy consequences implied by such a theory, knowledge about {{the location of the}} different equilibria would be extremely helpful. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of threshold-type models to identify those crucial parameters.

ABSTRACT: Droughts manifested in the changes in frequency, duration and changes in rainfall patterns directly impact on <b>livestock</b> <b>assets</b> of pastoral households of which Maasai community in Kajiado County of Kenya exemplifies. The community is seasonally exposed to drought effects and has adjusted their livestock feeding practices to cope but knowledge gaps exists {{as to whether the}} adjusted feeding practices adequately aligns to the magnitude of change experienced, This study established the influence of drought duration on livestock feeding practices from sample of 136 households, selected using simple random sampling procedure. A large majority of the sampled households had noticed changes in the frequency of droughts (98. 5 %), increased drought duration (97. 8 %), unpredictable onset and patterns of rains (99. 3 %) and longer droughts lasting 7 to 12 months on average. Despite noticing increased trends of changing and variable climate, a large majority of the sample households (87. 5 %) continues with traditional herd mobility in coping with drought effects and limited uptake of supplementary feeding, demonstrating non uptake of planned adaptation strategies, which poses threats to <b>livestock</b> <b>assets</b> of pastoral community. Urgent interventions is therefore advised for the Maasai community to include introduction and promotion of harvesting and storing natural hay for drought feeding, use of drought tolerant livestock breeds, targeted livestock off-take to reduce economic losses and construction of watering facilities in the area and regula...|$|E

All these effects {{put pressure on the}} <b>livestock</b> <b>assets</b> causing about 80  % livestock loss, testing the pastoral livelihoods heavily. Each household, on average, lost 6.5 small stock and 7 cattle during the past 10  years due to health hazards caused by P. juliflora pod. Consequently, P. juliflora as a source of income was considered by a quarter of the surveyed pastoral households, with the age of a household head and change in livestock asset being influential variables in decision-making.|$|E

30|$|The {{other problem}} {{associated}} with P. juliflora invasion is its hindrance on transhumance, a seasonal migration for search of feed. However, transhumance {{is one of}} the risk management strategies used by pastoralists to maintain their <b>livestock</b> <b>asset.</b> Transhumance allows marked recovery of grazing lands due to de facto “protected” grazing and also enables optimum utility from the grazing lands (Western and Nightingale 2002). Following the introduction of P. juliflora to the Middle Awash area, grazing lands of different seasons have been invaded, limiting transhumance to a maximum. The limitation in transhumance has in turn resulted in overgrazing of remained pasture sources leaving pastoralists with low number of stocks. Similar problems were also reported in Kenya and India (Gavali et al. 2003; Esther and Brent 2005). As a result, the pastoralists’ resilience to environmental uncertainties is impaired by raising their ecological vulnerability (Swallow 1994; Mariara 2005).|$|R

An empirical study on 90 farms in the three agroecological areas on different social and economic indicators related to poverty gave indicators on the roles of sheep and goats in different farm types according to resource endowment (e. g. land, livestock, capital) and human resources.

The main reasons given for the reduction in <b>livestock</b> <b>assets</b> were shortage of pasture due to P. juliflora invasion (48  %) followed by recurrent drought (40  %) and disease (10.6  %). Those who mentioned drought as a major factor also said that P. juliflora invasion aggravated the rain shortage problem. According to them, before P. juliflora invasion, {{they used to have}} enough dry pastures on the field even during drought season. Besides, a disease which is locally called Armeko, characterized by twisted neck and dental disfiguration, caused by eating P. juliflora pod was accused for fueling the problem. Each household, on average, lost about 6.5 sheep/goats and 7 cattle in the past 10  years due to a complexion caused by the pod. The continual reduction of livestock asset a household experienced made it very difficult to depend on sole pastoralism driving them to look for additional means of stay.|$|E

Geographic factors such as distance to the nearest town, permanent water source, and Nairobi National Park, as well as pasture potential also matter in some cases, but relatively little compared to household-level factors. Investments in livestock remain key to how well households are doing and in some cases appear to be driving livelihood diversification strategies that keep them from falling into poverty. While relatively few households are yet receiving wildlife conservation-related income, for those that are, it is a more lucrative option than cropping, from which very few are earning positive returns.

Another contributing factor for LULC changes are the process of bush encroachment linked to rangeland degradation and fragmentation (Dalle et al. 2006; Angassa and Oba 2008 b). Bush encroachment is widespread since the last four decades with its negative effects on cattle production and pastoral communities’ livelihood (Angassa and Oba 2008 b). In the Borana rangeland, grazing resources have been owned communally and administered by the traditional institution where community leaders used to formulate bylaws about their use with respect to the spatial and temporal patterns of grazing and types of animals to be allowed to graze in a specific landscape (Oba 1998). Changes in LULC have weakened the traditional institution in resource management. As a result, the present condition of resource administration and management in terms of rangeland resource utilization is not as strong as some four decades ago. Overall, the trends in LULC changes can adversely affect rangeland resources and livelihood of the local people.|$|R
