50|$|Motor unit {{recruitment}} {{refers to}} the activation of additional motor units to accomplish an increase in contractile strength in a muscle.A motor unit consists of one motor neuron {{and all of the}} muscle fibers it stimulates. All muscles consist of a number of motor units and the fibers belonging to a motor unit are dispersed and intermingle amongst fibers of other units. The muscle fibers belonging to one motor unit can be spread throughout part, or most of the entire muscle, depending on the number of fibers and size of the muscle. When a motor neuron is activated, all of the muscle fibers innervated by the motor neuron are stimulated and contract. The activation of one motor neuron will result in a weak but distributed muscle contraction. The activation of more motor neurons will result in more muscle fibers being activated, and therefore a stronger muscle contraction. Motor unit recruitment is a measure of how many motor neurons are activated in a particular muscle, and therefore is a measure of how many muscle fibers of that muscle are activated. The higher the recruitment the stronger the muscle contraction will be. Motor units are generally recruited in order of smallest to <b>largest</b> (<b>smallest</b> motor neurons to largest motor neurons (and thus slow to fast twitch) as contraction increases.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the {{performance}} of melt models of varying complexity to simulate snowmelt under different aspect, forest cover, and input data conditions in the British Columbia interior. Observed snow water equivalent data from the 2008 melt season were used to compare the performance of a basic temperature-index (TI) model, three modified TI models, and a simple energy balance model (EBM). The <b>largest</b> (<b>smallest)</b> values of NSE (RMSE) for the snow course sites were 0. 81 (0. 0243 m) for the TI models and 0. 58 (0. 0362 m) for the EBM.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} NCAR Community Atmospheric Model {{to show the}} {{influence}} of Atlantic warm pool (AWP) variability on the summer climate and Atlantic hurricane activity. The model runs show that the climate response to the AWP’s heating extends beyond the AWP region to other regions such as the eastern North Pacific. Both the sea level pressure and precipitation display a significant response of low (high) pressure and increased (decreased) rainfall to an anomalously <b>large</b> (<b>small)</b> AWP, in areas with two centers located in the western tropical North Atlantic and in the eastern North Pacific. The rainfall response suggests that an anomalously <b>large</b> (<b>small)</b> AWP suppresses (enhances) the midsummer drought, a phe-nomenon with a diminution in rainfall during July and August in the region around Central America. In response to the pressure changes, the easterly Caribbean low-level jet is weakened (strengthened), as is its westward moisture transport. An anomalously <b>large</b> (<b>small)</b> AWP weakens (strengthens) the southerly Great Plains low-level jet, which results in reduced (enhanced) northward moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico to the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and thus decreases (increases) the summer rainfall over the central United States, in agreement with observations.
