5|$|The {{historical}} {{stance of}} the BJP towards foreign policy, like the Jana Sangh, {{was based on}} an aggressive Hindu nationalism combined with economic protectionism. The Jana Sangh was founded with the explicit aim of reversing the partition of India; as a result, its official position was that the existence of Pakistan was illegitimate. This antagonism toward Pakistan remains a significant influence on the BJP's ideology. The party and its affiliates have strongly opposed India's <b>long</b> <b>standing</b> policy of nonalignment, and instead advocate closeness to the United States.|$|E
5|$|As a {{free agent}} {{following}} the season, Iginla chose to go to Boston and signed a one-year, $6million contract with the Bruins.

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such <b>long</b> <b>standing.</b> This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed.

The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal.

5|$|The {{capture of}} Malta {{returned}} {{control of the}} central Mediterranean to Britain and was {{an important step in}} the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a <b>long</b> <b>standing</b> claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this clause of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.|$|E

Day, a McKinley associate of <b>long</b> <b>standing,</b> superseded his boss as the real power in the State Department.

Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, {{when he came to}} bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance.

5|$|Vicarage Road is a four-sided {{ground with}} a {{capacity}} of 21,977. The East Stand, part of which was constructed in 1922, was closed {{to the general public}} in 2008 for health and safety reasons, although it still hosted the dressing rooms and the matchday press area. In November 2013, the East Stand was demolished and in its place a new steel-framed, 3,500-seater stand was constructed. The stand opened fully on Boxing Day 2014 and was named The Elton John Stand after the club's <b>long</b> <b>standing</b> chairman. The Graham Taylor Stand (previously the Rous Stand), built in 1986, has two tiers and runs the length of the pitch, with the upper section containing the club's corporate hospitality. At either end of the pitch, The Vicarage Stand is split between the club's family section and away supporters, while the Rookery Stand is for home supporters only. Both stands were built in the 1990s, financed by proceeds from player sales. In the summer of 2015, The Elton John Stand was revamped in order to accommodate an extra 700 seats. This number was revised a day later to around 1,000 extra seats following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.|$|E
