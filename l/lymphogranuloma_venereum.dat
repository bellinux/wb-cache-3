50|$|Esthiomene is {{generally}} the visible result of <b>lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum,</b> lymphatic infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. This {{sexually transmitted infection}} produces inflammation of the lymphatic channels in the female genitalia, followed by abscesses, fistulae, ulcerations, and fibrosis of the tissues.

5000|$|Inguinal {{lymphadenopathy}} causes swollen {{lymph nodes}} in the groin area. It can be a symptom of infective or neoplastic processes. Infective aetiologies include Tuberculosis, HIV, non-specific or reactive lymphadenopathy to recent lower limb infection or groin infections. Another notable infectious cause is <b>Lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum,</b> which is a sexually transmitted infection of the lymphatic system. Neoplastic aetiologies include lymphoma, leukaemia and metastatic disease from primary tumours in the lower limb, external genitalia or perianal region and melanoma.|$|E
50|$|João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme {{proposed}} that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, {{helped by a}} high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by genital ulcer diseases (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, <b>lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum,</b> and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01-0.1% to 4-43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum</b> is an {{infection}} {{caused by a}} variety of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.

40|$|<b>Lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum</b> is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L 1 - 3. It {{has been found to}} be endemic in tropical countries. In the last decades several cases have been reported in Western Europe, particularly in men who have sex with men population infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The authors present three cases of <b>lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum</b> infections, observed at their department in 2013 and 2014. The three human immunodeficiency virus infected patients who belonged to men who have sex with men population had casual sexual contacts in Western Europe. The symptoms included urethral discharge, discomfort and inguinal lymphadenomegaly in two patients, and rectal pain, discharge and perianal ulceration in one patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by nucleic acid amplification test performed in samples obtained from urethral discharge and exudate of perianal ulcer; <b>lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum</b> 2 b serovars were demonstrated in two patients and serovar 2 in one patient. Doxycyclin (daily dose of two times 100 mg for 21 days) resolved the symptoms in all cases. The authors conclude that <b>lymphogranuloma</b> <b>venereum</b> is a diagnostic challenge in Hungary, too.
