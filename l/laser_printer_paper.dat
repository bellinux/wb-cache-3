40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{exposure}} of paper samples to UV rays was monitored {{through the use of}} ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical tools. Three types of paper were used in this study: common <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> <b>paper,</b> sheets from a newspaper and sheets of light-sensitive fax paper. The samples were previously characterised through ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy to describe the natural experimental variability. Then, they were exposed to UV light for a total of 30 hours: the exposure effects were monitored through the same spectroscopic technique. Finally, multivariate statistical tools were applied to the final dataset, coupled to the construction of multivariate control charts, to identify the effects played by UV light on the samples surface...|$|E

40|$|While the {{emission}} rate of ultrafine particles has been measured and quantified, {{there is very}} little information on {{the emission}} rates of ions and charged particles from <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes a methodology that can be adopted for measuring the surface charge density on printed paper and the ion and charged particle emissions during operation of a high-emitting <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> and shows how emission rates of ultrafine particles, ions and charged particles may be quantified using a controlled experiment within a closed chamber...|$|R
40|$|A large {{fraction}} of the scientific papers available on the Internet have been created by TEX and dvips. Most of these papers use Computer Modern fonts at 300 dpi, and thus neither preview well with a typical screen resolution of less than 100 dpi, nor {{take advantage of the}} higher resolution of current <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> This <b>paper</b> presents T 1 part, a set of subroutines that decompose Type 1 PostScript fonts, including only those characters needed in a particular document. This package, in conjunction with a high-quality freely available set of Computer Modern fonts, can provide for the distribution of compact PostScript files that preview legibly and print beautifully. In addition, this package allows the printing of much more complex documents using more fonts than have previously been available in dvips. The T 1 part subroutines are modular and can be easily incorporated into other drivers...|$|R
50|$|In 1984, {{the company}} changed {{direction}} to make peripherals for Macintosh computers: the HyperDrive (the Mac's first internal hard drive), the WideWriter 360 large format inkjet printer, and the Personal <b>Laser</b> <b>Printer</b> (the first QuickDraw <b>laser</b> <b>printer).</b> Presently the company focuses exclusively on <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|LaserJet as a {{brand name}} {{identifies}} the line of dry electrophotographic (DEP) <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> marketed by the American computer company Hewlett-Packard (HP). The HP LaserJet was the world's first desktop <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> As of 2016, Canon supplies both mechanisms and cartridges for all HP's <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} inkjet, copier and <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> toners have been {{developed}} to utilize this process. This is the process developed at BlackLightning by Walter Jeffries in the 1980s for negatively charged <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> toners for use in black and white <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> like those from Apple, HP, Xerox, Canon and other vendors.|$|R
50|$|An {{in depth}} {{comparison}} of inkjet and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> suggest that <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are the ideal {{choice for a}} high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers {{tend to focus on}} large-format printers and household units. <b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> offer more precise edging and in-depth mono-chromatic color, but tend to cost more than a traditional inkjet printer.|$|R
50|$|Dataproducts later used Fuji Xerox engines {{for their}} Typhoon series of <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> The LZR1560/1580 was OEMed as the Apple LaserWriter Pro 810 in 1993. In 1998, the LZR 5200 {{continuous}} feed <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> was announced.|$|R
50|$|Although corona {{discharge}} is usually undesirable, until recently {{it was essential}} {{in the operation of}} photocopiers (xerography) and <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> Many modern copiers and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> now charge the photoconductor drum with an electrically conductive roller, reducing undesirable indoor ozone pollution.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>printer</b> speed {{can vary}} widely, and depends on many factors, {{including}} the graphic {{intensity of the}} job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.|$|R
40|$|Color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> have fast {{printing}} {{speed and}} high resolution, and forgeries using color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> can cause significant harm to society. A source printer identification technique {{can be employed}} as a countermeasure to those forgeries. This paper presents a color <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> identification method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods. Experiments are performed on eight color <b>laser</b> <b>printers,</b> and the performance is compared with several existing methods. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms existing source color <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> identification methods.

30|$|The {{character}} contour roughness of a <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> {{is expected}} to be less than that of an inkjet printer because character contours originated from <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are smoother. This feature describes the degree of character contour roughness between the two printing techniques.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> {{combine the}} best {{features}} of both printers and plotters. Like plotters, <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, {{they are able}} to generate pages of text and raster graphics. Unlike either printers or plotters, however, a <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page. PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics, by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.|$|R

50|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> rapidly {{produces}} {{high quality}} text and graphics. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction <b>printers</b> (MFPs), <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> employ a xerographic printing process but differ from analog photocopiers {{in that the}} image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer's photoreceptor.|$|R

After personal computers became more widespread, the first <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> intended for a mass market was the HP LaserJet 8ppm, released in 1984, using a Canon engine controlled by HP software.

50|$|The first <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> {{was invented}} by Xerox PARC in the 1970s. <b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> were {{introduced}} for the office and then home markets in subsequent years by IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and others.

50|$|Some {{printers}} use a {{very thin}} flexible metal foil roller, so there is less thermal mass to be heated and the fuser can more quickly reach operating temperature. If paper moves through the fuser more slowly, there is more roller contact time for the toner to melt, and the fuser can operate at a lower temperature. Smaller, inexpensive <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> typically print slowly, due to this energy-saving design, compared to large high speed <b>printers</b> where <b>paper</b> moves more rapidly through a high-temperature fuser with a very short contact time.|$|R
