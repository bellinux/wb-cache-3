5000|$|Hyperalonia morio is a <b>large</b> <b>bee</b> <b>fly</b> with a bluish {{black body}} and a yellow head. Wings are dark bluish, with hyaline areas.|$|E
50|$|This genus {{contains}} the <b>largest</b> <b>bee</b> <b>flies,</b> of about 14 mm, sometimes larger, up to 22 mm, {{though a few}} species are as small as 6 mm. The proboscis is short. The head is large and only loosely attached to the thorax. The antenna are small and well separated. Wings are large, with wingspan 40 mm, up to 64 mm in the largest species, nearly always boldly patterned; abdomen patterned (often banded) with white or pale scales on segment 6 and 7 or on each segment. Many species are sexually dimorphic.|$|R

50|$|Poecilanthrax willistoni, Williston's <b>bee</b> <b>fly</b> or {{sand dune}} <b>bee</b> <b>fly,</b> {{is a member}} of the Bombyliidae insect family. This family {{includes}} the <b>bee</b> <b>flies,</b> true flies that have developed Batesian mimicry characteristics to avoid predators. That is, they look like bees because that helps them avoid bee-wary predators, but they lack stingers.|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} role of corolla shape {{has been}} often asserted without an empirical demonstration of how natural selection acts on this trait. In generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated selection on corolla shape {{is even more}} difficult. In this study, we explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (<b>large</b> <b>bees,</b> small <b>bees</b> and <b>bee</b> <b>flies)</b> discriminate between different corolla shapes when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow petals, whereas <b>bee</b> <b>flies</b> prefer flowers with rounded overlapping petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the populations where <b>large</b> or small <b>bees</b> are the most abundant pollinator groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without specialization...|$|R
50|$|P. willistoni {{also has}} larvae {{that act as}} parasitoids on other insect species. They drop their eggs {{strategically}} {{so that when the}} larvae emerge they can easily locate and consume grubs and caterpillars. The <b>bee</b> <b>fly</b> sometimes propels its eggs into holes where beetles live, and when the <b>bee</b> <b>fly's</b> eggs hatch, the larvae attack and eat the beetles' offspring. This species of <b>bee</b> <b>fly</b> lives on sand dunes, and so parasitizes sand dune insect species.|$|R

Willi Hennig(1973) placed the <b>bee</b> <b>flies</b> in the superfamily of Nemestrinoidea, {{on the basis of}} analogies in the behaviour of the larvae, positioning the superfamily in Tabanomorpha inside the infraorder HomoeodactylaBoris Borisovitsch Rohdendorf (1974) dealt with the family in a separate superfamily (Bombyliidea), linking it to the superfamily of Asilidea. Currently the close correlation either positions the bee-flies within the superfamily Asiloidea sensu Rohdendorf (Asilidea)or they are included with the families separated by Rohdendorf in the superfamily of Asiloidea.|$|R
