40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of several prokinetic drugs on dyspeptic symptoms and on gastric emptying rates are well-established {{in patients with}} functional dyspepsia, but formal studies comparing different prokinetic drugs are lacking. Aim: To compare the effects of chronic oral administration of cisapride and <b>levosulpiride</b> in patients with functional dyspepsia and delayed gastric emptying. Methods: In a double-blind crossover comparison, {{the effects of a}} 4 -week administration of <b>levosulpiride</b> (25 mg t. d. s.) and cisapride (10 mg t. d. s.) on the gastric emptying rate and on symptoms were evaluated in 30 dyspeptic patients with functional gastroparesis. At the beginning of the study and after <b>levosulpiride</b> or cisapride treatment, the gastric emptying time of a standard meal was measured by C- 13 -octanoic acid breath test. Gastrointestinal symptom scores were also evaluated. Results: The {{efficacy of}} <b>levosulpiride</b> was similar to that of cisapride in significantly shortening (P < 0. 001) the t(1 / 2) of gastric emptying. No significant differences were observed between the two treatments with regards to improvements in total symptom scores. However, <b>levosulpiride</b> was significantly more effective (P < 0. 01) than cisapride in improving the impact of symptoms on the patients' every-day activities and in improving individual symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and early postprandial satiety.

40|$|<b>Levosulpiride</b> is the {{levorotatory}} enantiomer of sulpiride used in dyspeptic syndromes {{of various}} etiologies. The prokinetic effect of <b>levosulpiride</b> is mediated through the blockade of enteric inhibitory dopaminergic type 2 (D 2) receptors. The antagonism of central D 2 receptors leads to both therapeutic (e. g. antiemetic effect due to D 2 receptor blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone) and adverse (including hyperprolactinemia) effects. Dopamine {{is the main}} endogenous inhibitor of prolactin synthesis and secretion in the anterior pituitary. <b>Levosulpiride</b> causes significant elevation of serum prolactin levels in significant number of patients. The resultant hyperprolactinemia often manifests as distressing menstrual abnormalities and galactorrhoea in females. A significant number of patients who use <b>levosulpiride</b> develop serum prolactin levels of > 200 ng/mL that goes against the classical textbook teaching where pituitary tumor {{is supposed to be}} the mostly likely cause.

40|$|Various {{hypothesis}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the properties of atypical as compared to classical antipsychotics (APDs) : blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors, high dissociation rate of drug - D 2 receptor complex, mesolimbic selectivity, etc. We hypothesized that the atypical properties of different classes of APDs {{are the result of}} different mechanisms not only pharmacodynamic but also pharmacokinetic in nature. In order to test this hypothesis, we first studied by in vivo microdialysis the effects of various APDs on the extracellular dopamine (DA) in different areas of the rat brain: the prefrontal cortex (PFCX), the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and the NAc core. We administered different doses of haloperidol, clozapine, raclopride, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine amisulpride and <b>levosulpiride.</b> All the typical and atypical APDs tested significantly and dose dependently increased extracellular DA output in dialysates from the NAc shell, but after atypical APDs the increase was preferential or depending on the drug selective in the NAc shell as compared to the NAc core. All atypical APDs, except the benzamides raclopride, amisulpride and <b>levosulpiride,</b> increase DA output in dialysates from the PFCX. The benzamides also showed major differences in the time-course of the effects: while raclopride produced a sharp but short lasting increase of DA, <b>levosulpiride</b> and amisulpride elicited long lasting increase, producing the latter a slower effect. These observations suggest that different mechanisms might underlie the atypical properties of ADPs. Among drugs with rapid penetration into the brain compartments, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine and raclopride, atypical properties, {{as in the case of}} clozapine and quetiapine, critically depend from rapid D 2 receptor dissociation. Conversely, among drugs with slow D 2 receptor dissociation, as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, raclopride, amisulpride and <b>levosulpiride,</b> atypical properties depend from slow penetration of the blood brain barrier. Within this frame, blockade of 5 -HT 2 A receptors may be important for atypical aspect unrelated to extrapiramidal side effects and to clinical positive symptoms. Moreover, in order to evaluate the effects on motor behavior, we tested the antipsychotics in an animal model for motor coordination disturbances. Thus, we administered drugs to rats trained on a rotarod (8, 12, 16 rpm) and evaluated the latency to fall. No differences in vehicle, clozapine or amisulpride treated rats were observed whereas haloperidol and raclopride elicited significant deficits after all rpm and doses tested. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{relationship}} between symptom improvement (SI) and acceleration of gastric emptying (GE) for different drugs {{used in the}} treatment of idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis is uncertain. In this paper we examined the study-specific correlations between SI and GE, and we performed a meta-regression analysis of the association across multiple studies. METHODS: The MEDLINE database (1, 946 to present) was searched, and only controlled trials or trials with an established effective comparator that compared both SI and GE were included. RESULTS: Studies were identified for metoclopramide (n= 6), domperidone (n= 6), cisapride (n= 14), erythromycin (n= 3), botulinum toxin (n= 2), and <b>levosulpiride</b> (n= 3). Even though most drugs concomitantly improved symptoms and accelerated GE, no study reported a significant correlation between SI and GE. Moreover, a correlation analysis over all studies using meta-regression did not show a significant {{relationship between}} SI and GE. Our findings need to be qualified by inconsistencies in study methods, which is a limitation but also suggests that our findings are robust to methodological factors. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, no evidence of a relationship between SI and GE was identified for different drugs used for the treatment of gastroparesis. This finding questions the use of GE measurement to direct drug development for gastroparesis. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Gastroparesis is an {{important}} clinical disorder characterised by delayed gastric emptying {{in the absence of}} mechanical outlet obstruction. Idiopathic, diabetes and postsurgical causes represent the most common aetiologies. The condition commonly manifests as upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, early satiety, abdominal pain and bloating. AREAS COVERED: This paper provides a review of the prevalence, pathophysiology and clinical features associated with gastroparesis, with a particular focus on current pharmacological management options and novel and emerging therapies. A literature search was undertaken using the search terms: gastroparesis, diabetic gastroparesis, idiopathic gastroparesis, gastric emptying, prokinetic, metoclopramide, domperidone, erythromycin, motilin, alemcinal, KC 11458, mitemcinal, ghrelin, TZP- 101, TZP- 102, RM- 131, tegaserod, prucalopride, naronapride, velusetrag, <b>levosulpiride,</b> itopride, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, Enterra. EXPERT OPINION: Strategies for the management of gastroparesis include correction of malnutrition, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, relief of symptoms by appropriate use of prokinetic and antiemetic agents and, in patients with gastroparesis associated with diabetes or critical illness-induced hyperglycaemia, optimisation of glycaemic control. Conventional prokinetic agents form the mainstay of treatment. While novel pharmacotherapies are in development, compelling evidence for their efficacy, particularly in symptom relief, remains to be established.

40|$|Background. To test two {{different}} antiemetic regimens for preventing nausea and vomiting {{in patients with}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) undergoing systemic chemotherapy (CT) with ProMECE-CytaBOM (P-C). Patients and Methods. Twenty consecutive untreated adult outpatients with histologically confirmed NHL and scheduled to receive P-C chemotherapy were registered in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study to compare the antiemetic efficacy of a <b>levosulpiride</b> (LS) -based and metoclopramide (MTC) -based regimen. Results. Complete protection from vomiting was recorded in 93 % (62 / 67) of courses with the LS-regimen and in 89 % (62 / 70) with the MTC-regimen (p = 0. 428). No nausea was observed in 84 % (56 / 67) of courses with the LS-regimen and in 74 % (52 / 70) with the MTC-regimen (p = 0. 183). No differences in prevention of emesis were recorded when patients crossed to the other regimen. Both regimens were well tolerated; however, on day 8 of chemotherapy, when both antiemetic regimens were administered at a higher dose, the LS-based combination showed significantly lower toxicity (p = 0. 035). Conclusions. ProMECE-CytaBOM-induced emesis can be prevented in most cases with appropriate, specifically designed antiemetic therapy. Both the LS- and MTC-based combinations resulted in {{a high percentage of}} complete protection from emesis, but the higher incidence of side effects observed with MTC makes the LS-based regimen preferable for patients receiving P-C chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} prokinetic drugs on electrogastrography (EGG) parameters according to symptomatic changes in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: Seventy-four patients with FD were prospectively enrolled in this study between December 2006 and December 2010. We surveyed the patients using a questionnaire on dyspeptic symptoms before and after an 8 -wk course of prokinetic drug treatment. We also measured cutaneous pre-prandial and post-prandial EGG recordings including percentage of gastric waves (normogastria, bradygastria, tachygastria), dominant frequency (DF), dominant power (DP), dominant frequency instability coefficient (DFIC), dominant power instability coefficient (DPIC), and the ratio of post-prandial to fasting in DP {{before and after the}} 8 -wk course of prokinetic drug treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (70 %) achieved symptomatic improvement after prokinetic drug treatment. Patients who had normal gastric slow waves showed symptom improvement group after treatment. Post-prandial DF showed a downward trend in the symptom improvement group, especially in the itopride group. Post-prandial DP was increased regardless of symptom improvement, especially in the itopride group and mosapride group. Post-prandial DFIC and DPIC in the symptom improvement group were significantly increased after the treatment. The EGG power ratio was increased after treatment in the symptom improvement group (0. 50 1; 0. 70 vs 0. 93 1; 1. 77, P = 0. 002), especially in the itopride and <b>levosulpiride</b> groups.

40|$|The prolactin/vasoinhibin axis defines an {{endocrine}} system, {{in which}} prolactin (PRL) and vasoinhibins regulate blood vessel growth and function, the secretion of other hormones, inflammatory and immune processes, coagulation, and behavior. The core {{element of the}} PRL/vasoinhibin axis is the generation of vasoinhibins, which consists in the proteolytic cleavage of their precursor molecule PRL. Vasoinhibins can interact with multiple different partners to mediate their effects in various tissues and anatomical compartments, indicating their pleiotropic nature. Based on accumulating knowledge about the PRL/vasoinhibin axis, two clinical trials were initiated, in which vasoinhibin levels are the target of therapeutic interventions. One trial investigates the effect of <b>levosulpiride,</b> a selective dopamine D 2 -receptor antagonist, on retinal alterations in patients with diabetic macular edema and retinopathy. The rationale of this trial is that the levosulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia resulting in increased retinal vasoinhibins could lead to beneficiary outcomes {{in terms of a}} vasoinhibin-mediated antagonization of diabetes-induced retinal alterations. Another trial investigated the effect of bromocriptine, a dopamine D 2 -receptor agonist, for the treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy. The rationale of treatment with bromocriptine is the inhibition of vasoinhibin generation by substrate depletion to prevent detrimental effects on the myocardial microvascularization. The trial demonstrated that bromocriptine treatment was associated with a high rate of left ventricular recovery and low morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic interventions into the PRL/vasoinhibin axis bear the risk of side effects in the areas of blood coagulation, blood pressure, and alterations of the mental state...|$|E
40|$|We studied 60 {{patients}} receiving a 1 -year course of interferon (IFN) -alpha therapy for chronic viral hepatitis. Patients underwent psychiatric assessment before starting the IFN-alpha therapy, and monthly throughout the therapy, using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R, the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Spielberg State and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Five patients had a baseline diagnosis of major depression and 18 (30 %) developed an IFN-alpha-induced psychiatric adverse effect; 12 of these 23 patients received psychopharmacological treatment (patients and clinicians jointly decided {{the need for}} treatment). Two of the five patients with baseline depression started an antidepressant treatment (paroxetine) together with the IFN-alpha and successfully completed the IFN-alpha therapy. Ten patients received treatment for the IFN-alpha-induced psychiatric adverse effects (depression in five patients, anxiety in two patients, severe irritability in two patients and insomnia in one patient). Depression was treated with paroxetine, amisulpride or levosulpiride; anxiety and insomnia were treated with benzodiazepines; and irritability was treated with thioridazine. Individual response to medications was measured with the Clinical Global Impression scale. Of the patients with IFN-alpha-induced depression, two received paroxetine (one showed a good response), two received amisulpride (one showed a good response) and one {{did not respond to}} <b>levosulpiride</b> but responded to paroxetine.

40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or <b>levosulpiride</b> or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
