A SSL system is composed of a <b>LED</b> <b>engine</b> with micro-electronic driver(s) that supplies power to the optic design. Knowledge of system level reliability {{is not only a}} challenging scientific exercise but it is also crucial for successful adoption of future SSL systems. Currently, the lifetime of a SSL system provided by the manufacturers is often based on just the life time of the LED emitter but a malfunction of the system in reality is often induced by the failure or degradation of a combination of subsystems/interfaces. Hence, a significant improvement in the future SSL system can be achieved when the system level reliability is well understood by proper experimental and simulation techniques...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{properties}} {{and application of}} di-methyl ether (DME) as a candidate fuel for compression-ignition engines. DME is produced by the conversion of various feedstock such as natural gas, coal, oil residues and bio-mass. To determine the technical feasibility of DME, the review compares its key properties with those of diesel fuel {{that are relevant to}} this application. DME’s diesel engine-compatible properties are its high cetane number and low auto-ignition temperature. In addition, its simple chemical structure and high oxygen content result in soot-free combustion in engines. Fuel injection of DME can be achieved through both conventional mechanical and current common-rail systems but requires slight modification of the standard system to prevent corrosion and overcome low lubricity. The spray characteristics of DME enable its application to compression-ignition engines despite some differences in its properties such as easier evaporation and lower density. Overall, the low particulate matter production of DME provides adequate justification for its consideration as a candidate fuel in compression-ignition engines. Recent research and development shows comparable output performance to a diesel fuel <b>led</b> <b>engine</b> but with lower particulate emissions. NOx emissions from DME-fuelled engines can meet future regulations with high exhaust gas recirculation in combination with a lean NOx trap. Although more development work has focused on medium or heavy-duty engines, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the technical feasibility of DME as a candidate fuel for environmentally-friendly compression-ignition engines independent of size or application...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{degradation}} and failure mechanisms of organic {{materials in the}} optical part of LED-based products are studied. The main causes of discoloration of substrate/lens in remote phosphor of LED-based products are also comprehensively investigated. Solid State Lighting (SSL) technology is a new technology based on light emitting diodes as light sources. This technology, due to its several exceptional characteristics such as lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, and higher design flexibility {{with respect to the}} conventional lighting technology, has become very attractive to both manufacturers and consumers. It is applied in a variety of applications such as general lighting for in-door and out-door applications, and for automotive. Reliability in the highly demanding and fast growing SSL market is a key challenge, which requires special attention. A SSL system is typically composed of an <b>LED</b> <b>engine</b> with an electronic driver(s), integrated in a housing that also provides optical functions, thermal management, sensing and/or other functions. Knowledge of (system) reliability is crucial for not only the business success of today!s SSL products and applications, but also to gain deeper scientific understanding which will enable improved product and application design in the future. A malfunction of the system may be induced by the failure and/or degradation of any subsystem or interface. A comprehensive and in-depth understanding of failure and degradation behaviors of different SSL system components would obviously result in a more effective and reliable design as well as a proper selection of materials and anufacturing techniques. Package-related failure mechanisms. that result in an optical degradation, colour change, and severe discoloration of the encapsulant are listed as carbonization of the encapsulant, encapsulant yellowing, and phosphor thermal quenching. Among different materials used as an encapsulant or substrate for the phosphor in remote phosphor design, PolyCarbonate (BPA-PC) is chosen in this research. In order to study the main reason(s) of discoloration and consequently to define lifetime, a series of experiments are performed under different external stresses (temperature range of 100 to 140 ºC and radiation of blue light with 450 nm wavelength). A highly accelerated test set-up was designed to control these stresses and monitor light output of the system at the same time. Evaluating and analyzing of chemical and optical characteristics of samples during ageing in this specially designed highly accelerated test set-up are performed using a wide range of techniques including UV-Vis, FTIR-ATR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lambda spectroscopy and Integrated Sphere. The results show that increasing the thermal ageing time leads to yellowing, loss of optical properties, and decrease of the light transmission of the relative radiant power value of both pure and commercial BPA-PC plates. Thermally induced oxidation reactions of BPA-PC are found to be the major reason of the yellowing and discoloration. The major effect of light intensity in remote phosphor is believed to be increasing the temperature of the phosphor, and therefore enhancing the kinetics of thermal ageing. Photo-fries products are found in photo-thermally aged BPA-PC plates, aged under blue light radiation at elevated temperature of 140 ºC, and believed to have a contribution to the discoloration. The XPS analyses of aged samples confirm that discoloration is associated with surface oxidation. A significant increase in the signal ratio O 1 s /C 1 s in the XPS spectra of degraded specimens is observed. During thermal ageing, the C-H concentration decreases and new oxide features C=O and O-C=O form, with the latter being a support for oxidation at the surface being a major reaction during discoloration. Results also show that irradiation with blue light during thermal ageing accelerates the kinetics of discoloration and the increases O 1 s /C 1 s ratio in XPS spectra. The accelerated optical degradation and reliability of two different commercial BPA-PC plates under elevated temperature stress are studied as well. The reliability model, explained in this thesis, is indeed a useful framework to incorporate kinetics of (photo) -thermal ageing of BPA-PC and YAG:Ce phosphor into the life-time prediction models. It is shown that increasing the exposure time leads to degradation of BPA-PC optical properties, i. e. decrease of light transmission and increase in the yellowing index (YI). By increasing the temperature, the rate increases, meaning that lumen depreciation takes place at shorter time. The reaction rate follows the Arrhenius acceleration law. The thermal stability and life time of remote phosphor lens plates are also studied. The photometric properties of thermally-aged plates, monitored during the stress thermal ageing tests, show a significant change both in the correlated color temperature (CCT) and in the chromaticity coordinates (CIE x,y). It is also observed that there is a significant decay both in the phosphor yellow emission and in the blue peak intensity, with yellow emission being more affected, inferring that the main reason for the optical degradation of thermally-aged BPA-PC plates could be ascribed to yellow conversion of blue light. As final conclusions, among different existing stresses including light intensity, humidity and heat, thermal stress has a more pronounced influence on the ageing of encapsulants in optical parts in LED-based products. Also it is shown that the rate of lumen depreciation is highly dependent on temperature; the higher the temperature the faster the kinetics of color shifting and lumen depreciation is. The effect of light intensity is increasing the temperature in phosphor plates. Reliability of optical components in LED-based products can be well described by the Arrhenius equation and generalized Eyeing equation. Coating the BPA-PC by a graphene monolayer can significantly enhance the optical properties and stability of BPA-PC, used as substrate in remote phosphor plates. Graphene decreases the oxidation kinetics of BPA-PC and acts as a barrier for moisture and oxygen diffusion. DIMESElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} for power {{generation}} and propulsion applications have traditionally used diffusion-flame combustors {{because of their}} reliable performance and reasonable stability characteristics. Unfortunately, this type of combustor usually produces unacceptably high levels of thermal NOx. The increasingly strict regulation for pollutant emissions has recently <b>led</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturers to develop combustors that meet various regulatory requirements. New concepts for combustion technology have been introduced to the Gas Turbine industry, including lean-premixed combustion. Lean-premixed combustion {{appears to be the}} most promising technology for practical systems at the present time. In lean-premixed combustion, the fuel and air are premixed upstream of the combustor to avoid the formation of stoichiometric regions. The combustion zone is operated with excess air to reduce the flame temperature; consequently, thermal NOx is virtually eliminated. Unsteady flow oscillations, also referred to as combustion instability, however, have emerged as a common problem, and hindered the development of lean-premixed combustors. These oscillations may reach sufficient amplitudes to interfere with engine operation, and in extreme cases, lead to failure of the system due to excessive structural vibration and heat transfer to the chamber. The associated pressure oscillations and possibly enhanced heat transfer can lead to a deterioration in the system performance, and may be sufficiently intense to cause structural damage. Combustion instability remains a critical issue limiting the development of low-emission, leanpremixed Gas Turbine combustion systems. Combustion oscillations are not limited to gas turbine engines. They have been observed in the development of virtually all propulsion systems, including liquid rocket engines. The system usually operates near the lean blowout limit, then a small perturbation in the equivalence ratio may produce a significant variation in heat release, which, if it resonates with the chamber acoustic wave, can result in large excursions of combustion oscillations. The phenomenon may be defined as the unsteady motions in a dynamic system capable of sustaining large oscillations over a broad range of frequencies. The work is organized in two parts: an extensive bibliographic review of combustion instabilities and the motivation of this work in part 1; and the study about a new diagnostic methodology for thermoacoustic instabilities detection and future control in part 2. The part 1 is important because of lack of books that describe clearly and exhaustively the complex phenomenology of thermoacoustic instabilities, however the experts of thermoacoustic instabilities can skip directly from it to part 2 where is possible to find the improvements with respect to the state of the art. The part 1 is organized into five chapters. The chapter 1 gives a general background about modern Gas Turbine engine and shows the need of new sensors for measurements systems. The chapter 2 explains the characteristic of combustion noise, investigates the mechanisms driving combustion instabilities, the causes of instabilities and damping processes, and then provides a comprehensive review of the advances made in thermo-acoustic instabilities. The physics of combustion oscillations, most commonly caused by a coupling between acoustic waves and unsteady heat release, are discussed, and the concept of using feedback control to interrupt these interactions is introduced. The chapter 3 provides a survey of recent progress in passive and active control of combustion instabilities. The objective is to optimize combustor operations, monitor the process and alleviate instabilities and their severe consequences. It contains a review of some facets of combustion and focuses on the sensors that take or could take part to combustion control solutions. The chapter 4 provides a critical review of analytical and numerical models and criteria forcombustion instability. The chapter 5 shows an application of instability control to real heavy duty Gas Turbine of Vx 4. 3 A Siemens-Ansaldo. It shows the final purpose of the studies about thermoacoustic instability and one of the industrial fields where the new technique ODC proposed here could be easily applied. The part 2 is organized into three chapters. The chapter 6 explains the conventional optical techniques for concentration of chemical species, velocity measurements and temperatures, and then it gives a theoretical approach for thermal emission of flames. The chapter 7 proposes a new diagnostic technique named ODC (Optical Diagnostics of Combustion) developed and patented in ENEA and it shows an experimental approach for radiative emission of flames. Radiant energy spectra have the same dynamics of Turbulence (macroscale, inertial and dissipative ranges; slope= - 5 / 3) and reveal Chemical Kinetics high frequency effects. The chapter also explains why Radiant Energy shows Turbulence dynamics. The chapter 8 shows the results and gives an experimental proof that real-time information of combustion instabilities and mean velocity component can be performed by analyzing Radiant Energy captured by means of photo-diodes (ODC). It investigates the use of flame Radiant Energy signal: due to its relation with both Turbulence and Chemical Kinetics, it may reveal the state of a flame and the eventual instability precursor events. It shows experimental analysis of turbulent premixed combustion by means of ODC to laboratory and industrial burners. A collection of radiative emissions by several flames is analyzed in this chapter. Such flames have been obtained in a number of burners in a large range thermal power (i. e., 3 kWt- 1 MWt), either premixed or not, fed with different fuels (i. e., methane, hydrogen, oil) and with different physical states (i. e., gas and liquid fuel), while radiative emission is collected by means of a photo-diode. The purpose of this chapter is to show that the usefulness of measurements of Radiant Energy emission from flames can be enhanced by focusing on a spatially limited region, by means of the auto-correlation and cross-correlation of signals from two points. Finally it shows the fulfilment of a test facility for real burner in ENEA Research Center, i. e., COMET-HP (COMbustion Experimental Tests in High Pressure), 1 MWt premixed CH 4 /Air and gives several experimental tests. Concluding, a new optical instrument based on photo-diodes, called ODC, has been applied for thermoacoustic instability analysis. ODC provides information at very low cost and in real time about turbulent and chemical scales. Lastly five attachments conclude the PhD thesis. The attachment A shows Lighthill’s theory and acoustic analogy whereby the governing equations of motion of the fluid are coerced into a form reminiscent of the wave equation of “classical” (i. e. linear) acoustics. The attachment B provides a brief explanation of random signals, e. g. random vibrations, and spectra analysis, according to which a periodic function can be broken down into its harmonic components. The attachment C presents an analytical treatment of acoustic signals. The attachment D gives a theoretical approach for thermodynamic equations. Turbulent combustion is a multi-scale problem where complexity lies in the interaction between fluid dynamics and chemistry. This attachment provides a theoretical understanding of some of the scale physics in turbulent reacting flows. The attachment E provides laws for thermal radiation. At high temperatures thermal radiation is the main mode of heat transfer...|$|E

Electronics driven at high currents may experience local hot spots, which may cause thermal degradation or even catastrophic failures. This common problem occurs at light-emitting diode (LED) chips and it is not easily observed by end-users. Driving over 700 [*]mA over a 1 mm 2 chip is expected to generate local temperature gradients. In addition, bonding failures at manufacturing or during operation (cracks, delamination, etc.) may also lead to local hot spots.
