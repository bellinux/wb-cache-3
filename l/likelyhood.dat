40|$|Biogenetically {{unrelated}} cyclic guanidine alkaloids and pyrroloquinoline alkaloids {{have been}} reported from sponges assigned to the genus Batzella. These sponges have been assigned to this genus because of their possession of a simple complement of thin strongyles in irregular plumoreticulate arrangement. Cyclic guanidine alkaloids were first reported from an alleged axinellid species from the Caribbean, Ptilocaulis aff. P. spiculifer, and subsequently from a second Carribean specimen identified as Ptilocaulis spiculifer {{and at the same}} time from a Red Sea poecilosclerid, Hemimycale sp. Closely related compounds were described from a Caribbean specimen identified as Batzella sp. and also from the poecilosclerids Crambe crambe (Mediterranean) and Monanchora arbuscula (Brazil). Isobatzellins (pyrroloquinoline alkaloids) were reported from a black deep-water species from the Bahamas identified as Batzella sp. Chemically related pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were found in Pacific representatives of the fistular poecilosclerid genus Zyzzya, the hadromerid genus Latrunculia and the ?haplosclerid genus Prianos. Most of the voucher specimens involved in this puzzle were re-examined and several conclusions can be drawn: when inspected closely it appears, that the cyclic guanidine alkaloids are produced by sponges containing anisostrongyles, often in two categories, a thicker and a thinner one. Monanchora arbuscula, which has been recently discovered to produce these compounds, has monactinal spicules differentiated into a thinner subtylostyle and a thicker (tylo-) style, but many specimens have anisostrongylote modifications. Microscleres in Monanchora can be absent or very rare. By association, all the sponges from which cyclic guanidine alkaloids are known may be united in one family, possibly in a single wider defined genus Monanchora. However, further relationships with Crambe need to be studied. Both have cyclic guanidine alkaloids, both have megascleres of very variable shapes and thickness, differentiated mostly into two overlapping categories, microscleres and other additional spicules are often rare or absent. Relationships with the type of Hemimycale, viz. H. columella remain obscure, but in view of the much larger spicules of that species and the intricate ectosomal specialization (lacking in the above mentioned specimens) it is possible that similarities between the Red Sea Hemimycale and the European species are the product of parallel evolution. The strongyles of sponges producing pyrroloquinoline alkaloids are perfect isostrongyles and in the ectosome these are arranged in a definite ectosomal tangential crust. A good proportion of these strongyles have a faint spination on the apices. Assignment of these sponges to Batzella rest on the properties of its type species Batzella inops. Examination of a type spicule slide of that species did not solve that question, but until further notice Batzella may be used for the deep-water material. A further unsolved problem that remains is the phylogenetic relationships of Batzella with Zyzzya and Latrunculia. The <b>likelyhoods</b> of possible causes for this distribution of compounds are discussed...|$|R

This night, both {{strange and}} differing {{noise from the}} former first wakened Captain Hart, who lodged in the bed-chamber, who, hearing Roe and Brown to groan, called out to Cockaine and Crook to come and help them, for Hart could not now stir himself; Cockaine would faine have answered, but he could not, or look about; something, he thought, stopt both his breath and held down his eye-lids. Amazed thus, he struggles and kickt about, till he had awaked Captain Crook, who, half asleep, grew very angry at his kicks, and multiplied words, it grew to an {{appointment}} in the field; but this fully recovered Cockaine to remember that Captain Hart had called for help, wherefore to them he ran in the other room, whom he found sadly groaning, where, scraping in the chimney, he both found a candle and fire to light it; but had not gone two steps, when something blew the candle out, and threw him in the chair by the bedside, when presently cried out Captain Carelesse, with a most pitiful voice, [...] "Come hither, O come hither, brother Cockaine, the thing's gone of me." [...] Cockaine, scarce yet himself, helpt to set him up in his bed, and after Captain Hart, and having scarce done that to them, and also to the other two, they heard Captain Crook crying out, as if something had been killing him. Cockaine snacht up the sword that lay by their bed, {{and ran into the}} room to save Crook, but was in much more <b>likelyhood</b> to kill him, for at his coming, the thing that pressed Crook went of him, at which Crook started out of his bed, whom Cockaine thought a spirit made at him, at which Crook cried out [...] "Lord help, Lord save me;" [...] Cockaine let fall his hand, and Crook, embracing Cockaine, desired his reconcilement, giving him many thanks for his deliverance.

60|$|The Wars of Ireland {{being at}} an End, and the Articles of Limerick Sign'd, about 15000 regular Troops were Transported into France, besides several Thousands of others, who all proved as {{useful to the}} Monarch of France in his Wars in Italy, Spain, Germany, &c. {{as they had been}} in making a Three Years Diversion in Ireland, so happy was France in making a Politick use of King James's Misfortune, that Lewis XIV was much a greater Gainer by his being Banish'd, than if he had remain'd in the quiet Possession of his Throne. And now there were several Speculations, what Method the French King wou'd take to make the World believe he had a Design to {{reinstall}} King James. The most direct Means was to attempt a Descent, but this was impracticable by the way of Ireland; for if an Army of 30000 Men cou'd not keep it when they were actually in Possession of it, there was no <b>likelyhood</b> of their succeeding in a Descent, nor was it probable, that France would add more Force to them who had so often refus'd them when they were in Circumstances to receive. The most favourable Interpreters of the French King's Politicks, began now to think he had laid all Thoughts of a Restoration aside. King James's Troops were employ'd and scatter'd where they were useless upon that Design, and his Court was modell'd, as if nothing more should be attempted. However it was thought convenient still to carry the Juggle on, and several Methods were made use of to seduce the poor Jacobites in England and St. Germains, that their Work was still going on. Great Respect was shown to the Court of St. Germains by his Most Christian Majesty, with repeated Assurances to stand by them: In the mean time I was permitted to leave the Army, and solace my self for two or three Months at Paris, where, by the Assistance of my old Friend ready Money, I made my self very acceptable. It was my Happiness hitherto never to be engaged in an Intrigue with the Fair Sex; for though several of my Station have diverted themselves that way with much prejudice to their Business, yet I was always so bent upon War, that I cou'd never find spare Hours for such trifling Conversation, for that was the Notion I had of it. A general Whining and Pining away for a Trolloping Girl, was to me a very awker'd and inconsistent Piece of Pageantry; however, I had been often told by Persons of Experience, that no Man had so just an Idea of the World, as he that had been well hamper'd and sower'd by a Love Intrigue; for though Women appear to be only Spectators, and to bear no Sway in the Politicks of the World, yet underhand, the Fate of Kingdoms often hung at their Girdles, and the wisest of Princes often hazarded the Repose of his People for an Hours Dalliance with some Coquet and diverting Creature of the fair Sex. I cannot tell well how it happen'd, but I suppose by not resisting the first impressions of this kind, I found my self far gone in an Intrigue, and that without either Thought or Design; but I understood afterwards that a Breach of Idleness being espy'd in my Conduct, the Roving Deity seiz'd the Advantage and enter'd Sword in Hand. The Gentlewoman who drew me into this Snare, was no otherwise my Acquaintance than by an accidental Visit; but I was so much a Philosopher, as to know that where there is a Sympathy of Humours, all other Considerations are neglected, and a Turk with those Advantages, is as capable to make a Conquest as a Christian. I had at my first entrance upon the Stage of the World made a double Promise to my self, the one was never to hearken to a Love Affair till I had acquired a Stock of Experience, and Money to make that Passion Serviceable and of real Use in an honourable Way; the other was not to graft upon a Foreign Stock; but I was forc'd to humble my self under a violation of both these Purposes; for the Object of my Passion was a Spanish young Lady though of Irish Extraction, her Family Transporting themselves thither about the middle of Queen Elizabeth's Reign. Now I had two or three Difficulties to struggle with relating to this Affair: in the first place, I had not as yet imparted the Secret to the young Lady; again, my Brother's Example gave me grounds to think I cou'd not avoid a Quarrel with some of her Relations; but what chiefly frighted me, was the Plague of Wedding, in case we were both of a Mind, for a keen Hound is not easily call'd off from a hot Scent, till he has either caught or lost his Game. In the midst of these Perplexities, I judg'd 'twou'd be a wise Part to disclose my self to some Persons of Experience in these Matters; for in all the Skirmishes and Sieges I had been at, they never threw me into such a Consternation and Absence of Thought; and accordingly I met with an old Adept in these Affairs. When he heard my Case, after two or three Turns he approach'd me with the serious Air of a Physician, and I thinking he had Design to feel my Pulse, I offer'd him my Hand, which he only shook very gently, saying, Young Man, all the Comfort I can give you is, that you must buy your Knowledge by Experience as I and many others have done before you. All Advice is lost upon a Person in Love. Should I advice you to quit the Enterprize, I know you would not do it. A Halter or an East-India Voyage may do you Service in Case you are refused. In a Word, whatever I advised you to you will certainly do the contrary; However, that you may be said to have lost your Time in coming hither, hasten to the young Lady, tell her in a Franck Cavalier way how Things are with you; give all the vent you can to your Passion; if it blows over, you will be a wary Man hereafter, if it ends in Wedlock, any Body will inform you of the Consequences. While the old Gentleman was entertaining me with this Lesson, my Head grew so dizy, as if some invisible Hand had turn'd it round like a Gigg, so I left him abruptly, and went directly to my Lodgings to Bed, but to this Day I cannot tell, whether I went a Foot or in a Coach my Head was in such a Confusion. The next Morning finding my ideas better rang'd, I propos'd to seize the first Opportunity to let the Lady understand the Difficulties I struggled under upon her Account; but the Nature of our Visits was such, that I cou'd not do it any otherwise than by Letter: Thus when I had once broke the Ice, and that too with a fair Prospect of making Advances, in the next Place I gain'd the Maid by the usual Methods that such Creatures are render'd Obsequious, and under her Conduct methoughts I sail'd prosperously on without the least Rub to my suppos'd Happiness; 'tis true I was at a constant Charge of Presents, Treats, and now and then a Serenade according to the Spanish Customs. But I remember at one of these Midnight Scenes of Gallantry, I saw something that gave me a great deal of Uneasiness; drawing up my Musick under the Lady's Window, besides her Face, which was at the Casement wide open, I saw the Reflexion of a Periwig move towards the Corner of the Window; this made me vehemently suspect somebody had a better place in her Affections than my self, for there was no Male kind belonging to the Family, her Father and Brother, as she told me at other Times, being in Spain, to take care of some Effects they expected by the Flota from the West Indies. However, I endeavour'd to smother this Impression of Jealousy, attributing the Mistake to the Circumstances of Night, Candle Light, or some other false Medium that might ground it, so I was resolv'd to take no notice of it at my next Visit. But it was not long before I met with another Occasion of Jealousy, which cou'd not so easily be banish'd out of my Head. Sitting in the Chocolate House, a young Gentleman was giving himself Airs with a Snuff-box, which to my Eye (and it was my Interest to observe it very narrowly) appear'd to be the very same I had some time before presented the Lady with, and as an aggravating Circumstance, in taking Notice of the Gentleman's Periwig, it had the same Form with the Reflexion I saw up in the Lady's Chamber Window, vid. a flat Top, neither rais'd nor parted in the Middle, which spoke it to be a Piece of English Furniture. The Sight of the snuff-box drew all my Blood into my Heart, and left my pale Cheeks to account for the Consternation, wherefore not able to contain my self had I kept my Ground, I flung out of the Chocolate House, not unobserv'd by the Company to be in some Disorder; but when they look'd out of the Window and saw me stand gazing {{in the middle of the}} Street, (for my Motion thither was purely Animal, having no thought whither I was going) it encreas'd their Surprise. However, at three Steps I was got again into the Chocolate House, and with a galliard Air, addressing my self to the Gentleman with the Snuff box, Sir, said I, I confirm the Gift, and may all sniffling Fools that are in Love be serv'd like me. I allow'd no Time for a Reply, but bolting again into the Street, it came into my Head that perhaps two Snuff-boxes might be so much alike, as not to observe the difference without confronting 'em. This Thought gave me a Curiosity to step into a Toyshop, where I desired to have a Sight of the newest fashion'd Snuff-boxes, and when among others, I saw above half a Dozen exactly like that I had made the Lady a Present of, a Secret Confusion spread it self over my Soul to have given way to such Suspicions. The Matyrdom accustom'd by such like Thoughts as these being the usual Entertainment of Persons in my Condition, and I having read in several Moralists, That there can be no true Love without a Mixture of Jealousy, which two rose proportionably, and that Jealousy was the greatest Plague of Human Life. These Considerations, I say, made me Struggle hard to throw off the Tyranny I groan'd under, and it happen'd very luckily for me that within a few Days after the young Lady was sent for into Spain, so that I had in Election either to throw up all my Expectations in France, and follow her, or Moralize a Week or two; upon the Disappointment, and so recover my self again to my Senses, which I quickly did by spending my Time in a Treatise of Algebra and Fortifications. As for the Lady she parted without any Reluctance, and it mortify'd me sensibly, that what I had made a Study and Business of, was only her Diversion and Amusement; but I kept my Resolution never more to divert my self that way, till I was effectually tramell'd.|$|E

The severity of the withdrawal symptoms in the neonate is dependent upon the route of administration used by the mother (injection vs inhalation). The metabolism and elimination of the drug from the mother's system, and the length of time that the drug was taken will also impact the development of withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. More severe findings may include acting irritable or jittery, feeding problems, and diarrhea. Symptoms vary depending on which substances were used.

40|$|Whole genome duplications, or tetraplodies, are an {{important}} source of increased gene content. Following whole genome duplication, duplicate copies of many genes are lost from the genome. This loss of genes is biased both in the classes of genes deleted and the subgenome from which they are lost. Many or all classes are genes preferentially retained as duplicate copies are engaged in dose sensitive protein-protein interactions, such that deletion of any one duplicate upsets the status quo of subunit concentrations, and presumably lowers fitness as a result. Transcription factors are also preferentially retained following every whole genome duplications studied. This has been explained as a consequence of protein-protein interactions, just as for other highly retained classes of genes. We show that the quantity of conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) associated with genes predicts the <b>likelyhood</b> of their retention as duplicate pairs following whole genome duplication. As many CNSs likely represent binding sites for transcriptional regulators, we propose that the <b>likelyhood</b> of gene retention following tetraploidy may also be influenced by dose-sensitive protein-DNA interactions between the regulatory regions of CNS-rich genes [...] nicknamed "bigfoot genes" – and the proteins that bind to them.

The <b>likelyhood</b> for trapping into local minima by PSO is overcome in this enhanced version. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested on the standard IEEE- 30 bus system. The performance is compared with the basic version of PSO and improved results are seen...|$|E

Proceedings of the 4 th Red-cockaded woodpecker Symposium. Ralph Costa and Susan J. Daniels, eds. Savannah, Georgia. January, 2003. Chapter 6. Translocation. Pp 335 - 336. Abstract: Because translocations of male red-cockaded woodpeckers {{have been less}} successful (Costa and Kennedy 1994) and because translocations of females are dependent {{on the availability of}} established males, a technique to increase the success of translocations would be an important contribution to conservation efforts. Researchers from the U. S. Forest Service Southern Research Station hypothesized that by maintaining red-cockaded woodpeckers in an aviary prior to release the birds would develop an affinity for, and possibly imprint (Scott and Carpenter 1987) on their surroundings, and that this would increase their <b>likelyhood</b> of remaining in the cluster upon their release...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} family control and dividend policy in Indonesia. There are three possible explanations for the relationship. The expropriation hypothesis predicts that family control has {{a negative impact on}} dividend payouts. Meanwhile the reputation hypothesis and the family income hypothesis predict that family control has a positive impact on dividend payouts. Using a panel data of Indonesian publicly listed firms in the period of 2003 - 2009, the results shows that family control has a significant negative impact on dividend payouts, dividend yields and <b>likelyhood</b> to pay dividends. The results control for other variables that may potentially affect dividend payments such as growth opportunity, debt, profitability, firm size and firm age. From agency theory perspective, the finding is consistent with the argument that family controlling shareholders prefer lower dividends, in order to preserve cash flows that they can potentially expropriate (the expropriation hypothesis) ...|$|E
40|$|Mandelbrot (1963) {{has been}} the first to {{question}} the simple logic of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Elton e Gruber 1981). In financial markets, he pointed out, are present complex phenomena as the Noah effect (periodical large shocks) and the Joseph effect (positive trends tend to be followed by positive trends; {{the same is true for}} negative trends). The author believes that even more complex underlying patterns may be found. In this paper, which is of a pure experimental nature, and whose aim is at the moment purely descriptive, the <b>likelyhood</b> of the existence of a complex web of straight lines, so popular in technical analysis, is investigated and it is found that it has a credible foundation. A cyclic non-periodic structure of trends comes to the surface in addition. These results, as many others referenced to in the bibliography, question seriously wether even modern statistical theory (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov 1954) may be adequate to describe such complex phenomena...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{recognizing}} free-form 3 D objects from a single 2 D intensity image. A model-based solution within the alignment paradigm is presented which involves three major schemes [...] modeling, matching, and indexing. The modeling scheme constructs a set of model aspects which can predict the object contour as seen from any viewpoint. The matching scheme aligns the edgemap of a candidate model to the observed edgemap using an initial approximate pose. The major contribution of this paper involves the indexing scheme and its integration with modeling and matching to perform recognition. Indexing generates hypotheses specifying both candidate model aspects and approximate pose and scale. Hypotheses are ordered by <b>likelyhood</b> based on prior knowledge of pre-stored models and the visual evidence from the observed objects. A prototype implementation has been tested in recognition and localization experiments with a database containing 658 model aspects from 20 3 D objects and 80 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Television as an {{electronic}} medium of communication {{has evolved into}} a potent {{force to be reckoned with}} in the transmission of social values and norms in a civilised society. It has not only become a part of everyday life, but serves as a veritable source of information, education and entertainment by the reason of its dramatic and demonstrative powers. It was observed that teenagers fall into the category of media audience that spends a lot of time watching TV. Therefore, it plays an important role in structuring their lives in some shape and form also leading to the <b>likelyhood</b> of forming false ideals. The study sought to find out the frequency of teenagers’ exposure to entertainment TV; the kinds of entertainment programmes they watch; what they pay attention to in the programmes they watch; and how the entertainment programmes shape their world view concerning social behaviour in their environment. The results of the study showed that children frequently watched entertainment TV as represented by 92. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of all procedures {{implemented in the}} fail-stop controller to avoid and to detect faults leads to a failure-rate of wrong-side faults comparable with a 2 out of 2 computer system. The basic reasoning of the on-chip redundancy and the avoidance of faults by means of checked chip design rules is new and was not covered by existing DB guidelines. Alcatel SEL is following {{the philosophy of the}} <b>likelyhood</b> of wrong-side faults in the work groups for establishing european standards for railway signalling. This means a departing from fixed structures of homogenous redundancy which are at present mandatory and progressing towards an open market for lower cost systems of the same safety level. In phase II of the research project {{it will be necessary to}} prove that the established fault model with derived simulation methods together with the matching redundancy procedures lead to the intended result.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Foi avaliado o conjunto de cinco manobras para as lesões meniscais (McMurray, Apley, Childress, Steinmann 1 e 2) e calculados a sensibilidade, especificidade, acurácia e likelyhoods do conjunto dessas manobras. Os mesmos cálculos foram aplicados a cada teste individualmente. MÉTODOS: Cento e cinquenta e dois pacientes de ambos os sexos que iriam realizar videoartroscopia do joelho foram examinados por um dos cinco residentes desse {{hospital}} de forma cega sem que esse soubesse seus dados clínicos e porque seriam operados. Esse exame era realizado imediatamente antes da videoartroscopia e seus resultados anotados em planilha eletrônica. O conjunto de manobras foi considerado positivo quando uma era positiva. Já na análise individual, bastava o teste ser positivo. RESULTADOS: A análise mostrou que o conjunto dos cinco testes meniscais apresenta 89 % de sensibilidade, 42 % de especificidade, 75 % de acurácia, <b>likelyhood</b> + de 1, 53 e um <b>likelyhood</b> - de 0, 26. Individualmente os testes apresentaram acurácia entre 48 e 53 %. CONCLUSÃO: O conjunto de manobras para as lesões meniscais tem boa acurácia e valor significativo, principalmente para excluir lesões. Os testes isolados têm menor valor diagnóstico, sendo o teste de Apley o de melhor especificidade. OBJECTIVE: A set of five maneuvers for meniscal injuries (McMurray, Apley, Childress and Steinmann 1 and 2) {{was evaluated}} and their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and likelihood were calculated. The same methods {{were applied to}} each test individually. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two patients of both sexes {{who were going to}} undergo videoarthroscopy on the knee were examined blindly by one of five residents at this hospital, without knowledge of the clinical data and why the patient was going to undergo an operation. This examination was conducted immediately before the videoarthroscopy and its results were recorded in an electronic spreadsheet. The set of maneuvers was considered positive when one was positive. In the individual analysis, it was enough for the test to be positive. RESULTS: The analysis showed that the set of five meniscal tests presented sensitivity of 89 %, specificity of 42 %, accuracy of 75 %, positive likelihood of 1. 53 and negative likelihood of 0. 26. Individually, the tests presented accuracy of between 48 % and 53 %. CONCLUSION: The set of maneuvers for meniscal injuries presented a good accuracy and significant value, especially for ruling out injury. Individually, the tests had less diagnostic value, although the Apley test had better specificity...|$|E

D. thesis {{includes three}} topics of econometrics where the {{chapters of the}} whole study are devoted to robust regression analysis, research on the estimators for the covariance matrix of a heteroskedastic regression and finally an application of the Empirical Bayes method to some real data from Istanbul Stock Exchange. Some robust regression techniques are applied to some data sets to show how outliers of a data set may lead to wrong inferences. The results reveal that the former studies have gone through some wrong results with {{the effect of the}} outliers that were not detected. Second chapter makes a thorough evaluation of the existing heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimators where the Maximum <b>Likelyhood</b> estimator recently promoted to the literature by Zaman is also taken into consideration. Finally, some empirical study is carried out in {{the last part of the}} thesis. The firms of ISE are categorized into sectors and some estimation is done over an equation which is very common and simple in the finance literature. Orhan, MehmetPh. D...|$|E
40|$|I {{develop a}} model of {{cumulative}} ICT investments in a small open economy framework with differenciated inputs and imperfect competition borrowed to Ciccone and Matsuyama (1996). Within this framework, fixed adoption costs and pecuniary externalities based on strategic complementarities between users and producers of ICT-related inputs are what allow for agglomeration economies in ICT investments despite the abscence of transport costs. Moreover, expectations and the way alternative industrial structures {{allow them to be}} coordinated (monopolistic competition versus horizontally integrated monopoly) are key determinants of the <b>likelyhood</b> of an economic catching-up based on the intensive adoption of ICT inputs. Actually, three alternative growth paths with very different long-run outcome are allowed to emerge : 1) a "no-growth path 2 ̆ 01 d path in which the economy is trapped into primitive production processes; 2) a "transitory high growth path 2 ̆ 01 d in which the region underwents a process of adjustment to technological change and modernize its production processes by intensively adopting imported ICT-related inputs; 3) a "miracle growth path 2 ̆ 01 d where the regional economy find the adequate incentives not only to intensively adopt imported ICT inputs but also to develop and produce new ICT inputs...|$|E
