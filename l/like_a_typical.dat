5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> mobile ransomware, {{it employs}} scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions. Jesus probably looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, it was {{confirmed}} that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> group 7 element. A {{team at the}} Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267Bh produced in the reaction between 249Bk and 22Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as 108Tc) and rhenium (as 169Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{configurations of}} Lr+ and Lr2+ {{are expected to}} be 7s2 and 7s1 respectively, unlike the lanthanides which tend to be 5d1 as Ln2+. However, in species where all three valence electrons of lawrencium are ionized to give at least formally the Lr3+ cation, lawrencium is expected to behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> actinide and the heavier congener of lutetium, especially because the first three ionization potentials of lawrencium are predicted to be similar to those of lutetium. Hence, unlike thallium but like lutetium, lawrencium would prefer to form LrH3 than LrH, and LrCO is expected to be similar to the also unknown LuCO, both metals having a valence configuration of σ2π1 in their respective monocarbonyls. The pπ–dπ bond is expected to be observed in LrCl3 just as it is for LuCl3 and more generally all the LnCl3, and the complex anion − is expected to be stable just like its lanthanide congeners, with a configuration of 6d1 for lawrencium; this 6d orbital would be its highest occupied molecular orbital.|$|E

Jake looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very <b>typical</b> pirate, {{but much of}} his {{appearance}} is put on - his eyepatch just covers a perfectly good eye, and his hook is held {{in one of his}} hands. Jake's schemes to catch up with Abercromby usually involve a comedic comeupance.|$|R
25|$|The rest of Buxtehude's {{keyboard}} music {{does not}} employ pedals. Of the organ works, a few keyboard canzonas {{are the only}} strictly contrapuntal pieces in Buxtehude's oeuvre and were probably composed with teaching purposes in mind. There are also three pieces labelled fugues: only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 {{is more of a}} canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Buxtehude prelude, only beginning with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.|$|E
25|$|Red Bank Charter School is {{a public}} school for {{students}} in kindergarten through eighth grade that operates under a charter granted by the New Jersey Department of Education and accepts students and receives its funding from a portion of property taxes, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> public school. It does not charge tuition and operates independently {{of the public school}} system, with a separate school board. Students are selected to enroll in the charter school based on an annual lottery, which is open to all Red Bank residents of school age.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} were graced with statues, mirrors, tapestries, gilding, {{and various}} {{portraits of the}} Imperial family. The interiors of her sister ships were also placed {{in the hands of}} Poppe. The first class salon was noted for its tapestries and its blue seating. The smoking room, a traditionally male preserve, was made to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> German inn. The dining room, capable of holding all passengers in one sitting, rose several decks and was crowned with a dome. The room also had columns and had its chairs fixed to the deck, a typical feature of ocean liners of the era.|$|E

25|$|Flight of the Switchblade was {{scheduled}} for 2020 with its 61-meter long oblique wing perpendicular to its engines <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> aircraft. As the aircraft increased speed, the wing begins to pivot, so that when it breaks the sound barrier, its wing has swiveled 60 degrees, with one wingtip pointing forward and the other backward. The change in aerodynamics and the general structure {{would have made the}} aircraft very difficult to control for a human being. The plane was to be totally controlled by an on-board computer controlling flight parameters. Following Phase I the aircraft concept was cancelled in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} game We the People {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer card driven games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games. Twilight Struggle, a game based on the Cold War, was ranked #1 on the website BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016. As of April 2017, it's ranked third.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{an auction}} system {{designed}} by the economist William Vickrey, the OpenIPO auction uses a mathematical model to treat all qualifying bids in an impartial way. It {{is similar to the}} model used to auction Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. Just <b>like</b> in <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> auction, the highest bidders win in an OpenIPO auction, but there are important differences. In the OpenIPO auction, the entire auction is private, and winning bidders all pay the same price per share—the public offering price.|$|R
50|$|Like other vermetids, {{the species}} in this genus {{do not have}} regular shell coiling <b>like</b> that of <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> {{gastropod}} shell, instead they have shells which are irregular. They are usually cemented onto a hard surface. Because of all this, the shells resemble the calcareous tubes of worms in the polychaete family Serpulidae.|$|R
50|$|<b>Like</b> in <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> village, {{the fight}} soon stops and every thing returns to normal. When asked by Bhaskaran's father {{as to who}} gave him the idea to mix brass with gold. Bhaskaran replies that he learnt the idea from his father, who used to fool his wife (Bhaskaran's mother) by {{polishing}} brass with gold. Pavithran finally decides to take back his wife and daughter. The movie ends with a note which indicates that Bhaskaran too has found his true love in the dance teacher.|$|R
500|$|For Théodore Rosier, Gatlif {{wanted someone}} who looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Frenchman of the time, [...] with a [...] "voice and face {{a little like}} that of Pierre Fresnay, Maurice Ronet, Jacques Charrier or Gérard Philippe", which he found in Marc Lavoine. Marie-Josée Croze was the obvious choice for Mademoiselle Lise Lundi. Gatlif had envisioned Lundi as being like a [...] "Hitchcock character: fragile, mysterious and strong".|$|E
500|$|Very {{unlike the}} Irish Water Spaniel in appearance, the English Water Spaniel [...] more closely resembled a curly-haired {{version of the}} Springer Spaniel, with some traits of the Collie, poodle, and setter. The white and liver (tan) dog stood about [...] tall and looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical,</b> lean, long-legged spaniel with long ears and tail, a white underbelly, and [...] a brown back, except that it had the coat of a water dog.|$|E
500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{is a song}} which [...] "tells {{the story}} of a woman stuck in a {{dead-end}} relationship with a man who clearly does not deserve her, and with her journey to realizing that and eventually walking out on him", and her frustration that her man is not 100% committed. The introduction was said to be similar to [...] "4 Minutes" [...] by Madonna and Justin Timberlake, though the melody is [...] "backed with trumpets and synth beats". A reviewer from Prefix said that the record didn't sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Tricky Stewart and The-Dream production.|$|E
50|$|In the {{extermination}} phase, {{a wave of}} one or more enemy types {{moves across}} the level towards the core. With each enemy that reaches the core, the condition of the core degrades from 100%; when the condition reaches 0%, the game ends. Unlike most tower defense games, the player is allowed to move about the level during this phase and attack enemies with different weapon types, much <b>like</b> in <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> first-person shooter. Touching enemies will result in the player being knocked back, but no damage is done.|$|R
40|$|When I use a word, ” Humpty Dumpty said {{in rather}} a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean— neither more nor less. ” “The {{question}} is, ” said Alice, “whether {{you can make}} words mean different things. ” “The question is, ” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master—that’s all. ” 1 To “choose what words or concepts mean, neither more nor less ” is the function of a terminology. Each term has a precise meaning or description. The problem is that clinicians may use different terms to describe the same concept. For example, aqueous misdirection, malignant glaucoma, ciliary block glaucoma, and posterior aqueous diversion syndrome all describe a single concept. Without a common reference point, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dictionary, <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> computer system would consider all these terms as having different meanings...|$|R
50|$|Via Satyaam, as {{one goes}} from Nrusimhanath to Harishankar an old-patterned cave {{is caught in}} sight. It is just 10.5 km from the main temple, having {{dimensions}} of 150 ft. length, 50 ft. breadth and 25 ft. depth.
