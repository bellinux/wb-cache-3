5|$|Wyatt still owned a {{house in}} Tombstone with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, but she waited for him in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he {{had asked her to}} marry him. Wyatt, who did not believe in divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying to}} outrun a storm, Harry Potter and his cousin, Dudley Dursley, are {{attacked}} by Dementors, but Harry casts the Patronus Charm to fend them off. Back at the Dursley's, Harry receives a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> {{that he is}} expelled from Hogwarts. The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Albus Dumbledore, tells Harry that Dumbledore has persuaded the Ministry to let Harry have a hearing. They take him to their headquarters and inform him that the Ministry of Magic is refusing to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned. Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object {{he did not have}} during his previous attack.|$|E

5|$|Back at Kiamo Ko, Elphaba {{has already}} {{captured}} Dorothy, refusing to release {{her until she}} relinquishes Nessarose's slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy go. Elphaba refuses until she suddenly receives a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other for all grievances, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace {{for the last time}} before saying goodbye forever, and acknowledge that they are who they are because of each other ("For Good"). As the mob arrives at the castle, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away. Grief-stricken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her black hat and the small bottle of green elixir which she had slept with under her pillow.|$|E
25|$|Another {{confrontation}} with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.|$|E
25|$|On another occasion, while staying {{together}} in Brighton, Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, {{but failed to}} return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the Grand Hotel and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for blackmail.|$|E

25|$|There {{is nothing}} to prevent a debtor from having his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange with a friend to whom he owes a debt, and whom {{he is unable to}} pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E
25|$|Peary {{returned}} the favor in a memorable 1944 Fibber McGee & Molly episode in which {{neither of the}} title characters appeared: Jim Jordan was recovering from a bout of pneumonia (this would be written into the show the following week, when the Jordans returned), and the story line involved Gildersleeve and nephew Leroy hoping to visit the McGees at home during a train layover in Wistful Vista, but finding Fibber and Molly not at home. At {{the end of the}} episode, Gildersleeve discovers the couple had left in a hurry that morning when they received Gildy's <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> he would be stopping over in Wistful Vista.|$|E
25|$|Jackson's exact birthplace {{is unclear}} {{because he was}} born about the time his mother was making a {{difficult}} trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he was born at an uncle's plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Jackson may have {{claimed to be a}} South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|The {{sponsorship}} of AGU by ExxonMobil became {{a source of}} concern for many members after evidence surfaced that ExxonMobil had known about climate change for decades but had actively worked to undermine climate science. On February 22, 2016, a letter signed by 100 scientists was delivered to the AGU, requesting that they cut all ties with ExxonMobil and other companies that foster climate misinformation. The AGU Board of Directors met on 22 April 2016 and voted to continue accepting sponsorship from ExxonMobil, arguing {{that there was not}} unequivocal evidence that ExxonMobil continues to participate in climate misinformation. Instead of making a short-term political statement, the Board wished to engage with the energy industry over the long term. In response, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Representative Ted Lieu sent a critical <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that ExxonMobil continues to fund climate denial and is misleading the AGU. The Union of Concerned Scientists also sent a letter urging them to reconsider. However, in a meeting on 23 September 2016, the Board upheld its previous decision.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles {{serves as}} a power-based {{character}} in Sonic Heroes alongside Sonic and Tails, who respectively represent speed and flight. They team up to defeat Eggman after receiving a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he will destroy the world in three days. However, {{it turns out that}} Eggman is being impersonated by Metal Sonic, whom all of the other characters defeat together. Knuckles helps Sonic, Tails, Amy Rose, and Cream the Rabbit stop Eggman from building an empire in Sonic Advance, Sonic Advance 2, and Sonic Advance 3. With the same team, Knuckles recurs in Sonic Riders and its two sequels; in each game, they participate in board-racing competitions together. In another team-based installment, the role-playing game , Knuckles is a playable character with {{a major role in the}} story. The game begins with Tails informing Sonic that Knuckles has been kidnapped, so a team beginning as Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Rouge must rescue him. He is eventually saved, and it is revealed that the echidna race is still alive in the form of the helpful Shade the Echidna and her villainous tribe, the Nocturnus.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E

50|$|In {{the remote}} village of Ndotsheni, in the Natal {{province}} of eastern South Africa, the Reverend Stephen Kumalo receives {{a letter from}} a fellow minister summoning him to Johannesburg. He is needed there, the <b>letter</b> <b>says,</b> to help his sister, Gertrude, who the <b>letter</b> <b>says</b> has fallen ill. Kumalo undertakes the difficult and expensive journey to the city in the hopes of aiding Gertrude and of finding his son, Absalom, who traveled to Johannesburg from Ndotsheni and never returned. In Johannesburg, Kumalo is warmly welcomed by Msimangu, the priest who sent him the letter, and given comfortable lodging by Mrs. Lithebe, a Christian woman who feels that helping others is her duty.|$|R

500|$|In 2005, the New York State Department of Education sent Trump, Sexton, and Trump University a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> {{that they}} were violating state law by using the word [...] "university" [...] when in fact Trump University was not {{actually}} chartered as one {{and did not have}} the required license to offer live instruction or training. Although Sexton promised that the organization would stop instructing students in New York State, the New York Attorney General alleged that such instruction continued.|$|E
500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. We must have done something right." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} thirteen, Brown {{took a job as}} a paperboy for the Pittsburgh Courier, a black press paper, and {{developed}} a desire to pilot while reading in the newspaper about African-American aviators of the time including C. Alfred Anderson, Eugine Jacques Bullard, and Bessie Coleman. He also became an avid reader of Popular Aviation and the Chicago Defender, which he later said heavily influenced his desire to fly naval aircraft. In his childhood he was described as [...] "serious, witty, unassuming, and very intelligent." [...] In 1937, he wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in which he complained of the injustice of African-American pilots being kept out of the U.S. Army Air Corps, to which the White House responded with a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that it appreciated the viewpoint.|$|E

500|$|On May 9, 2008, Oklahoma City {{officials}} declared {{intent to}} sue for damages and a forced relocation of the SuperSonics if Schultz's lawsuit succeeded and the subsequent ownership did not relocate. In a legal letter to Schultz, Oklahoma City's attorney said that the Sonics were legally bound to relocate to Oklahoma City {{at the end of}} the KeyArena lease regardless of who owned the team. The letter stated that the city had [...] "valid and enforceable agreements with the Team requiring it relocate to Oklahoma City {{at the end of the}} current lease with the city of Seattle." [...] Schultz's attorney replied to the <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> the lease agreement was with PBC, not BCOS, and that the city began improvements on Ford Center at their own risk prior to conclusion of the pending litigation.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 1970, Hulme sent Madgwick a <b>letter</b> <b>saying</b> that he (Hulme) would, for the 1970–71 budget, {{be asking}} the Treasurer to cut ABC's budget by $500,000 {{and that at}} least half that cut would be applied to current affairs programming. The letter caused anger and consternation among the ABC's administrators, who felt that the threat {{undermined}} the ABC's independence and authority to decide its own programming. Because Madgwick was temporarily unavailable due to illness, ABC's board of commissioners met with Hulme to protest his intentions. The contents of the letter were leaked by someone in the ABC and received widespread coverage throughout Australia's media. On 27 May 1970, Hulme retracted the letter. That same day, Madgwick and his administrators drafted a letter in response, saying that Hulme's proposal would have been [...] "completely unacceptable" [...] to the ABC. Madgwick followed it up that evening by giving an interview on ABC's 7 o'clock news in which he explained his views on the proper relation {{between the government and}} the ABC.|$|E
500|$|The Sacramento Bee {{pointed out}} that despite {{regularly}} soliciting campaign funds from Silicon Valley business leaders, Representative and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, {{the author of the}} Republican letter to Secretary Chao, was targeting a project that benefited the region directly. Another Republican signatory, Representative Devin Nunes, was unmoved by arguments on infrastructure benefits, saying in late February that he would not [...] "feel too bad about one of the richest places on the planet not having a train." [...] Fellow Republican Representative Jeff Denham defended the <b>letter,</b> <b>saying</b> Caltrain's electrification project and CHSRA were closely intertwined because the former derived some funding under the [...] "blended plan" [...] agreement. Representative Tom McClintock reiterated his opposition to high-speed rail without addressing Caltrain: [...] "I have never supported a dollar of state funding going for , and would never support a dollar of federal funding." [...] Representative Mimi Walters also made a statement that she was not opposed to electrification, but instead held [...] "serious concerns about the use of taxpayer funds for a project that is tied to high speed rail".|$|E
