We seek to approximate the density d nu/d mu (assumed to be in L-mu(2) ([a; b])) in the least square sense, given {{the values of the}} distribution function nu([a; t]) at fixed points {t(j) : 1 {{less than or equal to}} j less than or equal to p}. We obtain a convenient solution of this ill-posed problem via a Hilbert space embedding, and the associated discretized problem is solved by using regularization methods. This problem is connected with sedimentological topics such as sediment transport and changes of scale. As an example, a weight frequency cumulative curve is processed...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to DSMC collision modelling, called viscosity-DSMC or mu-DSMC, is described. The characteristic collision cross-section (of any standard collision model) is made to vary from cell to cell, based on the time-averaged temperature in each cell. In this way the collision model will display the Chapman-Enskog viscosity given by any desired viscosity <b>law</b> <b>mu</b> = mu(T), including a curve fit to experimental data. For example, we show that a hard sphere collision model, with hard sphere collision probability, used with a different molecular size in each cell, can reproduce a Sutherland viscosity law. Similarly, by making the reference cross-section of a VHS collision model {{a function of the}} temperature, we show that the VHS collision model can reproduce the viscosity given by the more complicated generalized hard sphere (GHS) collision model. We calculate the structure of a plane 1 D shock using the {{new approach}} and show that the results agree closely with those from standard DSMC using the GHS model. A particularly simple, and computationally efficient, method is to use the Maxwell VHS model, in which all collision pairs are equally likely, as the basis of the new method. That is, the characteristic size of the maxwell VHS model is varied from cell to cell, based on the time-averaged cell temperature and the (arbitrary) desired viscosity <b>law</b> <b>mu</b> = mu(T). Since the time-averaged cell temperature is available in standard DSMC as part of the procedures which determine the steady state flow, the new methods are as fast as, or faster than DSMC using the standard VHS model. Unlike more complicated models with realistic viscosities, the new procedures are compatible with the Borgnakke-Larsen energy exchange scheme and the established chemistry models for DSMC. © 2005 American Institute of Physic...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{construction}} of a Skorohod embedding, namely, given a probability measure mu with zero expectation and finite variance, we construct an integrable stopping time T adapted to a filtration F_t, such that W_t has the <b>law</b> <b>mu,</b> where W_t is a standard Wiener process adapted to the same filtration. We find several sufficient conditions for the stopping time T to be bounded or to have a sub-exponential tail. In particular, our embedding seems rather natural for the case that mu is a log-concave measure and the tail behaviour of $T$ admits some tight bounds in that case. Our embedding admits the property that the stochastic measure-valued process {mu_t} (0 <t<T), where mu_t is as the law of W_T conditioned on F_t, is a Markov process...|$|E

We check this with DSMC calculations and show that {{it can be used to}} estimate the gas viscosity at high temperatures from measurements of shock thickness. We consider a monatomic gas(gamma = 5 / 3) for five different collision models and hence five different viscosity <b>laws</b> <b>mu</b> = mu(T). The collision models are: the variable hard sphere, sigma 1 /g^upsilon, with three values of upsilon; the generalized hard sphere; and the Maitland-Smith potential.

40|$|We {{consider}} the random reversible Markov kernel K obtained by assigning i. i. d. nonnegative weights {{to the edges}} of the complete graph over n vertices and normalizing by the corresponding row sum. The weights are assumed to be in the domain of attraction of an a-stable law, alpha is an element of (0, 2). When 1 <= alpha < 2, we show that for a suitable regularly varying sequence kappa(n) of index 1 - 1 /alpha, the limiting spectral distribution mu(alpha) of kappa(n) K coincides with the one of the random symmetric matrix of the un-normalized weights (Levy matrix with i. i. d. entries). In contrast, when 0 < alpha < 1, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of K converges without rescaling to a nontrivial <b>law</b> (<b>mu)</b> over tilde (alpha) supported on [- 1, 1], whose moments are the return probabilities of the random walk on the Poisson weighted infinite tree (PWIT) introduced by Aldous. The limiting spectral distributions are given by the expected value of the random spectral measure at the root of suitable self-adjoint operators defined on the PWIT. This characterization is used together with recursive relations on the tree to derive some properties of mu a and (mu) over tilde (alpha). We also study the limiting behavior of the invariant probability measure of K...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} DSMC {{method for}} rarefied flows is described, by which any viscosity <b>law</b> <b>mu</b> = mu(T) may be simulated, including experimental data directly. The collision cross-section {{of a simple}} collision model is made to vary from cell to cell, based on the time-averaged cell temperature and the required viscosity at that temperature. The new method is tested in two different flows: high speed Couette flow and a plane 1 D shock. For Couette flow, the shear stress and heat transfer, calculated from the velocity distribution, agree with the theoretical values calculated from the flow gradients and the theoretical transport coefficients. For the 1 D shock, the new method is compared with the generalized hard sphere (GHS) model. The new method produces profiles of density and temperature which are generally indistinguishable from the GHS results except for a deviation in the Tx temperature component in a small region ahead of the shock. For the worst case the deviation is 4. 6 %, {{but it can be}} reduced by basing the imposed viscosity on the maximum component of kinetic temperature rather than the mean kinetic temperature. The new method is shown to be insensitive to the number of simulator particles used in each cell. Three translational degrees of freedom are considered. However, because mu-DSMC is based on a hard sphere or VHS cross-section, it is compatible with the most commonly used Borgnakke-Larsen model for translational-rotational energy exchange...|$|E
