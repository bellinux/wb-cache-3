5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>who</b> served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

25|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} on stage {{when she was}} much younger, she had gotten stage fright though a <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> was in the play managed to help her get over it. On her first day at school, she recognizes Leo as the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> helped her during her first play, though it took more of a reminder via her pig tails and the childish phrase daikon meaning poor actor which earned him {{a slap in the}} face.|$|E

25|$|Housemates {{described}} Holmes as treating Clara violently, and in 1884, {{before his}} graduation, she {{moved back to}} New Hampshire and later wrote that she knew little of him afterwards. After he moved to Mooers Forks, New York, a rumor spread that Holmes had been seen with a <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> later disappeared. Holmes claimed the boy {{went back to his}} home in Massachusetts. No investigation took place and Holmes quickly left town. He later traveled to Philadelphia and eventually got a job as a keeper at Norristown State Hospital, but quit after a few days. Subsequently, he took a position at a drugstore in Philadelphia, but while he was working there, a boy died after taking medicine that was purchased at the store. Holmes denied any involvement in the child's death and immediately left the city. Right before moving to Chicago, he changed his name to Henry Howard Holmes to avoid the possibility of being exposed by victims of his previous scams. In his confession following his arrest, Holmes claimed that he had killed his former medical school classmate, Dr. Robert Leacock, in 1886 for insurance money; Dr. Leacock, however, died in Watford, Ontario in Canada on October 5, 1889.|$|E

60|$|Miss Fosbrook, within herself, {{thought this}} unlikely, for nobody went to Bonchamp for costly shopping; {{and she saw}} that the woman would gladly have had the knife back, if she could have sold the tool-box, which, even at this reduced price, was much too dear for the <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> frequented the shop.|$|R

Kim says he was kept in [...] "a dungeon in a red castle." [...] Olivia and Peter use the information to find the boy once they arrange for Walter's release. However, Joanne escapes with the completed formula, which she gives to Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly). Loeb kills her, but not before using the equation {{to allow him to}} pass through solid matter.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{praised the}} episode's ending, saying [...] "I think we're {{most proud of}} the ending: Mulder's quest is re-established (and Daniel Sackheim {{directed}} it beautifully) with Mulder sitting alone in a church with only his faith. The story, again, was fueled by Mulder's belief and emotional connection with this case. Another girl taken from her family. And, in a way, the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> is the conduit, who is also perhaps touched by the aliens, is essentially Mulder. These little touches the fans seem to respond to. It was difficult for us, {{but in the end}} satisfying. It came out of frustration on our parts, and creative uncertainty".|$|E
60|$|On this {{particular}} day there was dissension in the camp.

50|$|As a child, Rion saw an uncensored {{tape that}} showed demons {{possessing}} <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> would later {{grow up to}} be demons and attack young girls. From then on she was convinced that young <b>boys</b> were angels <b>who</b> would turn into villainous devils when they got older. Now that Rion has grown into a pretty young girl, she only has eyes for <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> and avoids “devils” at all costs. She even goes to an all-girl school in order to avoid men.|$|R

500|$|In December 2006, Mills {{told the}} BBC {{that she had}} {{received}} death threats, and on 17 December 2006, police stated that a [...] "non-specific threat" [...] {{had been made to}} her safety. This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services too often. In March 2007, Kevin Moore, Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police, said that Mills was running [...] "the risk of being treated as the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> cried wolf", and added, [...] "We do have to respond to a disproportionate high volume of calls from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in, and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters". Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed.|$|E
500|$|Hearing of its release, {{neighbors of}} Geisel's in Springfield were at first worried the book {{would be an}} exposé of the people there. [...] Sales were lackluster, but early reviews were glowing. [...] Clifton Fadiman wrote a one-sentence review in The New Yorker, which Geisel could still quote {{near the end of}} his life: [...] "They say it's for children, but better get a copy for {{yourself}} and marvel at the good Dr. Seuss' impossible pictures and the moral tale of the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> exaggerated not wisely but too well." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Highly original and entertaining, Dr Seuss' picture book partakes of the better qualities of those peculiarly America institutions, the funny papers and the tall tale. It is a masterly interpretation of the mind of a child in the act of creating one of those stories with which children often amuse themselves and bolster up their self-respect." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, Grant won a {{scholarship}} to attend Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, although his father could barely {{afford to pay for}} the uniform. With his good looks and acrobatic talents Grant became a popular figure among both girls and boys. Able at most academic subjects, he excelled at sports, particularly fives; he developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework. A former classmate referred to him as a [...] "scruffy little boy", while an old teacher remembered [...] "the naughty <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> was always making a noise in the back row and would never do his homework". His evenings were spent working backstage in Bristol theatres, and in 1917, at the age of 13, he was responsible for the lighting for the magician David Devant at the Hippodrome. Grant began hanging around backstage at the theatre at every opportunity. In the summer he volunteered for work as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton, to escape the unhappiness of his home life. The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship's cabin boy, but learned he was too young.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} about a <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things {{she wanted him to}} buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, the boy has forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

60|$|The barrack-green on Sunday afternoons had, indeed, {{become the}} {{promenade}} {{of a great}} many townspeople cheerfully inclined, many even of those who attended {{in the morning at}} Mr. Sainway's service; and <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> ought to have been listening to the curate's afternoon lecture were too often seen rolling upon the grass and making faces behind the more dignified listeners.|$|R

2500|$|As {{evidence}} that Gregory {{was very young}} in 1528, there are two letters written by John Chekyng, his tutor, to Thomas Cromwell, describing a <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>who</b> plays and who is learning to read and write.
