It is common to {{have one or two}} eggs remaining unhatched as the parents begin the task of feeding the nestlings. The time from laying until a fledgling adventures outside will vary with each clutch, but generally good eggs will hatch within 14 to 16 days of laying and young will begin to venture out within about three or four weeks of hatching, and will look full-grown in about three months. Breeding age is six or more months. Zebra finches are usually excellent parents and will readily take turns sitting on the nest and bringing food to the young.|$|E

50|$|The clutch is {{normally}} 3-6 eggs, but may contain {{any number of}} eggs up to seven; even more eggs may be laid in total when some are removed during the <b>laying</b> <b>time,</b> which lasts about 2 days per egg laid. The eggs are abundantly patterned with brown spots, from a wash that tinges the entire surface buffish white to large almost-black blotches. Incubation lasts some 4 weeks to one month, and only the female hatches the eggs. The male is responsible for provisioning her with food, and for some time after hatching this remains the same. Later, both parents share brooding and hunting duties until the young fledge, after 4-5 weeks. The family stays close together for a few weeks, up to a month or so, during which time the young learn how {{to fend for themselves}} and hunt prey. The young become sexually mature the next breeding season.|$|E

A long source-process time (~ 463. 0 sec) and large rupture length (~ 1164. 0 km) are de rived from this analysis of rupture directivity. The source-process time for this earth quake is larger than for either the 1960 Chile or 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This {{might be due to}} the length of the rupture that occurred during earth quake faulting. The estimated rise time for the 2004 Sumatra earthquake, 92. 0 sec, is approximately 20 % of the whole source duration and also larger than those for the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This likely reflects a fundamental difference between the frictional properties of these earth quakes. When the rise time is taken into ac count, an estimated rupture velocity of approximately 3. 1 km sec- 1 is obtained. This value is higher than that found in previous studies carried out on the basis of hydro acoustic data and regional seismic net works. In this study, we obtain additional evidence from analysis of the surface-wave phase-de <b>lay</b> <b>time</b> which con firms the basic features of the rupturing of the 2004 Sumatra earth quake. The results can also provide some constraints for the study of source rupturing for this earthquake...|$|R

The waves velocity and waves equation of carbon fiber/epoxy composite are obtained using the least square method and numerical analysis. Furthermore, characteristics of stress wave propagation under the different processing parameters and <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> are presented, and laws of peak and stability of stress waves response to different compaction force and laying speed are discussed.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with Muscovy ducks to study the influence of age and <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> on their egg quality. In addition the relationship between egg water loss during storage, shell thickness and storage time were tested. a total of 2920 eggs were collected and individually weighed, washed, fumigated and stored for a maximum period of 7 days. Then the eggs were incubated and candled on the 10 th day. All the shell obtained from unfertile eggs (10 th day), died embryo eggs (10 th and 30 th day) and hatched eggs (34 th day), were immediately cleaned by washing and dried in a forced draught stove. Individual egg measurements included: egg weight at collection and at incubation, shell weight and shell thickness. Shell weight per unit of egg surface area (SWUSA), water loss per unit of time, avg. shell thickness and percentage of shell on egg weight were calculated. Results obtained in this study show that the duck egg stored at 11 +- 0. 2 °C and R. H. 70 - 75 % loose 0. 03 g of water for each day of storage (P< 0. 001). Hatching rate is affected (P< 0. 05) by water loss during storage period and the best results (70. 34 %) are obtained when water loss per week is about 1 % of egg weight. Shell thickness, weight, percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA are significantly affected by <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> and age of bird (P< 0. 01). these parameters tend to decrease {{with the passing of}} laying -period and age of bird. A relationship between hatching outcome and shell weight percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA was observed (P< 0. 01). Moreover results showed that although shell weight increases with increasing egg weight (b=+ 0. 82), it does not do so proportionally, consequently there is concomitant decrease in percentage of shell on egg weight (b= - 0. 028) ...|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000246297100003 International audienceReproduction is {{generally}} controlled by important temporal constraints involving complex adaptive mechanisms. Birds, in temperate zones, present marked breeding seasonality {{as well as}} marked daily organization of reproductive behavior, especially laying. Intra-specific variability and determinants of this pattern have been investigated mainly in domestic non-passerine birds. The present study analyzed the daily temporal organization of laying in a free-living species, the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris. Breeding in a starling colony was monitored for five consecutive years using a non-invasive method (infrared video camera) to precisely estimate laying times. European starlings present a marked daily laying rhythm, ovipositions occurring only during a morning species-specific temporal window. Inside this laying window, time intervals between successive eggs varied greatly among females. Contrary to many species, the light/dark cycle {{did not appear to}} control <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> in European starlings, but daily variations of the ultraviolet composition of the solar spectrum appeared to be a possible Zeitgeber of this behavior...|$|E

30|$|During larval production, S. invicta {{searches}} for foods that contain {{a higher proportion}} of protein (Cook et al. 2010). This period coincides with the breeding season of various oviparous vertebrates. The texture and stiffness of certain bird and reptile eggs seem {{to play an important role}} in the ability of vertebrates to resist S. invicta (Diffie et al. 2010). However, during hatching or when young leaves the nest, vertebrate young may receive numerous stings (Allen et al. 2004; this study). Thus, RIFAs negatively affect some species, especially ground-nesting species including some amphibians, birds, and reptiles (Montgomery 1996; Tuberville et al. 2000). Most research on the effects of RIFAs on vertebrates was conducted in habitats where S. invicta is invasive, because the species has been implicated in the decline of populations of native species through competition and predation (Caughley and Gunn 1996; Wojcik et al. 2001; Holway et al. 2002). Other authors also described the impacts of RIFA species on sea- and freshwater turtles in the USA (Allen et al. 2001). At turtle nest sites, soil disturbance associated with digging of the nest chamber, combined with the production of mucus at <b>laying</b> <b>time,</b> attracts S. invicta to turtles' nesting sites. When hatching occurs, RIFAs attack turtle hatchlings, in turn increasing hatchling mortality or decreasing survivorship once they leave the nest (Allen et al. 2001).|$|E

Floor-housed pullets were raised in a light-tight facility from 1 d of age until housing in individ-ually illuminated cages at time of photostimulation (22 wk). Cages were equipped with hardware to monitor egg <b>laying</b> <b>time.</b> The photoschedule during rearing was 24 h light: 0 h dark for the first 3 d followed by 8 h light: 16 h dark from 3 d to photostimulation.

The experimental design was a 2 × 2 factorial with two day lengths [hemeral (24 h) and ahemeral (28 h) ] and two BW groups [high (HBW) and low BW (LBW) ], with the LBW weighing 327 g less than the HBW birds at 22 wk of age.

40|$|Some {{bird species}} {{would be able}} to {{manipulate}} primary sex ratio, i. e. the proportion of male and female offspring at the <b>laying</b> <b>time.</b> Such trait could be considered being mostly under maternal control. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism involved remains undetermined. Knowledge of the mechanism would contribute to any assessment of its cost in terms of resources andyor time, which would be important to formulate predictions of those scenarios where it could have evolved. In fact, small costs of sex ratio control could overcome the adaptive value of adjusting the proportion of sexes in the progeny. Pike and Petrie (2003) published an excellent review on the potential mechanism involved. However, many new experimental and correlational evidences have appeared from that date, providing new and interesting perspectives. Thus, hormonal control is obtaining strong support from recent findings. The present review updates the current knowledge on this subject with emphasis {{on the question of whether}} sex ratio manipulation is a widespread trait among avian taxa. Finally, future directions for research, including not only those related to the mechanism per se, but also those linked to conditions necessary for the evolution of this trait, are presented. Thus, the necessity of determining fitness functions of male and female offspring and both parents, as well as the problem of if this trait is the result of a evolutionary constraint or strategy, are also addressed...|$|E
40|$|Gull colonies world-wide {{have been}} {{harvested}} for their eggs for centuries with minimal {{knowledge of the}} impacts on breeding. Although most Laridae can replace lost eggs, they have comparatively high energetic demands for egg production. In this paper we assess the impacts of a licensed egg harvest on the breeding success of black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus, which nest colonially in an EU Special Protection Area in Hampshire, Southern England. We compared egg volume, hatching and chick survival from harvested and un-harvested nests in central and fringe positions within colonies of various sizes, including colonies with no harvesting activity. Eggs from various laying stages were collected from harvested and un-harvested colonies of similar pre-harvest intrinsic quality, for comparison of their volumes, yolk-to-albumen ratios and eggshell thickness. Egg volume and the yolk-to-albumen ratio depended on <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> and location, with the largest eggs laid during the peak period by birds breeding in central positions on large colonies. Eggs produced by these peak layers also had the largest yolk-to-albumen ratios. Harvested sites were characterised by reductions in egg volume, yolk-to-albumen ratio and eggshell thickness, which translated to poorer hatching success and chick survival. Harvested sites also had {{a higher proportion of}} abnormal eggs, particularly taking the forms of small yolkless eggs and unpigmented eggs. The reduced breeding success on harvested colonies is likely to be linked to depletion of the female's endogenous reserves which can also reduce future survival and breeding propensity...|$|E
