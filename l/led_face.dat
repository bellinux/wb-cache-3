40|$|This is a {{protocol}} for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows: Our main {{objective is to}} assess the effectiveness of follow-up services for ICU survivors that aim to identify and address unmet health needs related to the ICU period. We aim to assess the effectiveness in relation to health-related quality of life, mortality, depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, physical function, cognitive function, ability {{to return to work}} or education and adverse events. Our secondary objectives are, in general, to examine both the various ways that follow-up services are provided and any major influencing factors. Specifically, we aim to explore: the effectiveness of service organisation (physician versus nurse <b>led,</b> <b>face</b> to face versus remote, timing of follow-up service); possible differences in services related to country (developed versus developing country); and whether participants had delirium within the ICU setting...|$|E
40|$|The Programmable Display Pushbutton (PDP) is a {{pushbutton}} device {{available from}} Micro Switch {{which has a}} programmable 16 x 35 matrix of LEDs on the pushbutton surface. Any desired legends can be displayed on the PDPs, producing user-friendly applications which greatly {{reduce the need for}} dedicated manual controls. Because the PDP can interact with the operator, it can call for the correct response before transmitting its next message. It is both a simple manual control and a sophisticated programmable link between the operator and the host system. The Programmable Display Pushbutton Legend Editor, PDPE, is used to create the LED displays for the pushbuttons. PDPE encodes PDP control commands and legend data into message byte strings sent to a Logic Refresh and Control Unit (LRCU). The LRCU serves as the driver for a set of four PDPs. The legend editor (PDPE) transmits to the LRCU user specified commands that control what is displayed on the <b>LED</b> <b>face</b> of the individual pushbuttons. Upon receiving a command, the LRCU transmits an acknowledgement that the message was received and executed successfully. The user then observes the effect of the command on the PDP displays and decides whether or not to send the byte code of the message to a data file so that it may be called by an applications program. The PDPE program is written in FORTRAN for interactive execution. It was developed on a DEC VAX 11 / 780 under VMS. It has a central memory requirement of approximately 12800 bytes. It requires four Micro Switch PDPs and two RS- 232 VAX 11 / 780 terminal ports. The PDPE program was developed in 1985...|$|E

Both the rotating overhead light and the hood light have traditionally been synonymous with the MSP. The rotating red light has been used by the MSP since 1960 and the current style red overhead light has been in use by the agency since 1979. The red overhead lights on some MSP cars are 20-25 years old.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reflector}} forms {{a narrow}} beam called the [...] "throw", while light emitted forward misses the reflector and forms a wide flood or [...] "spill" [...] of light.

Variable focus [...] "zoom" [...] or [...] "flood to throw" [...] lights may move the reflector or lens or they may move the emitter; moving the emitter presents the designer {{with the problem of}} maintaining heat dissipation for the LED.|$|R

40|$|A {{portable}} instrument for oxygen determination, {{based on the}} quenching of phosphorescent octaethylporphyrin by gaseous O 2 has been developed using the fluorimetric paired emitter–detector diode technique (FPEDD). The instrument configuration consists of two light emitting diodes (<b>LEDs)</b> <b>facing</b> each other including an interchangeable support containing a phosphorescent membrane in between, in {{which one of the}} LEDs is used as the light source (emitter LED) and the other working in reverse bias mode as the light detector. The feasibility of using a LED as a luminescent detector is studied. Its small size allows the integration of the instrument into a portable measurement system.

40|$|Ultra violet light {{emitting}} diodes (UV <b>LEDs)</b> <b>face</b> critical limitations in both the injection efficiency and light extraction efficiency due to the resistive and absorbing p-type contact layers. In this work, we investigate the design and application of polarization engineered tunnel junctions for ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN (Al mole fraction higher than 50 %) materials towards highly efficient UV LEDs. We demonstrate that polarization-induced 3 D charge is beneficial in reducing tunneling barriers especially for high composition AlGaN tunnel junctions. The design of graded tunnel junction structures could lead to low tunneling resistance below 10 - 3 Ohm cm 2 and low voltage consumption below 1 V (at 1 kA/cm 2) for high composition AlGaN tunnel junctions. Experimental demonstration of 292 nm emission was achieved through non-equilibrium hole injection into wide bandgap materials with bandgap energy larger than 4. 7 eV, and detailed modeling of tunnel junctions shows {{that they can be}} engineered to have low resistance, and can enable efficient emitters in the UV-C wavelength range.

In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke's ecclesiastical supporters to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen. Mortemer thus marked another {{turning point in}} William's growing control of the duchy, although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060. Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the Battle of Varaville. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William's lifetime. In 1058, William invaded the County of Dreux and took Tillières-sur-Avre and Thimert. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the Siege of Thimert dragged on for two years until Henry's death.

50|$|All opto-isolators {{described}} {{so far are}} uni-directional. Optical channel always works one way, {{from the}} source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be it photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light. But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes, are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way opto-isolator {{from a pair of}} LEDs. The simplest bidirectional opto-isolator is merely a pair of <b>LEDs</b> placed <b>face</b> to face and held together with heat-shrink tubing. If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a glass fiber insert.|$|R
