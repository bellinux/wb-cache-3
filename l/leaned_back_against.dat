25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entr√©e that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, I <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall on my inside banquette {{and looked at}} him in frank astonishment.|$|E
2500|$|As {{he knelt}} {{to help a}} recruit load his rifle during the Battle of Chancellorsville on Plank Road, George Right Smith was also struck in the back by a mini-ball. He sat down and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a tree {{thinking}} he [...] "would surely die." [...] But, {{after a few minutes}} he found that the bullet had been spent after passing through his bed-roll leaving only a minor wound.|$|E
60|$|Blake made {{a sudden}} movement, and then <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the railing.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped his}} arm, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> heavily <b>against</b> {{the wall behind}} her.|$|R
50|$|The {{device was}} a new {{practical}} way {{of being able to}} <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a wall without slipping while sitting in a common Shaker ladder-back wooden chair. It prevented damage to carpets and scraping the floors usually caused by the back legs of chairs when they slipped.|$|R
50|$|The West Asian Arab region {{comprises}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{most of the}} Levant (excluding Cyprus and Israel), most of Mesopotamia (excluding parts of Turkey and Iran) and the Persian Gulf region. The peninsula is roughly a tilted rectangle that <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the slope of northeast Africa, the long axis pointing toward Turkey and Europe.|$|R
60|$|Thacker <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> {{the wall}} and held his glass up to the light.|$|E
60|$|He {{wrote the}} letters down, while Jackson <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall, in patient quiet.|$|E
60|$|He kicked {{one foot}} out, and disgustedly {{contemplated}} a burst white shoe, while the duck trousers cracked. Valentine <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the bulkhead and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Louis {{declined}} {{the chair to}} which I waved him. He <b>leaned</b> slightly <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the table, facing me.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{sat down}} as he said this, and, uttering a sort of groan, <b>leaned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a tree.|$|R
60|$|Some of them {{squatted down}} in the muddy road, the luckier ones managed to <b>lean</b> their <b>backs</b> <b>against</b> the slimy walls.|$|R
6000|$|... "St. John's!" [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> {{the piano}} and laughed unrestrainedly. [...] "That's a good one, to think how {{straight}} I've been talking to you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the window, but, {{in spite of}} his usual {{listless}} manner, they almost fancied that the face in shadow was a little pale.|$|E
60|$|Her grip relaxed. Her hands dropped {{slowly to}} her side. She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> {{the circle of}} his arms, {{and looked up at}} him--a strange look, full of a sweet humility.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy put {{his hands}} in his pockets, and turned away. He walked to the mantelpiece, and <b>leaned</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Her head drooped. She shivered as if {{the cold}} night air had struck her, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> wearily <b>against</b> the parapet of the wall.|$|R
60|$|Harry. That's just it. (<b>Leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> post again.) Hard luck. (Insinuating.) But {{there was}} never a time in all my travels that a woman of the right sort did not turn up to help me out of a fix. I don't know why. It's perhaps because they know without telling that I love them all. (Playful.) I've almost fallen in love with you, Miss Bessie.|$|R
60|$|Lady Glyde was {{not strong}} enough to bear the {{surprise}} of this extraordinary statement. She turned fearfully pale, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall, looking at her husband in dead silence.|$|E
60|$|At this {{declaration}} poor Barbara {{gasped and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> her pillow. Alan stood silent, though his lips turned white, while Jeekie thrust his big {{head through the}} tent opening and stared upwards.|$|E
60|$|As for Stephen, he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the {{framework}} of the conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,--love, rage, and confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that he had offended Maggie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Boston's a great place," [...] Ransom rejoined inattentively. He was not {{listening}} to the policeman or to the organ now, {{for the sound of}} voices had reached him {{from the other side of}} the door. The policeman took no further notice of it than to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the panels, with folded arms; and there was another pause, between them, during which the playing of the organ ceased.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} on a log and took out an old corncob pipe. When it was filled and lighted he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> contentedly <b>against</b> a {{friendly}} stump.|$|R
50|$|The {{security}} {{of their family}} structure, {{as well as their}} speed and agility in closed rainforest protects them against most feral animal attacks. When the animal is resting, it sits on the base of its tail whilst placing the rest of it between the hind legs. The animal then <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a rock or sapling. As it falls asleep, its head leans forward to rest on the tail or on the ground beside it.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} in the window-sill and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the corner. She had slept well, and she was not afraid of the sunshine--blue, too, was her most {{becoming}} colour. He looked at her admiringly.|$|E
60|$|Tom <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a tree, and in {{a minute}} more was in slumber-land. When the others awoke, they did not disturb him, {{consequently}} it was some time after sunrise {{when he opened his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{withdrew from}} {{his arms and}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> <b>against</b> {{the corner of the}} sofa. It was {{absolutely}} necessary to say what was gnawing at her heart-strings, but she felt ashamed and could not look at him.|$|E
60|$|Anna spoke earnestly, and {{her face}} quite shone with {{friendly}} zeal; while her eyes were full of unspoken admiration and regard for this friend, who seemed tottering {{on the verge of}} a precipice. She expected a serious reply,--thanks, at least, for her interest; and great was her surprise to see Frank <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the vine-wreathed pillar behind him, and laugh till a shower of rose-leaves came fluttering down on both their heads.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you mean?' said Bounderby, {{getting up}} to <b>lean</b> his <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the chimney-piece. 'What are you talking about? You took her for better for worse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is enough, Rujub," [...] Bathurst said, for he felt Isobel <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> heavily <b>against</b> {{the hand}} which he {{held at the}} back of her chair, and felt sure that she had fainted.|$|R
60|$|A violent fit of {{coughing}} doubled Omar up, and {{he rocked}} himself to and fro, wheezing and moaning in turns, while Babalatchi {{and the girl}} {{looked at him in}} silence. Then he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the tree, exhausted.|$|E
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the logs, and chuckled so complacently {{at his own}} conceit that it {{was hard}} to believe this easy-tempered {{creature}} was draining half my neighbors' blood; but I was filled with a great loathing for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} get off, I suppose," [...] she said. [...] "I don't believe I'm going any farther." [...] She <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> {{the bars of}} the bench, and put up one of her slim arms along the top.|$|E
60|$|All of {{the company}} save Dickey and Johnny seated {{themselves}} at the table, and began to make a hearty but hurried meal. Johnny stood up in a careful manner, and got along very well, but poor Dickey could neither sit down nor help himself. He made one or two vain efforts {{to pick up a}} biscuit from the table, but his armor would not permit, and he was about to <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the wall in helpless indignation, when Mrs. Green noticed him.|$|R
60|$|Isaac's head ached and throbbed so {{that after}} he had {{satisfied}} his thirst and hunger {{he was glad to}} close his eyes and <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the tree. Engrossed in thoughts of the home he might never see again, he had lain there an hour without moving, when he was aroused from his meditations by low guttural exclamations from the Indians. Opening his eyes he saw Crow and another Indian enter the glade, leading and half supporting a third savage.|$|R
50|$|For a {{good portion}} of the fight <b>against</b> Foreman, Ali <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the ropes and covers up, letting Foreman wildly throw punches at him. During the fight, Ali realizes that he has to react sooner or else he will be knocked out or {{possibly}} die in the ring. As the rounds go on, Foreman tires himself out and Ali takes advantage. He quickly knocks out the tired Foreman, and the film ends with Ali regaining the Heavyweight Championship of which he was previously stripped.|$|R
