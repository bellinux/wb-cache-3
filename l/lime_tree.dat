25|$|The Heuvel, {{one of the}} {{important}} squares, had its own <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> until 27 April 1994, being chopped for a bicycle parking basement. The felling led to many protests, because the tree was still healthy. After the Pieter Vreedeplein reconstruction, plans were made to plant a descendant of the original <b>lime</b> <b>tree.</b> Three were placed, only one of them survived. The last living tree was moved to another location again, but died shortly after. As of 23 November 2011, no more descendants have been placed.

25|$|Cricket {{grounds in}} most parts of the world are devoid of any trees or shrubs. The <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> at the St Lawrence Ground was an exception: the ground opened as the Beverley Ground in 1847, and was built around the tree. The {{presence}} of a tree within the playing area required special local rules. Shots blocked by the tree were counted as a four. Only four cricketers have cleared the tree to score a six: Arthur 'Jacko' Watson of Sussex in 1925, the West Indies' Learie Constantine (1928), Middlesex's Jim Smith (1939), and Carl Hooper (1992).|$|E

The original tree, around which the ground was built, was broken in two by high winds in January 2005 and replaced by a smaller replacement <b>lime</b> <b>tree</b> later in the same year. The ground hosts the annual Canterbury Cricket Week, the oldest cricket festival in the world. This dates from 1842 and has been held at the ground since the club moved there.|$|E

Plans are currently underway to substitute semi-dwarf Valencia oranges. This replacement is due primarily to a need to remove current trees for structural repairs and waterproofing of central plant ceilings. The trees will be mulched and used for ground cover in compliance with project commitments to sustainability. The decision not to replant additional <b>lime</b> <b>trees</b> stems from dissatisfaction with {{the manner in which}} the current trees defoliate and turn yellow in the shade.

500|$|The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{rented the}} cottage {{for three years}} from 1797. As well as writing poetry he was a {{literary}} critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was {{a founder of the}} Romantic Movement in England {{and a member of the}} Lake Poets. It was while he was living in Nether Stowey that Coleridge wrote This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, part of Christabel, and Frost at Midnight. While writing , Coleridge was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a [...] "Person from Porlock". It is unclear whether this really happened or was part of a dream but has become a literary allusion for unwanted intruders who disrupt inspired creativity.
