5000|$|The crew {{bring the}} {{children}} {{back to the}} Enterprise, where McCoy evaluates them and determines that they are suffering <b>lacunar</b> <b>amnesia,</b> unaware {{of what happened to}} their parents and unable to grieve. However, when left unattended in one of the ship's rooms, the children chant an invocation and summon a glowing humanoid apparition named Gorgan, who advises them {{to take control of the}} crew and spurs them on by saying, [...] "As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do." [...] At Gorgan's direction, the eldest child, Tommy, uses mental powers to trick the crew into steering the ship towards Marcus XII while presenting illusions that make them think they are still in orbit above Triacus.|$|E
5000|$|Through espionage, they {{discover}} that Curtain exerts {{much of his}} power through devices that interface directly with the brain. Helpers are government agents who were [...] "brainswept" [...] (given total amnesia) and the [...] "special recruits" [...] and former Messengers were given <b>lacunar</b> <b>amnesia</b> in order to forget their kidnappings or Messenger privileges, respectively. They also learn that a device called the Whisperer is transmitting the signals, and also see that Curtain is increasing {{the power of the}} thought transmissions it emits so that it no longer has to rely on other signals. They discover that Mr. Curtain's plan is to soothe the fear created by the Emergency, by using his Whisperer. In addition, Constance begins to hear the voices of individual Messengers during transmission. In order to gain the evidence they need, the children decide that they must become Messengers, and Reynie and Sticky, who know the answers, help let Kate and Constance see their answers, to gain the traction they need. Reynie and Sticky eventually become Messengers, which allows them each bi-weekly sessions with the Whisperer. These sessions are where the messages are transmitted, and they are also very euphoric to the Messengers involved.|$|E
