25|$|Arduengo's {{work with}} DuPont also {{involved}} {{a number of}} applied projects including the flexible polyimide film, Kapton-ZT, that is widely used in electronics for flexible printed circuits, connections, and insulation. Arduengo's research at DuPont often coalesced with his other hobbies outside the laboratory; for example with sports cars (cf. photo in the summary box above). He contributed to development of <b>low</b> <b>VOC</b> automotive coatings by devising catalysts for a novel cross-linking chemistry used by DuPont Performance Coatings in next-generation low-VOC paints. Eventually, DuPont waterborne performance coatings would be used by Lotus on their Elise and Exige models. Arduengo's effort on the industrial-scale syntheses of the catalysts for the paints on which he worked would launch his re-entry into the area of carbene chemistry, {{but this time it}} was to be nucleophilic rather than electrophilic carbenes. The observation that the catalyst syntheses were well tolerant of varied reaction conditions and substituents led Arduengo to postulate that the imidazol-2-ylidenes that were intermediates in the syntheses had to be far more stable than the then conventional wisdom would allow.|$|E
2500|$|Indoor Air Quality {{seeks to}} reduce {{volatile}} organic compounds, or VOCs, and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants. Buildings {{rely on a}} properly designed ventilation system (passively/naturally or mechanically powered) to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated, filtered air as well as isolated operations (kitchens, dry cleaners, etc.) from other occupancies. During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and interior finish products with zero or <b>low</b> <b>VOC</b> emissions will improve IAQ. Most building materials and cleaning/maintenance products emit gases, some of them toxic, such as many VOCs including formaldehyde. These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. Avoiding these products will increase a building's IEQ. LEED, HQE and Green Star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior. Draft LEED 2012 is about to expand {{the scope of the}} involved products. BREEAM limits formaldehyde emissions, no other VOCs. MAS Certified Green is a registered trademark to delineate low VOC-emitting products in the marketplace. The MAS Certified Green Program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long term health concerns. These IAQ standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs: (1) The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) in their LEED rating system (2) The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in their section 01350 standards [...] (3) The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) in their Best Practices Manual and (4) The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association (BIFMA) in their level® sustainability standard.|$|E

To protect people sensitive to exposure to VOCs {{it is important to}} evaluate and select <b>low</b> <b>VOCs</b> emitting paints. In this paper, therefore, twelve different paints provided by local manufacturers were selected for analysis to characterize total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) emissions. Emissions of TVOCs from six organic solvent-soluble paints and six water-soluble paints were evaluated using a small test chamber under controlled temperature, relative humidity and air exchange rates. The major volatile organic compounds in these paints were also identified. The time dependence of TVOC emissions from paint products in the chamber was evaluated. TVOC emissions from organic solvent-soluble and water-soluble paints were compared. The influence of air exchange rate on the TVOC concentrations emitted from organic solvent-soluble and water-soluble paints was also investigated. A double-exponential equation was used to evaluate emission characteristics of TVOC from paint products. With this double-exponential model, the physical processes of TVOC emissions can be explained. A variety of emission parameters can be calculated and used to estimate real indoor TVOCs concentrations...|$|R

A layer of well-aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nano-needles was synthesized on zinc plate at room temperature using an environmentally friendly zinc-air cell system (ZACs).

A porous void-paper separated the electrodes and {{in the presence of}} a low concentration NaOH electrolyte also formed the medium of transferring electrons from the anode to the cathode. In this study, the open-circuit voltage, Voc, were monitored as a function of the electrolyte concentration. The electrolyte concentrations used were 0. 4 M, 0. 5 M, 0. 6 M, 1 M and 2 M. The measured values of Voc were approximately 1. 2 V for all the five different concentrations used.

40|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} can be influenced by mutualistic and non-mutualistic microorganisms. We investigated {{the ability of the}} ericoid endomycorrhizal fungus Oidiodendron maius to influence {{growth and development}} of the non-host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Different experimental setups (non-compartmented and compartmented co-culture plates) were used to investigate the influence of both soluble and volatile fungal molecules on the plant phenotype. O. maius promoted growth of A. thaliana in all experimental setups. In addition, a peculiar clumped root phenotype, characterized by shortening of the primary root and by an increase of lateral root length and number, was observed in A. thaliana only in the non-compartmented plates, suggesting that soluble diffusible molecules are responsible for this root morphology. Fungal auxin {{does not seem to be}} involved in plant growth promotion and in the clumped root phenotype because co-cultivation with O. maius did not change auxin accumulation in plant tissues, as assessed in plants carrying the DR 5 ::GUS reporter construct. In addition, no correlation between the amount of fungal auxin produced and the plant root phenotype was observed in an O. maius mutant unable to induce the clumped root phenotype in A. thaliana. Addition of active charcoal, a VOC absorbant, in the compartmented plates did not modify plant growth promotion, suggesting that VOCs are not involved in this phenomenon. The <b>low</b> <b>VOCs</b> emission measured for O. maius further corroborated this hypothesis. By contrast, the addition of CO 2 traps in the compartmented plates drastically reduced plant growth, suggesting involvement of fungal CO 2 in plant growth promotion. Other mycorrhizal fungi, as well as a saprotrophic and a pathogenic fungus, were also tested with the same experimental setups. In the non-compartmented plates, most fungi promoted A. thaliana growth and some could induce the clumped root phenotype. In the compartmented plate experiments, a general induction of plant growth was observed for most other fungi, especially those producing higher biomass, further strengthening the role of a nonspecific mechanism, such as CO 2 emission...|$|R
