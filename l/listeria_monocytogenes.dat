5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|Food-borne {{pathogens}} {{that can}} survive on lettuce include <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage. However, despite {{high levels of}} bacteria being found on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
25|$|Non{{hemolytic}} streptococci rarely cause illness. However, weakly hemolytic group D beta-hemolytic streptococci and <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> (which {{is actually}} a Gram-positive bacillus) {{should not be confused}} with nonhemolytic streptococci.|$|E
25|$|Listeriosis is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacterium <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes.</b> The outbreak was determined to originate from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado after <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> was found in cantaloupe samples at a Jensen Farms store in Denver, Colorado and at the farm's packaging plant. The batch of cantaloupes had been shipped out over a period from July 29 through September 10 to twenty-five states, including Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recently}} proposed subclass is the Class IIe, which encompasses those bacteriocins composed by {{three or four}} non-pediocin like peptides. The best example is aureocin A70, a four-peptide bacteriocin, highly active against <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> with potential biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} bacteria form biofilms, including gram-positive (e.g. Bacillus spp, <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> Staphylococcus spp, and {{lactic acid}} bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis) and gram-negative species (e.g. Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Cyanobacteria also form biofilms in aquatic environments.|$|E
25|$|Most newborn {{infants with}} CAP are hospitalized, {{receiving}} IV ampicillin and gentamicin {{for at least}} ten days to treat the common causative agents streptococcus agalactiae, <b>listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> and escherichia coli. To treat the herpes simplex virus, IV acyclovir is administered for 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Some weakly beta-hemolytic species cause intense beta {{hemolysis}} when grown {{together with}} a strain of Staphylococcus. This is called the CAMP test. Streptococcus agalactiae displays this property. Clostridium perfringens can be identified presumptively with this test. <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> is also positive on sheep's blood agar.|$|E
25|$|The genes {{encoding}} alpha-toxin (Clostridium perfringens), Bacillus cereus PLC (BC-PLC), and PLCs from Clostridium bifermentans and <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> {{have been}} isolated and nucleotides sequenced. There is significant homology of the sequences, approximately 250 residues, from the N-terminus. Alpha-toxin has an additional 120 residues in the C-terminus. The C-terminus of the alpha-toxin {{has been reported}} as a “C2-like” domain, referencing the C2 domain found in eukaryotes {{that are involved in}} signal transduction and present in mammalian phosphoinositide phospholipase C.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 United States {{listeriosis}} outbreak was {{a widespread}} outbreak of <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> food poisoning across 28 US states {{that resulted from}} contaminated cantaloupes linked to Jensen Farms of Holly, Colorado. As of the final report on December 8, 2011, there were 30 deaths and 147 total confirmed cases {{since the beginning of}} the first recorded case on July 31, 2011. It was the worst foodborne illness outbreak in the United States, measured by the number of deaths, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking outbreaks in the 1970s, or tied with the worst, an outbreak of listeria from cheese in 1985, depending on which CDC report is used.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{have the potential for}} causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of Listeria bacteria. <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} blood-borne infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E

500|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} ways to survive inside phagocytes, where {{they continue to}} evade the immune system. To get safely inside the phagocyte they [...] express proteins called invasins. When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes. Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome. Other pathogens, such as Leishmania, create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. Staphylococcus aureus, for example, produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome: <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.|$|E
500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and cytokinesis. Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and root hair cells.|$|E

2500|$|A riboswitch in <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> {{regulates the}} {{expression}} of its downstream gene. [...] However, riboswitch transcripts subsequently modulate {{the expression of}} a gene located elsewhere in the genome.

2500|$|Hot {{dogs are}} also singled out and {{attacked}} for containing ingredients {{commonly found in}} prepared meat products. [...] An unopened package of franks contains ingredients that {{have the potential for}} promoting the growth of Listeria bacteria. <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> can also cause [...] serious infections in infants [...] and pregnant women, and can be transmitted to an infant in utero or after birth. [...] Adults with suppressed immune systems can also be negatively affected. Prevention involves heating the hot dogs to a temperature that will kill pathogens.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have {{approved}} several bacteriophage products. LMP-102 (Intralytix) was approved for treating ready-to-eat (RTE) poultry and meat products. In that same year, the FDA approved LISTEX (developed and produced by Micreos) using bacteriophages on cheese to kill <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> bacteria, giving them {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) status. In July 2007, the same bacteriophage were approved {{for use on}} all food products. [...] In 2011 USDA confirmed that LISTEX is a clean label processing aid and is included in USDA. Research in the field of food safety is continuing to see if lytic phages are a viable option to control other food-borne pathogens in various food products.|$|E
2500|$|Listeriosis is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} bacterium <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes.</b> The outbreak originated from lines 8 and 9 of the Maple Leaf Foods Bartor Road facility (Establishment No. 97B) in North York, Ontario, a neighbourhood of Toronto. There were about 220 possibly contaminated products, each stamped with the code [...] "97B" [...] near the [...] "Best before" [...] date. Since the bacteria travelled through deli meats, which are cooked (and as a result are usually free of pathogens), the contamination likely occurred during packaging. The outbreak was first noticed in July when regular surveillance [...] detected an increase in cases reported. Federal inspectors usually spent less than 5 hours {{a day at the}} plant in the months before the outbreak of the illness, sometimes as little as 70 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombocytopenia {{that starts}} {{after the first}} 72 hours since birth is often the result of {{underlying}} sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the case of infection, PCR tests may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. [...] Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (e.g. Candida sp.), and Toxoplasma gondii. The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (<b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes),</b> Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause souring and spoilage of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also.|$|E
2500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that the contaminated cantaloupe harvest contained four separate <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> strains, which the governmental agency found to be [...] "unusual", but {{was still trying to}} determine the reason. On October 20, it was reported that the FDA officials had found listeria on dirty, corroded equipment used by Jensen Farms, which had been bought used and was previously utilized for potato farming. It was stated by the government that the [...] "equipment's past use may {{have played a role in}} the contamination". Water contaminated with listeria was also found on the floor of the packing plant and it was determined that the workers moving around the plant had spread it, as the contaminated water was also found on the cantaloupe conveyor belt. It was noted by officials that Jensen Farms had [...] "passed a food safety audit by an outside contractor" [...] six days before the outbreak.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} this is found in a study {{published}} in Nature, which showed that mice with a latent infection of a Herpesvirus were less susceptible to bacterial infections. [...] Mice were infected with murine gammherpesvirus 68 (a member of the gammaherpesvirinae subfamily) and then challenged with <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes.</b> [...] The mice that had a latent infection of the virus had an increased resistance to the bacteria, but those with a non-latent strain of virus had no change in susceptibility to the bacteria. The study went on to test mice with murine cytomegalovirus, a member of the betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which provided similar results. [...] However, infection with human herpes simplex virus type-1, a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, did not provide increased resistance to bacterial infection. [...] They also used Yersinia pestis (the causative agent of the Black Death) to challenge mice with a latent infection of gammaherpesvirus 68, and they found the mice did have an increased resistance to the bacteria. The suspected {{reason for this is that}} peritoneal macrophages in the mouse are activated after latent infection of the herpesvirus, and since macrophages play an important role in immunity, this provides the mouse with a stronger, active immune system at the time of bacterial exposure. [...] It was found that the latent herpesvirus caused an increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), both of which lead to activation of macrophages and resistance to bacterial infection.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> {{some species}} of Rickettsia, Shigella flexneri and other {{intracellular}} germs escape from phagocytic vacuoles by coating {{themselves with a}} capsule of actin filaments. L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri both generate a tail {{in the form of}} a [...] "comet tail" [...] that gives them mobility. Each species exhibits small differences in the molecular polymerization mechanism of their [...] "comet tails». [...] Different displacement velocities have been observed, for example, with Listeria and Shigella found to be the fastest. Many experiments have demonstrated this mechanism in vitro. This indicates that the bacteria are not using a myosin-like protein motor, and it appears that their propulsion is acquired from the pressure exerted by the polymerization that takes place near to the microorganism's cell wall. The bacteria have previously been surrounded by ABPs from the host, and as a minimum the covering contains Arp2/3 complex, Ena/VASP proteins, cofilin, a buffering protein and nucleation promoters, such as vinculin complex. Through these movements they form protrusions that reach the neighbouring cells, infecting them as well so that the immune system can only fight the infection through cell immunity. The movement could be caused by the modification of the curve and debranching of the filaments. Other species, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Burkholderia pseudomallei, are also capable of localized polymerization of cellular actin to aid their movement through a mechanism that is centered on the Arp2/3 complex. In addition the vaccine virus Vaccinia also uses elements of the actin cytoskeleton for its dissemination.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{have found}} <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> {{in at least}} 37 {{mammalian}} species, both domesticated and feral, {{as well as in}} at least 17 species of birds and possibly in some species of fish and shellfish. Laboratories can isolate <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> from soil, silage, and other environmental sources. <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> is quite hardy and resists the deleterious effects of freezing, drying, and heat remarkably well for a bacterium that does not form spores. Most <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> strains are pathogenic to some degree.|$|E
50|$|Intracellular bacteria, <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes,</b> {{have been}} shown to stimulate host immune {{response}} through STING. STING may {{play an important role in}} the production of MCP-1 and CCL7 chemokines. STING deficient monocytes are intrinsically defective in migration to the liver during <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> infection. In this way, STING protects host from <b>Listeria</b> <b>monocytogenes</b> infection by regulating monocyte migration. The activation of STING is likely to be mediated by cyclic-di-AMP secreted by intracellular bacteria.|$|E
