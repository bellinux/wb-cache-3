Case reportThe great saphenous vein (GSV) of a 57 year-old man was treated with EVLA. During withdrawal, {{a flash of light}} was seen from a hole that had burned through the introducer sheath. This device was removed and a second sheath and <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> inserted to complete the ablation procedure. A follow-up duplex scan identified a residual length of <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> within the GSV that was removed by an additional surgical procedure. A change in <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> length had not been identified during the initial procedure. DiscussionThis case highlights the importance of routinely inspecting the sheath and fibre following EVLA to ensure that they have been removed intact...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{establish}} a possible mechanism {{of damage to}} a <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> significant enough to cause a retained segment within a patient. MethodsA 21 G needle was used to pierce a VARILASE™ 810 nm <b>Laser</b> <b>Fibre</b> inserted within a 4 F sheath. A tiny pin source {{of light from the}} aiming beam emerged from the needle hole in the sheath. Using laser protection protocol, the generator was fired for one minute at 14 Watts (W) continuous wave. The sheath and fibre were then examined. In a control experiment, we were unable manually to break a fibre where the coating had been damaged prior to the laser being fired. ResultsThe aiming beam was noted to be concentrated {{at the side of the}} catheter at the point of needle damage rather than at the fibre tip. When the fibre was removed from the sheath the distal length, from the point of damage to the tip, was retained within the sheath. Longer firing with the sheath surrounded by a wet towel or a pork loin resulted in complete severance of the sheath and fibre. ConclusionThere are no firm manufacturer's guidelines on whether Tumescent Anaesthesia should be delivered before or after the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> has been inserted into the patient. Some units performing EVLA prefer to do this with the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> in situ as it is easier to image on ultrasound than the sheath alone. The results of this in-vitro experiment would suggest it is possible to cause sufficient needle damage to fracture a <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> when fired. In the interests of safety we would recommend administration of tumescent anaesthesia should always be carried out before introduction of the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre...</b>|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> deterioration leads to a significant decrease of power output during 80 W potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser vaporisation (LV) of the prostate. This decrease results in inefficient vaporisation especially {{towards the end of}} the procedure. For the new 120 W lithium-triborate (LBO) High Performance System (HPS) laser not only higher power but also changes in beam characteristics and improved fibre quality have been advertised. However, high laser power has been identified as a risk factor for <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> degradation. Between July and September 2008 25 laser fibres were investigated during routine 120 W LBO-LV in 20 consecutive patients. Laser beam power was measured at baseline and after the application of every 25 kJ during the LV procedure. Postoperatively, the surgeon subjectively rated the performance of the respective fibre on a scale from 1 to 4 (1 indicating perfect and 4 insufficient performance). Additionally, microscopic examination of the fibre tip was performed. Median energy applied was 212 kJ. Changes of power output were similar for all fibres. Typically, a steep decrease of power output within the first 50 kJ was followed by a continuous mild decrease until the end of the procedure. After the application of 50 kJ the median power output was 63 % (58 - 73 % interquartile range) of the baseline value. The median power output at the end of the 275 kJ-lifespan of the fibres was 42 % (40 - 47 %). The median surgeons' rating of the overall performance of the laser fibres was 2 and the median estimated final decrease of power output 60 %. Some degree of degradation at the emission window was microscopically detectable in all cases after the procedure. However, even after the application of 275 kJ, these structural changes were only moderate. Minor degradation of the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> was associated with a significant decrease of power output during 120 W LBO-LV. However, following an early, steep decrease, power output remained relatively constant on a medium level for the rest of the fibre's lifespan. The subjective rating by the surgeons is in accordance with these findings. Improved properties of the LBO laser and enhanced fibre quality resulted in an only moderate decrease of power output which allowed for a consistently effective performance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn this {{histological}} study, {{the lateral}} saphenous vein of the goat was treated using a <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> {{to which a}} tulip-shaped, self-expandable catheter had been fixed to achieve endovenous laser ablation (EVLA). The catheter centres the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> in the vein preventing {{direct contact with the}} vein wall. This study aims to establish whether prevention of direct contact between the fibre tip and the vein wall prevents ulceration and perforation of the vein wall and perivenous tissue destruction. Materials and MethodsTen lateral saphenous veins were treated, using the tulip catheter, in goats under general anaesthesia. Ten more veins were treated with a normal bare fibre. We used a 980 nm diode laser to provide the energy. Postoperatively the veins were removed immediately, at 10 days and after 3 weeks for histological examination. Destruction of the vessel wall was measured and perivenous tissue destruction was quantified using a graded scale. ResultsUlceration and perforation were prevented when using the tulip catheter. It also achieved more even vein wall necrosis. Tulip-catheter-treated veins show a transmural vein wall necrosis in, on average, 80 % of the total circumference compared to 64 % in bare-fibre treated veins. Less perivenous tissue destruction was seen with the new catheter (perivenous tissue destruction scale: tulip catheter: 1. 7 vs. bare fibre: 3. 8). Three weeks after treatment, we found regression of the perivenous tissue destruction as the healing process continued. ConclusionsEVLA using the tulip catheter avoids ulceration and perforation of the vein associated with treatment using a bare fibre. It also results in more even circumferential vein wall necrosis and less perivenous tissue destruction...|$|E
30|$|Yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) <b>laser</b> <b>fibre</b> {{dissection}} is {{of great}} value for the adhesiolysis (Fig.  3): {{the tip of the}} fibre is visualised and guided to dissect the adhesions. However, in a completely obstructed cavity, this energy is very difficult to be used without orientation. The laser takes very little time to dissect lateral wall adhesions. The technique should be applied very delicately as fibres are very fragile and expensive to replace. In experienced hands, laser can be very effective with minimal tissue destruction. However, be aware that heat diffuses into the tissues, causing thermal damage up to 1  cm in depth and bubbles may be present during dissection hindering the view. Good view is essential in operative hysteroscopy. YAG laser use for minimal access surgery however is very expensive and not readily available in all hospitals.

Over a 1 -year period, otherwise unselected consecutive series of 52 GSVs in 40 patients (36 females, 4 males; age 39 to 63 yrs.) with varicose veins due to GSV incompetence (up to 1, 2 cm in diameter at the saphenofemoral junction) were included. After selective spinal anaesthesia, laser energy (diode laser 980 nm) was administered endovenously. A laser fiber (δ 600 μ; length 2 m) was inserted from malleolus to sapheno-femoral junction. Laser energy (12 - 15 J/sec. - 40 - 80 J/cm 2) was administered either continuously, during constant backpull of the <b>laser</b> <b>fibre,</b> or in a pulsed fashion (on time 1 - 2 sec.; off time 1 sec.; withdrawing the fibre 1 cm every 1 sec.).
