25|$|Individuals with HGPS {{typically}} appear normal at birth, {{but their}} growth is severely retarded, resulting in short stature, {{a very low}} body weight and delayed tooth eruption. Their facial/cranial proportions and facial features are abnormal, characterized by larger-than-normal eyes, a thin, beaked nose, thin lips, small chin and jaw (micrognathia), protruding ears, scalp hair, eyebrows, and lashes, hair loss, large head, large fontanelle and generally appearing aged. Other features include skeletal alterations (osteolysis, osteoporosis), amyotrophy (wasting of muscle), <b>lipodystrophy</b> and skin atrophy (loss of subcutaneous tissue and fat) with sclerodermatous focal lesions, severe atherosclerosis and prominent scalp veins.

Pathophysiological, biochemical, and genetic studies suggest that impairment in multiple adipose tissue functions, including adipocyte maturation, lipid storage, formation and/or maintenance of the lipid droplet, membrane composition, DNA repair efficiency, and insulin signaling, results in severe metabolic and endocrine consequences, ultimately leading to specific lipodystrophic phenotypes. In this review, recent evidences on the causes and metabolic processes of <b>lipodystrophies</b> will be presented, proposing a disease model that could be potentially informative for better understanding of common metabolic diseases in humans, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lipodystrophies</b> are a wide {{group of}} {{diseases}} with various etiology, mainly genetic, metabolic or autoimmune. The treatment of these diseases is chronic {{and not always}} effective. Major concerns for patients with lipodystro-phies are also esthetic defects, especially deformities in the face, neck and upper limbs. There are many surgical methods {{that can be used}} to improve patient’s appearance like fillers, autologous fat transfer and skin flaps. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss surgical techniques used for correction of lipoatrophy and other skin lesions present in lupus erythematosus. In the first presented patient, lipodermal grafts were performed in two stages (first – to both zygomatic areas, the second – to both nasolabial folds). Moreover, the patient was qualified for arm scar plasty. Deepithelialized skin in the affected area was covered with advanced local skin flaps. In the second patient, an extensive scarring lesion on the scalp was excised and the defect was closed with an expanded scalp flap. Patients with <b>lipodystrophies</b> may require aesthetic surgical procedures to improve their appearance. In patients with lupus erythematosus, autologous fat graft in the face area seems to be a safe and effective method of refilling the volume of atrophic tissues. On the basis of our experience, it is worth emphasizing that the process of fat graft resorption is typical. In patients with scalp scars, an effective method of their removal and hairline restoring is usage of the tissue expander. Key words: lupus erythematosus, lipodermal graft, tissue expander...|$|R

40|$|There is {{substantial}} {{evidence that the}} growth hormone (GH) /insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system {{is involved in the}} pathophysiology of obesity. Both GH and IGF-I have direct effects on adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and this system is involved in the cross-talk between adipose tissue, liver, and pituitary. Transgenic animal models have been of importance in identifying mechanisms underlying these interactions. It emerges that this system has key roles in visceral adiposity, and there is a rationale for targeting this system in the treatment of visceral obesity associated with GH deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and <b>lipodystrophies.</b> This evidence is reviewed, gaps in knowledge are highlighted, and recommendations are made for future research...|$|R
50|$|Central obesity can be {{a feature}} of <b>lipodystrophies,</b> a group of {{diseases}} that is either inherited, or due to secondary causes (often protease inhibitors, a group of medications against AIDS). Central obesity is a symptom of Cushing's syndrome and is also common in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Central obesity is associated with glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Once dyslipidemia becomes a severe problem, an individual's abdominal cavity would generate elevated free fatty acid flux to the liver. The effect of abdominal adiposity occurs not just in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.|$|R
2500|$|Naturally, {{since the}} {{metabolic}} syndrome is a disorder of energy distribution and storage, fat accumulation explains {{for a significant}} proportion of cardiovascular risk. However, [...] obesity without metabolic syndrome does not confer a significant cardiovascular risk, whereas metabolic syndrome without obesity is associated with a significant risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This association of metabolic syndrome with diabetes can be illustrated by generalized <b>lipodystrophy</b> (near complete absence of adipose tissue). The animals and humans with generalized <b>lipodystrophy</b> develop signs of metabolic syndrome in the absence of adipose tissue; and the metabolic syndrome progresses to type2 diabetes. Adipose tissue transplantation in transgenic mice with <b>lipodystrophy</b> can cure the type2 diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|Cellulite (also {{known as}} adiposis edematosa, dermopanniculosis deformans, status protrusus cutis, gynoid <b>lipodystrophy,</b> and orange peel syndrome) is the {{herniation}} of subcutaneous fat within {{fibrous connective tissue}} that manifests topographically as skin dimpling and nodularity, often on the pelvic region (specifically the buttocks), lower limbs, and abdomen. Cellulite occurs in most postpubescent females. A review gives a prevalence of 85 to 98% of women, indicating that it is physiologic rather than pathologic. [...] It can result from a complex combination of factors ranging from hormones to heredity.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms include rapid weight gain, {{particularly}} {{of the trunk}} and face with sparing of the limbs (central obesity). Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the collarbone, {{on the back of}} the neck ("buffalo hump" [...] or <b>lipodystrophy),</b> and on the face ("moon face"). Other symptoms include excess sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs, or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or extremely dry and brittle hair. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypocalcemia. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, insomnia, inhibited aromatase, reduced libido, impotence in men, and amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhea and infertility in women due to elevations in androgens. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of GnRH release.|$|E

50|$|In this context, {{it may be}} {{interesting}} that age-dependent downregulation of POLD1 has been observed. although no clinical significance {{has been associated with}} this phenotype as yet.

40|$|Lamin A is a {{component}} of the nuclear lamina mutated in a group of human inherited disorders known as laminopathies. Among laminopathies, progeroid syndromes and <b>lipodystrophies</b> feature accumulation of prelamin A, the precursor protein which, in normal cells, undergoes a multi-step processing to yield mature lamin A. It is of utmost importance to characterize the prelamin A form accumulated in each laminopathy, since existing evidence shows that drugs acting on protein processing can improve some pathological aspects. We report that two antibodies raised against differently modified prelamin A peptides show a clear specificity to full-length prelamin A or carboxymethylated farnesylated prelamin A, respectively. Using these antibodies, we demonstrated that inhibition of the prelamin A endoprotease ZMPSTE 24 mostly elicits accumulation of full-length prelamin A in its farnesylated form, while loss of the prelamin A cleavage site causes accumulation of carboxymethylated prelamin A in progeria cells. These results suggest a major role of ZMPSTE 24 in the first prelamin A cleavage step...|$|R
40|$|A-type lamin {{mutations}} {{are associated}} with degenerative disorders causing dilated cardiomyopathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. Our lab has identified MLIP; a novel protein that interacts with lamin A/C. Knocked down MLIP expression in C 2 C 12 myoblasts down regulates myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD and Myogenin, which delays myogenic differentiation. We hypothesize that MLIP is essential for myogenic differentiation. Our goal is to define the MLIP associated pathways involved in myogenic programming. Gene expression profiling of MLIP stably knocked down C 2 C 12 cells, identified 30 genes implicated in human disease. Mutations in five of those genes (DMPK, HSPB 8, LMNB 2, NEFL and SGCD) cause muscular dystrophy, neuropathies, and <b>lipodystrophies</b> that have phenotypic overlap with laminopathies. Further studies involving the MLIP knocked down cell lines demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} puromycin, MLIP protein expression returns to normal.
