5|$|Liubo: The {{now defunct}} board game liubo {{for the most}} part remains an enigma for modern {{scholars}} still deciphering exactly how it was played; its association with both gambling and divination make it a unique game. The earliest two liubo game boards are found in the Zhongshan Tomb 3 at Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the Chu Tomb 197 and 314 at Jiangling, Hubei. Liubo game boards have been found in several Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) tombs; 1 wooden board at Jiangdu in Jiangsu; 1 wooden board in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 lacquered set of liubo in Tomb 3 at Mawangdui Han tombs site in Hunan; 1 <b>lacquered</b> <b>board</b> in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in Yunnan; 1 bronze board at Xilin in Guangxi. During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game {{as a result of a}} playing session led to a fight between a Western Han crown prince and Liu Xian (劉賢), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (劉濞), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the Rebellion of the Seven States (154 BC). The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe asserts that the set pieces of liubo were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements, wu xing.|$|E

50|$|The {{unglazed}} clay Furo {{coated with}} black lacquer was preferred for formal use. It {{was placed on}} a <b>lacquered</b> <b>board</b> to prevent heat damage. The iron type was set on a paving tile. On {{the edge of a}} Furo a fire window or cut-out opening provided the necessary draft to keep the Sumi burning properly. A bed of ashes Hai was laid inside the Furo and the Sumi placed on top was lighted. The Kama was then set directly on the bronze or iron brazier, but a trivet was used for a clay brazier. Kama for portable ranges is slightly smaller than those used for fixed hearths Ro (Sen, 1979, p. 22).|$|E

40|$|The {{motif of}} Skinner’s room recurs through William Gibson’s Bridge trilogy {{as a place}} of refuge. It is a shack knocked {{together}} from salvage, suspended high on the bridge tower, a place where things and images, old tech and new tech are recombined into makeshift forms. A space for assimilation, where stories are woven together and electricity applied. It is the birds-nest vantage point of a post-devaluation community. In Gibson’s world metaphor is ‘a component like acapacitor’. Here the thought-form fiction of Skinner’s Room is the imaginary location to collect the works manifest in this real life show: A glitched lunar eclipse, a <b>lacquered</b> <b>board,</b> the crackling sound of code dysfunction, a star field of full stops, a speculative map of sound samples, wooden three letter words and a print, painted over, that could just be an image of Skinner’s Room.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} a specific problem met in woodworking practice by the company K that manufactures door frames made of MDF boards (medium density fi breboards). Visible side surfaces of MDF door frames were lacquered with white polyurethane lacquer. Thirty days after installation, longitudinal surface cracks appeared in the lacquer fi lm on side planes of the door frame. Within the research of the said appearance of cracks, testing was carried out of technical properties and free formaldehyde concentration of the original door frame made of MDF boards by the manufacturer K, MDF boards of the same manufacturer from door frame plant, MDF boards made by the manufacturer H and <b>lacquered</b> experimental MDF <b>boards</b> of both manufacturers. The lacquered surface structure was tested by applying 97 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on 5 mm thick lattices that were cut out from side planes of experimental and original door frame samples. The action of acid destructed the lacquer final layer, and pigmented base with other additives was scraped off the surface. It was noticed that the lacquer film on the original door frame made of MDF panels by the manufacturer K had no two-component polyurethane clear base, or that it was applied {{in a very small}} quantity. Lacquer film cracking on side planes is the consequence of in-depth cracks in the structure of MDF panels that occur thirty days after <b>lacquering.</b> Experimental <b>boards</b> designated KE, produced by MDF manufacturer K, have an optimum layer of two-component polyurethane clear base, two-component polyurethane white base and two-component polyurethane semi gloss enamel paint. On side planes of these boards no distinctive cracks were observed. In <b>lacquering</b> MDF <b>boards,</b> it is necessary to apply two-component polyurethane clear base on side planes, and to fully protect the door frames with polyurethane films, and not only the visible planes. The use of load bearing MDF boards is necessary in dry conditions - MDF. LA type, and in increased relative humidity, fibreboards are required for general use in humid conditions - MDF.

5000|$|The {{power system}} became {{operational}} on 19 June 1891 and was run continuously {{for the first}} 30 days. The entire plant required 15 to 20 attendants for its operation. The instruments and controls were rudimentary, solenoid type gravity balance Voltmeters and ammeters mounted on <b>lacquered</b> wooden <b>boards.</b> Workers had to take special care {{because of the high}} voltages used. Power was connected by closing simple knife switches and the system was shut down (the electrical circuit [...] "opened") by a worker garbing a connecting line at the power pole and pulling it out of the arc-light style plug mounted on the pole (a sometime dangerous maneuver that produced 6 to 8 foot (1.83-m to 2.44-m) long high voltage arcs). One continual problem was repairing damage from lightning strikes, a common occurrence at the mountainous location. The alternators were set on paraffin soaked oak platforms to add insulation and Westinghouse engineers tried various types of lightning arrestors. The alternators were designed with removable parts making the task of repairing them a little easier.|$|R
40|$|When using wood-based {{materials}} as exterior layer {{it is necessary}} to coat this material with a weathertight coating. Examinations of test-methods, criteria and requirements have been carried out to identify the weathertightness of liquid or paste-like done coating system. To this end, test-methods for <b>lacquers,</b> particle <b>boards</b> and other building materials have been examined and, where necessary, modified. Four coating systems weathered on building material in natural climate and on pieces of particle boards in conditioned chambers have been tested. The examinations concerned e. g. the moisture behaviour of wood-based materials in building materials, of the particle boards in conditioned chambers and of the coating systems themselves; further on the water vapour permeability, impact resistance, flexibility and adhesive strength of the coating systems as well as the absorption of wood-based materials by the capillary water flow through the water-repellent layers of the coating system. The results of the examination served to derivate a proposal for the testing of the coatings with at least one water-repellent layer on polyurethane (PUR) base. This proposal contains requirements and criteria for the coatings, general statements as to the testing and pretreatment of samples from house facades, the climates which should be applied, the different test-methods and the practical use of these test-methods.
