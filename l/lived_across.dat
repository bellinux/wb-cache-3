5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that were likely among the most basal (primitive) members of the group.

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren.|$|E

5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> {{the street from the}} scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and others}} {{sympathetic}} to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine {{the purpose of the}} meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E

5|$|R. s. annamiticus, {{known as}} the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros, Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticu or Vietnamese rhinoceros, once <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus {{is derived from the}} Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, {{estimated}} at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Notably, the Queen was {{the first}} {{character}} to ever speak in an animated feature film. She was voiced by Lucille La Verne, who achieved her voice change {{for the role of}} the Witch by removing her false teeth. Joe Grant, who contributed the design for her Witch form, noticed La Verne's changing attitude and posture when voicing the Queen and Witch, and sketched these poses and her body language down for animation reference. He also said he based the Witch's concept art on a woman who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> the street from him. The character's foreign dubbing voice actresses included Jiřina Petrovická in Czechoslovakia, Clara Pontoppidan, Kirsten Rolffes, Lise Ringheim in Denmark, Rauni Luoma and Seela Sella in Finland, Claude Gensac in France, Dagny Servaes in Germany, Ilus Vay in Hungary, Tina Lattanzi and Dina Romano in Italy, Tanie Kitabayashi in Japan, Blanca de Castejón and Cristina Montt in Mexico, Zinaida Sharko in Russia, and Helena Brodin, Hjördis Petterson and Lil Terselius in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologist Richard Schodde has {{proposed}} {{the ancestors of}} the two subspecies were separated during the last glacial period in the Pleistocene around 12,000years ago. Aridity had pushed the grasslands preferred by the wren to the north, and with subsequent wetter warmer conditions it once again spread southwards and met the eastern form in northern Queensland and intermediate forms arose. The distribution of the three bi-coloured fairywren species indicates their ancestors <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> New Guinea and northern Australia in a period when sea levels were lower and the two regions were joined by a land bridge. Populations became separated as sea levels rose, and New Guinea birds evolved into the white-shouldered fairywren, and Australian forms into the red-backed fairywren and the arid-adapted white-winged fairywren. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the red-backed and white-shouldered fairywrens diverged from each other around 3 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 5 million years ago from a lineage {{that gave rise to}} the white-winged fairywren.|$|E

25|$|Hagel {{was born}} in North Platte, Nebraska, a son of Charles Dean Hagel, and his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Dunn. His father was of German heritage, while his mother was of Irish and Polish ancestry. Growing up, Hagel <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> Nebraska; in Ainsworth, Rushville, Scottsbluff, Terrytown, York and Columbus, Nebraska. Hagel was the oldest of four brothers. His father, a veteran of World War II, died {{suddenly}} on Christmas morning, 1962, {{at the age of}} 39, when Hagel was 16. He graduated from St. Bonaventure High School (now Scotus Central Catholic High School) in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1964, the Brown Institute for Radio and Television in 1966, and he earned a BA degree in history at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1971.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} of Akra Leuke, Hamilcar began to move northwest; alas, no records of his campaigns exist. Hamilcar had split his forces {{in the winter of}} 228 BC, Hasdrubal the Fair was sent on a separate campaign, while Hamilcar besieged an Iberian town, then sent the bulk of his troops to winter quarters at Akra Leuke. Hamilcar’s sons, Hannibal and Hasdrubal, had accompanied him. The town, called Helike, is commonly identified with Elche, but given that it is situated close to Hamilcar’s base at Akra Leuke from which he could readily draw reinforcement, it cannot be the place where the following events unfolded. It is possible that Hamilcar died battling the Vettoni, who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> the Tagus west of Toledo and to the north of Turduli and northwest of Oretani territory.|$|E

25|$|Marjorie Mazia {{was born}} Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother, Aliza Greenblatt, was a {{well-known}} Yiddish poet. With her, Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics. Guthrie's Jewish lyrics {{can be traced}} to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law, who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie (the Oklahoma troubadour) and Greenblatt (the Jewish wordsmith) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice, despite very different backgrounds. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, classic socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship, both personal and political; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.|$|E
25|$|Logan’s {{friendly}} {{relations with}} white settlers changed after the Yellow Creek Massacre of April 30, 1774. A group of Virginia Long knives led by Daniel Greathouse murdered {{a number of}} Mingo, among them Logan’s brother (commonly known as John Petty) {{and at least two}} other close female relatives, one of them pregnant and caring for an infant daughter. Her children's father was John Gibson, a prominent trader in the region. These Mingo had been living near the mouth of Yellow Creek, and had been lured to the cabin of Joshua Baker, a settler and rum trader who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> the Ohio River from their village. The Mingo in Baker’s cabin were all murdered, except for the infant mixed-race child, who was spared with the intention of giving her to her father. At least two canoes were dispatched from the Yellow Creek village to aid their members, but they were repelled by Greathouse’s men concealed along the river. In all, approximately a dozen Mingo were murdered in the cabin and on the river. Logan was not present in the area when the massacre took place, and was summoned to return by runners.|$|E
25|$|Edward became king in 1042, {{and given}} his {{upbringing}} {{might have been}} considered a Norman by those who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> the English Channel. Following Cnut's reforms, excessive power was concentrated {{in the hands of}} the rival houses of Leofric of Mercia and Godwine of Wessex. Problems also came for Edward from the resentment caused by the king's introduction of Norman friends. A crisis arose in 1051 when Godwine defied the king's order to punish the men of Dover, who had resisted an attempt by Eustace of Boulogne to quarter his men on them by force. The support of Earl Leofric and Earl Siward enabled Edward to secure the outlawry of Godwine and his sons; and William of Normandy paid Edward a visit during which Edward may have promised William succession to the English throne, although this Norman claim may have been mere propaganda. Godwine and his sons came back the following year with a strong force, and the magnates were not prepared to engage them in civil war but forced the king to make terms. Some unpopular Normans were driven out, including Archbishop Robert, whose archbishopric was given to Stigand; this act supplied an excuse for the Papal support of William's cause.|$|E
