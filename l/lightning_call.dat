50|$|Tris has ambient magic with {{weather and}} the earth, {{affecting}} various types of elemental currents, such as the flow of magma or the ocean tides. She is the only known weather mage that can predict the weather accurately, one hundred percent of the time. She can affect the wind, <b>lightning,</b> <b>call</b> rain and manipulate the sea. Once she tried stopping the tide but got sick from doing it. The breezes she controls {{can be made by}} Tris to bring her voices so that she can overhear a lot of talks, {{while at the same time}} cooling her off. She can spin winds and water into threads and balls, shaping them to her need. She can raise shields against spells in a few moments that would take most accomplished mages hours to make. One of her more interesting powers is her ability to sprout lightning and to control it at will, but when she was younger, and when she is angry, her hair sparks lightning or storms came up. This often led people to be afraid of her as with Polyam in Daja's Book.|$|E

25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of <b>lightning,</b> <b>called</b> the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|R

Smokey reveals that even though Doc never raced again after his crash, he found a new happiness in training Lightning. Smokey and his friends teach Lightning and Cruz how to drive smarter than Storm, with Cruz serving as a sparring partner for Lightning. During a final practice race, Lightning has a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence.|$|R

50|$|The Secret Warriors entered {{battle for}} the first time during the Skrulls' {{invasion}} of Earth. Manhattan became a warzone with Super-Skrulls devastating the city. The arrival of the Nick Fury-led team turned the tide of battle enough to rescue the combined forces of the Initiative and the Young Avengers from being killed by the Skrulls. Fury rallied all the other heroes together with his agents and began a series of hit and run attacks on the Skrull forces throughout the city. It took all of them just to take out a few Super Skrulls at a time. A better chance at defeating the Skrull invasion came at the sight of Thor's <b>lightning</b> <b>calling</b> them all to Central Park. There, the team gathered with all of the other assembled heroes and repelled the Skrull invasion.

40|$|Natural {{hazards and}} {{disasters}} can cause major accidents in chemical and process installations. These so-called Natech accidents {{can result in}} hazardous-materials releases due to damage to process and storage units, or pipes. In {{order to understand the}} dynamics of Natech events, accidents triggered by earthquakes, floods and lightning recorded in industrial-accident databases were analysed. This allowed the identification of the most vulnerable equipment types, their modes of failure under natural-event loading, and the final accident scenarios. Moreover, lessons learned for future accident prevention and mitigation were derived. The analysis showed that pipes and storage tanks are the most vulnerable equipment for earthquakes, floods and <b>lightning,</b> <b>calling</b> for more research of equipment behaviour under natural-event loading. The damage modes and states are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the impacting natural event. Toxic dispersion, fires and/or explosions were observed as a consequence of all three types of natural event analysed. In the case of floods two additional scenarios were identified. These are water contamination and the formation of toxic and/or flammable vapours upon reaction of the released chemicals with the floodwaters. The overall number of recorded Natech accidents from all the natural hazards considered in the analysed databases was found to range from 2 to 5 %. JRC. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen oxides are key species {{controlling}} {{ozone chemistry}} in the stratosphere. Mostly originating from the photolysis of N 2 O, a gas source emitted {{at the surface}} by plants and fertilizers, they are also produced by lightning within the 10 - 15 km altitude range, particularly in the tropics, by ionisation of oxygen and nitrogen and eventually also directly in the lower stratosphere by Blue-jets. The NOx concentration due to <b>lightning</b> (<b>called</b> LNOx) observed from high altitude aircraft and long duration circumnavigating balloons during the European projects TROCCINOX and HIBISCUS was shown to increase the NOx concentration by a factor two in the upper troposphere over tropical continents compared to oceanic areas where lightning is less frequent. The question is {{to know how much}} TLEs could also contribute directly into the stratosphere. Although models are predicting significant NOx production by TLEs in the stratosphere, little signature was observed on MIPAS, GOMOS or HALOE profiles during the summer thunderstorm season, but these analyses apply to zonal mean profiles only and moreover the measurements are limited to altitudes above 22 km, leaving open the possibility of a significant contribution of blue-jets between the tropopause around 16 km and 22 km. New balloon experiments and satellite data analyses are in progress which hopefully could provide a clearer answer on the possible NOx production by TLEs...|$|R

50|$|If {{the player}} chooses the dark side, Starkiller raises his saber to kill Vader, {{only to be}} impaled by a {{shrouded}} figure who uncloaks behind him. Kota attacks the figure, but is driven back and force pushed over the edge with numerous other Rebel troopers. As the figure removes his cowl, Vader explains to the dying Starkiller he lied {{when he said the}} cloning process had not been perfected, revealing the figure to be a dark, perfect clone. Starkiller takes one last look at Juno's corpse and dies. The clone kneels before Vader and is instructed to take Starkiller's ship and kill the remaining leaders of the Rebel Alliance. Downloadable content released in December 2010 expands on this ending, with Starkiller's clone participating in the Battle of Endor in which the remnants of the Rebel Alliance desperately attack Endor in the hopes of destroying the Death Star II. The dark Starkiller is sent to eliminate the threat and kills Ewoks and Rebels (including Han Solo and Chewbacca) in the process. Eventually he finds Princess Leia Organa, who is revealed to be a Jedi after the death of her brother on Hoth, waiting for him and duels her. Starkiller succeeds in killing her. Meanwhile, the Emperor scolds Vader for creating the dark copy of his failed apprentice and subdues him with Force <b>Lightning</b> (<b>calling</b> him Skywalker). The Emperor then orders Captain Sarkli to kill the dark Starkiller. Starkiller meditates at Leia's corpse as Star Destroyers loom in the distance.|$|R
