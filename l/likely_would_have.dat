5|$|Heikkinen's {{interception}} of {{a forward}} pass {{proved to be}} the key break in a 70 win over Penn. He also blocked kicks for points after touchdown in one-point wins over Illinois (76) and Chicago (1312). Without Heikkinen’s big plays against Penn, Illinois and Chicago, the Wolverines <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been 152 instead of 44. Even in a 210 loss to Ohio State, Heikkinen blocked two kicks.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick {{said that the}} move was made not because of {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken not wanted {{to move back to}} third base, the Orioles <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E
5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E

5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> avoided these had she been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams would have kept the ship afloat.|$|E
5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, {{it would not have been}} able to be released before November 2011, and <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been so large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E
5|$|In the US {{the song}} was {{released}} as a radio-only single, and was therefore ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. However, it peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number nine on the Hot Dance Club Songs charts. Author Fred Bronson noted it <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the album's eighth top ten hit if a commercial product had been distributed. In Australia, the song received a commercial release, and peaked at number 94 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 1991. Jackson has performed the song on two of her tours, the Rhythm Nation World Tour and on her State of the World Tour in 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} delays, Urobuchi issued an apology to viewers. However, he also {{indicated}} that the postponements could be viewed {{in a positive light}} because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule. Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of the}} series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} the green light (if it existed at all) was never determined. The most <b>likely</b> {{possibility}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a junior conductor's lantern, as they were equipped with filters in multiple colors, including green.|$|R
50|$|Palau {{had also}} limited {{relations}} with the exterior before the 18th century, mainly with Yap and Java. Had {{it not been for}} shipwrecked islanders who took refuge in the Philippines in 1696, Europeans <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> found Palau until much later.|$|R

5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of close ties with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close ties with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, he <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> forced to join the alliance.|$|E
5|$|Both fighters' {{victories}} on April 12 {{cleared the}} way for a July 26 showdown between Cotto and Margarito. The WBA welterweight title fight took place at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, marking the first time Cotto headlined a Las Vegas card. It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 11, 2004, on the undercard of Vitali Klitschko's bout with Danny Williams. According to Bob Arum, the match took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. The Las Vegas notion gained momentum in the previous month when the Nevada Athletic Commission amended its provisional rules on glove size, allowing welterweights to wear 8ounce (227g) gloves instead of the previously mandated 10ounce (284g) gloves. Nearly every other boxing jurisdiction in the United States allows welterweights to fight with 8ounce gloves, and both Cotto and Margarito <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> refused to fight in Las Vegas without their usual glove size. Margarito had to vacate the IBF welterweight title after the IBF mandated him to defend the title against Joshua Clottey. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E
25|$|In October 2001, Air New Zealand was re-nationalised under a New Zealand {{government}} NZ$885 million rescue plan (with {{the government}} taking a 76.5% stake), and subsequently received new leadership.

25|$|Still {{others have}} argued that war-weary Japan would likely have {{surrendered}} regardless, due to a collapse of the economy, lack of army, food, and industrial materials, threat of internal revolution, and talk of surrender since earlier in the year, while others find this unlikely, arguing that Japan may well have, or <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> put up a spirited resistance.|$|E
25|$|Had the Staleys won, {{there would}} have been a three way tie among the Staleys, the Buffalo All-Americans (9–1–1 in 1920, 4–1–1 in league play) and the Pros, each team having one loss.

25|$|Williams <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{approached}} or exceeded Babe Ruth's {{home run}} record {{if he had}} not served in the military, and might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.|$|E

The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of Rumeli (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, Bayezid II.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of the Vietnam war {{upheaval}} in the United States in May 1968, Warner graduated from Yale University with a B.A. degree and intended to go to Yale medical school after leaving Yale undergraduate. Without a college deferment, Warner most <b>likely</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been classified as 1-A, that is to say, classified as available immediately for military service.
