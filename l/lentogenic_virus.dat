40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain F is a lentogenic {{vaccine strain}} used for primary {{vaccination}} in day-old chickens against Newcastle disease (ND) in India and Southeast Asian countries. Recombinant NDV-F virus and another recombinant NDV harboring the major capsid protein VP 2 gene {{of a very}} virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV); namely rNDV-F and rNDV-F/VP 2, respectively, were generated using the NDV F strain. The rNDV-F/VP 2 virus was slightly attenuated, {{as compared to the}} rNDV-F virus, as evidenced from the mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index analysis. This result indicates that rNDV-F/VP 2 behaves as a <b>lentogenic</b> <b>virus</b> and it is stable even after 10 serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs. When chickens were vaccinated with the rNDV F/VP 2, it induced both humoral and cell mediated immunity, and was able to confer complete protection against very virulent IBDV challenge and 80 % protection against virulent NDV challenge. These results suggest that rNDV-F could be an effective and inherently safe vaccine vector. Here, we demonstrate that a bivalent NDV-IBDV vaccine candidate generated by reverse genetics method is safe, efficacious and cost-effective, which will greatly aid the poultry industry in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Newcastle {{disease is}} an avian {{pathogen}} causing severe economic losses to the Indian poultry industry due to recurring outbreaks in vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks. India being an endemic country, advocates vaccination against the virus using lentogenic and mesogenic strains. Two virus strains which {{are commonly used}} for vaccination are strain F (a <b>lentogenic</b> <b>virus)</b> and strain R 2 B (a mesogenic virus). Strain F is given to 0 - 7 days old chicks and R 2 B is given to older birds which are around 6 - 8 weeks old. To understand the genetic makeup of these two strains, a complete genome study and phylogenetic analysis of the F, HN genes of these vaccine strains were carried out. Both the viral strains had a genome length of 15, 186 nucleotides and consisted of six genes with conserved complimentary 3 ' leader and 5 ' trailer regions. The fusion protein cleavage site of strain F is GGRQGRL and strain R 2 B is RRQKRF. Although both the viral strains had different virulence attributes, {{the length of the}} HN protein was similar with 577 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of F, HN and complete genome sequences grouped these two strains in genotype II category which are considered as early genotypes and corroborated with their years of isolation...|$|E
40|$|A {{paramyxovirus}} with a thermostability of 60 min (typical of velogenic viruses) and a mean death time of > 90 h (typical of <b>lentogenic</b> <b>viruses)</b> {{was isolated}} from layers near Mooi River, South Africa. Our results, based on comparative nucleotide sequence {{data indicated that}} the virus is pigeon paramyxovirus 1 (PPMV- 1), a variant of Newcastle disease virus. The F 0 cleavage site contains a 112 RRKKRF 117 motif, and the virus had 98 % sequence identity with PPMV- 1 strains from the Far East. PPMV- 1 was last reported in South Africa during the 1980 s, with this being the first report of PPMV- 1 isolated from chickens in South Africa. </span...|$|R
40|$|Context Pancreatic {{cancer is}} the fourth leading {{cause of cancer death}} in the U. S. Highly {{infectious}} Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains are known to be very cytotoxic for an array of human tumor cell types in vitro and in vivo but the effects of these and avirulent NDV strains on pancreatic neoplasms are little known. Objective Here, the direct cytolytic effects of the avirulent Hitchner-B 1 (B 1) and Ulster (U) NDV strains on 7 human pancreatic tumor cell lines and 4 normal human cell lines were studied. Methods Cytotoxicity assays used serially diluted NDV to determine minimum cytotoxic plaque forming unit (PFU) doses. Results For NDV-B 1, normal human cells were killed only by relatively high doses (range: 471 - 3, 724 PFU) whereas NDV-U killed these cells at low PFU (range: 0. 32 - 1. 60 PFU). Most pancreatic cancer cell types were killed by much lower NDV-B 1 doses (range: 0. 40 - 2. 60 PFU) while NDV-U killed Capan- 1 and SU. 86. 86 cultures at very low doses (0. 00041 PFU and 0. 0034 PFU, respectively). Conclusions On average, 1, 555 times more NDV-B 1 was needed to kill normal cells than most pancreatic tumor cells and 558 times more NDV-U to kill the two most sensitive pancreatic cancer lines. These innately-targeted <b>lentogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> may have meaningful potential in treating pancreatic cancer...|$|R
40|$|Degenerate {{oligonucleotide}} primers were synthesized to amplify nucleotide sequences from {{portions of the}} fusion protein and matrix protein genes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genomic RNA {{that could be used}} diagnostically. These primers were used in a single-tube reverse transcription PCR of NDV genomic RNA coupled to direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product to characterize more than 30 NDV isolates. In agreement with previous reports, differences in the fusion protein cleavage sequence that correlated genotypically with virulence among various NDV pathotypes were detected. By using sequences generated from the matrix protein gene coding for the nuclear localization signal, <b>lentogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> were again grouped phylogenetically separate from other pathotypes. These techniques were applied to compare neurotropic velogenic viruses isolated from an outbreak of Newcastle disease in cormorants and turkeys. Cormorant NDV isolates and an NDV isolate from an infected turkey flock in North Dakota had the fusion protein cleavage sequence 109 SRGRRQKRFVG 119. The R-for-G substitution at position 110 may be unique for the cormorant-type isolates. Although the amino acid sequences from the fusion protein cleavage site were identical, nucleotide sequence data correlate the outbreak in turkeys to a cormorant virus isolate from Minnesota and not to a cormorant virus isolate from Michigan. On the basis of sequence information, the cormorant isolates are virulent viruses related to isolates of psittacine origin, possibly genotypically distinct from other velogenic NDV isolates. These techniques can be used reliably for Newcastle disease epidemiology and for prediction of pathotypes of NDV isolates without traditional live-bird inoculations...|$|R

Based upon phylogenetic {{analysis of the}} fusion gene, these viruses were related to <b>lentogenic</b> class I <b>viruses</b> found in U. S. LBMs and wild waterfowl. An alternative real-time RT-PCR assay which complements the matrix gene assay was developed to efficiently detect class I viruses...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to evaluate an application of an inactive Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine derived from velogenic strain of local Newcastle disease virus (NDV). In this research. the Ira strain of velogenic ND virus was grown in specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs and then was inactivated by formalin at a final concentration of 1 : 1, 000 at 4 °C. The inactive antigen was then emulsified with an oil adjuvant or aluminium hydroxide gel before being administered for vaccination in layers and compared to a commercial inactive ND vaccine. Results indicated that application of these inactivated ND vaccines for booster vaccination following vaccination with an active <b>lentogenic</b> ND <b>virus</b> in pullets nearly producing eggs, resulted in high antibody titre which persisted for considerable long period of time and capable of protecting layers from sick of ND and from reducing egg production. Hence, it could be concluded that the inactivated vaccine emulsified in either oil-adjuvant (lanolin-paraffin) or aluminium hydroxide gel were considered to be highly immunogenic and capable of protecting layers from sick of ND and from reducing egg productio...|$|R
40|$|Three-week-old {{chickens}} {{were given}} sheep erythrocytes or bovine serum albumin intravenously. Seven days later their tears and saliva possessed {{low levels of}} antibody to those antigens. Concurrent infection with <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (NDV) caused {{a significant increase in}} transuded antibody in those fluids. In chickens with circulating antibody to NDV, induced by parenterally administered inactivated vaccine, respiratory infection with heterologous infectious bronchitis virus resulted in limited transudation of anti-NDV. In contrast, the tears, saliva and tracheal fluid of non-vaccinated chickens undergoing primary infection with NDV acquired considerable levels of specific anti-NDV. The {{difference between the two groups}} is attributed to locally synthesized antibody...|$|R
40|$|Mesogenic vaccine {{strains of}} Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{are widely used}} in many {{countries}} of Asia and Africa to control the Newcastle disease of poultry. In India, the mesogenic strain R 2 B was introduced in 1945; it protects adult chickens that have been preimmunized with a <b>lentogenic</b> vaccine <b>virus</b> and provides long-lasting immunity. In this article, we report the complete genome sequence of the hitherto unsequenced Indian vaccine virus strain R 2 B. The viral genome is 15, 186 nucleotides in length and contains the polybasic amino acid motif in the fusion protein cleavage site, indicating that this vaccine strain has evolved from a virulent virus. Phylogenetic analysis of this mesogenic vaccine virus classified it with the viruses belonging to genotype III of the class cluster II of NDV. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a highly contagious and fataldisease-causing virus that affects most species of birds world-wide (5, 6). The genome of the virus, which is approximately 15 kb in size, is of negative polarity and nonsegmented in nature. The virus encodes six main structural proteins, namely, nucleocapsid (NP), phosphoprotein (P),matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (HN), and large (L) proteins. Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines {{have been developed to}} controlNDV infections. The vac-cine strain R 2 B used in the Indian subcontinent has given excel...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (NDV) of {{the vaccine}} strain Clone- 30 was {{reproducibly}} generated after simultaneous expression of antigenome-sense NDV RNA and NDV nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from plasmids transfected into cells stably expressing T 7 RNA polymerase. For this purpose, the genome of Clone- 30, comprising 15186 nt, was cloned and sequenced prior to assembly into a full-length cDNA clone under control of a T 7 RNA polymerase promoter. Recombinant virus was amplified by inoculation of transfection supernatant into the allantoic cavity of embryonated specific-pathogenfree (SPF) chicken eggs. Two marker restriction sites comprising {{a total of five}} nucleotide changes artificially introduced into noncoding regions were present in the progeny virus. The recombinant NDV was indistinguishable from the parental wild-type virus with respect to its growth characteristics in cell culture and in embryonated eggs. Moreover, an intracerebral pathogenicity index of 0 � 29 was obtained for both viruses as determined by intracerebral inoculation of day-old SPF chickens, proving that the recombinant NDV is a faithful copy of the parental vaccine strain of NDV...|$|R
40|$|Interferon {{regulatory}} factor 7 (IRF 7) {{is essential}} for the induction of an antiviral response. Previous studies have shown that virus replication causes the activation or expression of Type I interferon (IFN) in cells, which further activates IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to retard virus growth. In this study, after infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) with the <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (NDV) strain LaSota or the velogenic NDV strain GM, the mRNA and protein levels of IRF 7 showed a significant increase, and part of the IRF 7 protein was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In order to further explore the effect of IRF 7 -mediated innate immune response on the replication of NDV in CEFs, the mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT 1 were measured and the replication kinetics of NDV determined. The results showed that specific siRNA could inhibit the expression of IRF 7 and limit the mRNA level of IFN-α, IFN-β and STAT 1 and, accordingly, the replication kinetics of both NDVs were enhanced after the inhibition of IRF 7. In conclusion, IRF 7 is an important nuclear transcription factor for the induction of Type I IFNs during the antiviral response, which can affect the replication of NDV and spread to CEFs in the early phase of viral infection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{distribution}} of avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) among wild birds in Japan. Surveillance of APMV in migratory waterfowl was conducted in the San-in region of western Japan during winters of 2006 to 2012. A total of 16 avian paramyxoviruses consisting of 3 <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>viruses</b> (NDVs), 12 APMV- 4 and 1 APMV- 8 were isolated from 1, 967 wild-bird fecal samples. The results show that NDV and APMV- 4 are relatively widely distributed among wild waterfowl that migrate to Japan from northern regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was no genetic relationship between the isolates from wild birds and domestic poultry in Japan. However, surveillance of APMVs in wild waterfowl needs to be conducted due to the pathogenic potential of these isolates in domestic poultry.

Sci. 76 (3) : 423 – 430, 2014 Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs), which belong to the genus Avulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae, comprise nine antigenically distinct serotypes (APMV- 1 to 9) [1]. Recently, new serotypes of APMVs, APMV- 10,- 11 and- 12, were proposed, respectively [4, 17, 24]. Although APMV- 1, which is synonymous with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) ...|$|R
40|$|Inoculation of 200 mean egg {{infectious}} doses (EID 50) of <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> strain B 1 (NDV-B 1) {{into the}} air sac of 4 -day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks provided significant protection against challenge of the air sac with 100 chicken mean lethal doses (LD 50) of velogenic NDV-H but no protection against reinfection when the challenge was by the eye. Conversely, inoculation of the eye with 200 EID 50 of NDV-B 1 provided significant protection against challenge of the eye but not of the air sac with 100 chicken LD 50 of NDV-H. Birds that received both antiserum and intraocular immunization were subsequently protected against both eye and air-sac challenge. On the other hand, birds that received antiserum and air-sac immunization were protected only against air-sac challenge but not against ocular challenge. Low levels of passively administered antibody did not prevent infection of the eye or air sac but greatly reduced the mortality rate after inoculation of either the vaccine or the challenge viruses. Passively administered antibody also suppressed hemagglutination-inhibiting and virus-neutralizing antibody formation stimulated by air-sac infection but not antibody formation stimulated by ocular infection. These data {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that local immunity is responsible for prevention of infection, since birds were immune to reinfection at one site and simultaneously susceptible at the other site of infection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow {{pathogenicity}} {{avian influenza}} <b>virus</b> (LPAIV) and <b>lentogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (l NDV) are commonly reported causes of respiratory disease in poultry worldwide with similar clinical and pathobiological presentation. Co-infections do occur {{but are not}} easily detected, {{and the impact of}} co-infections on pathobiology is unknown. In this study chickens and turkeys were infected with a l NDV vaccine strain (LaSota) and a H 7 N 2 LPAIV (A/turkey/VA/SEP- 67 / 2002) simultaneously or sequentially three days apart. No clinical signs were observed in chickens co-infected with the l NDV and LPAIV or in chickens infected with the viruses individually. However, the pattern of virus shed was different with co-infected chickens, which excreted lower titers of l NDV and LPAIV at 2 and 3  days post inoculation (dpi) and higher titers at subsequent time points. All turkeys inoculated with the LPAIV, {{whether or not they were}} exposed to l NDV, presented mild clinical signs. Co-infection effects were more pronounced in turkeys than in chickens with reduction in the number of birds shedding virus and in virus titers, especially when LPAIV was followed by l NDV. In conclusion, co-infection of chickens or turkeys with l NDV and LPAIV affected the replication dynamics of these viruses but did not affect clinical signs. The effect on virus replication was different depending on the species and on the time of infection. These results suggest that infection with a heterologous virus may result in temporary competition for cell receptors or competent cells for replication, most likely interferon-mediated, which decreases with time...|$|R

Materials and methods: NDV LaSota strain {{was used to}} infect the following human cells: non-small cell lung carcinoma (A 549), glioblastoma (U 87 MG and T 98 G), mammary gland adenocarcinoma (MCF 7 and MDA-MB- 453), hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh 7), transformed embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), primary monocytes, lung fibroblast (HF 19), skin fibroblast (NB 1 RGB) and rat astroglia (RCR- 1) at 0. 001 multiplicity of infection. NDV-induced cytotoxicity and expression of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -Yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: Tumor cells (A 549, U 87 MG, T 98 G, Huh 7, MDA-MB- 453, and MCF 7) showed viability of < 44 %, while normal cell lines HEK 293, NB 1 RGB, and RCR- 1 showed 84 %, 73 %, and 69 % viability at 72  hours postinfection, respectively. Proinflammatory cytokine profiling showed that NDV mainly induced the secretion of interferon (IFN) -α, IFN-β, and IFN-λ in tumor cells and only IFN-λ in normal cells. In addition, NDV infection induced the production of interleukin (IL) - 6 in most cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a new perspective regarding the role of IFN-λ and IL- 6 in the mechanism of tumor selectivity and oncolysis of NDV.
