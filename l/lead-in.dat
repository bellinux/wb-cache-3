5|$|Davidson had an {{interrupted}} <b>lead-in</b> to the Tests. He injured himself while batting in {{his sixth}} match, against the MCC, and {{was unable to}} take any further part in the match. He was out of action for two weeks but recovered in time for the First Test at Trent Bridge. He had scored 46 runs at 11.50 and took 13 wickets at 20.92during his preparation.|$|E
5000|$|Editors and caption writers tend {{to avoid}} using clichés and obvious <b>lead-ins</b> (e.g., [...] "Two heads better than one," [...] "Whistle while you work," [...] etc.); and also prefer varying <b>lead-ins</b> {{throughout}} the publication.|$|R

5|$|KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, {{who would}} be {{introduced}} in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did {{not appear in the}} backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed {{the second part of the}} season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a <b>lead-in</b> to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a <b>lead-in</b> to Private Practice. The series ended its run in January 2013 after six seasons.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{had been}} unbeaten {{throughout}} the tour. Between the Fourth and Fifth Test, they played five tour matches. They defeated Derbyshire by an innings, before having a washout against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in {{hand on the}} final day. Australia's final <b>lead-in</b> outing was a two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day.|$|E
5|$|Awake had low viewership and ratings {{throughout}} its original run. The premiere episode, which was originally broadcast on March1, 2012, was watched 6.2million viewers (the most-viewed program in its time slot for NBC since April 2010 and {{an improvement over}} its <b>lead-in</b> show, Up All Night). NBC also won the hour for the 18–49audience, nearly doubling its numbers with those viewers over The Firm. Awake debuted slightly better than the previous drama occupying the slot in fall 2011, Prime Suspect, which premiered with 6.05million total viewers and a 1.8/5-percent share in the 18–49demographic.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that <b>lead-ins</b> are irrelevant. Leno's Tonight Show, in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy <b>lead-ins</b> courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of and running counter to the assertion that his ratings were the cardinal factor in being pushed out of the traditional Tonight Show time slot.|$|R
5|$|Brown {{started the}} tour patchily, {{although}} Australia won their first four matches by an innings. In his first four innings, Brown passed five only once, scoring 72 against Oxford University. He returned to form with an unbeaten 194 against Northamptonshire, helping {{to set up}} an innings win, before adding another 96 in the next match against Surrey. Brown entered the Tests with 504 runs at 56.00 in the <b>lead-in</b> tour matches.|$|E
5|$|In the New York media market, BVT {{sold the}} {{syndicated}} Millionaire to CBS's flagship station, WCBS-TV. In the season that had passed, WCBS' mid-afternoon schedule included the syndicated edition of NBC's Weakest Link, which aired at 4 pm from its January 2002 premiere. Joining Millionaire {{as a new}} syndicated series was a spinoff of The Oprah Winfrey Show hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw. WCBS picked up both series for 2002–03, with Dr. Phil serving as <b>lead-in</b> for the syndicated Millionaire, which was plugged into the time slot that Weakest Link had been occupying.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Marc Maron that summer, Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and {{the actions of the}} network. The demonstrable impact of The Jay Leno Show on the ratings of local news across the country—in some markets as low as fifty percent—was the direct cause of the cancellation of The Jay Leno Show, and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that <b>lead-ins</b> are irrelevant.

5000|$|An {{original}} cast recording {{was released}} by RCA Victor with orchestrations and musical direction by Sid Ramin. The 2008 CD release on DRG Records was re-edited from the first-generation master recording and interpolated five dialogue <b>lead-ins</b> that were not included on the 1958 LP release.

5|$|That fall, CBS Reports, a news/documentary {{program at}} 7:30(et) on Wednesdays, was blamed {{in the press}} for the sharp drop off in the ratings of The Beverly Hillbillies– the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons, but dropped to eighteenth when CBS Reports became the Hillbillies <b>lead-in</b> for its third season. (Hillbillies had aired at nine o'clock before moving up a half hour in 1964.) CBS responded by moving CBS Reports to Mondays.|$|E
5|$|The series earned {{relatively}} average {{ratings for}} GSN's standards. Despite The American Bible Challenge debuting to record ratings for GSN, Beat the Chefs maintained {{less than a}} third of the viewers that tuned in to its <b>lead-in.</b> The series premiere averaged 521,000 viewers, compared to the 1.73 million viewers who watched The American Bible Challenge. The following week, Beat the Chefs dropped to 357,000 viewers, while its lead-out, a sneak peek of GSN's upcoming revival of Pyramid, earned 443,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided {{to pick up the}} series for a full season of 22episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an {{increase}} of 73% in males aged 18–49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its <b>lead-in,</b> Gilmore Girls. Supernaturals first season averaged about 3.81million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1930s {{the roles}} of the piano, bass, and drums in the rhythm section changed {{significantly}} {{under the influence of the}} Count Basie Orchestra. Early swing drumming relied heavily on the bass and snare drums, with a secondary role for the high hat cymbal in timekeeping. Jo Jones inverted that relationship, making the high hat the primary timekeeper and using the bass and snare drums for accents and <b>lead-ins.</b> Basie introduced a rhythmically sparse style of piano playing emphasizing accents, <b>lead-ins,</b> and fills. Both of those changes increased the importance of the bass and guitar in timekeeping, ably held by Walter Page and Freddie Green. The lighter and sparser, yet more dynamic, sense of rhythm expressed by the Basie rhythm section lent greater freedom for the band's soloists and set a trend that would culminate in the rhythmic ideas of bebop.|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and Jason Elen and directed by Jason Bloom, marking Ruggiero's fourteenth writing credit, Elen's first and only writing credit for the show, and Bloom's third directing credit for the series. The episode features several notable guest stars. Matt Czuchry appears as Vanity Fair reporter Norman Phipps, who poses as Logan's half-brother for a story. Czuchry was a series regular at the time for Gilmore Girls, the <b>lead-in</b> show for Veronica Mars. Ryan Eggold appears as Charlie Stone, Logan's actual half brother. According to Variety, the role was initially scheduled to be a recurring one. Series regular Tina Majorino filmed scenes for the episode, although they were deleted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} vehicle and sitcom debut for Shannen Doherty under the working title Wingwoman. Though picked up by UPN, Doherty {{was removed from the}} project {{at the request of the}} network due to her poor reception by preview audiences; she was replaced by Philipps. The show was set in New York City, but filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles and other locations in California.

In addition, he owned a restaurant and club in Escondido, where he filmed <b>lead-ins</b> for reruns of The Lawrence Welk Show.|$|R
5|$|While the {{dramatic}} {{portions of the}} movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot {{in a number of}} different ways. The <b>lead-in</b> to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman {{emphasized the importance of}} caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the <b>lead-in</b> tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Formed in April 1944, No.81 Wing {{comprised}} three flying units, Nos.76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, operating P-40 Kittyhawk {{fighters in}} the South West Pacific theatre of World WarII. Following {{the end of}} hostilities, the wing converted to P-51 Mustangs and was based in Japan {{as part of the}} Allied occupational forces; it disbanded there in November 1948. Re-formed at Williamtown in January 1961, its complement included Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, and No.2 Operational Conversion Unit, operating CAC Sabre jets. The Sabres were deployed to RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory, in 1964 to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces during the Konfrontasi with Malaysia. No.81 Wing converted to Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters before disbanding in December 1966. It was re-formed again at Williamtown in February 1987, to operate the Hornet.
