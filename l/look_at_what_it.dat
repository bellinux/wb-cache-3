In a review Publishers Weekly wrote that [...] "a talented new humorist springs onto the scene: Rakoff has a rapier wit, slashing {{in all directions}} with slice-of-life insights and cutting remarks, sometimes nicking himself with self-deprecation in his dexterous duel with the American experience." [...] Kevin Cowherd {{said that in the}} book, Rakoff [...] "makes a strong bid for the title of Most Neurotic Man on the Planet, and the results are absolutely hilarious – when they're not achingly revealing and tinged with sadness." [...] Max Magee called the collection a [...] "meta-article in which he talks about the particulars and relative merits of his assignment as he embarks on that assignment" [...] and that [...] "the reader feels invited in for a behind the scenes <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to be a disaffected, overly-qualified, under-ambitious journalist as he takes on his fluffy assignments." [...] David Bahr calls Fraud [...] "witty, insightful and typically bittersweet." ...|$|E

There was something about the bank in the newspaper yesterday which upset him dreadfully; he put down his cup of coffee--and went away to the City, without eating his breakfast. I don't like to worry you about it, Amelius. But my aunt seems to take no interest in her husband's affairs--and it is really a relief to me to talk of my troubles to you.

Particularly during this historical moment in the late 1970s, not long after the Black Arts Movement which was a very male-dominated and patriarchal movement, Shange's position as a black woman poet is groundbreaking. She challenges the idea that words and poetry belong to men, and points to how unfair it is that when a woman does something, an 'ess' is added to the title (as in poetess).|$|R

Much of his work is created on location using 'Diary Rooms' - a technique he has pioneered, and then re-contextualised in gallery settings. In 2011 Eland was an official war artist with the British Army in Helmand, Afghanistan. He spent a month on the front line where he set up a series of diary rooms and asked soldiers and civilians, Western and Afghan, to write their stories on postcards. The resulting work has been exhibited worldwide, including the Imperial War Museum, Art Month Sidney, The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum and, in 2014, Derek Eland: Diary Rooms 11 November 2014 - 26 February 2015 - Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art.|$|R
