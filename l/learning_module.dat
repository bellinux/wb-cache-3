40|$|Background Web-based {{learning}} is increasingly {{used as an}} adjunct to, and a replacement for, traditional learning methods. We investigated the impact of web-based <b>learning</b> <b>modules</b> in improving the delivery of undergraduate medical education in general surgery and urology. Objectives To determine if online <b>learning</b> <b>modules</b> improve student performance in general surgery and urology. To determine if previous use of online <b>learning</b> <b>modules</b> promote future utilization of such modules among students. Materials and Methods Four general surgical and urologic web-based <b>learning</b> <b>modules</b> were delivered {{as an adjunct to}} traditional teaching via an online learning management system to fourth year medical students in 2009 and 2010. Each module contained 40 identical pre-module and post-module questions which allow analysis of change in student performance after delivery of these modules. The student t-test and Fisher’s exact test were used for statistical analysis. Results In urology, the mean pre-module score was 22. 4 (SD 4. 3) and the mean post-module score was 33. 0 (SD 2. 1) (P < 0. 001). Students who completed all the pre-module and post-module questions had a mean increase of 12. 8 score points (SD 3. 9). In general surgery, significantly more students completed all of the pre-module (42. 7 % vs. 27. 5 %) and post-module (23. 2 % vs. 7. 3 %) questions for the general surgical modules in 2010 compared to the urology modules in 2009 (P ≤ 0. 001).
