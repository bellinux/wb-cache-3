5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's {{presentation of}} a woman's view on <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the group on the album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> {{has always}} been {{automobile}} racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible), a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill {{behind the wheel of}} his brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of the {{abduction}} of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E

Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. Although it has a cast of stick figures, the comic occasionally features landscapes and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals, graphs, and charts. New cartoons are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.|$|E
25|$|Though {{we cannot}} perfect the {{endeavour}} we should strive for it: the will-to-live constantly renews itself, {{for it is}} both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> are rooted in this same principle, in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so, Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied, not least in the European Middle Ages, and in the Indian Brahminic philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Ranevskaya's {{failure to}} address {{problems}} facing her estate and family mean that she eventually loses almost everything and her fate {{can be seen}} as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). She is a woman who lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son's death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. Cherry trees themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.|$|E

500|$|Film critic Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety, {{summarized}} {{the film as}} [...] "eloquent about love, self-realization and adolescent angst". The main theme addressed in Rocket Science is Hal's coming of age, which is portrayed both by his understanding of love and finding his voice. The film takes its title from Hal's closing quote that understanding <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> [...] "shouldn't be rocket science".|$|E

500|$|... "My Father's Song" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Barbra Streisand for her seventeenth studio album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). It was released as a 7" [...] single in August 1975 through Columbia Records. Rupert Holmes wrote the song in collaboration with its producer Jeffrey Lesser. A sentimental ballad, [...] "My Father's Song" [...] was about Streisand's childhood with her father; Holmes' lyrics involve a protagonist, presumably a daughter, asking for her father's approval in <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{suggests that}} the Kaumodaki symbolizes the life-force (prana) from which all [...] "physical and mental powers" [...] arise. Vishnu's gada also stands for discipline, complemented by his lotus, that denotes praise. While the lotus and shankha in his hands are water symbols representing <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> the gada and the chakra are fire symbols denoting pain and destruction and command adherence {{to the rules of}} society and nature. The Varaha Purana says the gada is to teach a lesson to irreligious rulers. Vishnu is also said to clear illusion by his gada.|$|E
500|$|Savage's In the Shadow of the Pyramids was {{reviewed}} in The Literary World in May 1898.

[...] The [...] "absurd" [...] main character was criticized as unrealistically exposed to mortal danger almost daily, [...] "just escaping dagger thrusts and pistol shots, with results more {{favorable to the}} theatrical progress of the story than to his common sense." [...] The previous month in the same periodical, Savage's 25¢ book For <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> <b>Love</b> was dismissed as [...] "a slap-dash romance".|$|E

500|$|To {{allow the}} market to {{continue}} trading while the rebuilding took place, a set of temporary stalls were built in Gentleman's Walk and surrounding streets. A third of the market's stalls at a time traded from these temporary stalls while their stalls in the main market were replaced, a process taking four months for each third of the market. The rebuilding was officially completed on 25 March 2006. Although generally popular with traders and shoppers, the redesign was criticised by The Times, who described it as [...] "an anaemic shopping mall for health and safety inspectors: straight lines, wipe-clean boxy cubicles, all <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> drained out." ...|$|E
500|$|She was openly {{lesbian and}} began {{publishing}} love poems to women under {{her own name}} as early as 1900, considering scandal as [...] "the best way {{of getting rid of}} nuisances" [...] (meaning heterosexual attention from young males). In her writings she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Renée Vivien and dancer Armen Ohanian and a 50-year relationship with painter Romaine Brooks. Her <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> affairs served as inspiration for many novels, ranging from the salacious French bestseller Idylle Saphique to The Well of Loneliness, the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|Across {{the various}} theologies and philosophies, the common theme {{presents}} Krishna as the essence and symbol of divine love, with human <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> {{as a reflection}} of the divine. The longing and love-filled legends of Krishna and the gopis, his playful pranks as a baby, as well as his later dialogues with other characters, are philosophically treated as metaphors for the human longing for the divine and for meaning, and the play between the universals and the human soul. Krishna's lila is a theology of love-play. According to John Koller, [...] "love is presented not simply as a means to salvation, it is the highest life". Human love is God's love.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham admires {{the track}} as [...] "beautifully put together"; he {{describes}} it as both [...] "some of the most exotic music released under The Beatles' name" [...] and a [...] "philosophical meditation on <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> beyond self... once surrendered to, is {{a central part of}} the Pepper experience". In his book on the history of ambient music, Mark Prendergast includes [...] "Within You Without You" [...] among the album's [...] "three outstanding cuts" [...] and deems it to be [...] "the most timeless piece of dronal psychedelia ever recorded". AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger admires the melody, but he considers the track overlong and notes the potential for offence in this, [...] "the first Beatles song where [...] Indian religious beliefs affected the lyrics with full force".|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] is a {{reference}} to the 1952 historical romance novel A Many-Splendoured Thing and the subsequent film Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955). The title refers to the episode's theme of the many variations of love, as demonstrated by the sexual taboos from the world of Angela Frandina, the dysfunctional relationship of Munch and Felicia, the budding romance between Bolander and Linda, and the twisted love Mitchell Forman harbors for pens. The Forman case was inspired by a real-life murder that took place in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in which a 23-year-old man shot another man 10 times in a doughnut shop when the victim refused to sell the shooter his pen. During the double date Munch crashes, Howard becomes depressed about the hopelessness of <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love,</b> leaving unhappily with Danvers. This scene foreshadows the eventual break-up of Howard and Danvers, which occurs at an unspecified time in the [...]|$|E
500|$|Critics {{consider}} García Márquez's book {{in terms}} of the historical novel, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of The General in his Labyrinth, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar's views [...] "on everything from <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>love</b> to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke". On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had [...] "improved on history". According to critic Donald L. Shaw, The General in His Labyrinth is a [...] "New Historical Novel", a genre that he argues crosses between Boom, Post-Boom, and Postmodernist fiction in Latin American literature: [...] "New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of making sense of the past at all." [...] Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez is presenting both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.|$|E
