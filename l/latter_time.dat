2500|$|The Lambda-CDM {{concordance}} model {{describes the}} evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years of cosmological time. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a singularity called the [...] "Big Bang singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured [...] "since the Big Bang" [...] even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, [...] "10−6 seconds after the Big Bang" [...] is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as [...] "13.8 billion years minus 10−6 seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule <b>latter</b> <b>time</b> interval is swamped by uncertainty in the former.|$|E

He drew on the relationship Owen had shown between fossils of the extinct giant Macrauchenia and the modern guanacos that Darwin had hunted in Patagonia: [...] "The same kind of relation that common ostrich bears to : extinct Guanaco to recent: in former case position, in <b>latter</b> <b>time.</b> .... – As in first cases distinct species inosculate, so must we believe ancient ones: not gradual change or degeneration. from circumstances: if one species does change into another it must be per saltum – or species may perish."

Bishop White participated in the consecration of most American Episcopal bishops during the country's first two decades. He also consecrated two African-Americans as deacons and then priests, Absalom Jones of Philadelphia (in 1795 and 1804, respectively), and William Levington of New York (who became missionary to free and enslaved African Americans in the South and established St.James Episcopal Church in Baltimore circa 1824). Although Bishop White did not travel extensively through his diocese, he did support missionary priests, including Simon Wilmer (who traveled through Pennsylvania and New Jersey and ultimately settled down in what became the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C.), William Meade (who traveled extensively throughout Virginia and ultimately became its bishop, bishop White participating in his consecration) and Jackson Kemper (first in Philadelphia for 2 decades, founded the Society for the Advancement of Christianity and became the Episcopal Church's first missionary bishop). The elderly Bishop White made only one trip to the western parts of his diocese. [...] In 1825 he traveled with Rev. Kemper to western Pennsylvania confirming 212 and consecrating three buildings.

And at that time the transgressors came to the full: for then the High-priesthood was exposed to sale, the Vessels of the Temple were sold to pay for the purchase; and the High-priest, with some of the Jews, procured a licence from Antiochus Epiphanes to do after the ordinances of the heathen, and set up a school at Jerusalem for teaching those ordinances. Then Antiochus took Jerusalem with an armed force, slew 4000 Jews, took as many prisoners and sold them, spoiled the Temple, interdicted the worship, commanded the Law of Moses to be burnt, and set up the worship of the heathen Gods in all Judea.
