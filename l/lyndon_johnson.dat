5|$|After Kennedy's assassination, Congress {{altered the}} Secret Service's mandate to include {{protection}} for presidential candidates. The remaining candidates were immediately protected under {{an executive order}} issued by <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Lyndon</b> B. <b>Johnson</b> School of Public Affairs {{was named}} in his honor, {{as is the}} <b>Lyndon</b> B. <b>Johnson</b> National Grassland.

25|$|The Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston {{was renamed}} the <b>Lyndon</b> B. <b>Johnson</b> Space Center in 1973, and Texas created a legal state holiday to be {{observed}} on August 27 to mark Johnson's birthday. It is known as <b>Lyndon</b> Baines <b>Johnson</b> Day. The <b>Lyndon</b> Baines <b>Johnson</b> Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated on April 6, 1976.|$|R

5|$|Goldwater {{selected}} William E. Miller, U.S. Representative {{and chairman}} of the Republican National Committee, as his running mate for the general election. Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by those familiar with him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> and the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{established}} the Presidential Medal of Freedom on February 22, 1963, but died {{before he could}} award it. Two weeks after Kennedy's assassination, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> awarded it to Meany and thirty others on December 6, 1963. Johnson said the award was for Meany's service to the union movement and for advancing freedom throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers charged that Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who was rumored to be considering a run for president. Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E

U.S. President <b>Lyndon</b> B. <b>Johnson,</b> {{convinced}} of {{the defeat of the}} Loyalist forces and fearing the creation of [...] "a second Cuba" [...] on Americas doorstep, ordered U.S. forces to restore order. The decision to intervene militarily in the Dominican Republic was <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnsons</b> personal decision. All civilian advisers had recommended against immediate intervention hoping that the Loyalist side could {{bring an end to the}} civil war.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> led a {{landslide}} victory for his party, securing another term {{as president and}} taking 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives. Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new Minority Leader. Three members approached Ford {{to see if he}} would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed. After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as Minority Leader.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970â€”the first significant federal affirmative action program. He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed {{both houses of}} Congress in 1972 {{and went to the}} states for ratification. Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> had.|$|E

5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E

5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on its front page. The Tribune became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
5|$|From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky {{chaired the}} National Academy of Science's Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), and was its vice {{president}} from 1965 to 1973. He received several awards over the years, including the Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service in 1957. He {{was awarded the}} Medal for Merit by President Truman, the Medal of Freedom by President Eisenhower in 1961, and the National Medal of Science by President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> in 1967. He was also a recipient of the Priestley Medal from the American Chemical Society in 1972 and the Franklin Medal from Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E

5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} favorite son candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|The third administrator, James E. Webb (1961â€“1968), {{appointed}} by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order {{to implement the}} Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal {{by the end of}} the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President <b>Lyndon</b> <b>Johnson</b> kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E
