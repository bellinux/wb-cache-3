40|$|The {{distribution}} of water fluxes is {{strongly influenced by}} {{the properties of the}} media adjacent to the cathode catalyst layer (CCL), viz. polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and gas diffusion media (GDM). We propose a model that is applied under varying humidification of the cathode feed gas, with water removal in liquid and vapor form. The model warrants the definition of a critical current density up to which water removal out of the CCL could proceed completely via vapor diffusion to the cathode side. Above the critical current density, excessive water generation leads to the build-up of an excess liquid pressure in the CCL, which drives hydraulic fluxes to PEM and GDM sides. Experimental data from literature were analyzed and found to be in good agreement with predictions of the model. This analysis reveals that the effective <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of commercial GDMs (that includes an MPL) lies within the same order of magnitude of the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of the PEM...|$|E

Investigations of the porous network (mercury intrusion porosimetry, apparent density, 2 D and 3 D observations) emphasize an air-entrained stabilisation depending on CE chemistry. We also highlight that CE chemistry leads to a gradual effect on characteristics of the water transport. The global tendencies brought by CE are: higher water retention, lower capillarity water absorption, lower <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> as well as higher water vapour permeability.

40|$|Water {{permeation}} through Nafion® membranes and catalyst-coated membranes are measured. Three {{types of}} <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements are conducted {{in order to}} systematically study {{the effect of the}} phase of water in contact with the membrane: vapour permeation (termed vapour-vapour permeation), pervaporation (termed liquid-vapour permeation) and hydraulic permeation (termed liquid-liquid permeation). Measurements are taken at 70 oC. The largest water permeation flux was observed when the membrane was exposed to <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> on one side and water vapour at the other, i. e., liquid-vapour permeation. <b>Water</b> <b>permeabilities</b> were found to increase: with increasing differential chemical potential developed across the membrane; with progressive hydration of the membrane; and when the membrane is in contact with <b>liquid</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements obtained ex-situ are correlated to in-situ fuel cell water balance measurements at 70 oC. The back permeation (i. e., water transport from cathode to anode), is largely driven by liquid-vapour permeation, and is sufficient to offset the electro-osmotic drag flux (i. e., proton-driven water transport towards cathode). Ex-situ and in-situ water transport measurements were extended to membranes with thicknesses ranging 6 to 201 μm. Under liquid-liquid permeation condition, water permeation fluxes increased with reduction in membrane thickness; under liquid-vapour and vapour-vapour permeation conditions, water permeation fluxes increased with reduction in membrane thickness but changed little for thickness below 56 μm. Estimation of internal and interfacial water transport resistances revealed that interfacial water transport resistance is dominant for thin membranes – explaining why further increases in liquid-vapour and vapour-vapour permeation fluxes are not observed with decreasing membrane thicknesses below 56 μm. <b>Water</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of catalyst-coated membranes and pristine membranes are found to be similar under all three modes of water permeation. The effect of catalyst layer on membrane water permeation is negligible. In summary, the formation of a membrane/liquid interface is found to enhance the <b>permeability</b> of <b>water</b> through Nafion® membranes. In contrast, presence of a membrane/vapour interface diminishes the rate of water permeation. Under fuel cell operating conditions, when the membrane/liquid interface is formed at the cathode, it is found that a sufficient rate of back permeation effectively regulates the water balance within the fuel cell...|$|R

40|$|The Boltzmann {{transformation}} {{method is}} {{used to determine the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> diffusivity from moisture content profiles as measured in a capillary water absorption experiment. An inter-laboratory comparison for analyzing the reliability of the determination method showed that the inaccuracy in the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> diffusivity is caused by scatter in the transformed data and by uncertainty in the boundary conditions at the intake surface and ahead of the steep moisture front. A methodology is proposed based on (1) the evaluation of the validity of the diffusion approach, (2) a simplified handling of the boundary conditions, (3) smoothing of the scattered data and (4) the evaluation {{of the quality of the}} determined <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> diffusivity. For HAM (Heat-Air-Moisture transport) calculations values of the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> diffusivity for moisture contents higher than the capillary moisture content are disregarded.

To describe the moisture diffusivity including <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> and water vapour transports, a new parametric description of the moisture diffusivity is presented, which shows sufficient flexibility both in the hygroscopic and overhygroscopic ranges.

40|$|Vasopressin-regulated water {{reabsorption}} {{through the}} water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) in renal collecting ducts maintains body water homeostasis. Vasopressin activates PKA, which phosphorylates AQP 2, and this phosphorylation event is required to increase the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> and <b>water</b> reabsorption of the collecting duct cells. It has been established that the phosphorylation of AQP 2 induces its apical membrane insertion, rendering the cell water-permeable. However, whether this phosphorylation regulates the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of this channel still remains unclear. To clarify the role of AQP 2 phosphorylation in <b>water</b> <b>permeability,</b> we expressed recombinant human AQP 2 in Escherichia coli, purified it, and reconstituted it into proteoliposomes. AQP 2 proteins not reconstituted into liposomes were removed by fractionating on density step gradients. AQP 2 -reconstituted liposomes were then extruded through polycarbonate filters to obtain unilamellar vesicles. PKA phosphorylation significantly increased the osmotic <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of AQP 2 -reconstituted liposomes.

40|$|International audienceMoisture {{transport}} in cementitious {{materials is}} directly related to the durability of concrete structures. When the material loses moisture, the drying shrinkage induces cracks which are harmful to the solid body. When liquid moves into the material, it can carry aggressive ions. Hence, moisture transport properties are important to cope with durability issues. The present paper is focused on two ways to enhance our understanding of moisture transport properties of cementitious materials. They are based on the indirect determination of the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> and water vapour diffusion coefficient. The first one is known as the " inverse analysis " method. In a moisture transport model, the liquid permeability and diffusion coefficient can be adjusted in order to fit the measured mass loss curves and water content profiles. In the second way, measured apparent diffusion coefficient (also called moisture diffusivity) curves are fitted over a large range of relative humidity (RH) by a general expression which includes both liquid transport and vapour diffusion. Due to different RH ranges of predominance of liquid and vapour transport, the liquid water perme-ability and vapour diffusion coefficient can be determined separately. Input experimental data on cement pastes are collected from the literature. Discussions on relative permeability and Knudsen diffusion show a significant influence on modelling of moisture transport. A further comparison with measured permeability data is able to provide a better understanding of moisture transport properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{unlimited}} {{decrease in}} the liquid water coefficient of permeability, kw, with increasing soil suctions produces a shut off of water flow. It is known, however, that significant quantities of water flow occur even at relatively high soil suctions and the extremely small values for kw can cause serious difficulties in the numerical solution of seepage problems. The objective {{of the present study}} is to suggest an appropriate lower limit for kw in order to ameliorate numerical difficulties. Two approaches for imposing lower limit for kw were evaluated. First, the residual conditions were used for the calculation of the minimum value of kw. The values of kw at the residual conditions were found to provide an inappropriate lower limit for kw. The second approach was based on the water vapour flow theory. A vapour permeability function was developed and used to determine the change in water vapour permeability with suction. Based on the comparison of liquid water and overall permeability functions, a lower limit for kw was established.

40|$|In this thesis, water {{management}} in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells is analyzed. To find strategies for minimizing the major loss mechanisms that occur due to flooding, a focus {{is put on}} liquid water transport in the porous transport layer (PTL). A novel method to visualize the liquid water percolation in the PTLs using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) is developed. Compared to existing visualization techniques, the method enables to phenomenologically investigate the liquid water transport mechanisms with low experimental cost and high temporal and spatial resolution. The water transport mechanisms are investigated by analyzing the impact of different local PTL modifications on the {{water management}} by applying ESEM and synchrotron imaging, in-situ performance characterization and water balancing. Different indications on a beneficial drainage effect are found, which results in a reduced saturation {{in the vicinity of}} the modifications in the fibrous substrate (FS). Further findings indicate that interfacial water between the microporous layer (MPL) and the catalyst layer is the most decisive for the success of the perforation approach but also for the performance with unmodified PTLs. The identified transport mechanisms are implemented in a 3 -dimensional fuel cell model containing the thermodynamic processes that are most relevant for 2 -phase water analysis. As a module, a novel approach to model the liquid water percolation is developed. The liquid water distribution and movement is described by considering all stable water paths within the FS. By determining the transitions between the stable paths, a network is generated which is used as a basis for a fast and computationally inexpensive calculation of the liquid water percolation. After the network generation step, liquid water can either be injected through one of the PTL boundaries or directly into the FS bulk e. g. as by condensation. The discrete water path network model is coupled with a continuum model including the fuel cell thermodynamic processes and an iterative coupling algorithm is developed to match the input and output of the two model modules. Using the model, the ad- and desorption rate of the catalyst layer and the in-plane <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> close to the catalyst layer/PTL interface are identified as important parameters for the overall fuel cell performance. A major contributor to the beneficial effects of the MPL is found to be the altered processes close to the CCL/ PTL interface...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspects of}} durability of Swedish softwood in above ground applications. The thesis {{consists of a}} summary of nine papers, which all aim to explain the existing variation in above ground microbial durability and moisture sensitivity of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The methods used were two field tests, one accelerated durability test, and three water permeability tests. The main conclusions made {{in the study were}} that Norway spruce sapwood is more susceptible to discolouring fungi than heartwood. With respect to Scots pine, the only important factor for its natural durability above ground was whether the samples consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. There was also no systematic variation between pine heartwood from different stand origins in above ground conditions. Origin had no influence on durability in practice for neither spruce nor pine. Furthermore, in contradiction with traditional thinking, annual ring width and density had no influence on durability in any of the tests. The material came from two different samplings. The ‘old’ material was sampled {{in the beginning of the}} 1980 s and consisted of Scots pine and Norway spruce from three different origins: the north, the central area, and the south of Sweden. The material was subjected to different handling conditions and surface and end-grain treatments. The ‘old’ material was used in a large above ground field test, carried out between 1985 and 1994. Unfortunately, the spruce sapwood and heartwood was not separated in this field test. In the field trial with the ‘old’ material, the most important factor for the durability of Norway spruce was the samples’ surface- and end-grain treatment. It was also observed that untreated spruce showed better durability than samples that were painted but without proper end-grain treatment. Samples originating from one of the stands were more sensitive towards air-drying than samples from the other two, which was reflected in a higher average moisture content and mass loss for the untreated samples. With respect to Scots pine, the most important factor was whether the sample consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. The heartwood samples were durable irrespective of their previous treatment. The Scots pine sapwood samples, on the other hand, had a very fluctuating moisture content if they were not surface- and end-painted. This was also reflected in higher mass losses in these samples. Even when properly surface- and end grain treated, the sapwood samples did not perform as well as the heartwood samples. The ‘new’ material consisted of Scots pine taken from six different stands, and Norway spruce from five different stands, all from areas in southern Sweden. The sampling was performed in order to achieve a large variation in wood properties. Thus, logs from areas with different climate and growth conditions were collected. This material was used for laboratory tests, and also for the second field test, which was evaluated after a test period of two years. In the second field test untreated Scots pine and Norway spruce samples from the ‘new’ material were investigated. Effects of origin and different tree diameters were examined. Furthermore, Scots pine was separated to heartwood and sapwood, and Norway spruce to mature and juvenile wood. The Norway spruce samples were sawn with vertical or horizontal annual rings. For the Norway spruce in the second field test, vertical annual rings were shown to be very beneficial for avoiding crack formation, while samples with horizontal annual rings displayed a large number of cracks. Despite this, the larger number of cracks did not result in a higher moisture content or more fungal discoloration. Juvenile wood had a slightly higher average discolouring fungal growth grading than the other spruce samples. For Scots pine, the only factor of importance was whether the samples consisted of heartwood or of sapwood. Annual ring width, density and origin had no significant effect on either fungal growth or moisture uptake. This observation held for both Norway spruce samples and Scots pine samples. An accelerated test was run in order to investigate Norway spruce sapwood and heartwood with respect to their differences in durability towards discolouring fungi and moisture uptake. The Mycologg method was used to accelerate fungal growth during a number of forced moisture cycles. The results showed that sapwood was much more sensitive to discolouring fungi than heartwood. Sapwood also recorded a higher average moisture content than heartwood. The differences that were observed between the types of samples were not due to annual ring width, density or origin. It was observed that Norway spruce sapwood samples and heartwood samples showed differences in <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> <b>permeability.</b> This observation was made especially evident in a droplet absorption test. Water droplets were absorbed much faster on the sapwood samples in comparison with the heartwood samples. This higher affinity to water suggested that a sapwood surface would reach a higher moisture content than a heartwood surface. This observation provides a major explanation of why the sapwood samples showed poorer durability towards discolouring fungi in the Mycologg trials...|$|E

When inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) -channels were blocked, 10 mM [K +] o also induced a calcium increase and the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> increase no longer persisted. In conclusion, we find that elevation of extracellular potassium regulates AQP 4 and astrocyte <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> via intracellular signaling involving cAMP. A prolonged increase of astrocyte <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> is Kir-channel dependent and this response can be impeded by intracellular calcium signaling. Our results support the concept of coupling between AQP 4 and potassiu...|$|R

Silver {{and gold}} {{compounds}} were tested as potential inhibitors of aquaporins of plant- and human origin. Silver as AgNO₃ or silver sulfadiazine inhibited with high potency (EC₅₀ 1 – 10 μM) the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of the peribacteroid membrane from soybean (containing Nodulin 26), the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of plasma membrane from roots (containing plasma membrane integral proteins), and the <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> of human red cells (containing aquaporin 1). Gold as HAuCl₄ was less effective but still inhibited peribacteroid membrane <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> (EC₅₀= 10 μM).

This study presents an analytical model {{based on the}} concept of REV (Representative Element Volume) to assess the effect of <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> in cold joint concrete. Here, OPC (Ordinary Portland Cement) concrete samples with cold joint are prepared and WPT (<b>Water</b> <b>Permeability</b> Test) is performed on the samples cured for 91 days. In order to account for the effect of GGBFS (Granulated Ground Blast Furnace Slag) on <b>water</b> <b>permeability,</b> concrete samples with the same W/B (Water to Binder) ratio and 40 % replacement ratio of GGBFS are tested as well. Utilizing the previous models handling porosity and saturation, the analysis technique for equivalent <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> with effective cold joint width is proposed. <b>Water</b> <b>permeability</b> in cold joint increases to 140. 7 % in control case but it decreases to 120. 7 % through GGBFS replacement.

This increase in albedo is seen most quickly {{at the lower end of}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> path spectrum, that is, the smaller the amount of total water, the quicker the albedo increases. The radiative absorption of clouds is also dependent on the <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> path. An increase of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> path leads to an increase in absorption. Again, the largest increase is seen with lower levels of <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> path.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the results from {{a study on the}} cross-plane water flow through the needle punched nonwoven geotextiles produced from polypropylene fibers. Different types of nonwoven geotextiles are produced by varying the processing parameters during the needle punching process. The pore characteristics and the cross-plane <b>water</b> flow (or <b>permeability)</b> through the nonwoven geotextiles are measured by liquid extrusion porometry and <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> tester, respectively. The water flow velocities through the geotextiles are predicted by the finite element analysis. There is a good correlation between the average velocity data obtained from <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> test and theoretical prediction based on finite element analysis. The pore characteristics {{play an important role in}} <b>water</b> <b>permeability</b> behavior of nonwoven geotextiles. 200...|$|R

40|$|This paper adresses the hygric {{behaviour}} {{of ceramic}} and calcium silicate brick {{treated with a}} water repellent oligomeric alkyl-alkoxysilane. Although the hydrophobic treatment succesfully blocks capillary effects, diffusion-adsorption processes of water molecules into the hydrophobic treated material still can take place. This process determines the particular hygric behaviour of hydrophobic treated materials. First, the contact angle of a drop deposited on an hydrophobic surface changes continuously over time due to absorption {{of water from the}} droplet into the hydrophobic material. This absorption process is found to be drop-size dependent. As a result large droplets, that remain on the hydrophobic surface for a longer time, are preferentially used to accurately measure the contact angle. Second, the <b>water</b> vapour <b>permeability</b> can decrease substantially due to clogging of connective pores caused by the hydrophobic treatment. Porous building materials showing an important midsize pore system within the length of the polymer chains are very sensitive to clogging of connective pores and therefore susceptible to an important increase in water vapour transmission resistance. Due to micro-droplet and water island formation on the hydrophobic network, the <b>water</b> vapour <b>permeability</b> increases with relative humidity. Finally, <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> break-through in hydrophobic treated cracks is explained in view of microdroplet and water forming process in the crack. When <b>liquid</b> <b>water</b> islands become connected in the crack, capillary forces arise leading to the break-through...|$|R
