5|$|Dorset is famed in {{literature}} {{for being the}} native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy, {{and many of the}} places he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset, which he renamed South Wessex. The National Trust owns Thomas Hardy's Cottage, in Higher Bockhampton, east of Dorchester; and Max Gate, his former house in Dorchester.

Powys lived in Chaldon Herring for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel Mr. Weston's Good Wine; John Cowper Powys, his elder brother, also set a number of his works in Dorset, such as the novels Maiden Castle and Weymouth Sands. The 19th-century poet William Barnes was born in Bagber and wrote many poems in his native Dorset dialect. Originating from the ancient Norse and Saxon languages, the dialect was prevalent across the Blackmore Vale but has fallen into disuse.|$|E

It introduces George Smiley, {{the most famous}} of <b>le</b> <b>Carré's</b> recurring characters, in a story about East German spies inside Great Britain.

25|$|From the 1970s, Guinness made regular {{appearances}} on UK television, including {{the part of}} George Smiley in the serialisations of two novels by John le Carré: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People. He twice won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for the roles, and <b>Le</b> <b>Carré</b> was so impressed by Guinness's performance as Smiley that he based his characterisation of Smiley in subsequent novels on Guinness. One of Guinness's last appearances was in the BBC drama Eskimo Day (1996).|$|E
25|$|Espionage novelist David John Moore Cornwell, {{better known}} as John <b>le</b> <b>Carré,</b> whose books include The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has lived in St Buryan for more than forty years.

25|$|Reima Pietilä {{had also}} {{been active in the}} {{activities}} of the Museum of Finnish Architecture as well as publishing theoretical articles in <b>Le</b> <b>Carré</b> Bleu and Arkkitehti. Pietilä even attended a meeting of the Team X group of architects, held in 1972 at Cornell University in the USA, who were very much concerned with questions of structuralism in architecture, that is emphasising the elements of culture, somewhat in reaction to the universalising tendencies of modernism, especially as originally promoted by Team X's instigators, the older generation of CIAM. Pietilä took a diametric viewpoint to that of the rationalist school, and though the works (designed in partnership with his wife Raili Pietilä) had much of the organic idiosyncrasies of Aalto, they were far more abstract and nebulous. In arguing that nature is the apotheosis of plasticity, he demanded a morphological analysis of architectural products, considering Euclidean geometry as an inadequate instrument of analysis. His first major work, the Finnish Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Expo did in fact take a modular approach akin to the theories of Blomstedt; however, the wooden rectangular box-like units as a whole gave a foretaste of Pietilä's later surfaces based entirely on free form; the most notable of these organic works being Kaleva Church, Tampere (1959–66), Dipoli student assembly building, Espoo (1961–66), Metso Library, Tampere (1978–86) and culminating in his final work, the Official Residence of the President of Finland, Mäntyniemi, Helsinki (1983–93). All these buildings had been the result of open architectural competitions.|$|E
500|$|Taunton is {{mentioned}} in The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy by John <b>le</b> <b>Carré,</b> and Evelyn Waugh's Scoop, {{and was given}} the fictitious name of [...] "Toneborough" [...] by Thomas Hardy.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{believed}} that the two-part story [...] "belongs" [...] to Calculus, because his [...] "cosmic vision moves the story forward". They further expressed the opinion that Wolff was a unique character in the Adventures of Tintin, suggesting that he is akin to a character from a John <b>le</b> <b>Carré</b> novel.|$|E
5000|$|Rick Pym, {{the charismatic}} con man father of Magnus in the novel, {{is based on}} <b>le</b> <b>Carré's</b> father, Ronnie Cornwell. Ronnie was a {{confidence}} man and associate of the Kray twins, London organised crime figures. He made and lost several fortunes through elaborate confidence schemes, and was jailed for insurance fraud. <b>Le</b> <b>Carré's</b> biographer Lynndianne Beene describes Ronnie as 'an epic con man of little education, immense charm, extravagant tastes, but no social values'. <b>Le</b> <b>Carré's</b> relationship with his father was troubled, and he has said: [...] "Although I've {{never been to a}} shrink, writing A Perfect Spy is probably what a very wise shrink would have advised me to do anyway." ...|$|R

500|$|The Globe and Mail crime critic Derrick Murdoch said, [...] "John Gardner is {{technically}} a highly competent thriller novelist who {{never seems to}} be quite at ease unless he is writing {{in the same vein}} as another writer. (He has worked John <b>le</b> <b>Carré</b> and Graham Greene this way, and it's what makes him so well qualified to continue the James Bond saga.)" ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John <b>le</b> <b>Carré,</b> who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, <b>le</b> <b>Carré</b> acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} the diner where the Observers discuss Peter's {{existence}} featured [...] "California Dreamin'" [...] by vocal group The Mamas & the Papas. Other songs featured in the episode included [...] "Rockin' Robin" [...] by Bobby Day and [...] "Cinderella in the Palace" [...] by Sergei Prokofiev, the latter performed by the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine. Walter later quotes {{a line from the}} 1963 John <b>le</b> <b>Carre</b> novel The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.|$|E

500|$|... "The Pine Bluff Variant" [...] {{was based}} on the idea of Mulder going undercover, a topic that Shiban had wanted to work on for a {{majority}} of the fifth season. Shiban argued that the concept worked for the series because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season. The episode was indirectly influenced by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, written by John <b>le</b> <b>Carré.</b> The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real United States military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{influenced}} by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, written by John <b>le</b> <b>Carré.</b> Both the book and author are favorites of Shiban. Because the Cold War had been over, he used the opportunity to introduce a new [...] "bogeyman", in this case domestic terrorism. The writing staff used then-recent fears about Saddam Hussein's alleged production of biological weapons to craft the basic premise of the script. The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons. Shiban also recalled that the 1995 action film Heat was an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|To {{research}} for his role, Armitage read novels from authors including John <b>le</b> <b>Carré,</b> Frederick Forsyth and Robert Ludlum. He tried to inspire his acting style for Lucas by Jason Bourne, a character created by Ludlum. He also lost a stone in weight {{in order to}} keep with the description that Lucas is malnourished, but also had to keep physically fit in order to perform a fight sequence during his first week of filming. Since Lucas is a fluent Russian speaker, Armitage had to learn it phonetically, which he found [...] "pretty impossible." [...] He originally tried to learn it from a disc, but found it too basic and had since moved on to a language coach.|$|E
