500|$|To aid in {{the visual}} aspect of production, David Siller {{recruited}} Joe Pearson of Epoch Ink, who in turn recommended that Charles Zembillas of American Exitus be brought on board as well. Pearson and Zembillas would meet with Naughty Dog weekly to create the characters and environments of the game. Because the main character was Tasmanian, {{it was decided that}} the game would take place on a mysterious island where every possible type of environment could be found, with the added reasoning that an evil genius like Doctor Neo Cortex would require an island stronghold. On creating the levels for the game, Pearson first sketched each environment, designing and creating additional individual elements later. Pearson aimed for an organic, overgrown look to the game and worked to completely avoid straight lines and 90-degree corners. In January 1995, Rubin became concerned about the programmer-to-artist ratio and hired Bob Rafei and Taylor Kurosaki as additional artists. A Naughty Dog artist sketched every single background object in the game before it was modeled. Naughty Dog's artists were tasked with making the best use of textures and reducing the amount of geometry. Dark and light elements were juxtaposed to create visual interest and separate geometry. The artists would squint when sketching, texturing, and playing the levels to make sure they could be played by <b>light</b> <b>value</b> alone. They ensured to use color correctly by choosing mutually accentuating colors as the theme for the [...] "Lost City" [...] and [...] "Sunset Vista" [...] levels. The interior of Cortex's castle was designed to reflect the inside of his mind. According to Rubin, the artists worked on the visuals for eight months before any game code was written.|$|E

5000|$|In photography, <b>light</b> <b>value</b> {{has been}} used to refer to a&ldquo;light level&rdquo; for either {{incident}} or reflected light, often on a base-2 logarithmic scale.The term does not derive from a published standard, and has had severaldifferent meanings: ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{synonym for}} &ldquo;EV at ISO 100 film speed&rdquo;. This usage appears on many web pages, usually without {{attribution}} of an authoritative source. Eads (2000) proposed a revised APEX in which luminance value was equal to EV for ISO 100 speed, {{but he did}} not use the term <b>light</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of shading {{algorithms}} for rasterizers. All shading algorithms need to account for distance from light and the normal vector of the shaded object with respect to the incident direction of light. The fastest algorithms simply shade all pixels on any given triangle with a single <b>lighting</b> <b>value,</b> also known as flat shading. There is no way to create the illusion of smooth surfaces this way, except by subdividing into many small triangles. Algorithms can also separately shade vertices, and interpolate the <b>lighting</b> <b>value</b> of the vertices when drawing pixels. This is known as Gouraud shading. The slowest and most realistic approach is to calculate lighting separately for each pixel, also known as Phong shading. This performs bilinear interpolation of the normal vectors and uses the result to do local lighting calculation.|$|R

50|$|The cel-shading process {{starts with}} a typical 3D model. Where cel-shading differs from {{conventional}} rendering is in its non-photorealistic illumination model. Conventional (smooth) <b>lighting</b> <b>values</b> are calculated for each pixel and then quantized to {{a small number of}} discrete shades to create the characteristic flat look - where the shadows and highlights appear more like blocks of color rather than mixed in a smooth way.|$|R
5000|$|Literally speaking, the English term <b>light</b> <b>value</b> {{could be}} {{translated}} as &ldquo;Lichtwert&rdquo; in German language, however, {{this is not}} what the term Lichtwert, as it was introduced by the German shutter manufacturer [...] in 1954 and defined as Belichtungswert in DIN 19010, is used for in German-speaking countries. Instead, the established term Lichtwert (abbreviated as &ldquo;LW&rdquo;) describes what became known as exposure value (EV) elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|An {{arbitrary}} value indicated by an exposure meter {{such as the}} Weston Master V, discussed in Adams (1948, 14 - 18). This {{may have been the}} origin of the term. The indicated <b>light</b> <b>value</b> was transferred to the meter's exposure calculator, which then was used to determine camera settings. Ray (2000) uses the term, with the acronym 'LV', in this sense. The Honeywell/Pentax 1&deg;/21&deg; spot meter indicated in &ldquo;light level&rdquo; (&ldquo;LL&rdquo;), with LL essentially exposure value (EV) for ISO 100 film speed. The later Pentax Spotmeter V and Digital Spotmeter indicated directly in EV for ISO 100, but they made no mention of &ldquo;light level&rdquo;, &ldquo;light value&rdquo;, or LV.|$|E
5000|$|Starting 1954, the {{so-called}} Exposure Value Scale (EVS), originally known as <b>Light</b> <b>Value</b> Scale (LVS), {{was adopted by}} Rollei, Hasselblad, Voigtländer, Braun, Kodak, Seikosha, Aires, Konica, Olympus, Ricoh and others, introducing lenses with coupled shutters and apertures, such that, after setting the exposure value, adjusting either the shutter speed or aperture made a corresponding adjustment in the other to maintain a constant exposure. On some models, the coupling of shutter speed and aperture setting was optional, so that photographers could choose their preferred method of working depending on the situation. Use of the [...] scale on such cameras is discussed briefly by Adams (1981, 39).|$|E

30|$|The {{mean and}} {{covariance}} values show a linear {{dependence of the}} intensity values in the sliding window using this criterion (6). So, the high brightness and contrast values found in the images are changed by consistent values according to {{the distribution of the}} DH. For this reason, we could say that the proposed DH algorithm eliminates the impulsive noise caused by high-contrast <b>lighting</b> <b>values</b> in the acquired images.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light sensor}} detects the light level in one direction, and also {{includes}} a LED for illuminating an object. The light sensor can sense reflected <b>light</b> <b>values</b> (using the built-in red LED), or ambient light. In the NXT-G programming software the sensor senses light {{on a scale of}} 0 to 100, 100 being very bright and 0 being dark. If calibrated, the sensor can also be used as a distance sensor.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} the central pixel will take the mean value of the area that is most homogenous. The {{location}} of the pixel in relation to an edge plays a great role in determining which region will have the greater standard deviation. If for example the pixel is located on a dark side of an edge it will most probably take the mean value of the dark region. On the other hand, should the pixel be on the lighter side of an edge it will most probably take a <b>light</b> <b>value.</b> On {{the event that the}} pixel is located on the edge it will take the value of the more smooth, least textured region. The fact that the filter takes into account the homogeneity of the regions ensures that it will preserve the edges while using the mean creates the blurring effect.|$|E
5000|$|More precisely, the {{argument}} (angle) {{of the complex}} number defines the hue value while the modulus defines the <b>light</b> <b>value</b> of the color in the HLS (hue, lightness, saturation) color model; for a given (H,L) pair we choose the maximal saturation value. In both assignments, vivid colors of the rainbow are rotating in a continuous way on the complex unit circle, so the sixth roots of unity (starting with 1) are, according to the second definition: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta. In addition, it is common in the assignments that the gradations of colors belonging to two complex numbers {{close to each other}} are close to each other, and that colors of complex numbers of the same argument are gradations of the same color [...] - [...] the one which has greater absolute value is lighter (according to the first definition) or darker (according to the second definition).|$|E
50|$|Before {{the final}} {{color of the}} pixel can be decided, a {{lighting}} calculation must be performed to shade the pixels based on any lights which may {{be present in the}} scene. There are generally three light types commonly used in scenes. Directional lights are lights which come from a single direction and have the same intensity throughout the entire scene. In real life, sunlight comes close to being a directional light, as the sun is so far away that rays from the sun appear parallel to Earth observers and the falloff is negligible. Point lights are lights with a definite position in space and radiate light evenly in all directions. Point lights are usually subject to some form of attenuation, or fall off in the intensity of light incident on objects farther away. Real life light sources experience quadratic falloff. Finally, spotlights are like real-life spotlights, with a definite point in space, a direction, and an angle defining the cone of the spotlight. There is also often an ambient <b>light</b> <b>value</b> that is added to all final lighting calculations to arbitrarily compensate for global illumination effects which rasterization can not calculate correctly.|$|E
50|$|Donald Farnsworth {{at the art}} {{workshop}} Magnolia Editions {{developed a}} digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin. Instead, a series of 'masks' (layers of resist) are printed onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: “The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic random dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you’re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that’s etched are the light tones.” Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the <b>light</b> <b>values</b> be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the <b>lighter</b> <b>values</b> {{to protect them from}} subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.|$|R
50|$|Earliest {{proponents of}} this style include the Dutch Master Johannes Vermeer and Hendrick Terbrugghen.Recent artists working with this style include the Boston School of painters, such as Edmund Tarbell and William McGregor Paxton. These artists {{combined}} vibrant Impressionist pastel colors {{with a more}} traditional palette, to create color-realist works that have {{a full range of}} dark to <b>light</b> <b>values.</b> Contemporary artists utilizing elements of this style include Sam Vokey, Charles Tersolo, and Barbara Glee Lucas.|$|R
2500|$|Analysis {{of these}} records reveals another {{interesting}} fact: planktonic (floating) forams record {{the shift to}} <b>lighter</b> isotope <b>values</b> earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower [...] ) methanogenic carbon can only {{be incorporated into the}} forams' shells after it has been oxidised. A gradual release of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic forams show <b>lighter</b> <b>values</b> earlier. The fact that the planktonic forams are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.|$|R
