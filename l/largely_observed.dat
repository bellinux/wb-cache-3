Artillery and tanks were utilised in the battle there, which was described as the heaviest fighting since the signing of Minsk II.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 1664, four English frigates led by Richard Nicolls sailed into New Amsterdam’s {{harbor and}} demanded New Netherland’s surrender. They met no {{resistance}} because numerous citizens’ requests had gone unheeded for protection by a suitable Dutch garrison against [...] "the deplorable and tragic massacres" [...] by the natives. That {{lack of adequate}} fortification, ammunition, and manpower made New Amsterdam defenseless, {{as well as the}} indifference from the West India Company to previous pleas for reinforcement of men and ships against [...] "the continual troubles, threats, encroachments and invasions of the English neighbors." [...] Stuyvesant negotiated successfully for good terms from his [...] "too powerful enemies". In the Articles of Transfer, he and his council secured the principle of religious tolerance in Article VIII, which assured that New Netherlanders [...] "shall keep and enjoy the liberty of their consciences in religion" [...] under English rule. The Articles were <b>largely</b> <b>observed</b> in New Amsterdam and the Hudson River Valley, but they were immediately violated by the English along the Delaware River, where pillaging, looting, and arson were undertaken under the orders of English officer Sir Robert Carr, Kt. who had been dispatched to secure the valley. Many Dutch settlers were sold into slavery in Virginia on Carr's orders, and an entire Mennonite settlement was wiped out, led by Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy near modern Lewes, Delaware. The 1667 Treaty of Breda ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War; the Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland, and the status quo was maintained, with the Dutch occupying Suriname and the nutmeg island of Run.|$|E

This asymmetric response is consistent with the documented stock price reaction following downgrades and upgrades. The increased excess cash holdings following downgrades is consistent with the theory that managers may hoard money as their firms become more financially constrained, either as a safety net in the event of potential future financial distress or due to reduced access to financial markets. However, we find the increase in excess cash holdings after downgrades is value-decreasing for shareholders...|$|R

In Table A 1, the blue columns show {{the breakdown of the}} cost function for each algorithm (for the definition of the cost function, see (3) in Section 2. 1). We observe that modules selected by the integrated algorithm have negative total weight adjustment, demonstrating their coherence. Such observations are consistent with the results obtained by other performance measures such as strength and specificity.

40|$|This {{research}} {{surveys the}} impact of corporate governance practices on performance in the highly profitable mobile telecommunications industry in Zimbabwe, with special emphasis on return on assets {{as a proxy for}} performance. It further sought to evaluate the extent to which corporate governance practices are being observed as well as assess whether performances of the different telecoms companies are comparable and identify factors affecting compliance to corporate governance A descriptive survey research design was used to find the opinions of individuals in the target population on factors affecting compliance with corporate governance {{and the extent to which}} firms observe corporate governance. The average Return on Assets (ROA) was calculated and used as a proxy for performance for the period under study to assess performance of the three companies. Data entry was done using a combination of Microsoft Excel and the STATA statistical package. Almost all of the investigated mobile telecommunications companies <b>largely</b> <b>observe</b> corporate governance practices of the rights of shareholders, the equitable treatment of shareholders, the role of stakeholders in corporate governance, disclosure and transparency and the responsibility of the board. However, NetOneâ€™s results show that a bigger percentage of performance in the state enterprise is explained by other factors other than corporate governance practices tested unlike in the other two private companies where the relationship is more significant. The research was done within a short space of time and due to the sensitivity of some of the variables, most of the target population could not provide such data because of confidentiality. It is evident that corporate governance impacts on performance and hence the government should promote good corporate governance standards. The study proposes further study in the areas of corporate governance and corporate failure as this study has established some discrepancies in performance between the state-controlled mobile telecommunications companies and the privately owned companiesâ€...|$|R
