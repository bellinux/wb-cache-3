5|$|Galatasaray were {{required}} {{to qualify for the}} group stage, as Turkey's country coefficient only held qualifying places. The Turks entered the third qualifying round of the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League, the final qualifying game of the competition, where they competed against Rapid Wien in two matches. Galatasaray won the first <b>leg</b> <b>with</b> 3–0 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion, and earned their spot in the first group stage following a 1–0 win at their home arena, Ali Sami Yen Stadium in the decisive leg. Galatasaray were scheduled to take part in Group G, containing Chelsea, Hertha Berlin and Milan. Six matches were played, as they recorded a total two wins, one draw and three defeats, thus descending into the third round of the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup. With the game won, rather than play out time Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents with the ball. In the last minute he went to 'nutmeg' an opponent, who was having none of it and broke Baxter's <b>leg</b> <b>with</b> his challenge. This was to be a watershed for Baxter. During the four months in which he was unable to play he began drinking to his detriment; this ultimately was to curtail his playing career and his life.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time on his research into the Custer battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden <b>Leg.</b> <b>With</b> them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H.

He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated <b>leg.</b> <b>With</b> assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth and}} final bout {{of the main}} card was the UFC Welterweight Championship match between Georges St-Pierre and B.J. Penn, {{regulated}} by referee Herb Dean.

Unable to get the takedown, St-Pierre let go and connected with a right hand punch. They met up and clinched {{in the middle of the}} cage with St-Pierre pushing Penn towards the fence. There, St-Pierre attempted a takedown but went back the clinch when he was unable to finish it. The two fighters continued trading punches to end the first round.|$|E

5|$|The only UEFA European Fixture to {{take place}} at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first {{qualifying}} round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers, on 22 July 1998. Due to fears of sectarian violence, and after discussions between the two clubs and UEFA, Prenton Park {{was chosen as the}} venue for the first <b>leg,</b> <b>with</b> Shelbourne as the home team. The match finished 3–5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne (at the time a semi-professional side) had earlier taken a 3–0 lead. As a result of this game, Rangers were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs and warned by UEFA for their fans' behaviour at the game.|$|E

United went on to secure the tie in the second <b>leg</b> <b>with</b> a 1–0 win, their record 11th consecutive home Champions League win.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} planned {{to begin at}} 2:30 AM local time by the organizers, but due to large crowds and some {{participants}} arriving late, the race officially started at 2:43. The riders formed three groups on the road, of which the first one contained twenty riders when it passed through the checkpoint in Brescia. The group further thinned to sixteen {{by the time it}} reached Verona, and to eleven when it arrived at the checkpoint in Vicenza. From the group, the sprint to the finish line was mainly contested by Giovanni Micheletto and Giuseppe Santhià, of which the former managed to win the <b>leg.</b> <b>With</b> Atala-Dunlop's Micheletto winning the stage and his teammate Carlo Galetti finishing third, Atala-Dunlop acquired seven points and the lead in the race.|$|E
