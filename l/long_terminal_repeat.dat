25|$|Viral {{oncogenesis}} {{are most}} common with DNA and RNA tumor viruses, most frequently the retroviruses. There {{are two types}} of oncogenic retroviruses: acute transforming viruses and non-acute transforming viruses. Acute transforming viruses induce a rapid tumor growth since they carry viral oncogenes in their DNA/RNA to induce such growth. An example of an acute transforming virus is the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) that carry the v-src oncogene. v-Src is part of the c-src, which is a cellular proto-oncogene that stimulates rapid cell growth and expansion. A non-acute transforming virus on the other hand induces a slow tumor growth, since it does not carry any viral oncogenes. It induces tumor growth by transcriptionally activating the proto-oncogenes particularly the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) in the proto-oncogenes.|$|E

The ends of each strand of HIV RNA contain an RNA sequence called the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR). Regions in the LTR act as switches to control production of new viruses and can be triggered by proteins from either HIV or the host cell. The Psi element is involved in viral genome packaging and recognized by Gag and Rev proteins.

5000|$|Most HERV’s in {{the genome}} today are not replication-competent due to frame shifts, {{premature}} stop codons and recombination in their <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> (LTRs).

50|$|Retrotransposons can be {{transcribed}} into RNA, {{which are}} then duplicated at another site into the genome. Retrotransposons {{can be divided into}} <b>Long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> (LTRs) and Non-Long <b>Terminal</b> <b>Repeats</b> (Non-LTR).|$|R
50|$|During {{transcription}} of {{the human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 provirus, polyadenylation signals present in the 5' <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) are disregarded while the identical polyadenylation signals present in the 3'LTR are utilized efficiently.

50|$|The HIV {{trans-activation}} response (TAR) {{element is}} an RNA element {{which is known}} to be required for the trans-activation of the viral promoter and for virus replication. The TAR hairpin is a dynamic structure that acts as a binding site for the Tat protein, and this interaction stimulates the activity of the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> promoter.|$|E
50|$|In addition, genetic {{material}} of retroviral origin appears {{frequently in the}} genome, reflecting integration of the genomes of human endogenous retroviruses. Such integration events result {{in the presence of}} genes encoding retroviral reverse transcriptase, which includes an RNase H domain. An example is ERVK6. <b>Long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> retrotransposons are also common in the genome and often include their own RNase H domains, with a complex evolutionary history.|$|E
5000|$|Flanking (or <b>terminal)</b> <b>repeats</b> (<b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> {{sequences}}) are sequences {{that are}} repeated {{on both ends}} of a sequence, for example, the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> (LTRs) on retroviruses.

50|$|Retrotransposons, {{also known}} as class I transposable elements, consist of two subclasses, the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) and the non-LTR retrotransposons. Classification into these subclasses {{is based on the}} {{phylogeny}} of the reverse transcriptase, which goes in line with structural differences, such as presence/absence of long terminal repeats as well as number and types of open reading frames, encoding domains and target site duplication lengths.|$|E
50|$|APOBEC3G was {{associated}} with interference of viral DNA integration into the host genome in a manner dependent on functional catalytic domains and deaminase activity. Mbisa et al. saw that APOBEC3G interferes with the processing and removal of primer tRNA from the DNA minus strand, thus leading to aberrant viral 3’ <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) DNA ends. These viral DNA ends are inefficient substrates for integration and plus-strand DNA transfer. As a result, HIV-1 provirus formation is inhibited.|$|E
50|$|Features of the genome: {{infectious}} viruses {{have three}} main genes coding for the viral proteins in the order: 5´-gag-pol-env-3´. There are two regulatory genes, tat and rev. There are additional accessory genes {{depending on the}} virus (e.g., for HIV-1: vif, vpr, vpu, nef) whose products are involved in regulation of synthesis and processing viral RNA and other replicative functions. The <b>Long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) is about 600 nt long, of which the U3 region is 450, the R sequence 100 and the U5 region some 70 nt long.|$|E
50|$|<b>Long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> (LTRs) are {{identical}} sequences of DNA that repeat {{hundreds or thousands}} of times found at either end of retrotransposons or proviral DNA formed by reverse transcription of retroviral RNA.

50|$|RTL6 is a {{retrotransposon}} GAG related gene. It is one {{of eleven}} MART (Mammalian Retrotransposon Derived) genes in humans related to Sushi-like retrotransposons with <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> from fish and amphibians. Between 170-310 MYA, MART genes lost their ability to retrotranspose and concomitantly gained new, beneficial function for its host organism.|$|R
50|$|Retrotransposons use reverse {{transcriptase}} {{to generate a}} cDNA from the TE transcript. These are further divided into <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR) retrotransposons, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). In LTR retrotransposons, after the RNA template is degraded, a DNA strand complementary to the reverse-transcribed cDNA returns the element to a double-stranded state. Integrase, an enzyme encoded by the LTR retrotransposon, then reincorporates the element at a new target site. These elements are flanked by long terminal repeats (300-500bp) which mediate the transposition process.|$|E
50|$|The genome of Picea abies was sequenced in 2013, {{the first}} {{gymnosperm}} genome {{to be completely}} sequenced. The genome contains approximately 20 billion base pairs and is about six {{times the size of}} the human genome, despite possessing a similar number of genes. A large proportion of the spruce genome consists of repetitive DNA sequences, including <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> transposable elements. Despite recent advances in massively parallel DNA sequencing, the assembly of such a large and repetitive genome is a particularly challenging task, mainly from a computational perspective.|$|E

50|$|SINEs are {{classified}} as non-LTR retrotransposons {{because they do not}} contain <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> (LTRs). There are three types of SINEs common to vertebrates and invertebrates: CORE-SINEs, V-SINEs, and AmnSINEs. SINEs have 50-500 base pair internal regions which contain a tRNA-derived segment with A and B boxes that serve as an internal promoter for RNA polymerase III.|$|R
50|$|The mice {{undergoing}} {{the process}} of transgenesis are known as transgenic mice. A basic transgene has a promoter region, Protein coding sequence, Intron and a stop codon. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), is a retro virus {{that has been a}} known promoter to cause breast tumors once activated. MMTV is a heritable somatic mutagen whose target range is limited. It harbors a regulatory DNA sequence called the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> (LTR), which promotes steroid-hormone-inducible transcription.

50|$|Tax is {{produced}} {{by members of the}} retroviral family primate T-lymphotropic virus, which are classified as Deltaretroviruses. This includes Human T-lymphotrophic viruses (HTLVs), bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) and simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). The tax protein produced from HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 have been most extensively studied. The gene for Tax is found within the pX region between the env gene and one of the long terminal repeats of the viral genome; which is where the name Tax comes from (transactivator from the X-gene region). Tax acts as a transactivator, causing the transcription (production of mRNA from genetic code) of viral proteins in the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeat</b> that are essential for replication.|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} the complete nucleotide {{sequence of the}} gypsy element present at the forked locus of Drosophila melanogaster in the f 1 allele. The gypsy element shares more homology with vertebrate retroviruses than with the copia element of D. melanogaster or the Ty element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both in overall organization and at the DNA sequence level. This transposable element is 7, 469 base pairs long and encodes three putative protein products. The <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats</b> are 482 nucleotides long and contain transcription initiation and termination signals; sequences homologous to the polypurine tract and tRNA primer binding site of retroviruses are located adjacent to the <b>long</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>repeats.</b> The central region of the element contains three different open reading frames.
