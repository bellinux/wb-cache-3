For simulation of two-phase flow in a 3 -D tank equipped with baffles, partially filled with incompressible, viscous fluid, volume of fluid (VOF) method based on the finite volume method (FVM) has been used. External Seismic excitations to the tank are imposed by Momentum Source input in cell zone conditions using User defined Function (UDF).

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in {{microfluidic}} channels is {{a complex}} process that depends {{on a variety of}} geometric, operating, and material parameters such as microchannel geometry, flow velocity∕pressure, liquid surface tension, and contact angle of channel surface. Accurate analysis of the filling process can provide key insights into the filling time, air bubble trapping, and dead zone formation, and help evaluate trade-offs among the various design parameters and lead to optimal chip design. However, efficient modeling of <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in complex microfluidic networks continues to be a significant challenge. High-fidelity computational methods, such as the volume of fluid method, are prohibitively expensive from a computational standpoint. Analytical models, on the other hand, are primarily applicable to idealized geometries and, hence, are unable to accurately capture chip level behavior of complex microfluidic systems. This paper presents a parametrized dynamic model for the system-level analysis of <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> in three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic networks. In our approach, a complex microfluidic network is deconstructed into a set of commonly used components, such as reservoirs, microchannels, and junctions. The components are then assembled according to their spatial layout and operating rationale to achieve a rapid system-level model. A dynamic model based on the transient momentum equation is developed to track the liquid front in the microchannels. The principle of mass conservation at the junction is used to link the fluidic parameters in the microchannels emanating from the junction. Assembly of these component models yields a set of differential and algebraic equations, which upon integration provides temporal information of the <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> process, particularly <b>liquid</b> front propagation (i. e., the arrival time). The models are used to simulate the transient <b>liquid</b> <b>filling</b> process in a variety of microfluidic constructs and in a multiplexer, representing a complex microfluidic network.
