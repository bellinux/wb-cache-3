5000|$|Even {{knowing the}} size and density of the {{satellite}} leaves many parameters that must be estimated (especially &omega;, Q, and &mu;), so that any calculated locking times obtained {{are expected to be}} inaccurate, even to factors of ten.

50|$|The passive {{optical network}} (PON) uses tree-like network {{topology}}. Due to the topology of PON, the transmission modes for downstream (that is, from optical line termination, (OLT) to optical network unit (ONU)) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal to all the ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. One given ONU can find which frame in the CM stream is for it by reading the header of the frame. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. It is because that all the signals transmitted from the ONUs converge (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlap among themselves if CM is used. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot {{and it needs to}} transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. In order to compensate the phase variation from packet to packet, burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) is required. Such circuit can generate local clock with the frequency and phase same as the individual received optical packet in a short <b>locking</b> <b>time,</b> for example within 40 ns. Such generated local clock can in turn perform correct data decision. Above all, the clock and data recovery can be performed correctly after a short <b>locking</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lock</b> <b>time</b> is {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} sear and the {{ignition}} of the cartridge. A lengthy <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> and reduce the window for error. Reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing pin or striker, shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring.

40|$|A seven-state phase {{frequency}} detector (S. S PFD) is proposed for fast-locking charge pump based phase-locked loops (CPPLLs) in this paper. The <b>locking</b> <b>time</b> of the PLL can be significantly reduced {{by using the}} seven-state PFD to inject more current into the loop filter. In this stage, the bandwidth of the PLL is increased or decreased to track the phase difference of the reference signal and the feedback signal. The proposed architecture is realized in a standard 0. 35 mu m 2 P 4 M CMOS process with a 3. 3 V supply voltage. The <b>locking</b> <b>time</b> of the proposed PLL is 1. 102 mu s compared with the 2. 347 mu s of the PLL based on continuous-time PFD and the 3. 298 mu s of the PLL based on the pass-transistor tri-state PFD.
