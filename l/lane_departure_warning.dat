5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warning</b> system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E

40|$|In the past, <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> were {{demonstrated}} to improve driving behaviours during <b>lane</b> <b>departures</b> but {{little is known}} about the effects of unreliable warnings. This experiment focused on the influence of false warnings lone or in combination with missed warnings and warning onset on assistance effectiveness and acceptance. Two assistance unreliability levels (33 % and 17 %) and two warning onsets (partial and full <b>lane</b> <b>departure)</b> were manipulated in order to investigate interaction. Results showed that assistance, regardless unreliability levels and warning onsets, improved driving behaviours during <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> episodes and outside of these episodes by favouring better lane keeping performances. Full <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> and highly unreliable warnings, however, reduced assistance efficiency. Drivers' assistance acceptance was better for the most reliable warnings and for the subsequent warnings. The data indicate that imperfect <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> (false warnings or false and missed warnings) further improve driving behaviours compared to no assistance...|$|R

40|$|The Driving Assistance Systems (DAS) aim to {{help the}} vehicle drivers to proceed through {{different}} road situations.

The problem domain here is huge and might be divided into the subtopics, like driver's fatigue detection, pedestrian tracking, obstacle collision avoidance, <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> and traffic signs detection and recognition. Advanced computer vision techniques are widely used in order to develop sufficient and robust systems for driving assistance.

30|$|An {{alternative}} solution to prevent single vehicle and head on crashes is <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> {{in terms of}} a driver support system, LDW systems. It has been shown that there is a potential to substitute the infrastructure rumble strip with an in-vehicle LDW system [18]. In an investigation of the safety benefits of in-vehicle LDW and LKA (Lane keeping Aid) in real world passenger car injury crashes in Sweden a positive effect in reducing single vehicle crashes (− 53 %) as well as a total reduction of − 30 % for all head-on and single vehicle driver injury crashes was shown [19].|$|R
40|$|Driver {{drowsiness}} is a {{major cause}} of severe accidents, many ofwhich involve a single vehicle <b>lane</b> <b>departure.</b> The objective of the experimentdescribed in this paper is to determine the relationships between drowsiness, lanedeparture events (LDE) and effects of a warning system. While in case of driverdistraction the impact of such a warning system can be tested in real traffic, forreasons of safety (and reproducibility), a laboratory-based driving simulator isbeing used in this project. The experiments were conducted with a cohort of 63 healthy male subjects aged 22 to 27 driving for about 2. 5 hrs in a stimuli-deprivedscenario with a six-fold repetition under carefully controlled conditions. Severalhundreds micro-sleep episodes were identified in the 53 successful trials byelectrooculogram and video signal and confirmed by behavioral analysis; morethan 800 <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> (LDW) occurred in the assisted sub-cohort of 17 drivers.

By taking advantage of DSRC, a vehicle in a GNSS denied environment is able to calculate its position using the assistance of other vehicles with sufficient GNSS signals to fix their locations.

Also many of the new innovations demand the use of advanced electronics. Examples of these new systems are adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, forward collision avoidance, <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings,</b> and many more.

30|$|The {{statistics}} for road accidents in the United States in 2010 is shocking: 32, 999 killed, 3.9 million injured, and 24 million vehicles damaged, the tangible and intangible costs of which total $ 277 billion [37]. This cost burden has a ripple effect, {{having an impact}} on productivity, medical costs, legal and court costs, workplace losses, emergency service costs, the congestion burden, insurance administration costs, and property damage. A downward trend in the number of crashes in the United States [38] is significantly indebted to the adoption of new technologies such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, 8 head-protection side air bags, and forward collision warnings [39, 40]. These are features that will be adopted in AV technology. In particular, some studies estimate the reduction of crashes could be as high as one-third if all vehicles are equipped with adaptive headlights, 9 forward collision 10 <b>warnings,</b> <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> 11, and blind spot assistance 12 [39, 40, 41] which are attributed to Level 0 or Level 1 vehicle automation. Human error is blamed for more than ninety percent of crashes [42]. Therefore, AVs should be able to prevent an appreciable number of these crashes, in turn eliminating the vast majority of all traffic delays [7].|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore how}} a single master alarm system affects drivers’ {{responses}} {{when compared to}} multiple, distinct warnings. Background: Advanced driver warning systems are intended to improve safety, yet inappropriate integration may increase the complexity of driving, especially in high workload situations. This study investigated the effects of auditory alarm scheme, reliability, and collision event-type on driver performance. Method: A 2 x 2 x 4 mixed factorial design investigated the impact of two alarm schemes (master vs. individual) and two levels of alarm reliability (high and low) on distracted drivers’ performance across four collision event-types (frontal collision warnings, left and right <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings,</b> and follow vehicle fast approach). Results: Participants’ reaction times and accuracy rates were significantly affected {{by the type of}} collision event and alarm reliability. The use of individual alarms, rather than a single master alarm, did not significantly affect driving performance in terms of reaction time or response accuracy. Conclusion: Even though a master alarm is a relatively uninformative warning, it produced statistically no different reaction times or accuracy results when compared to information-rich auditory icons, some of which were spatially located. In addition, unreliable alarms negatively impacted driver performance, regardless of event type or alarm scheme. Application: These results have important implications for {{the development and implementation of}} multiple driver warning systems. This project was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} two types of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) as tools for observing driving behavior. The first was a kinematic-based ADAS that uses speed and acceleration data to detect driving events such as hard braking, speeding and sharp turning. The second was a visionbased ADAS that uses video data to provide <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings</b> (LDW), headway warnings (HW) and forward collision warnings (FCW). Data was collected for more than 4, 500 trips and 2, 200 driving hours {{during a period of}} 70 days. The sample consisted of 10 drivers that used both types of ADAS simultaneously. The information collected also included more than 17, 000 records of various types of driving events. First, the events rates were estimated by the Poisson and the Poisson-lognormal models. Then, Pearson correlation and factor analysis were implemented to study the relationships among the events and to evaluate whether different types of events converged to describe the same behaviors. Significant correlations were observed between the braking and turning kinematic-based events and the FCW vision-based event, which converged under the same factor. High rates of these events may indicate that the person is driving in an urban style. The LDW, HW and speeding events converged to the second factor, which is more relevant in inter-urban areas. These findings, although based on a small-scale study, point to a potential for the use of commercial ADAS for driving behavior analysis. The integration of kinematic-based and vision-based information can provide deeper understanding of the measured behavior...|$|R

40|$|As vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{continue to increase}} their emphasis on safety with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), I propose a ubiquitous device that is able to analyze and advise on safety conditions. Mobile smartphones are increasing in popularity among younger generations with an estimated 64 % of 25 - 34 year olds already using one in their daily lives. with over 10 million car accidents reported in the United States each year, car manufacturers have shifted their focus of a passive approach (airbags) to more active by adding features associated with ADAS (<b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings).</b> However, vehicles manufactured with these sensors are not economically priced while older vehicles might only have passive safety features. Given its accessibility and portability, I target a mobile smartphone as a device to compliment ADAS that can bring a driver assist to any vehicle without regards for any on-vehicle communication system requirements. I use the 3 -axis accelerometer of multiple Android based smartphone to record and analyze various safety factors which can influence a driver while operating a vehicle.

40|$|High {{demands on}} {{advanced}} safety and driving functions, such as active safety and <b>lane</b> <b>departure</b> <b>warnings,</b> increase a vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s dependency on automotive electrical/electronic architectures. Hard real-time requirements and high reliability constraints must be satisfied for the correct functioning of these safety-critical features, {{which can be}} achieved by using the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) standard. The AUTOSAR standard was introduced to simplify automotive system design while offering inter-operability, scalability, extensibility, and flexibility. The current version of AUTOSAR does not assist in the replication of tasks for recovering from task failures. Instead, the standard assumes that architecture designers will introduce custom extensions to meet such reliability needs. The introduction of affordable techniques with predictable properties for meeting reliability requirements will prove to be very valuable in future versions of AUTOSAR. In this paper, we propose a new Software-Component (SW-C) allocation algorithm called R-FLOW (Reliable application-FLOW-aware SW-C partitioning algorithm) for fail-stop processors to support fault-tolerance with bounded recovery times, and we integrate the R-FLOW algorithm into AUTOSAR. R-FLOW leverages different types of replication schemes to satisfy reliability and timing constraints, while offering a high degree of resource utilization and flexibility. Specifically, R-FLOW classifies real-time periodic tasks into Hard Recovery tasks, Soft Recovery tasks, andBest-Effort Recovery tasks. Hot Standbys are used for recovering from failures of hard recovery tasks, whereas Cold Standbys are utilized for recovering from failures of soft recovery and best-effort recovery tasks. With this goal in mind, we design and implement our proposed architecture within the guidelines of the current AUTOSAR framework. We have built an at-scale prototyping platform, comprising of Freescale HCS 12 X processing boards, a dual-channel FlexRay bus, and a CAN network.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in actively mitigating safety in vehicles {{beyond that of}} improving crash worthiness. According to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), {{there are more than}} 40, 000 deaths on highways each year. This number may be decreasing with increasing active public concern and awareness for the use of safety restraints, but the numbers are still in excess of 40, 000 deaths annually. Focusing on crash-worthiness as a measure of safety in vehicles will eventually reach a point of diminishing return, thus {{there is a need for}} automotive manufacturers to shift their safety focus to crash avoidance safety systems (Runge, 2002). In the public domain, significant progress and advancements have been made under the Intelligent Vehicles Initiative (IVI) set up by U. S. Department of Transportation to prevent motor vehicle crashes by assisting drivers in avoiding hazardous mistakes (U. S DOT, 1998). One IVI focus area is facilitating the rapid deployment of Collision Avoidance Systems (CAS) in vehicles. Collision Avoidance Systems are a subset of Advanced Vehicle Control Safety Systems (AVCSS) which come under the umbrella of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). These Collision Avoidance Systems warn drivers of imminent collisions and can potentially help to save lives. Primary directions of research in CAS are determining implementation strategies and technologies in vehicles and roadway infrastructure, as well as optimizing the driving performance of different populations of drivers when using CAS. In CAS implementation, vehicles will communicate with other vehicles as well as with the roadway infrastructure via sensors and telecommunication networks. The data obtained can then be used in Collision Avoidance Systems. Vehicle-to-vehicle CAS include warnings that trigger when a vehicle is about to collide with another vehicle. Examples include Frontal Warning, Rear Warning and Blind Spot Detection Warnings. Vehicle-to-infrastructure CAS include warnings that trigger when a vehicle is about to have a collision with the roadway infrastructure. Examples include Intersection <b>Warnings,</b> <b>Lane</b> <b>Departure</b> <b>Warnings,</b> Curve Speed Warnings and Road-condition Warnings. Driving in a dynamic environment has become increasingly complex, such that drivers must visually track objects, monitor a constantly changing system, manage system information, to include the explosion of telematics, and make decisions in this dynamic and potentially high mental workload environment. Introducing Collision Avoidance Systems into vehicles could add to the complexity of this dynamic environment as different drivers will respond differently to Collision Avoidance Systems and there are many critical human factors issues that require investigation.
