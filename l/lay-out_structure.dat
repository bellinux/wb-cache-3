40|$|The most widely-spread {{type of a}} rural {{dwelling-house}} in the Hainan province {{presenting the}} most populated part of China is a «Siheyuan» country estate. Its <b>lay-out</b> <b>structure</b> contains an open internal courtyard and all the buildings are practically always located symmetrically relative to a central axis {{on the sides of}} the courtyard. The Siheyuan composition permits to divide it in elements which are convenient for a separate construction and for being connected in multi-element block-schemes.   In this connection the designing block-module method can be recommended as the most prospective one for improvement of the methodology for designing rural dwelling houses. Their large-scale construction on the valley territories of the Hainan province is planned by the leadership of the People’s Republic of China.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of four native-Roman settlements in Oss {{has shown that}} two major changes have taken place since the late Iron Age. Shifting farms were replaced by compound settlements at fixed locations. Within an enclosed spatial area farms were rebuilt on the same location.

Topology {{optimization}} {{deals with}} optimum material (mass) distribution within a design domain to find optimal <b>lay-out</b> of a <b>structure</b> subjected to certain boundary and loading conditions. Topology optimization {{can be used}} to address conflicting requirements, such as light weight and high-strength/stiffness design. In this paper, a simulation program to analyze topology optimization of beam structures with seven different end conditions and three types of loads (single point load, two point loads and uniformly distributed load) is developed using MATLAB code adapted from Sigmund’s 99 line topology optimization code. Furthermore, the program has been enhanced with a graphical user interface for ease of use. Using the developed system, it is possible to analyze the effect of different parameters...|$|R
40|$|The blade {{which can}} extract energy from wind {{plays a key}} role in a wind turbine system. Recently, finite element {{technology}} has been widely used in modern wind turbine blade design and analysis. However, due to the extremely complicated geometry shape and <b>structure</b> <b>lay-out</b> of the blade, finite element modeling of the blade becomes a quite challenge task and consumes a lot of time. In order to improve the efficiency of wind turbine blade design and analysis, this paper integrates Matlab language and APDL (Ansys Parametric Design Language) to develop a Matlab GUI (Graphic User Interface),which can generate the APDL commands used for building up the finite element model of blade while complete the blade geometry design. A 10 kW fixed-pitch stall-regulated wind turbine blade is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and practicality of this method...|$|R
40|$|Imagine an {{extraterrestrial}} researcher {{landing on}} one of our college or university campuses a regular class day. He would observe a particular behavior that reflects accepted conventions and rules: At a given signal young men and women enter spacious rooms, sit on chairs in front of desks and await the arrival of an older individual–usually better dressed–who addresses them while they take notes or ask questions. Other members of the campus community walk into rooms with various kinds of instruments and, under the guidance of older individuals, manipulate and observe tiny fragments of matter. If the extraterrestrial visitor were to ask these young people why they sit for hours in a room or strain their eyes in concentrated attention instead of playing, working, or doing something else, they would speak of values, telling him about the importance of obtaining knowledge and skills to earn a living, help other people, and achieve fulfillment in life. The extraterrestrial would also note that the campus <b>lay-out,</b> the administrative <b>structure,</b> the curriculum, the attitudes of students and teachers take for granted certain beliefs and convictions regarding human rationality, academic and professional traditions, the transmission of culture, the ability to set goals, and the freedom to move toward them...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 ’s {{there has}} been an at times heated debate on the {{intended}} function and the intended use of manuscripts. Within the field of Middle Dutch literature this debate is reflected in the discussion on the intended function and the intended use of the Lancelot Compilation, a vast collection of both translated and indigenous Middle Dutch Arthurian literature dating from {{the first quarter of the}} 14 th century. Was the compilation meant to be read privately, scholars wondered, or rather to be performed, read aloud to a listening audience? While some scholars were convinced, due to for instance manuscript <b>lay-out</b> and intricate <b>structure</b> of the verses of the compilation, that the codex had been primarily intended for individual reading, other scholars firmly believed performance supporting devices could be found in the manuscript. In this thesis, I will try to provide some new insights by following the paradigm of performance. In the first part of this thesis, I will set out to find answers to questions such as: what would a medieval performance text have needed? And were these requirements met by the Lancelot Compilation? In the second part of the thesis I will zoom in on what may very well be the most important as well as the most complicated aspect of performance: the performance of direct discourse...|$|R
40|$|The {{hierarchical}} {{topology optimization}} of three-dimensional structures is {{addressed in this}} paper. The <b>structure</b> <b>lay-out</b> (macroscale) and material microstructure (microscale) are optimized concurrently to minimize compliance. It is assumed that structure {{is made up of}} a periodic cellular material. This two-scale optimization problem is subjected to global/local material resource constraints and to specific local constraints controlling the perimeter on material microstructure design. To handle local constraints a proper algorithmic strategy is used combining two versions of MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes). Local design problems can be solved independently and one takes advantage of this property by using parallel computing techniques to speed-up the solution task. Concerning applications one might think on man’s made structures but the model is used to gain insight in natural hierarchical materials such as bone. At apparent level (macroscale) bone exhibits two types of tissues in a well-defined arrangement (cortical and trabecular) while going down on length scale (microscale) one distinguish trabeculae from marrow space. Actually, bone adapts to the mechanical environment by changing its microstructure and this natural adaptation is simulated in the present work. Further, among morphometric parameters used to characterize trabecular architecture there is the surface-to-volume ratio, which depends on anatomical site of the trabecular region. This biological feature of bone architecture is taken into account in the present study by means of a local material design constraint involving perimeter control. The results obtained for a proximal femur bone show a fin...|$|R
40|$|As {{solar cells}} become ever cheaper to make, cos ts not {{directly}} related to the solar cell man ufacturing process comprise an ever increasin g share of the total cost of a solar cell. These c osts can be reducedon a per unit energy basis ¨by making more efficient solar cells. Theref ore, there is a strong incentive for research in t he field of high-efficiency solar cells. Spec ifically silicon solar cells are of great pra ctical interest as they presently have a dominant¨ market position. Contact recombination curren ts are one of the major power loss mechanisms in c ertain types of high efficiency silicon solar ¨cells, for example interdigitated back conta ct silicon solar cells featuring diffused junction s. Therefore, reducing contact recombination¨ currents can result in efficiency gains. However,¨ the characterization of contact recombination ¨losses is convoluted, and many present techn ologies forthe characterization of contact recombi nation currents are imperfect. This provided¨ the incentive for this work on a novel charac terization method for contact recombination curren ts. The characterization method developed in¨ this dissertation is based on photo conductancemeasurements on lattices of point contacts on o therwise passivated wafers. Chapt er one features a general introduction. This inclu des a discussion the context in which this di ssertation is performed is performed. Then, v arious sources of efficiency loss in solar cells a rediscussed. The focus is on silicon solar ce lls, and Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC) silicon solar cells in particular. Finally, varioust ypes of passivated contacts are discussed. In chapter two, an introduction to carrie r recombination in silicon solar cells is pro vided. Chapter two also features an introduction t o radio-wave detected quasi steady state phot o conductance (QSSPC) measurements. QSSPC mea surements lie at the basis of the characterization ¨method for contact recombination measurement s which is developed in this dissertation. The result of chapter two is a mathematical framewor k for a number of basic concepts in the field ¨of silicon solar cells, and particularly in the f ield of silicon solar cell characterization. In chapter three, an overview of contem porary methods for contact recombination curr ent measurements is given, and it is argued why th e developmentof a novel method for contact re combination measurements is desirable. This m ethod is subsequently described in detail. This de tailed description covers the physics that li es at the basis of the method. It also covers ¨design rules, error analysis, parasitic effects,¨ and experimental results. The focus is on tes t structures based on lattices of point contacts,but at the end of chapter three, alternative¨ test structure embodiments are described. In chapter four, point contact based test¨ structures are applied to the optimization of ¨n+ diffusions which are used as back surface ¨fields (BSF) in interdigitated back contact (IBC) ¨silicon solar cells. In addition, various fr ont surface field oxidations are investigated. The ¨use of the test structure developed in chapt er three for a classical junction optimizationproblem allows for further experimental confirma tion of the characterization method. Certainl y, the consistency of the trends observed between¨ contact resistance, contact saturation curren t density and saturation current density of p assivated junctions is a strong experimental confi rmation of the novel characterization method¨ described in this dissertation. I n the final chapter, thin dielectric Al 2 O 3 la yers grown using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) are investigated for the passivation of¨ the interface between aluminum contacts and n+ orp+ silicon. Specific attention is paid to the ¨effect of specific surface treatments prior¨ to the formation of Al 2 O 3 contact passivation ¨layers: ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layerson HF-last and HNO 3 -last silicon are investigated. ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers arefound to effectively passivate aluminum contactson n+ silicon surfaces, but they are found to be¨ ineffective at passivating aluminum contacts¨ on p+ silicon surfaces. In addition, it is fo und that pin-holesassociated with HF-last ALD Al 2 O 3 contact passivation layers can improve the¨ trade-off between contact resistance and cont act recombination associated with passivated conta cts. However, the reproducibility of pinhole¨ formation in ALD Al 2 O 3 contacts remains an op en question. Acknowledgements	v Abstract	viii Nederlandse samenvatting	x Table of contents	xii 1.
