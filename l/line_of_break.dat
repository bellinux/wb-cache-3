Here, philosophy and photography illustrate thresholds through which teacher leaders enter educational policy discourse and development...|$|R
5000|$|This {{sense of}} the term is closely related to another sense, that <b>of</b> the <b>breaking</b> wave itself. In times past, when ocean {{navigation}} was relatively rudimentary, a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> waves was a crucial indicator that a boat was bearing down upon an island or reef. This was especially the case when sailing in darkness, in which the highly visible <b>line</b> <b>of</b> froth caused by breaking waves could be the only such indicator. In such cases the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> breakers was charted and named as a [...] "breaker".|$|R
60|$|They {{knew that}} the entrance, of whose {{existence}} they had been previously unaware, was an exceedingly narrow one and, as they neared the shore, could see--by the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> surf--that it could, at most, be wide enough for one to pass at a time, Accordingly one drew ahead and, discharging the cannon which it carried in its bow, rowed at full speed for the entrance; another following so close behind that its bow almost touched the stern.|$|R
50|$|A rip current, often {{referred}} to simply as a rip, or by the misnomer rip tide, is a specific kind of water current which can occur near beaches with breaking waves. However, a rip can often be hard to see and absent from breaking waves, and only recognised by a ripple {{on the top of}} the water that heads out to sea. A rip is a strong, localized, and narrow current of water which moves directly away from the shore, cutting through the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> waves like a river running out to sea, and is strongest near the surface of the water.|$|R

5000|$|The {{unimproved}} {{state of}} {{the mouth of the}} bay was a crescent-shaped bar covered by a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> waves. [...] The entrance of the bay is protected by two sand spits, named South Spit and North Spit. The bay mouth was stabilized by jetties with one jetty projecting from each spit. [...] The South Spit jetty was built starting in 1889, but by 1890 it was apparent that it was eroding the North Spit and widening the channel. [...] The jetties are approximately 6,000 ft long and 2,200 ft apart. Storm damage led to rebuilding of the jetties in 1911, 1927, 1932, 1939, 1950, 1957, 1963, 1971, 1988 and 1995. Entrance currents are strong ranging from 2.0 knots average maximum ebb and 1.6 knots average maximum flood; although peak rates can be nearly twice as high.|$|R

5000|$|A {{rip current}} forms because wind and {{breaking}} waves push surface water towards the land, and {{this causes a}} slight rise in the water level along the shore, which will tend to flow back to the open water by the route of least resistance. When there is a local area which is slightly deeper or a break in an offshore bar or reef, this can allow water to flow offshore more easily, and this will initiate a rip current through that gap. Water that has been pushed up near the beach flows along shore towards the outgoing rip as feeder currents, and then flows out at approximately a right angle to the beach in a tight current called the [...] "neck" [...] of the rip, where the flow is most rapid. When {{the water in the}} rip current reaches outside <b>of</b> the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> waves, the flow disperses sideways, loses power, and dissipates in {{what is known as the}} [...] "head" [...] of the rip.|$|R

40|$|Tasmanian {{physiography}} is {{so closely}} {{connected with the}} great occurrences of dolerite (diabase) that a correct understanding of the one {{is essential for the}} deciphering of the other. Every worker in geology in Tasmania has made some contribution towards the elucidation of the problem, and this paper merely carries our knowledge a little further. The statements here contained are not proved; and await further confirmation. To summarise, then, the physical outline of Tasmania is framed on blocks of country elevated to varying altitudes and consisting of relatively soft sediments with sills of very hard igneous rock intruded at various horizons. Previous to this elevation a definite topography had been eroded, the igneous rock modifying this considerably, and this topography was elevated or not according to its position. In the course of the elevation, again, the igneous rock modified the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>break,</b> and after elevation it largely controlled the rate of erosion. Subsequent to this elevation, the agents of-erosion, chiefly frost, snow, and ice, on the highlands have moulded the details of the landscape, and some slight faulting has added a few features locally...|$|R
