This {{research}} {{presents an}} algorithm that allows transaction processing to proceed during site failures and network partitioning while ensuring {{the consistency of}} replicated data. Our algorithm can be used together with various voting schemes which provide varying degrees of data availability. Different voting schemes may be used simul-taneously for different groups,'of data. Our algorithm contains as special cases: the site quorum method in which the ~ is a single distinguished partition, and the virtual partition method in which a (possibly different) distinguished partition is determined for each <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> item. By <b>grouping</b> <b>data</b> items in various ways, our algorithm can be tuned to yield methods which lie between these two extremes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Data models {{provide a}} map of the {{components}} of an information system. Prior research has indicated that more expressive conceptual data models (despite their increased size) result in better performance for problem solving tasks. An initial experiment using <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> models indicated that more expressive <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> models also enhanced end-user performance for information retrieval tasks. However, the principles of parsimony and bounded rationality imply that, past some point, increases in size lead to a level of complexity that results in impaired performance. The results of this study support these principles. For a <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> model of increased but still modest size, users composing queries for the more expressive <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> model did not perform as well as users composing queries for the corresponding less expressive but more parsimonious <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> model.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to managing large, heterogeneous, and distributed collections of data is {{to separate the}} data itself (and its physical rendering in replicas) from the metadata that describes {{the nature of the}} <b>data</b> (often called <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> descriptions). Metadata catalogs store descriptive information (metadata attributes) about <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> items. These catalogs can then be queried to retrieve the particular <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> item that matches the desired criteria. However, the query has to be formulated in terms of the metadata attributes defined for the catalog. Our work explores the notion of virtual metadata, where catalogs can be queried using metadata attributes not originally defined in the catalog. We use semantic web standards to query catalogs with virtual metadata and reason about how to map them into existing metadata attributes. ...|$|R

As a consequence a mixed traffic scenario where both unicast and multicast demands compete for the same shared resources, is the one {{more likely to be}} found within the current transport networks. On today’s traffic-engineered networks such traffic travels through <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> paths setting up by constrained-based routing schemes provided by a control plane. In this paper we have devised a novel constraint-based routing scheme to forward unicast and multicast traffic envisioning a system resource consumption outstanding performance. We introduce the concept of AnyTraffic <b>data</b> <b>group</b> which consists of a group of egress nodes receiving unicast and multicast traffic over the same single minimum-cost tree. A novel Steiner tree-based heuristic algorithm is specifically defined to accommodate such <b>data</b> <b>group</b> and has been compared with the standard shortest path (SP) algorithm - the optimal case for unicast routing - and a classical Steiner tree (ST) heuristic algorithm - the optimal case for multicast routing. Exhaustive experiments have been done to validate the results. Preprin...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of data models produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database {{to be used for}} the information system. [...] The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual data model which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> model, which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual data model may require multiple <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> models. The last step in data modeling is transforming the <b>logical</b> <b>data</b> model to a physical data model that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. Data modeling defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them.|$|R

Some types however cannot be derived and need to be defined explicitly in this data model. Below is an example of this data model.|$|R
