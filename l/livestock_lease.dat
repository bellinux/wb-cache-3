40|$|Some {{producers}} find it {{advantageous to}} lease their cattle to other producers either for cash {{or for a}} share of the calf crop. This may be in the course of ultimately transferring the herd — e. g., to a child or other new owner. It may also be used by a producer who has been forced to liquidate his/her herd and wishes to re-establish a new herd. This checklist has been adapted from Doye, Sahs 2 ̆ 6 Coe, Breeding <b>Livestock</b> <b>Lease</b> Agreements, F- 571 and Doye, Sahs 2 ̆ 6 Coe, Stocker <b>Livestock</b> <b>Lease</b> Agreements, F- 572 (Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service) ...|$|E

5000|$|Approximately $45 {{million of}} private {{donations}} and $18 {{million in federal}} Land and Water Conservation funds were spent to purchase land from the Catellus Corporation between 1999 and 2004 {{with the promise of}} conserving it in perpetuity. However, the BLM subsequently accepted applications to build solar and wind energy projects on these former railroad lands. [...] The California Desert Protection Act of 2010 provides additional protection for approximately 266000 acre of these acquisitions, prohibiting disposal of this land or additional mining, rights-of-way, <b>leases,</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing, infrastructure development, or off-highway vehicle use.|$|R

40|$|As the {{challenges}} toward earning a viable living from farming continue to mount in rural areas, natural resources professionals, consumers and agricultural producers are seeking alternative methods {{of food and}} crop production to enhance market potential for rural, agricultural-based communities (Raedeke, Green, Hodge and Valdivia 2003). Agroforestry, a set of integrated land management practices, is one possible solution to helping landowners remain successful on agricultural lands. The practice combines trees and crops together in strategically planned settings as an income-producing alternative to “conventional farming practices, ” such as traditional monocropped farming (Raedeke et. al 2003). Agroforestry provides short-term income from products like nuts, specialty mushrooms, and medicinal herbs, while also establishing opportunities for long-term income, such as a timber harvest, <b>livestock</b> production and <b>lease</b> hunting or recreational opportunities. For example, wheat or bluegrass hay can be planted in between rows of pecan trees in the agroforestry practice of alley cropping. The wheat and nut crops are harvested for income while the trees mature for later timber harvest, offering increased market potential to even a smaller acreage of land. In addition to short and long-term income opportunities, agroforestry provides environmental and ecological benefits (Garrett et. al 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explores the}} effects of HIV/AIDS on the {{livelihoods}} of banana-farming households in Maragua district, Central Kenya. It {{is based on the}} results of a field study carried out during 2004 – 2005. The study applied the sustainable livelihood approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. A survey was conducted among 254 farming households: 75 HIV/AIDS-affected households and 179 non-affected households. It was found that the people attribute the spread of HIV/AIDS in the area to rural-urban migration and hopelessness and despair due to lack of employment, especially among the youth. HIV/AIDS-affected households are mostly female-headed, have a significantly higher dependency ratio and experience labour shortage despite their larger size. A significant number of affected households have stopped growing labour-intensive cash crops and shifted to producing food crops. Management in banana farming has declined among these households. Affected households do not sell land to cater for household needs such as medical expenses and school fees, but use their savings or sell <b>livestock</b> instead. Additionally, <b>leasing</b> land and migration are important livelihood strategies of HIV/AIDS-affected households. Altogether the picture of HIV/AIDS effects on the livelihoods of banana-farming households is one of mixed evidence...|$|R
40|$|Incentives and {{compliance}} There are no explicit incentives under the LAA to encourage best practice for sustainable land management. On the other hand, {{there are a}} number of penalties for breaches of the conditions of a lease: – A lessee may be fined or may forfeit rights to the lease if they fail to comply with the LAA, any conditions of the lease, a soil conservation notice (imposed by the Soil Commissioner under the Soil and Land Conservation Act) or any other conditions imposed by the Board. – The Board can instruct a lessee to destock a portion of a lease or the entire lease, or to redistribute the <b>livestock</b> on the <b>lease</b> to relieve pressure in particular areas. Ignoring this instruction and the default notice can expose the lessee to fines. – A fine of $ 10, 000 applies where actions are taken without a permit, such as clearing of land, sowing (and selling) non-native pastures and conducting non-pastoral economic activities. – Failure to comply with a default notice that warns of a breach of conditions may incur a fine of $ 50, 000. Government programs that support sustainability – Gascoyne-Murchison Strategy (GMS) Developed by the Department of Agriculture, the GMS prompted a number of programs. It has a focus on an economically sustainable base for the industry but also includes an environmental sustainability component...|$|R
