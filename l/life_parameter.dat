40|$|AbstractMost of the {{existing}} methods for the estimation of strain <b>life</b> <b>parameters</b> were developed by correlating experimentally determined strain <b>life</b> <b>parameters,</b> directly and independently of each other, {{with one or more}} readily obtainable monotonic tensile material properties. In some cases, this resulted in relatively complicated expressions for the calculation of fatigue parameters, while in others, because of the poor correlation between certain fatigue and monotonic properties, constant values were assigned to some of these fatigue parameters. Since in the strain life approach the fatigue life of the material is defined by Δε/ 2 − 2 Nf relationship, it is suggested that the estimation of the strain <b>life</b> fatigue <b>parameters</b> should be based on the analysis and connection of actual strain life data to an appropriate monotonic property. For the purpose of an initial verification of the proposed approach, estimation of fatigue parameters σf′, b, εf′ and c was performed using data gathered for normalized and quenched and tempered high-strength low-alloy steels AISI 4140 and AISI 4142. Brinell hardness HB was chosen as a required monotonic parameter. Numbers of load reversals 2 Nf calculated using experimentally determined and estimated fatigue parameters were analyzed and compared. They were found to be in very good agreement, thus confirming good predictive capabilities as well as general validity of the proposed approach to the estimation of strain <b>life</b> fatigue <b>parameters...</b>|$|R

To better identify the <b>life</b> <b>parameters</b> such as respiration and heartbeat, a novel method combined with several signal processing techniques is presented. Firstly, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the life signals, the signal accumulation technique by FFT is used. Then, to restrain the interferences produced by moving objects, a dual filtering algorithm (DFA) which is able to remove the interferences by tracing the interfering spectral peaks is proposed. Finally, the wavelet transform is applied to separate the heartbeat from the respiration signal. The method cannot only help to automatically detect the existence of human beings effectively, but also identifying the parameters like respiration, heartbeat, and body-moving signals significantly.

The estimation of its value is a constant objective pursued by those types of organizations. It is a common practice to consider the minimum life value equal to zero when dealing with metallurgical products. This means that a failure can occur at any time after time zero (t> 0). However, there are several metallurgical products having a minimum life quite different from zero. It is the case, for example, of steel beams, used in the construction of bridges, overpasses and buildings. In this work we will apply a sequential life testing approach developed by De Souza [1] to steel beams made with a type of a low-alloy, high strength steel, to determine the resistance to fatigue (cycles) presented by this type of steel.

Theoretically, the combination of orchiectomy and chemotherapy could reduce androgen sensitive and insensitive cells in the prostate. This European Organization for Research in Cancer Therapy Genitourinary Group randomized, multicenter phase III trial demonstrates the outcome of orchiectomy alone versus orchiectomy followed by intravenous mitomycin C. A total of 189 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and poor prognostic factors were randomized in this trial by 42 institutions. Of these patients 184 (97 %) were eligible for study, including 90 treated with orchiectomy alone (orchiectomy only arm) and 94 treated with orchiectomy followed by 15 mg. /m. 2 mitomycin C in 1 week (combined treatment arm). Mitomycin C was administered every 6 weeks and treatment was continued as long as tolerance and patient compliance allowed, and no progression was observed. Objective and subjective criteria for progression were clearly defined in the protocol. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms. At a median followup of 4. 2 years 144 patients had died, including 112 of prostate cancer. No significant differences for time to overall (p = 0. 17), subjective (p = 0. 25) and objective (p = 0. 08) progression {{were found between the}} 2 treatment groups. For progression-free survival no difference was noted (p = 0. 67) between the 2 treatment groups but a trend in favor of orchiectomy alone was observed for overall survival (p = 0. 04).

Previous studies on {{quality of life in}} patients with DTC were hampered by small patient numbers, limited of quality of <b>life</b> <b>parameters</b> or were uncontrolled. Design: Cross-sectional case-control study. Method: We assessed quality of life in 153 cured DTC patients with a median duration of cure of 6. 34 years (range 0. 3 - 41. 8) and studied the contribution of disease specific, biochemical and social variables, focusing on the degree of TSH suppression. Four validated health-related questionnaires were used (Short Form- 36, Multidimensional Fatigue Index- 20, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Somatoform Disorder Questionnaire), including multiple aspects of physical, psychological and social functioning. Patients were compared with 113 controls selected by patients themselves (control group-I), and with 336 pooled age- and gender-matched controls from other Leiden quality of life studies (control group-II). Results: Patients had significantly decreased quality of life in 11 of 16 subscales when compared with control group-I. Comparison with control group-II, decreased scores in 13 of 16 items were observed. An important independent predictor for quality of life was duration of cure. Quality of <b>life</b> <b>parameters</b> were not influenced by serum TSH levels, both measured at the time of quality of life assessment and measured over time since initial therapy.
