5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 {{the total population of}} the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago <b>Land</b> <b>Clearance</b> Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E
5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E

5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some <b>land</b> <b>clearance,</b> Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E

The same year Darst promoted a $1.5 million bond issue that allowed for the completion of the St. Louis Gateway Mall project by clearing blocks of land from 15th to 18th streets. Darst also was responsible for encouraging the construction of several large high-rise housing projects, all of which began between 1951 and 1953.|$|E

25|$|Although the Commission of Fine Arts did {{not approve}} the FBI building's final design until November 1967, the first {{contract}} for <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> and excavation was awarded in March 1965. GSA also moved ahead with funding requests for construction in 1965. But securing that funding proved elusive. A Johnson administration request for $45.8 million in initial funding was denied by the House Appropriations Committee in May. Although both administration and FBI officials expressed confidence that {{the money would be}} restored, a House-Senate budget conference committee in August declined to include the funds in the fiscal 1966 budget.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} approved Labeaume's <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> and memorial design plan, and in 1935, {{the city}} issued a $7.5 million bond to purchase and demolish buildings at the site. The clearance project was aided by $9 {{million from the}} Works Progress Administration, and work began quickly on acquisition and demolition of the forty block area. The only remnant of Laclede's street grid to be preserved was north of the Eads Bridge (in what {{is now known as}} Laclede's Landing), while the only building in the area to remain was the Old Cathedral, built in 1834. Demolition continued until the outbreak of World War II, when the area began {{to be used as a}} parking lot, and the project remained stalled until the late 1940s.|$|E

First Officer Vunpin was the pilot flying and Captain Aditya was the Pilot Monitoring. At 09:22, the flight crews made first communication with El Tari Control Tower controller (El Tari Tower) and reported their position and maintaining 11,500 ft. The pilot received information that the runway in use was 07 and the weather information. Flight 6517 later descended approved their descent clearance of 5.000 ft. At 09.38 local time, the crew reported the aircraft was passing 10,500 ft and stated that the flight was on Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). El Tari Airport then obtained visual contact with Flight 6517 and issued a <b>landing</b> <b>clearance.</b> At 09.51 a.m, the crew reported that their position was on final and the El Tari Tower re-issued the <b>landing</b> <b>clearance.</b> Flight 6517 then retracted its landing gear.|$|R
25|$|In 1948, voters {{rejected}} the {{proposal for a}} municipal loan to finance the change, but soon the situation was changed with the Housing Act of 1949 and Missouri state laws that provided co-financing of public housing projects. The approach taken by Darst, urban renewal, was shared by the Harry S. Truman administration and fellow mayors of other cities overwhelmed by industrial workers recruited during the war. Specifically, St. Louis <b>Land</b> <b>Clearance</b> and Redevelopment Authority was authorized to acquire and demolish the slums of the inner ring and then sell the land at reduced prices to private developers, fostering middle-class return and business growth. Another agency, St. Louis Housing Authority, had to clear land to construct public housing for the former slum dwellers.|$|E

Her mother Jean was involved in local politics in the United Party, Progressive Party and as city councilor. She was the eldest of five children, one sister and three brothers, and attended the Roedean School in Johannesburg where the principal, Ella la Maitre's religious and liberal views would influence Duncan's life. During her youth she {{spent some time in}} Southern Rhodesia before leaving for Scotland where she was educated at the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, qualifying in 1953. On her return to South Africa she married architect Neil Duncan in 1955 and the settled in Southern Rhodesia where she worked as a teacher of domestic science. They stayed there for eight years before returning to South Africa in 1963 and joining the Black Sash and would be the chairman of the Transvaal region. On the retirement of her mother in 1975, Duncan became president of the Black Sash from 1975 until 1978 then serving as vice president before being elected again in 1982 until 1986.

500|$|In {{the century}} before the Romans arrived in Britain, the area now covered by West Sussex was {{ruled by the}} Atrebates, a Belgic tribe led by Commius. [...] They {{were found to have}} been present in the area now covered by Southgate when {{building}} work took place in 1969. [...] The Southgate West development was underway on land covered by Hogs Hill Farm, which occupied a ridge of land between the Horsham and Brighton Roads. [...] <b>Land</b> <b>clearance</b> revealed two ditches filled with debris such as bones and pieces of pottery. [...] The next year, a large house on Horsham Road was demolished {{to make way for a}} new road of houses; the builders discovered similar pits, and the remains were identified as pre-Roman using carbon dating techniques. [...] The remains of crucibles, slag and other ironworking materials were also discovered; these were confirmed as being from the same era, the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. [...] It was later confirmed that the Hogs Hill Farm remains dated from the Roman era, meaning that the ironmaking and pottery-producing activities of the Atrebates were continued by their conquerors. [...] By the time the excavations and investigation finished, evidence of three iron bloomeries, a small flint mine, roof tiles (possibly from a building on the site) and many pieces of pottery had been found and catalogued.|$|E

2500|$|The J. Edgar Hoover Building is a {{low-rise}} {{office building}} located at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., in the United States. It is {{the headquarters of}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Planning for the building began in 1962, and a site was formally selected in January 1963. Design work, focusing on avoiding the typical blocky, monolithic structure typical of most federal architecture at the time, began in 1963 and was largely complete by 1964 (although final approval did not occur until 1967). <b>Land</b> <b>clearance</b> and excavation of the foundation began in March 1965; delays in obtaining congressional funding meant that only the three-story substructure was complete by 1970. Work on the superstructure began in May 1971. These delays meant that the cost of the project grew to $126.108 million from $60 million.

2500|$|The {{industrial}} {{history of}} the site {{is reflected in the}} habitats and wildlife that it now supports. Historically, the Park would have predominantly been broadleaved woodland. Due to the activities of Saxon <b>land</b> <b>clearance</b> and subsequent land management through the medieval ages, this would have been converted to a patchwork of arable farmland, grassland and copses. By the Industrial Revolution, much of the Park area would have contained spoil mounds and quarry pits with isolated remnants of woodland and grassland habitats. [...] Since the abandonment of industry, the pit mounds and surrounding areas have reverted to heathland and extensive areas of grassland; the quarried areas have become lakes and ponds; and woodland, scrub and hedges have established elsewhere, including alongside the old canal and railway. This mosaic of different habitats now support a variety of wildlife including birds, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, bats and other mammals. [...] In recognition of the educational and amenity value of this biodiversity resource, a significant proportion of the Park has been designated as a statutory Local Nature Reserve (LNR) (Figure 1.1).|$|E

2500|$|Land {{clearing}} operations {{had been}} undertaken by 1st Field Squadron since {{the occupation of}} Nui Dat to improve base defences and observation. Later they were extended for tactical purposes to open up key routes within Phuoc Tuy by removing vegetation to deny cover and concealment to the Viet Cong, and also provided arable land for villagers {{as part of the}} Pacification program. In March 1968, a dedicated Land Clearing Team was formed by 17th Construction Squadron elements at Nui Dat to supplement existing arrangements. One particular operation, codenamed [...] "Cooktown Orchid" [...] conducted in April 1968, saw a large element of Plant Troop deploy under infantry and armoured protection to clear undergrowth and trees {{in the foothills of the}} Long Hai mountains. <b>Land</b> <b>clearance</b> operations proved quite dangerous for the plant operators who were exposed to land mines and booby traps, as well as to attack by small arms and other direct fire weapons. During this operation one D8 bulldozer was destroyed, and a sapper injured when an RPG round hit the dozer he was operating. In 1969 the squadron continued with land clearing tasks within the 1 ATF area of operations. During the operation, numerous bunker systems were uncovered and the D8 dozers detonated many mines. In August 1969, 9 Troop assisted in replacing a sabotaged bridge with a [...] floating pontoon bridge. The enemy had blown the bridge on National Route 51, [...] south-east of Saigon.
