In {{the past ten years}} important events have occurred and a number of NRC, industry, and international studies have concluded that significant frequencies of reactor core damage could occur from accidents initiated during <b>low</b> power and <b>shutdown</b> (LPSD) operations. This perspective has led to several initiatives to ensure safety during such operations, including: Reactor licensees have developed and applied methods for better managing plant safety during outages.

This approach is judged to be bounding for the low power/shutdown conditions, for both the release category frequencies and for the severity of the source terms expected from accidents initiated from <b>low</b> power or <b>shutdown.</b> ” The release category frequencies are a function of frequencies of various initiating event, the system unavailabilities, the human error probabilities, and the conditional probability associated with containment failure, given core damage.

40|$|Several BWR {{utilities}} are adopting practices {{for determining the}} state of control rods based on the neutron sensitive LPRM and gamma sensitive TIP measurement systems of the nuclear reactor core. This method is in this study evaluated by quantitatively analyzing the detector sensitivity to several material and geometrical distortions in the detector vicinity, using the Los Alamos National Laboratory stochastic Monte Carlo code MCNP 5 and the Westinghouse 3 D core simulator POLCA 7. These results are used {{to determine whether or}} not there are potential pitfalls that need to be considered when applying the in-core detector based diagnostic methods to determine the state of control rods. This study also addresses the utility concern about shutdown margin deterioration due to potential loss of neutron absorbing material from control rods. It is found that indication of potential control rod leakage by means of the LPRM and the gamma TIP probe detector systems is feasible, provided that both detector systems show similar deviations that correspond to the potential loss of neutron absorbing material from the control rod. Furthermore, it is possible to correlate the observed detector signaldeviation to the magnitude of the distortion. The study lays out criteria that need to befulfilled for indication of control rod leakage to be reasonable, but it is to be noted that nodefinitive stand is or can be taken regarding the state of individual control rods at anyutility. The shutdown margin is found not to be significantly deteriorated in any of the utility cases that are studied under an assumption of control rod loss of neutron absorbing material as apotential cause for anomalous detector readings.

To understand the physical phenomena that takes place inside the reactor, the experiments are simulated with thermal-hydraulic codes, and this makes it possible to analyze the code capabilities to predict the plant behavior. This work presents the simulation results of four experiments included in PKL experimental series obtained using RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} most {{probabilistic}} risk assessments (PRAs) of severe accidents in {{nuclear power plants}} have considered initiating events which could potentially lead to core damage and containment failure during normal full power operation. However, recent studies and operational experience during periods while plants were shutdown for maintenance or refueling indicated that potential accidents initiated during low power operation or shutdown conditions could also potentially become important contributors to risk. In 1989, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) began an extensive program to assess the risk during <b>low</b> power and <b>shutdown</b> operation. Two plants, Surry (a pressurized water reactor, PWR) and Grand Gulf (a boiling water reactor,BWR) were selected as the plants to be studied. This paper describes an analysis of accident progression and offsite consequences (level 3 PRA) carried out for the Surry plant. The focus of the level 3 PRA was on mid-loop operation, which is a plant operational state (POS) that can occur while the plant is shutdown for maintenance or refueling. Mid-loop refers to a configuration when the reactor coolant system is lowered to the mid-plane of the hot leg to allow essential maintenance to be performed. This operational state was selected after an initial coarse screening study indicated that reduced inventory during mid-loop operation could pose higher risk than other POSs...|$|R
40|$|After the {{occurrence}} of several significant events in nuclear power plants during shutdown modes of operation in the eighties, and {{from the results of}} probabilistic safety assessments completed in the nineties, it was clear that risk from <b>low</b> power and <b>shutdown</b> operational modes could not be neglected and had to be addressed by appropriate safety programs. A comprehensive review of operating experience from the last ten years has been conducted by the Joint Research Centre with the objective of deriving lessons learned and recommendations useful for nuclear regulatory bodies and utilities alike. This paper is focused on one particular challenge that any nuclear plant faces whenever it plans its next outage period: how to manage the configuration of all systems under a complex environment involving numerous concurrent activities, and how to make sure that systems are returned to their valid configuration before the plant resumes power operation. This study highlights the importance of conveying accurate but synthesized information on the status of the plant to the operators in the main control room. Many of the lessons learned are related to the alarm display in the control room and to the use of check lists to control the status of systems. Members of the industry and safety authorities may now use these recommendations and lessons learned to feed their own operating experience feedback programs, and check their applicability for specific sites.
