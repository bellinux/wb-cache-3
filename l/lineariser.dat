40|$|Power {{amplifiers}} are {{key elements}} in the modern communication systems. They are used to generate the required power and amplify the signal to be transmitted. Linear and efficient amplifiers are needed in most of modern wireless systems. However, either linearity or efficiency will be compromised during amplifier design procedure. In order to meet these two requirement at the same time, linearisers are usually applied on the efficient but nonlinear amplifiers. This dissertation presents a study of a novel linearisation technique, based on the minimal control synthesis (MCS) algorithm. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of this new linearisation approach. The aim is achieved by the simulation and implementation results. The MCS-based <b>lineariser</b> can be implemented on their own. Alternatively, the adaptive controllers can be retrofitted to existing, more conventional control schemes, e. g. pre-distortion <b>lineariser</b> and Cartesian feedback <b>lineariser.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The Cartesian {{feedback}} {{technique is}} an extended solution {{for reducing the}} distortions generated by the nonlinearities of power RF amplifiers, being its restrictions of use related to the stability margins of the <b>lineariser</b> loop. Here, considerations are given to its use in the Ka-band, where the small wavelengths lead to critical times and phase unbalances which produce misadjustments of the feedback loop parameters. Results are obtained from the simulation of a Cartesian feedback <b>lineariser</b> applied to a commercial 28 GHz power amplifier. Introduction: Among the different linerisation techniques, Cartesian feedback, feedforward and predistortion are the most suitable for multilevel modulation, where class A or class AB power amplifiers are necessary. Other techniques, such as LINC [1], CALLUM [2] or Envelope Elimination and Restoration [3] are guided to higher-efficiency amplifiers used in modulations which produce smal...|$|E

40|$|Predistortion (PD) <b>lineariser</b> for {{microwave}} power amplifiers (PAs) {{is an important}} topic of research. With larger and larger bandwidth as it appears today in modern WiMax standards {{as well as in}} multichannel base stations for 3 GPP standards, the relatively simple nonlinear effect of a PA becomes a complex memory-including function, severely distorting the output signal. In this contribution, two digital PD algorithms are investigated for the linearisation of microwave PAs in mobile communications. The first one is an efficient and low-complexity algorithm based on a memoryless model, called the simplicial canonical piecewise linear (SCPWL) function that describes the static nonlinear characteristic of the PA. The second algorithm is more general, approximating the pre-inverse filter of a nonlinear PA iteratively using a Volterra model. The first simpler algorithm is suitable for compensation of amplitude compression and amplitude-to-phase conversion, for example, in mobile units with relatively small bandwidths. The second algorithm can be used to linearise PAs operating with larger bandwidths, thus exhibiting memory effects, for example, in multichannel base stations. A measurement testbed which includes a transmitter-receiver chain with a microwave PA is built for testing and prototyping of the proposed PD algorithms.

The FPGA implementation allows the pre-inverse filter to be tested in a real-time mode. Measurement results show excellent linearisation capabilities of both the proposed algorithms in terms of adjacent channel power suppression. It is also shown that the fixed-point FPGA implementation of the iterative algorithm performs as well as the floating-point implementation.|$|E
40|$|New {{concepts}} of telecommunication satellites request very small, highly integrated and linearised travelling wave tube amplifiers (LTWTA). A linearised channel amplifier (LCAMP) and an {{electronic power conditioner}} (EPC) was developed to be integrated together building one unit for the C- and Ku-Band. The LCAMP was designed for a short travelling wave tube (STWT) and optimised mechanically for the integration with the developed EPC regarding best electrical performance, volume and weight. This could be realised by applying new components (like SMD-parts, ASIC and MMIC) {{and the development of}} a new housing. One major task was the selection of a MMIC-manufacturer, the designing of MMIC and the final testing for the LCAMP. A potential high-rel manufacturer (UMS- united microwave semiconductor) has been selected and the measured results of the MMIC are close to the calculated. An ESA-evaluation was performed in the frame of LVS-Study at UMS successfully. Bosch evaluated the market for microwave packages and selected finally Kyocera who provides packages for applications up to 20 GHz. The experience during procurement of packages was important for integration of MMIC into LCAMP. The LCAMP was integrated with the EPC in C- and Ku-band and finally tested with the STWT. Particular good results were measured for intermodulation products and phase shift behaviour. All other requirements of the integrated LTWTA were fulfilled, if they are in the nature of the LCAMP and EPC only. The achieved size of the EPC is 198 x 110 x 60, 5 mm and the total weight of the LTWTA is about 2300 grams (including channel amplifier, <b>lineariser,</b> EPC, STWT and connecting cables). (orig.)
