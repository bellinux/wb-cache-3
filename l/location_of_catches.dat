We have data on catches per species {{for a number of}} vessels collected by the European Union {{in the context of the}} North Atlantic Fisheries Organization. Many variables can be thought to influence the amount caught: a number of ship characteristics —such as the size of the ship, the fishing technique used, the mesh size of the nets, etc. —, are obvious candidates, but one can also consider the season or the actual <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>catch.</b> In all, our database leads to 23 possible regressors, resulting in a set of 8. 4 × 10 6 possible linear regression models.

40|$|Abstract: The heavily {{degraded}} {{area of the}} Ljubljanica River corridor upstream and downstream of the Ljubljana {{urban area}} is an important habitat for the fragmented and heavily endangered populations of Danube Salmon (Hucho hucho), Danube Roach (Rutilus pigus) and Striped Chub (Leuciscus souffia). Nowadays the water level upstream of the weir on the Ljubljanica River is too low therefore during low flow conditions the main Ljubljanica River channel is not connected to its tributaries. This represents a great obstacle for the habitat connectivity along the river reaches which is worsened by the improperly working fish passes. To enable fish migration along the river concrete restoration measures were performed. The reconstructions of sill and two fish passes on the Ljubljanica River have been implemented and barrier’s lifting system on the weir was modernized. During the entire project fish monitoring is being performed in different ways. It helps us to evaluate if concrete restoration actions (restoration of sill, two fish passes and a barrier) were successful and if fish migration is improved. We follow fish migration with marking the fish with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags. Regarding the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> we implant tags beneath transparent or translucent tissue combining different tag locations (dorsal fin, post ocular tissue) and colours (red and yellow). The success of restoration actions is monitored {{with the use of}} on line connected cameras installed on the fish passes. Records from the camera are analysed to evaluate number and type of fish using the fish pass. The data gathered from the fish monitoring will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} fish migration along the Ljubljanica and Sava River and will help to evaluate the project success...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio vulnificus (Vv) and V. parahaemolyticus (Vp) are gram negative, halophilic {{bacteria}} that occur naturally in estuarine waters of Galveston Bay. Both bacteria {{have the potential}} to cause infections in humans either via consumption or direct contact. Finfish are a potential vector for these bacteria. Previous work by Brinkmeyer determined that these bacteria are present on the benthic dwelling catfish, Ariopsis felis and Bagre marinus, using a conventional microbial method. The present work focused on using Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (QPCR) and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) to not only determine presence of these bacteria, but also to quantify them and look at community structure. QPCR was able to detect bacteria presence in 34 percent, 31. 6 percent, and 0 percent for V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus. thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) and thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) genes, respectively. Statistical analysis of the QPCR results found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the length <b>of</b> fish, <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> or species <b>of</b> fish in relation to the abundance of bacteria. T-RFLP was able to detect the presence of bacteria in approximately 70 percent of the samples surveyed. Bands produced from T-RFLP were able to be grouped into five different ranges. The most frequently occurring band fell in the range of 213 - 219 base pairs, and the most common number of bands per sample was 1 band. This study found that both QPCR and T-RFLP were better assays than conventional microbial methods for detecting the presence of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus on catfish fins. QPCR proved to be the most rapid detection method. Based on this study, it was determined that these Vibrio spp. bacteria have some type of relationship with A. felis and B. marinus. This information may be useful to the medical community for determining when there is a greater risk of infection via catfish puncture wounds...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a fourth}} {{report on the}} fishing areas for the sardine, Sardinops caerulea, off the California coast. Previous {{accounts}} described the areas in detail from shortly after the industry's inception (investigation records date from 1919), through the period of rapid expansion (1920 's), and terminated with the peak season of production (1936 – 37). During the twenties the fishing grounds were extended from the localities near port to greater distances both offshore and north and south along the coast. By {{the end of that}} decade the fishermen were operating from Pt. Reyes to the Farallon Islands and southward to Pt. Sur, and by the mid-thirties the San Francisco fishermen were catching sardines as far north as Pt. Arena. In Southern California the fishing grounds extended from Pt. Conception to San Diego and around all the Channel Islands. The present study covers the 12 seasons 1937 – 38 through 1948 – 49. In this time interval the maximum boundaries of the fishing grounds remained the same. The only marked change was the development by the Monterey fishermen of the grounds between Pt. Sur and Pt. Buchon. The purpose of this report is threefold: to record where sardines were caught, to note the yield of sardines per block area, and to indicate any shift of fishing grounds during the period of study. The earliest reports were based on fishermen interviews, giving accurate pinpoint <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>catches.</b> This method is limited by the number of interviews that can be held during any given season, which, in practice, never encompasses the entire fleet. The full extent of the fishing grounds is thus difficult to determine. The recording of the successful fishing <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> the entire fleet during each fishing day of the season was begun in the early 1930 's, when the waters off the coast were divided into numbered blocks of 10 minutes of latitude and 10 minutes of longitude. The Division of Fish and Game provides the fishermen with charts showing these blocks and requests that the block in which the catch was made be recorded on the receipt which the weighmaster makes out when a load of fish is purchased. A copy of this receipt furnishes the basic information from which the California fishery statistics are compiled. To obtain supplementary data, checkers are maintained at each port during the sardine season; they observe and make notes on the unloading of the boats, the composition <b>of</b> the <b>catch,</b> the condition <b>of</b> the fish, and any other pertinent information. These notes are filed with the corresponding boat receipts and the two combined represent a fairly complete history of a load of sardines. In the present study the material was first compiled to show total tonnages taken from each specific block without regard to port of delivery. To indicate general trends and to eliminate minute details the 12 seasons were combined into four three-season groups: 1937 – 38 through 1939 – 40, 1940 – 41 through 1942 – 43, 1943 – 44 through 1945 – 46, and 1946 – 47 through 1948 – 49. The average tonnage of each block area in each of the three-season groups was then computed and plotted. The present extent of the sardine fishing grounds was well established by the early 1930 's. To note any shift of fishing intensity within these known grounds, the tonnages for individual blocks were grouped into broader areas. The seasonal tonnage for each of these larger regions was computed and its relative importance indicated {{as a percentage of the}} total season catch for the entire State...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtending the {{definition}} of small scale fisheries is a recurrent issue in policy and research debates. A broader definition of small scale fisheries would need to encompass, in addition to vessel size attributes such as vessel length, variables relating to their local operational range, their social role in coastal communities and {{the economics of the}} enterprise. In this study, data mining and geospatial analysis techniques were used to explore the relationship between vessel characteristics and local operational range. The process relies heavily on the availability of detailed logbook data and involves two main steps: (1) clustering vessels on the basis of operational range attributes and (2) finding vessel characteristics that best match the operational range classes through machine learning algorithms. The analysis was carried out using the Swedish fishing fleet as a case study and considers the fishing activity of the entire fleet over the period 2007 – 2013. Swedish logbook data offers the advantage of providing precise spatial information on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>catch.</b> Results clearly identified three operational range clusters: local, medium and long range. When considering engine power and vessel tonnage as explanatory variables, the classification algorithms were able to represent the operational range classes with a success rate of 94 %.
