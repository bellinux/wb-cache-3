5000|$|Backscatter {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} directly gives a measure of clouds and aerosols. Other derived measurements from backscatter such as winds or cirrus ice crystals require careful selecting of the wavelength and/or polarization detected. Doppler lidar and Rayleigh Doppler lidar are used to measure temperature and/or wind speed along the beam by measuring {{the frequency of the}} backscattered light. The Doppler broadening of gases in motion allows the determination of properties via the resulting frequency shift.

40|$|At present {{there is}} no single {{technology}} that can measure both terrain heights and water depths to a suitable level of accuracy and density for applications such as storm surge modelling and coastal inundation studies. Conventional topographic <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed for measuring high resolution terrain heights, but {{they do not have the}} ability to penetrate water to yield bathymetric results. Bathymetric <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> have been specifically developed to measure water depth and can also measure terrain heights, but with typically lower accuracy and spatial resolution than available from the topographic equivalent. A further limitation of all bathymetric <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> is their inability to measure depths where the water is cloudy or turbid. Of particular importance to this project is the fact that bathymetric <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> cannot acquire dependable bathymetric data in the near-shore or surf zone. Accordingly, there is frequently a discontinuity between terrain height data acquired by topographic <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> and water depth data collected by bathymetric <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems.</b> The height datums used by such systems also tend to be inconsistent in terms of the way they are realised, creating further difficulties when endeavouring to integrate the respective data sets. The Cooperative Research Centre of Spatial Information has been working with the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment on a pilot project to investigate issues and technical challenges that are faced in the development of a continuous LIDAR based terrain model that traverses the littoral zone. This paper summarises the results of this pilot project, which has been based on topographic and bathymetric LIDAR data collected over the southern part of Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> {{have come}} to be {{extensively}} used in photogrammetry and mapping sciences. The accuracy of 3 D information is mainly affected by navigational and system-dependent uncertainties, but also by the laser beam properties {{and the nature of the}} light interaction on the object surface. At the moment, the system-dependent sources of error are much better known than those arising from laser light interaction. In this paper, a simulation approach for scanning <b>LIDAR</b> <b>systems</b> is presented and discussed. Simulating light interaction on an object surface provides an opportunity to measure well-defined objects under controlled conditions. The simulated object remains unchanged over time, and when various sensor and system parameters are applied, it is possible to compare the 3 D point clouds created.
