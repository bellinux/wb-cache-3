5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a <b>layperson</b> it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} an SMS service (SMS = {{short message}} service = text message) with which <b>laypersons</b> are alerted to go to patients with suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and perform early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). This study {{is the first to}} report on a program in which an emergency medical service (EMS) is able to alert citizens by sending them SMS messages on their mobile phone. - Methods: Web-based questionnaires were completed by <b>laypersons</b> who were sent an alert by the AED-Alert system between February 1, 2010 and April 30, 2010. Questions concerned the process of training, receiving alerts, actions taken and follow-up care. - Results: AED-Alert was activated for 52 patients suspected of cardiac arrest, sending 3227 alerts to 2287 <b>laypersons.</b> Out of 2168 eligible <b>laypersons</b> 1679 (77 %) completed 2098 questionnaires, one for each alert.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether design experts or <b>laypersons</b> evaluate webpages differently. Twenty participants, 10 {{experts and}} 10 <b>laypersons,</b> judged the aesthetic {{value of a}} webpage in an EEG-experiment. Screenshots of 150 webpages, judged as aesthetic or as unaesthetic by another 136 participants, served as stimulus material. Behaviorally, experts and <b>laypersons</b> evaluated unaesthetic webpages similarly, but they differed in their evaluation of aesthetic ones: experts evaluated aesthetic webpages as unaesthetic more often than <b>laypersons</b> did. The ERP-data show main effects of level of expertise and of aesthetic value only. There was no interaction of expertise and aesthetics. In a time-window of 110 – 130 ms after stimulus onset, aesthetic webpages elicited a more negative EEG-amplitude than unaesthetic webpages. In the same time window, experts had more negative EEG-amplitudes than <b>laypersons.</b> This patterning of results continued until a time window of 600 – 800 ms in which group and aesthetic differences diminished.

40|$|Scientists {{and their}} {{supporters}} often portray as exasperatingly irrational all those <b>laypersons</b> who refuse to accede to practical recommendations issued by expert scientists and 'science appliers' (e. g., public health authorities and regulators). After first considering the latter groups’ standard explanations for such non-deference, which focus upon irrationalities besetting the laity, I will propose that a better explanation {{for at least some}} of the non-deference is that many <b>laypersons</b> are rationally electing to substitute their own judgments for those urged upon them by the scientific community. Science-based recommendations, as I treat them, have the general form In light of the science on X, if you seek outcome O, you ought to V. Non-deferring <b>laypersons</b> deny the soundness or cogency of the V-supporting argumentation—though they are supposedly not competent to do so, given their gross epistemic inferiority to the scientific authorities who create and endorse the arguments. On account of thus being epistemically irrational, they end up being instrumentally irrational, pursuing courses of action that are poor choices for serving their own interests (as well as broader societal interests). The non-deferring <b>laypersons</b> are thought to violate two mandates of rationality: for internal deference to the underlying science as true (or probable) enough to constitute an unproblematic background for decisionmaking, and for external deference to the practical application of that science to the concrete extra-scientific circumstances in question. I claim that rationality does not require categorical adherence to these mandates. In any given case, non-deference by some <b>laypersons</b> might be warranted by one or more of four distinct rationales. 1. 	Value-ladenness: The science-based recommendation discernibly (to these <b>laypersons)</b> includes non-scientific (political, legal, moral, or prudential) value-choice or value-weighting assumptions. It embodies a certain prioritizing of the plurality of specific values packed within its O parameter (which is typically stated either generally, e. g. “health” or “safety,” or not at all), and some <b>laypersons</b> may permissibly substitute their own. 2. 	Non-scientific-reasoning-ladenness: The science-based recommendation discernibly (to these <b>laypersons)</b> relies upon reasoning moves that are not distinctive to science, moves whose critical assessment demands no scientific expertise. Error-free reasoning is difficult to attain, and the <b>laypersons</b> may justifiably take themselves to have found weaknesses in the V-supporting argumentation that undermine the case for conformity to the recommendation. 3. 	Overgeneralization: The science-based recommendation discernibly (to these <b>laypersons)</b> is not adequately tailored to the specific situation of the <b>laypersons</b> in question. 4. 	Untrustworthy science: The science-based recommendation discernibly (to these <b>laypersons)</b> is based upon scientific research that is of doubtful quality. The first three rationales cast doubt upon the External Deference Mandate, questioning not the existence of sound underlying research but the recommendation’s judgments about how this research ought to be applied. The fourth is a challenge to the Internal Deference Mandate...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} differences between experts and <b>laypersons</b> concerning {{the way they}} assess the importance {{of each of the}} various decision attributes (cost, risk, feasibility) taken into consideration during decision processes in an organizational setting. Design/methodology/approach – Nine project managers at building companies (experts), and 18 university students (<b>laypersons)</b> performed a think-aloud assignment aimed at assessing the importance of two attributes (safety and comfort) during an acquisition process of minibuses by a fictitious company. Findings – Experts use less effort for the assignment, but perform the same mental operations in comparison with <b>laypersons.</b> Experts work in less detail than <b>laypersons.</b> Both <b>laypersons</b> and experts disregard important aspects of normative decision theory; for instance, they appear not to check for completeness of their assessments. Practical implications – The authors propose that the main difference between experts and <b>laypersons</b> seems not to be {{the way in which they}} conduct importance assessments, but rather the fact that <b>laypersons</b> have to make “clean sheet” assessments, whereas experts can rely on their knowledge and experience to merely modify existing attribute weights. This relying on weights used in previous decisions may lead to sub-optimal choices in non-routine decision situations. Originality/value – In much decision research, the focus is on elicitation of weights and on factors that influence weights, not on the way weights come about. By explicitly addressing the thinking process before the weights are actually set, we gain insight in a stage of the decision process that is rarely addressed. Hence, we potentially create possibilities for improving the weighing process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigated}} the attitudes of orthodontists and <b>laypersons</b> towards the choice of extracting second premolars, rather than first premolars, based on tooth condition {{and the use of}} additional anchorage devices. Methods Questionnaires were sent to two groups: 324 orthodontists who were members of the Thai Association of Orthodontists, and 100 randomly selected Thai <b>laypersons</b> aged above 20  years and who were unrelated to the field of dentistry. Descriptive and chi-square statistics were used to analyze the data. Results Questionnaires were returned by 142 orthodontists (43. 8 %) and completed by 100 <b>laypersons.</b> The larger the size of the caries lesion in the maxillary second premolar was found, the more orthodontists and <b>laypersons</b> both chose to extract a carious maxillary second premolar instead of a healthy maxillary first premolar. For orthodontists, the use of mini-implant anchorage was significantly related to their extraction decision. Orthodontists who were familiar with mini-implants usage would choose to extract the second premolar at a lower size of extent of caries. Besides, when larger sizes of caries lesions in maxillary second premolars were considered, <b>laypersons</b> tended to have greater acceptance of the use of additional anchorage devices {{in order to keep the}} healthy maxillary first premolar. Conclusions In this study, tooth condition and the use of anchorage devices are currently the main considerations by both orthodontists and <b>laypersons</b> when selecting the teeth to be extracted for orthodontic treatment...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Men with {{corrected}} hypospadias often {{suffer from}} sexual inhibition {{and fear of}} being ridiculed by others because of their penile appearance. However, no investigation has thus far {{been made of the}} perception of hypospadias-affected surgically repaired genitals by <b>laypersons</b> unacquainted with hypospadias. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether <b>laypersons</b> notice a difference between genitals of men with corrected hypospadias in comparison with circumcised genitals. Furthermore, the most relevant predictors of laypersons' perception of hypospadias-affected genitals were examined. STUDY DESIGN A cross-sectional study was performed in which a questionnaire with 10 standardized photographs of non-erect hypospadias-affected genitals and 10 circumcised genitals was presented to <b>laypersons</b> unacquainted with hypospadias to measure how they rated these genitals. <b>Laypersons</b> were 105 women and 70 men of three different age groups (age ranges 16 - 20, 25 - 30, and 40 - 45 years). Furthermore, <b>laypersons</b> were asked about demographic characteristics, their sexuality and their genital self-perception. RESULTS The results showed that genitals with distal forms of hypospadias were rated similarly to circumcised genitals. In contrast, genitals with more proximal types were perceived as significantly less positive than circumcised genitals. However, the effect size was small. Higher age, being in an intimate relationship, higher socio-economic status, and a higher sexual interest predicted a better layperson's perception of hypospadias-affected genitals. DISCUSSION These findings do not support the fear of some men with corrected hypospadias of being ridiculed by others because of their penile appearance. The results indicate that <b>laypersons</b> do not notice a difference between corrected distal types of hypospadias (which represent the majority of hypospadias) and circumcised genitals. Although the findings showed that <b>laypersons</b> perceive more proximal forms of hypospadias less positively than circumcised genitals, the difference does not appear to be clinically relevant as the effect size was small. A major strength of this study is its comprehensive study design. However, the low response rate of hypospadias patients and control individuals for photo documentation and of <b>laypersons</b> who rated these photosets is a limitation of the study. Therefore, generalization from the results must be made carefully. CONCLUSIONS The results are relevant for patient counseling. Knowing that the penile appearance would not trouble <b>laypersons</b> may prevent the development of a negative genital self-perception and feelings of shame. The findings also suggest that hypospadias-affected genitals seem to be rated more positively when <b>laypersons</b> know more about the "normal" variation of penile appearance (e. g. with increasing sexual experience at a higher age) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective : To {{examine the}} impact of schizophrenia, its {{treatment}} and treatment-related adverse events related to antipsychotics, on quality of life from the perspective of schizophrenia patients and <b>laypersons.</b> Methods : Health state descriptions for stable schizophrenia, extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS), hyperprolactinemia, diabetes, weight gain and relapse were developed based on {{a review of the literature}} and expert opinion. The quality of life impact of each health state was elicited using a time trade-off instrument administered by interview to 49 stable schizophrenia patients and 75 <b>laypersons.</b> Regression techniques were employed to examine the importance of subject characteristics on health-related utility scores. Results : Patients and <b>laypersons</b> completed the interview in similar times. Stable schizophrenia had the highest mean utility (0. 87 and 0. 92 for <b>laypersons</b> and patients respectively), while relapse (0. 48 and 0. 60) had the lowest mean utility. Of the treatment-related adverse events, EPS had the lowest mean utility (0. 57 and 0. 72, respectively). Age, gender and PANSS score did not influence the utility results independently of health state. On average, patient utilities are 0. 077 points higher than utilities derived from <b>laypersons,</b> although the ranking was similar between the two groups. Conclusion : Events associated with schizophrenia and treatment of schizophrenia can bring about a significant detriment in patient quality of life, with relapse having the largest negative impact. Results indicate that patients with stable schizophrenia are less willing to trade years of life to avoid schizophrenia-related symptoms compared to <b>laypersons.</b> Both sets of respondents showed equal ability to complete the questionnaire...|$|R
