It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were highlighted}} positively. Kasavin {{was impressed with}} the amount of lighting and motion blur effects, and noted that the [...] "excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look." [...] Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a [...] "stunning <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> 360 hardware is capable of", but also admitted that the animation [...] "is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness". IGN credited the attractive gun models, explosions, and sprawling vistas, but felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny. The game's audio was said to feature [...] "heavy-hitting weapon effects [...] fantastic, moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms".|$|E

This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining [...] "caving grounds", and to the south of the Mather A & B Mine complex.

Dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to work over an absinthe in a public cafe, and looked the man over. The aged rakishness of his appearance was set off by a youthful costume; he had disreputable grey hair and a disreputable sore, red nose; but the coat and the gesture, the outworks of the man, were still designed for show. Dick came up to his table and inquired if he might <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> gentleman was doing. No one was so delighted as the Admiral.|$|E

6000|$|In that attitude, he {{declared}} suddenly {{that the highest}} expression of democracy was Caesarism: the imperial rule based upon the direct popular vote. Caesarism was conservative. It was strong. It recognized the legitimate needs of democracy which requires orders, titles, and distinctions. They would be showered upon deserving men. Caesarism was peace. It was progressive. It secured the prosperity of a country. Pedrito Montero was carried away. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Second Empire had done for France. It was a regime which delighted to honour men of Don Carlos's stamp. The Second Empire fell, but that was because its chief was devoid of that military genius which had raised General Montero to the pinnacle of fame and glory. Pedrito elevated his hand jerkily to help the idea of pinnacle, of fame. [...] "We shall have many talks yet. We shall understand each other thoroughly, Don Carlos!" [...] he cried {{in a tone of}} fellowship. Republicanism had done its work. Imperial democracy was the power of the future. Pedrito, the guerrillero, showing his hand, lowered his voice forcibly. A man singled out by his fellow-citizens for the honourable nickname of El Rey de Sulaco could not but receive a full recognition from an imperial democracy as a great captain of industry and a person of weighty counsel, whose popular designation would be soon replaced by a more solid title. [...] "Eh, Don Carlos? No! What do you say? Conde de Sulaco--Eh?--or marquis [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{servants}} {{from the}} vicarage {{were not the}} first persons to hit upon the dead body of the vicar. Joe Harley, the poacher, was out reconnoitring that afternoon in the vicar's preserves; and five minutes after Walter Dene had passed down {{the far side of}} the hedge, Joe Harley skulked noiselessly from the orchard up to the cover of the gate by Selbury Copse. He crept through the open end by the post (for it was against Joe's principles under any circumstances to climb over an obstacle of any sort, and so needlessly expose himself), and he was just going to slink off along the other hedge, having wires and traps in his pocket, when his boot struck violently against a soft object in the ditch underfoot. It struck so violently that it crushed in the object with the force of the impact; and when Joe came to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> object might be, he found to his horror that it was the bruised and livid face of the old parson. Joe had had a brush with keepers more than once, and had spent several months of seclusion in Dorchester Gaol; but, in spite of his familiarity with minor forms of lawlessness, he was moved enough in all conscience by this awful and unexpected discovery. He turned the body over clumsily with his hands, and saw that it had been stabbed in the back once only. In doing so he trod in a little blood, and got a drop or two on his sleeve and trousers; for the pool was bigger now, and Joe was not so handy or dainty with his fingers as the idyllic curate.|$|E
