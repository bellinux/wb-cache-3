25|$|Externally the 1972 {{model was}} the same as the 1971 model, {{retaining}} the same front end but with 3 vertical strips added to the grille. The chrome trunk <b>lid</b> <b>strip</b> and rear corner chrome of the 1970 Rebel and 1971 Marador was dropped. The rear bumper again was the 1970 Rebel bumper but with a new lens assembly with each assembly divided into nine recessed vertically rectangular lenses. Interior-wise the 1972 model saw the return of the round instrument dials of earlier Ambassador and 1967 Rebel models. The steering wheel {{was the same}} as previous models. New for the 1972 model was slimmer arm rests for the doors and a bench seat without the fold-down centre armrests.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} electric kettle K1 (a world first), designed in October 1955, used a bi-metallic strip {{at the rear}} of the kettle: steam was forced through an aperture in the <b>lid</b> of the <b>strip</b> and this knocked the switch, turning the kettle off.|$|R
50|$|Fleetwood {{lettering}} {{appeared on}} the rear deck <b>lid</b> trim <b>strip.</b> Single side trim moldings extended from the front wheel housing {{to the rear of}} the car. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; Hydramatic automatic transmission; dual back-up lamps; windshield washers and two-speed wipers; wheel discs; dual outside rearview mirror; vanity mirror; oil filter and power vent windows. Power steering and shock absorbers were improved this year. Engine displacement on the Cadillac OHV V8 was increased to 390 cuin L.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, Apple {{revised the}} case and keyboard. The {{original}} IIe uses a case {{very similar to the}} Apple II Plus, painted and with Velcro-type clips to secure the <b>lid</b> with a <b>strip</b> of metal mesh along the edge to eliminate radio frequency interference. The new case is made of dyed plastic mold in a slightly darker beige with a simplified snap-case lid. The other noticeable change is a new keyboard, with more professional-looking print on darker keycaps (small black lettering, versus large white print). This was the first cosmetic change.|$|R
50|$|Ford New Zealand {{built the}} Zephyr 4 and 6 {{as well as}} the Zodiac locally from CKD kits, {{offering}} only the bench front seat option finished in vinyl. Automatic transmission, introduced late {{in the life of the}} Mk II, was again available but was a rare factory option as most buyers chose manual. As well as the 'Zephyr 6', Ford NZ built a six-cylinder 'Zephyr Special' with a lower equipment level and deletion of the boot <b>lid</b> trim <b>strip</b> and other exterior brightwork which was sold to fleet operators such as the government. The big Fords were unusual in having four-speed manual gearboxes when rivals, including Ford's own Falcon, had only three speeds. Building the top luxury Zodiac model locally again also gave Ford a supply advantage over key rivals such as Vauxhall whose upmarket Cresta was only ever sold fully imported and much harder to obtain than the locally assembled Velox.|$|R
2500|$|American Motors {{advertising}} {{assured that}} the new Matador {{was not just a}} name change and facelift, but in reality it was the 1970 Rebel restyled with a longer front clip and a new interior. The 1971 model year Matadors acquired a [...] "beefier" [...] front end look for all three body designs: two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon. The AMC Matador shared its basic body design from the firewall back with the Ambassador, which was built on the same platform, but had a longer wheelbase and front-end sheetmetal, a formal grille and luxurious trim, as well as more standard equipment that included air conditioning. Interior wise, it shared the same dash, instrument cluster, steering wheel, and arm rests as the 1970 Rebel. Also reused was the 1967–1970 Rebel [...] "Weather Eye" [...] three-lever fan/heat control unit. The 1971 model came with a split-bench front seat with individual fold-down center arm rests for passenger and driver seats. Externally the 1971 model retained the same trunk <b>lid</b> chrome <b>strip</b> and rear-corner chrome garnishes as the 1970 Rebel. The rear bumper was also the same as the 1970 Rebel but with a new tail light lens assembly of three-in-line square lenses with rounded corners.|$|R
40|$|While ocular {{involvement}} {{is well documented}} in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF- 1), conjunctival neurofibromas are very rare. We describe a challenging NF- 1 case of a patient with a conjunctival neurofibroma in association with lower lid involutional entropion and severe conjunctival chemosis. A 65 year-old male presented with age-related left lower lid laxity, retractor dehiscence, inferior conjunctival chemosis and significant ocular discomfort. The patient underwent a left lower <b>lid</b> lateral tarsal <b>strip</b> procedure with retractor plication without much improvement in the chemosis and discomfort. However post-operatively it became evident that an injected mass was present in the left inferior fornix. Surgical debulking of this mass allowed for resolution of the patient’s signs and symptoms as well as proper lower lid alignment. Histopathologic diagnosis with S 100 and CD 34 positivity confirmed a conjunctival neurofibroma. Although uncommon, {{it is important to}} consider the possibility of a conjunctival mass in a patient with persistent chemosis and recurrent lower lid instability, particularly when confronted with a neurocutaneous syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Stormwater runoff {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to the impairment of surface waters in the United States. With high connected impervious surfaces and concentrated human activities, urban land uses are involved in discharging most of the stormwater volume and pollutant loadings during a storm. Stormwater pollution prevention involves the installation and maintenance of stormwater low impact development (LID) practices in urban areas. These include infiltration basins and trenches, porous pavements, rain gardens, vegetative swales, and filter <b>strips.</b> <b>LID</b> practices infiltrate and detain stormwater to reduce stormwater runoff volume and improve water quality via filtration and other processes. The reasons for assessing the performance of the LID practices include fulfilling stormwater permit regulatory requirements, engineering and design due diligence, scheduling maintenance and TMDL studies. The results of the assessment allow for an improved understanding {{of the role of the}} various system components (i. e. soil, plants, etc.) in pollutant removal and volume reduction. This project is designed to assist MS 4 s in the assessment of their stormwater BMPs and the utilization of these BMPs in watershed TMDL analyses. Objective B of this project focuses on the infiltration performance of low impact development (LID) practices. The infiltration capacity testing developed for rain gardens (Asleson, et al. 2009) was to be refined, altered and expanded for other types of LID practices including infiltration basins and trenches, vegetative swales and filter strips. The Modified Philip Dunne (MPD) infiltrometer is implemented as a low-effort, low-cost method to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity, a predictor of infiltration capacity. This infiltration tests have been performed on rain gardens, infiltration basin, swales and turf areas. Minnesota Pollution Control Agenc...|$|R
