40|$|Spatial {{decision-making}} procedures, such as multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and misclassifications that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial decision-making procedures. The research presented here explores what influence errors and misclassifications in remote sensing derived <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> can have on the output from spatial decision-making procedures. Four <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers, each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers are compared with an author-created <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layer known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and misclassifications, rather than the quantity of errors and misclassifications alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and misclassifications on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial decision-making procedures. Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers. A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial decision-making procedure using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial decision-making procedure using each of the comparative <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers as input. Differences between the BASE layer and the comparative <b>land</b> cover <b>data</b> layers are then assessed to determine if errors and misclassifications have had an impact on the output of the spatial decision-making procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Data {{assimilation}} {{has become}} a popular method to integrate observations from multiple sources with land surface models to improve predictions {{of the water and}} energy cycles of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum. Multivariate data assimilation refers to the simultaneous assimilation of observation data from multiple model state variables into a simulation model. In recent years, several <b>land</b> <b>data</b> assimilation systems have been developed in different research agencies. Because of the software availability or adaptability, these systems are not easy to apply for the purpose of multivariate <b>land</b> <b>data</b> assimilation research.

LETKF (Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter) is implemented as the main data assimilation algorithm, and uncertainties in the data assimilation can be introduced by perturbed atmospheric forcing data, and represented by perturbed soil and vegetation parameters and model initial conditions. The Community Land Model (CLM) was integrated as the model operator. The implementation allows also parameter estimation (soil properties and/or leaf area index) {{on the basis of the}} joint state and parameter estimation approach. The Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM), COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Interaction Code (COSMIC) and the Two-Source Formulation (TSF) were integrated as observation operators for the assimilation of L-band passive microwave, cosmic-ray soil moisture probe and land surface temperature measurements, respectively. DasPy has been evaluated in several assimilation studies of neutron count intensity (soil moisture), L-band brightness temperature and land surface temperature. DasPy is parallelized using the hybrid Message Passing Interface and Open Multi-Processing techniques. All the input and output data flows are organized efficiently using the commonly used NetCDF file format. Online 1 -D and 2 -D visualization of data assimilation results is also implemented to facilitate the post simulation analysis.
