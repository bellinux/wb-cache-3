Methods: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients (ASA Grade 1 - 2, aged 18 - 80 yr) were randomly allocated for airway management with the i-gel® (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, Berkshire UK), the LMA-ProSeal® and the LMA-Supreme® (The Laryngeal Mask Company Ltd, Wooburn Green, Bucks, UK). Anaesthesia was with fentanyl/propofol/sevoflurane mixture. A laryngoscope-guided, gastric tube-guided technique was used for insertion. The following primary variables were assessed: ease of insertion, effective airway time, anatomical position, oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> among devices, and change in oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> between 30 and 60 minutes for each device during the spontaneous breathing anaesthesia. Results: Differences detected were that the LMA-Supreme was easier to insert and had a shorter effective airway time than the LMA-Proseal and i-gel. Anatomical position was better for the LMA-Supreme than for the i-gel. Oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressures</b> were similar among devices during apnoea and spontaneous ventilation, but much higher than in the first generation classic type of laryngeal masks. There were no changes in oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> for any device during the spontaneous breathing phase. There were no differences in performance for any variable between the LMA-ProSeal and i-gel. Conclusion: The LMA-Supreme is easier and quicker to insert than the LMA-ProSeal and i-gel using a laryngoscope-guided, gastric tube-guided technique and is associated with better anatomical positioning than the i-gel.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess and compare the effect of head and neck position on the oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressures</b> and cuff position (employing fibreoptic view of the glottis) and ventilation scores between ProSeal LMA and the I-gel.

The position of the head was randomly changed from neutral to flexion, extension, and lateral rotation (left). The oropharyngeal <b>leak</b> <b>pressures,</b> fibreoptic view of glottis, ventilation scores, and delivered tidal volumes and end tidal CO 2 were noted in all positions. Results.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aim: Colonic {{perforation}} {{is a serious}} complication of colonoscopy, with surgical repair usually indicated. The aim was to compare acute strength of various endoscopic colonic closure techniques by assessing air <b>leak</b> <b>pressures</b> in a previously described ex vivo experimental apparatus. Methods: Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed on a bench. Six techniques included surgical suture (gold standard), QuickClips, T-tags, over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) system, and two types of flexible stapler (Covidien). After closure, each specimen was fixed in the apparatus and pressure was gradually increased until air bubbles were seen. <b>Leak</b> <b>pressure</b> was the primary outcome parameter. Closure using the gold standard (first 15 experiments) resulted in a mean <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> of 86. 9 mmHg (SD 7). Using a noninferiority design a sample size of 12 specimens for each closure technique was determined. Results: Mean colotomy <b>leak</b> <b>pressures</b> in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and difference (with 95 % confidence intervals [CI]) between each technique and the gold standard were: QuickClips 85. 1 (difference - 1. 8; 95 % CI - 7. 0 to 3. 9); T-tags 53. 9 (difference - 33. 0; - 39. 0 to - 27. 0); OTSC 90. 3 mmHg (difference 3. 4; - 6. 1 to 12. 9); 15 -mm shaft stapler 98. 5 mmHg (difference 9. 7; 0. 8 to 18. 5) and 8 -mm shaft stapler 96. 6 mmHg (difference 11. 6; 1. 5 to 21. 7).

The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate gastric closure using the over-the-scope clip (OTSC) system in a previously described experimental setup, comparing the acute strength with a gold standard (hand surgical suturing). Methods: Comparison was done using an ex vivo porcine stomach experimental setup. The gastric opening was created by a needle knife puncture followed by dilation with 18 -mm balloon. Control gastrotomies (n = 15; surgical suturing) showed a mean <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> of 206 mmHg (SD 59). A non-inferiority design required a sample size of 11 specimens for the OTSC group. Closure comprised: (i) approximation of muscular layers using a flexible twin grasper; (ii) pulling the tissue into the OTSC cap {{at the tip of the}} scope; (iii) releasing the clip. Main outcome measures were <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> of closed gastrotomies, leak location, and time needed for adequate closure.

RESULTS: In sham-operated and ovariectomized animals, sildenafil did not impact micturition, although it decreased urethral resistance 10 -fold. nNOS inhibition by 7 -NI reduced the number of micturitions and increased residual volume and <b>leak</b> point <b>pressure.</b> It abrogated sildenafil-induced drop in urethral resistances. Hormonal status did not influence the structure of the urethral layers. CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the hormonal status, sildenafil decreased <b>leak</b> point <b>pressure</b> by a nNOS-mediated mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The {{porosity}} in {{powder metal}} parts becomes a liability when the part must resist a differential pressure. PM applications for compressed air, fuel handling or hydraulic housings are common and effective; however, {{they must be}} sealed first. The polymer does not add structural strength to the physical part, but it will hold high pressures without creeping. If the wall thickness of the part exceeds 1/4 inch, the <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> is typically on the same order of magnitude as the burst pressure of the part.|$|R
5000|$|The Tweel (a {{portmanteau}} of {{tire and}} wheel) is an airless tire design concept {{developed by the}} French tire company Michelin. Its significant advantage over pneumatic tires is that the Tweel does not use a bladder full of compressed air, and therefore it cannot burst, <b>leak</b> <b>pressure,</b> or become flat. Instead, the Tweel assembly's inner hub connects to flexible polyurethane spokes which are used to support an outer rim and these engineered compliant components assume the shock-absorbing role provided by the compressed air in a traditional tire.|$|R
40|$|Background. We have {{compared}} the laryngeal tube and laryngeal mask in 22 patients {{for the success}} rate of insertion, gas <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> and the incidence of gastric insuf¯ation. Method. In a randomized, crossover design, the laryngeal tube and laryngeal mask were inserted in turn after induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular block. The cuffs were in¯ated until the intracuff pressure reached 60 cm H 2 O. We measured adequacy of ventilation and the minimum airway pressure at which gas leaked around the cuff. The {{presence or absence of}} gas-tric insuf¯ation was studied at an in¯ation pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. Results. It was possible to ventilate through the laryngeal tube in 21 patients and through the laryngeal mask in 21 patients. The mean <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> for the laryngeal tube (26 (SD 5) cm H 2 O) was signi®cantly greater than that for the laryngeal mask (19 (4) cm H 2 O) (P< 0. 01; 95 % con®dence intervals for mean difference: 5. 3 ± 10. 2 cm H 2 O). Gastric insuf¯ation did not occur when the laryngeal tube was used and was noted in three patients when the laryngeal mask was used. Conclusion. The laryngeal tube provides a better seal in the oropharynx than the laryngeal mask...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Secure transluminal closure is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} prerequisite for the safe introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). The aim was to compare acute strength of various gastrotomy closure techniques in an in vitro porcine stomach model by assessing <b>leak</b> <b>pressures.</b> METHODS: Standardized gastrotomies were closed manually, {{without the use of}} an endoscope, by one of seven NOTES closure devices: (i) T tags, (ii) purse string modified T tags, (iii) Eagle Claw VIII, (iv) Resolution clips, (v) flexible stapler; (vi) purse string suturing device, and (vii) flexible Endostitch. After closure, each specimen was fixed on the experimental apparatus and the pressure was gradually increased. By linking the pressure gauge and two cameras, the <b>leak</b> location and <b>pressure</b> could be determined in detail. We began by collecting gold standard reference values, by testing 15 gastrotomies closed with interrupted surgical sutures; these were associated with a mean <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> of 206 mmHg (SD 59). Using a noninferiority design, a sample size of 11 specimens for each NOTES closure technique was determined. RESULTS: The Resolution clips (P = 0. 0285), Eagle Claw VIII (P = 0. 0325), flexible stapler (P 0. 6775), purse string modified T tags (P > 0. 999), and the purse string suturing device (P = 0. 9875) resulted in inferior closures. CONCLUSIONS: The Eagle Claw VIII, Resolution clips, flexible stapler and flexible Endostitch produced noninferior closures in comparison with surgical closure in this model. These techniques seem to be the prime candidates for further testing in animal experiments before human trials can be initiate...|$|R
40|$|Background The i-gel™ is a {{single-use}} supraglottic {{airway device}} (SAD) that allows fibreoptic-guided tracheal intubation through the device. Until now, no prospective {{data for this}} procedure are available. Therefore, in a prospective randomized controlled trial, we evaluated fibreoptic-guided tracheal intubation with a standard Rüsch™ PVC tracheal tube (TT) through the i-gel™ compared with the single-use ILMA™ (sILMA™) TT through the sILMA™ in patients with a predicted difficult airway. Methods With ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 160 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either SAD. After placement of the SAD, a fibreoptic bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea as a railroad for the TT. Primary outcome variable was the first-attempt fibreoptic-guided intubation success rate. Secondary variables included time for insertion and intubation, airway <b>leak</b> <b>pressures,</b> fibreoptic view, and adverse events. Data are presented as mean (sd) or percentages. A P-value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results Fibreoptic-guided intubation was successful at the first attempt in 76 patients (96 %) using the i-gel™ and in 71 patients (90 %) using the sILMA™ (P= 0. 21). Most of the failed intubations were rescued by conventional laryngoscopy. Airway <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> was higher for the sILMA™. There were no problems during removal of either type of SAD. Conclusions Fibreopic-guided tracheal intubation through the i-gel™ using a standard Rüsch™ Magill TT is successful and an alternative to the sILMA™ with the sILMA™ T...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The size 1 I-gel, {{recommended}} for small infants and neonates weighing 2 – 5 [*]kg, {{has recently been}} released. There are no prospective studies available that assess the insertion conditions, sealing pressures, or ventilation quality of it. This {{study was designed to}} compare the performance of recently released size 1 I-gel with size 1 ProSeal LMA. Methods. Fifty infants and neonates, ASA I-II were included in this prospective, randomized, and controlled study. Patients were divided into two groups for placing I-gel or ProSeal LMA. The primary outcome was airway <b>leak</b> <b>pressure,</b> and secondary outcomes included insertion time, insertion success and conditions, initial airway quality, fiberoptic view of the larynx, and complications. Results. There {{were no significant differences in}} terms of airway <b>leak</b> <b>pressure</b> between the I-gel (27. 44 ± 5. 67) and ProSeal LMA (23. 52 ± 8. 15) (P= 0. 054). The insertion time for the I-gel was shorter (12. 6 ± 2. 19 [*]s) than for the ProSeal LMA (24. 2 ± 6. 059 [*]s) (P= 0. 0001). Insertion success and conditions were similar in groups. We encountered few complications. Conclusion. Our study demonstrates that the size 1 I-gel provided an effective and satisfactory airway as the size 1 ProSeal LMA. It may be a good alternative supraglottic airway device for use in small infants and neonates. This trial is registered with: ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01704118...|$|R
