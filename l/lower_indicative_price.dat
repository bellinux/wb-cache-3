40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to practice in}} the U. S., European IPOs are very rarely <b>priced</b> outside the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range, and frequently are priced at its upper bound. We develop a model that provides a rationale for this seemingly inefficient pricing behaviour. The model allows for the practice, observed in Europe {{but not in the}} U. S., whereby underwriters obtain information from investors prior to establishing the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range. With this alternative staging of the information game, first studied by Benveniste and Spindt (1989), a commitment to not exceeding the upper bound is necessary to extract private information from investors. The model has important implications for empirical research based on European primary market data. ...|$|R
50|$|Production {{proposals}} are also summarized and evaluated on a quantitative basis, {{in this case}} by the ratio of social benefits to social costs. (The social benefit part of the ratio is calculated by multiplying the proposed quantity of outputs from a workplace by their <b>indicative</b> <b>prices,</b> adding negative prices for any proposed pollution emissions and summing. The social costs are calculated by multiplying the quantity of requested inputs by their <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> and summing.) Proposals with a benefits-to-cost ratio below one will need to make adjustments {{in order to gain}} approval in the next round, either by switching to a less polluting technology, producing a more socially desirable set of outputs, or using less costly inputs.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} opening auction design {{on the quality of}} the auction price. The exchange provides throughout the auction a market clearing <b>price</b> (called <b>indicative</b> <b>price)</b> together with the executable volume which would result from an immediate close of the call phase. By getting rid of microstructure noise, we find that the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> becomes informative about the true value at the very beginning of the call phase, and that traders estimate the extent of microstructure noise by means of the executable volume. Moreover, the (undisclosed) order book provides information about future prices that is not incorporated in the auction price. Finally, the auction ends at a random time between 9 and 9 : 00 : 30 a. m. The random phase duration bears no impact on traded volume in the morning...|$|R
50|$|During {{an event}} {{known as a}} {{planning}} procedure, which could be an annual, bi-annual or quarterly event, facilitation boards first announce a set of <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> which workers and consumers use, individually and through their councils at each level, when deciding on their production and consumption proposals. Proposals could be done either collectively through a local consumer council, or individually on a computer; or any combination of the two. When the proposals are all in, the IFBs aggregate all the production and consumption proposals for the different categories {{of goods and services}} - inputs into all the production processes as well as consumer goods - to see if proposed supply and demand are equal. If they are not equal for every good and service the IFB revises the set of <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> and the process is repeated through successive rounds until a consistent set of production and consumption proposals is arrived at.|$|R
50|$|In July 2001, the Group {{completed}} its IPO on Piazza Affari, in Italy's biggest IPO of the year. The shares were priced {{at the lower}} end of the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range of 30 to 38. The initial public offering was three times oversubscribed.The group later acquired leading brands like the Dreher aguardiente, the Old Eight, Drury's, Gregson's and Gold Cup whiskies and Liebfraumilch wine.|$|R
50|$|The {{process begins}} when the {{facilitation}} board (see below) announces {{a list of}} <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> for each final consumer good, {{as well as for}} each capital good, natural resource, and category of labor that is available to society. These <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> are calculated to reflect the estimated opportunity costs for producing various goods and services, and incorporate both social costs and pollution impacts. In response to this list of prices, individuals draft an annual consumption plan for goods/services they wish to consume in the coming year, and also meet in their neighborhood councils to deliberate and democratically arrive at a plan for the consumption of public goods (e.g. obtaining resources to build a public playground). As workers, individuals also meet in their workplaces to determine what outputs they will produce and what inputs they will consume in the production process, as well as how much they would each like to work. Thus, workers and consumers (as well as any federations of workers or consumers) submit their initial requests to the facilitation board, which aggregates this information.|$|R
50|$|After {{receiving}} the revised proposals, the facilitation board once again updates {{the list of}} <b>indicative</b> <b>prices.</b> After several rounds of this revision and re-submission process, the result is convergence to a feasible plan in which workers and consumers are able to accomplish the activities that they detailed in their final submissions. Even after a feasible plan is achieved, flexible mid-year revisions of consumer/worker proposals can also {{be incorporated into the}} planning process.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{conclusion}} of the first round of this process will almost certainly not be a workable plan, the facilitation board proceeds to update the list of <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> for each good up or down, in proportion to the excess demand and supply for each, so that the updated prices reflect a more accurate estimate of the social opportunity costs of each item. The announcement of updated <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> then initiates {{the second round of the}} planning process, in which consumers and workers revise and resubmit their proposals in light of the new information. In particular, consumption proposals in which the individual's proposed effort rating does not warrant the proposed level of consumption will need to be adjusted, so that the individual will either have to reduce his/her consumption requests, shift them to less costly products, or increase his/her projected work-hours for the coming year. Other consumers may discover that their initial proposals were too modest, and can revise their consumption upwards, if they choose, or they can revise their projected effort rating downwards by proposing to work fewer hours and increasing leisure time.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, NASDAQ adopted two single-price {{double-sided}} call auctions named opening {{cross and}} closing cross {{to open and}} close the market. Unlike many other call auction mechanisms, the opening and closing cross have two unique features: 1) The continuous trading does not stop while the call auctions proceed. 2) To determine the opening and closing price, NASDAQ not only considers the liqudity in the opening and closing book, but also the liqudity of the continuous book. These two features make NASDAQ have 8 ̆ 5 ve different prices for the same stock: three are <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> from the call auction market, and two are bid and ask prices from the continuous market. This paper studies the interaction of these five prices using the NASDAQ Order Imbalance Information data set. We find that while opening cross has significant price contribution for some NASDAQ- 100 stocks, the contribution to price discovery of the closing cross is very limited. We also find that the <b>indicative</b> <b>prices</b> in the closing cross are more noisy {{than those in the}} opening cross. This counterintuitive result indicates potential manipulation in the call auction market at market close...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates Initial Public Offerings (IPO) on Oslo Stock Exchange between 2006 and 2011. The {{analyses}} {{examine how}} the IPOs are priced relative to the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range, and how this affects the performance. In addition, {{the effect of a}} previous listing in the OTC-market, issue size and the use of a Green Shoe Option (GSO) have been examined. Based on my analyses I find the average market adjusted initial return to be marginally positive, and it seems to decline in the longer run. When investigating how the IPOs were priced relative to the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range I find the majority to be priced in {{the lower part of the}} range. I also observe that small bookbuilt IPOs and IPOs sold without a GSO more frequently were priced below the midpoint of the range. The analysis indicates that IPOs priced in the upper part of the range perform better in the aftermarket. The regression analyses suggest that both private and public information are only partially incorporated into the issue price. My results indicate that companies previously listed in the OTC-market and large issues experience less fluctuation after the introduction. Furthermore, every IPO using fixed-price was characterized as small. Finally, I find that fixed-price was more often used among former OTC-listed companies...|$|R

Using a sample of both U. S. and international IPOs we find evidence of the following: · IPO allocation policies favor institutional investors, both in the U. S. and worldwide. ·Constraints on the discretion bankers exercise in the allocation of IPO shares reduce institutional allocations. ·Constraints on allocation discretion result in offer prices that deviate less from the <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> range established prior to bankers’ efforts to gauge demand among institutional investors. We interpret this as indicative of diminished information production. · Initial returns, which reflect a significant indirect cost of going public, are directly related to this measure of information production and inversely related to the fraction of shares allocated to institutional investors. ...|$|R

40|$|June 2003 Does the preopening period {{facilitate}} price discovery? An experimental investigation Price discovery at {{the opening}} of the market is a delicate and crucial time in the trading day. To facilitate price discovery {{at the opening}}, several exchanges have introduced a peopening period. <b>Indicative</b> <b>prices</b> formed during this period could facilitate price discovery by helping investors figuring out the new equilibrium and determining their optimal strategies. On the other hand, since there are no actual trades until the opening of the market, investors could be tempted to manipulate prices. To test these hypotheses, we will run several experimental financial markets under two treatments: In the first treatment, the price is set in a call auction. In the second treatment, there is a preopening period before the call auction. Comparing the informational efficiency of prices and the convergence of order placement strategies to equilibrium in these treatments will shed light on whether the preopening period is useful for price discovery. To obtain clear-cut predictions, we will design the experiment so that the Milgrom and Stokey (1982) theorem applies: investors start the game with private signals, and cas...|$|R

The objectives of the study were to review the current status of mangroves in Tamil Nadu, study the fisherfolk’s perceived role of mangroves on their livelihood, estimate the economic value of mangroves as a case study, and suggest policy measures needed for the conservation, protection, management and development of mangroves. The required data were collected randomly from 41 experts and 120 villagers. The most important concern for protecting the mangroves was found to be strengthening of coastline against Tsunami through mangrove plantation. The most important present use of the Pichavaram mangroves was their services through their ecological functions like protection against tsunami, floods and heavy winds; followed by contribution to fishery; and firewood collection. In calculating the Total Economic Value of the concerned mangrove area, the values were divided according to direct use values, indirect use values and willingness to pay estimates, and was added upto be Rs. 353, 52, 31, 312.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the IPO pricing processes {{of two different}} markets, each of which employs bookbuilding methods for marketing the IPO shares. For each market we investigate two questions: Does bookbuilding serve mainly as a method for distributing shares, or also {{as a means for}} gathering information? And, to what extent do underwriters respond in IPO pricing to any information that they obtain through bookbuilding? We find that a direct comparison of these two markets sheds light on the bookbuilding process in each. For Nasdaq IPOs we find evidence consistent with informational rents being earned by investors for providing information during bookbuilding. On the Neuer Markt there is no such evidence. Instead, we find evidence consistent with rents being paid for information that helps underwriters to set <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> ranges prior to bookbuilding. The two markets differ further in how underwriters respond to information in pricing IPOs. For the Neuer Markt, this response is severly constrained since underwriters do not set prices above the price ranges. We estimate the total cost of this "restriction" to be approximately one billion Euros for our sample of IPOs. While there are no such apparent restrictions for Nasdaq, we show that also on this market IPO prices are "sticky" in that underwriters respond less to information received later in the pricing process.

The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze the magnitude of the effects brought by exchange rate movements on fuel price changes in Tanzania, study the appropriate measure to avert or minimize the adverse impact taken by the government of Tanzania. Secondary data has been mostly used in this research. Primary data has been obtained through close ended and structured questionnaires supplemented by observation and face to face interviews. According to the findings, there is a direct relationship between the current trend of fuel price changes and the movements of exchange rate. The study also showed that there is an inappropriate association between the extent of fuel price changes and the movements of exchange rate, thus the appreciation or depreciation of foreign exchange does not tally with fuel price changes in the country. The study showed that fuel computation and periodic <b>indicative</b> <b>price</b> done by Ewura are wrongly applied and do not reflect the actual movements of exchange rate. The study revealed that foreign exchange appreciation or depreciation has immediate effect on fuel price changes because of weakness of local currency which causes Ewura as Government Regulatory Authority to use this weakness of TZS over USD to set and change the fuel prices every now and then...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular signal {{transduction}} proteins typically utilize multiple interaction domains for proper targeting, {{and thus a}} broad diversity of distinct signaling complexes may be assembled. Considering the coordination of only two such domains, as in tandem Src homology 2 (SH 2) domain constructs, {{gives rise to a}} kinetic scheme that is not adequately described by simple models used routinely to interpret in vitro binding measurements. To analyze the interactions between tandem SH 2 domains and bisphosphorylated peptides, we formulated detailed kinetic models and applied them to the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase p 85 regulatory subunit/platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor system. Data for this system from different in vitro assay platforms, including surface plasmon resonance, competition binding, and isothermal titration calorimetry, were reconciled to estimate the magnitude of the cooperativity characterizing the sequential binding of the high and low affinity SH 2 domains (C-SH 2 and N-SH 2, respectively). Compared with values based on an effective volume approximation, the estimated cooperativity is 3 orders of magnitude <b>lower,</b> <b>indicative</b> of significant structural constraints.
