50|$|This concept {{represents}} {{a new way}} of distributing energy for <b>low-voltage</b> <b>installations</b> on ships. It can be used for any electrical ship application up to 20 megawatts and operates at a nominal voltage of 1000V DC. The DC distribution system is simply an extension of the multiple DC links that already exist in all propulsion and thruster drives, which usually account for more than 80 percent of the electrical power consumption on electric propulsion vessels.|$|R
30|$|To {{explain the}} impacts of {{these two types of}} {{resonance}} on the emission from a wind park, a distinction should be made between the primary emission and the secondary emission [26]. These terms describe the interaction between different sources (fluorescent lamps) of high-frequency emission in a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>installation.</b> The primary emission is the current at the equipment terminals due to the power-electronic switching in the device, and the secondary emission is the current due to power-electronic switching in neighboring devices.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} diversity factors of CFL (compact fluorescent lamps) {{in combination with}} LED (light emitting diode) lamps is presented in this paper. Attention was paid to the reduction of low–order harmonic currents, especially the third one; which is mainly responsible for the strong increase in power losses in the neutral conductor of <b>low–voltage</b> <b>installations.</b> The harmonic currents drawn by several LED and CFL lamps with nominal powers < 25 W were first measured to investigate the electrical characteristics of individual lamps. In addition, a series of experiments was conducted in which LED lamps were powered between lines through small autotransformers thus avoiding {{the use of the}} neutral conductor. The results showed in both cases a sensible reduction of the harmonic current of third order and therefore a marked reduction of the power losses associated with them...|$|R
40|$|Harmonic {{characteristics}} of power cables used in low-voltage distribution systems of commercial buildings are investigated. Analytical discussion of cable resistance and reactance at harmonic frequencies is presented. An experimental procedure for obtaining full matrix impedance of cables at harmonic frequency is introduced. It is found that cable resistance increases with increasing harmonic order. Cable inductance, however, decreases {{due to the}} effect of flux cancellation. The analytical formulas presented yield reasonable accuracy for cable resistance for single-core cables, but provide an overestimation for multicore cables. The impact of various parameters on cable resistance and reactance, such as harmonic order, cable installation method, cable current distribution and the presence of magnetic material is also addressed, as well as the mechanisms for impedance variation. Finally, recommendations for using the approximate formulas for cables in <b>low-voltage</b> <b>installations</b> are provided. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
