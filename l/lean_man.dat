40|$|Background and Aim: Adiponectin is an {{important}} protective factor in pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease {{and it has been}} reported that testosterone has a potential anti-diabetic role in men. Furthermore, cortisol is an anti-stress catabolic hormone. The purpose of this study was to survey effect of strength training on serum levels of adiponectin, testosterone, and cortisol in sedentary <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> Materials and Methods: In a semi-experimental study, sedentary <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> were randomly placed at two groups: strength training and control. Strength training protocol consisted of twelve weeks weight training (3 sessions per week, 10 stations, 3 sets 8 - 12 repetitions in each station, intensity 60 - 80 % of one repetition maximum, rest between sets 1 min and between stations 2 min, duration of main training 20 - 40 min per each session). Data analyzed by SPSS 16 software. Independent- and paired-samples T tests were used for analyzing data. Statistical significance was accepted at P 0. 05). Conclusion: Performing a period of strength training can improve body weight, body mass index, and cardio respiratory function of sedentary <b>lean</b> <b>men,</b> while it results in no significant change in body fat percent. Also, since testosterone has anti-diabetic role, strength training can be useful through increasing testosterone levels in sedentary <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> It doesn’t appear that twelve weeks strength training has effect on circulating levels of adiponectin and cortisol in sedentary <b>lean</b> <b>men...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between body mass index and mortality in middle aged British men. DESIGN [...] Men who were recruited for the British Regional Heart Study were followed up for a mean of nine years. SETTING [...] General practices in 24 British towns. SUBJECTS [...] 7735 Men aged 40 - 59 years selected from the age-sex registers of one group practice {{in each of the}} 24 towns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Mortality from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes. RESULTS [...] 660 Of the men died. There was a U-shaped relation between body mass index and total mortality. Very <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> (less than 20 kg/m 2) had by far the highest mortality followed by <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> (20 - 22 kg/m 2) and obese men (greater than or equal to 28 kg/m 2). The high mortality in lean and very <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> was due largely to non-cardiovascular causes, particularly lung cancer and respiratory disease, which are associated with cigarette smoking. In obese men deaths {{were more likely to be}} due to cardiovascular causes. There was a strong inverse association between body weight and cigarette smoking. When the pattern of mortality was examined by age, smoking habits, and pre-existing smoking related disease both very <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> and obese men consistently had an increased mortality. The U-shaped relation was most prominent in men in the oldest age group (55 - 59). Current smokers had a higher mortality than former smokers at virtually all values of body mass index. An increased mortality in <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> was seen only in current smokers and in men with smoking related disease. Among men who had never smoked, <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> had the lowest total mortality, thereafter mortality increased with increasing body mass index (p less than 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS [...] This study provides strong evidence of the impact of cigarette smoking on body weight and mortality and strongly suggests that the benefits of giving up smoking are far greater than the problems associated with the increase in weight that may occur...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} acute resistance exercise on adipose tissue tria-cylglycerol lipase activity (TGLA) in <b>lean</b> and obese <b>men.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Nine lean and eight obese men performed 30 min of circuit resistance exercise. Adipose tissue and blood were sampled during exercise for TGLA, metabolite, and hormone determinations. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was mea-sured throughout exercise. RESULTS — Energy expenditure of exercise relative to body mass was higher in the lean and RER was higher in the obese men, suggesting lower fat oxidation. TGLA increased 18 -fold at 5 min of exercise in the <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> and 16 -fold at 10 min of exercise in the obese men. The delayed lipolytic activation in the obese men was reflected in serum nonesterified fatty acid and glycerol concentrations.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to survey relationships between acylated ghrelin with GH, insulin resistance, lipid profile, and cardio respiratory function in <b>lean</b> and obese <b>men.</b> Methods: Nineteen obese men (body mass index 31. 0 ± 3. 5 kg/m 2, aged 27. 5 ± 5. 8 year) and the same number of <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> (body mass index = 18. 47 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2, aged 26. 9 ± 5. 6 year) were selected if they had no experience of regular physical activity during six month ago. After 12 hour fasting, blood samples were collected and blood parameters as well as maximal oxygen uptake (as indicator of cardiorespiratory function) was assessed. Results: Insulin levels and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) were higher, and GH, acylated ghrelin and maximal oxygen uptake levels were lower, in obese versus <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> (p 0. 01). Plasma acylated ghrelin concentrations in obese and <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> were negatively correlated to body weight (r= - 0. 50, r= - 0. 43, respectively), body fat percent (r = - 0. 53, r = - 0. 44, respectively), body mass index (r = - 0. 53, r = - 0. 49, respectively), insulin (r = - 0. 42, r = - 0. 40, respectively) and HOMA-IR (r = - 0. 48, r = - 0. 45, respectively), and positively correlated to GH levels (r = 0. 37, r = 0. 31, respectively) and maximal oxygen uptake (r = 0. 33, r = 0. 31, respectively) (p 0. 01). Conclusions: Obese and <b>lean</b> inactive young <b>men</b> had different levels of acylated ghrelin, GH, insulin, insulin resistance index, cardiorespiratory function and body fat percent.

Chemerin {{is also a}} newly known adipokine that regulates the adipogenesis and metabolism of adipocytes. This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} endurance training (ET) on leptin and chemerin adipokines in inactive <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> Materials and Methods: In a semi-experimental study, 20 inactive <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> were randomly divided into the experimental and control groups. General characteristics of the subjects, serum levels of leptin and chemerin (using ELISA method) were assessed before and after the training. Blood sampling was performed after the twelve-hours fasting, at 8 A. M. An ET protocol consisted of twelve weeks pedaling on cycle ergometer (3 sessions per week, intensity 60 - 70 of the reserved heart rate, duration of each session 20 - 40 min). Results: After an ET period, no significant changes were found in body weight, BMI, and body fat percent (P> 0. 05), while maximal oxygen uptake was improved (P= 0. 004). Moreover, the ET had no significant effects on serum concentrations of chemerin and leptin (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Performing a twelve-week ET has no significant effect on serum concentrations of leptin and chemerin in inactive <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> It seems that this lack of change is likely the result of consistency of weight and fat mass following the training period.

40|$|First {{published}} {{online in}} 2009 Obesity in men, particularly when central, {{is associated with}} lower total testosterone [TT], free testosterone [FT] and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], and a greater decline in TT and FT with increasing age compared with <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> Obesity-related conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus are independently associated with decreased plasma testosterone. Possible mechanisms include decreased LH pulse amplitude, inhibitory effects of oestrogen at the hypothalamus and pituitary {{and the effects of}} leptin and other peptides centrally and on Leydig cells. Obese men have reduced sperm concentration and total sperm count compared to <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> but sperm motility and morphology appear unaffected. The cause and effect relationships between low plasma androgen levels, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, and associated cardiometabolic risk remain unclear.

Given the undeniable role of sport in general health, the aim ofthis {{present study was to}} assay the effects of regular exercise on serum levels of immunoregulators factors(leptin, tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF- α) and interleukin- 6) in obese and <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> Material and methods: 37 male subjects divided two groups of obese and lean with body compositionanalyzer. Blood samples were taken 48 h before starting the aerobic training program. Then, both groupsperformed the aerobic training program included running with 65 - 85 % of individual maximum heart rateon treadmill for 3 sessions per week, 30 minutes per session and 2 consecutive months. Then anotherblood sample was taken following the training period. Serum levels of leptin, TNF- α and interleukin- 6 of all subjects before and after the training period were measured using standard biochemical methodsfrom all the subjects and all the parameters were measured in both groups again. Results: Our results showed that the aerobic training resulted in a significant decrease in leptin levelsin obese (p= 0. 000) and non obese (p= 0. 004) peoples and also a significant decrease in TNF- α (p= 0. 042) in lean people. However, the aerobic training had no significant influence in the levels of interleukin- 6 inboth groups. Conclusion: The results showed that regular and light aerobic exercises could decrase leptin levels inboth obese and <b>lean</b> <b>men,</b> but have differential effects on levels of TNF- α in both groups. These effectsmay influence functions of immune system and metabolism in obese and <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> in a different way...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adjustments of {{carbohydrate}} {{intake and}} oxidation occur in both normal-weight and overweight individuals. Never-theless, {{the contribution of}} carbohydrates to the accumulation of fat through either reduction of fat oxidation or stimulation of fat synthesis in obesity remains poorly investigated. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the post-prandial metabolic changes and the fractional hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) induced by a high-carbohydrate, low-fat meal in lean and overweight young men. Design: A high-carbohydrate, low-fat meal was administered to 6 lean and 7 overweight men after a 17. 5 -h fast. During the fasting and postprandial periods, energy expenditure (EE), macronutrient oxidation, diet-induced thermogenesis, and serum insulin, glu-cose, triacylglycerol, and fatty acids were measured. To determine DNL, [1 - 13 C]sodium acetate was infused and the mass isotopomer distribution analysis method was applied. Results: After intake of the high-carbohydrate meal, the over-weight men had hyperinsulinemia and higher fatty acid and tri-acylglycerol concentrations than did the <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> The over-weight group showed a greater EE, whereas there was no significant difference in carbohydrate oxidation between the groups. Never-theless, the overweight men had a marginally higher protein oxi-dation and a lower lipid oxidation than did the <b>lean</b> <b>men.</b> DNL was significantly higher before and after meal intake in the over-weight men and was positively associated with fasting serum glu-cose and insulin concentrations. Furthermore, postprandial DNL was positively correlated with body fat mass, EE, and triacyl-glycerol.

Four groups of healthy men were studied: seven <b>lean</b> young <b>men</b> [age, 27. 5), seven <b>lean</b> older <b>men</b> (age, > 60 yr; BMI, 27. 5). The men performed a maximal exercise test. GH secretion was higher in the younger men than in the older men. Peak GH was higher in the older <b>lean</b> <b>men</b> than in the older overweight men. There was no difference between the young groups. Fitness correlated negatively with age and positively with peak GH. In young men, there was no relation between BMI, bioimpedance, or leptin and GH secretion. In contrast, in older men there was an inverse correlation between measures of fat mass and GH secretion. Age and physical fitness are more important than body fat in regulating exercise-induced GH secretion. These findings have important clinical implications if we are to prevent the frailty and morbidity associated with aging. <br/...|$|R
