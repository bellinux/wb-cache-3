500|$|Between 2001 and 2010, Gingrich {{consulted}} for Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored secondary {{home mortgage}} company, which {{was concerned about}} new regulations under consideration by Congress. Regarding payments of $1.6 million for the consulting, Gingrich said that [...] "Freddie Mac paid Gingrich Group, which {{has a number of}} employees and a number of offices, a consulting fee, just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> pay any other consulting firm." [...] In January 2012, he said that he could not make public his contract with Freddie Mac, even though the company gave permission, until his business partners in the Center for Health Transformation also agreed to that.|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters {{made it very clear}} who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the chief}} witch Muriel, {{described}} by Arterton as [...] "the queen bee of witches", was given to Dutch actress Famke Janssen. Janssen too described the film as [...] "Tarantino-esque", with [...] "a lot of blood, gore and exploding witches." [...] Wirkola {{said he had a}} crush on Janssen since he saw her in GoldenEye as Xenia Onatopp, [...] "an amazing villain," [...] and that in his opinion her being not only a good actress but also a beautiful woman who is [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "menacing somehow" [...] made her [...] "a perfect combination" [...] of [...] "sexy and dangerous". Janssen said that at first the initial appeal was just money, but she quickly took a liking of the script and of Wirkola personally. She also thought the idea of playing an [...] "evil to the core" [...] witch [...] "was appealing and different", saying, [...] "I hadn't done anything like it…A character like a witch feels <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have so much freedom, because there are no restrictions as to what you can do." [...] Later, however, she was constantly being distracted by the special effects work and felt that she [...] "really understood the character" [...] only {{in one part of the}} film. She found the time-consuming process of applying such makeup (taking three hours to apply and one hour to remove) [...] "very strange" [...] and also felt restricted and afraid of acting over-the-top in her witch role. In the end, she still had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing someone who is completely evil, and felt that it was [...] "so empowering" [...] to have [...] "an inner witch to get in touch with once in a while." [...] Janssen said the film might appeal to women and girls, too: [...] "There's a brother and a sister story. And there's a romance in it too - but obviously not with the witch. Nobody falls in love with the witch." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mine? Ho, ho! That {{much for}} thy service!" [...] with a disdainful gesture of his fingers. [...] "A {{strapping}} lad <b>like</b> <b>thee</b> <b>would</b> be {{the ruin of}} my trade. I might as well give up bag and staff at once." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sentence {{comprehension}} has to {{deal with}} ambiguity in spoken and written utterances, for example lexical, structural, and semantic ambiguities. [...] Ambiguity is ubiquitous, but people usually resolve it so effortlessly that they do not even notice it. For example, the sentence Time flies like an arrow has (at least) the interpretations Time moves as quickly as an arrow, A special kind of fly, called time fly, likes arrows and Measure the speed of flies <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> measure the speed of an arrow. Usually, readers will be aware of only the first interpretation. Educated readers though, spontaneously think about the arrow of time but inhibit that interpretation because it deviates from the original phrase and the temporal lobe acts as a switch.|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron's 1971 album Pieces of a Man {{used more}} {{conventional}} song structures than the loose, spoken-word feel of Small Talk. He {{was joined by}} Jackson, Johnny Pate as conductor, Ron Carter on bass and bass guitar, drummer Bernard [...] "Pretty" [...] Purdie, Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron's third album, Free Will, was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on Free Will and were joined by Jerry Jemmott playing bass, David Spinozza on guitar, and Horace Ott (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron's voice, [...] "He wasn't a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered {{it would have been}} dynamic. It was a voice <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have for Shakespeare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, lady, lady!' she said, {{clasping}} {{her hands}} passionately before her face, 'if {{there was more}} <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> there <b>would</b> be fewer like me,--there would--there would!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nonsense, Philip. If 'it' heard <b>you</b> talk <b>like</b> that, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> join Grumps. Don't let me {{hear any}} more such stuff," [...] but, though she spoke sharply, somehow {{she did not look}} displeased.|$|R

6000|$|... "I heard Mr. Bonteen {{remark that}} you or {{somebody}} <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{in certain circumstances}} be after a certain lady. I thought {{it to be an}} ill-judged speech, and as your particular friend I heard it with great regret." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not like you!" [...] Jack said astonished, [...] "what {{makes you}} think that? she was sure to like you; why, even if nobody else <b>liked</b> <b>you</b> Nelly <b>would,</b> because <b>you</b> have been so kind to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I laughed heartily. [...] "My dear little girl," [...] said I, [...] "you {{would be}} sorry, indeed, {{if you had}} {{anything}} of the sort.

6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought, Quashy," [...] he said, with {{a return of}} his wonted gravity, [...] "that a man of a {{thoughtful}} and contemplative turn of mind <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have acquired the power of expressing almost any idea in Spanish by this time." ...|$|E
