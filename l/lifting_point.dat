40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructures made {{of glass}} {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP), often abbreviated GRP cover, are used to protect subsea equipment in {{the oil and gas}} industry. These structures need to be lifted during fabrication, transportation and during the installation. The present work investigates the lifting capacity of the GRP covers. The aim is to achieve a more accurate analytical estimate of the lifting capacity, with a desire to replace the simplified hand calculations used today. In order to investigate the lifting capacity, a <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> (reinforced lifting holes made of GRP) is studied with both finite element analysis and experimental tests in a hydraulic tensile bench. Three different test setups, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 are investigated. Case 1 is a representation of a lift through the splash zone during installation, where the GRP cover is in an upright vertical position. Case 2 is an approximation of a horizontal lift with the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> located on top of the cover, causing the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> to encounter out-of-plane loads. Case 3 is a representation of a horizontal four-point lift, with the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> placed on the side walls. The experimental tests were performed in collaboration with Highcomp AS at Westcon Løfteteknikk in Haugesund. The finite element analysis represents the test setup in the hydraulic tensile bench in order to achieve comparable data. Finite element analysis can reduce cost and time compared with physical experiments. For Case 1, with in-plane loads representing the lifting through the splash zone, the results achieved were within a 2 % error margin. For the out-of-plane situation (Case 2) with solid elements, the results were within a 20 % error margin. The results from the in-plane and out-of-plane scenarios were used in a capacity evaluation to create a graph which represents all results and takes into account the out-of-plane angle from the lifting slings. This graph is easy to use in design and provides good results. Based on the comparison of the results, it was concluded that the Puck criterion with gradual degradation provides the most accurate estimate for the capacity and that use of this criterion can replace simplified hand calculation and reduce the number of physical experiments in the future. Based on these findings, an improvement study was conducted for a 30 mm laminate with Puck criterion and gradual degradation with a new lay-up consisting of fibers at [0, 90, + 45, - 45] degrees, compared to the one used today [0, 90]. The results of the new study showed an increase of over 28 % for the capacity in Case 1 and an increase of over 16 % compared with Case 2. These are interesting results, leading to the conclusion that by introducing the fiber directions + 45 degrees, one can enhance the capacity of the material by about 20 %, and it is easy and efficient to implement in a new design of the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> used in GRP covers...|$|E

40|$|A new {{semi-rigid}} inflatable rescue craft, the Delta Autonomous Rescue and Recovery Craft (ARRC), {{has been}} developed by Delta ARRC Ltd., with design support by Amgram Ltd. This craft is 18. 8 m long, has a mass of 30. 6 tonne and is to be lifted onto a mother ship using a two point lift system. The local details of the lifting points in the Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) hull were determined from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) performed by White Young Green Consulting. Each <b>lifting</b> <b>point,</b> forward and aft, has a safe working load of 16 tonne and the statutory requirement is a safety factor of 6 against failure. The FEA determined the additional hull thickness required at the lifting points and other specific details of the connections such as the number {{and size of the}} bolts and the plating thicknesses. The FEA showed that the revised <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> details met their statutory requirements but the only way to prove this in practice, before manufacture of the new boat, would be to perform a full load test to 96 tonne. A specimen that was representative of the locally thickened hull together with a central GRP rib was chosen and the test rig was designed by the University of Southampton. Load was applied in 8 tonne increments, to a maximum of 92 tonne, a safety factor of 5. 75. It was at this stage that the test was discontinued due to safety concerns. However, considering that the test was more onerous than the real situation and that the specimen was only lightly damaged and capable of carrying further load it was concluded that the <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> configuration met its statutory requirements...|$|E

Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be sag or bend {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two lifting lug are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of lifting plate so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes. On the other hand, due to two <b>lifting</b> <b>point</b> on a beam plate may be band or sag so it’s require to solve two problem simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract. The {{horizontal}} boom of {{the tower}} crane in the rotary plane is a cantilever structure with large flexibility. Its stability analysis belongs to critical load problems under double non-conservative forces. In this paper, the second-order theory is used to establish the deflection differential equation in the rotary plane of the horizontal boom. According to the deformation compatibility conditions and the boundary conditions, the exact expression of the deflection equation and the instability characteristic equation in the rotary plane are obtained. The premise of the stability analysis {{is to determine the}} force relationship of the two pulling rods in the horizontal boom with double <b>lifting</b> <b>points,</b> which is a statically indeterminate structure. This paper is aimed at the structural characteristics and the load forms of the general boom. For the calculation of the pulling rod forces in the boom, the general expression is deduced considering the variety of the cross-section, the load and the position of <b>lifting</b> <b>points.</b> A highly efficient method for the stability analysis of the horizontal boom with double pulling rods is provided by the analytic expression of the instability characteristic equation and the internal forces in the statically indeterminate pulling rods.
