40|$|In this paper, a micro-hollow cathode <b>light</b> <b>device</b> and a coaxial {{electrode}} geometry {{controlled by}} a dielectric barrier are introduced. Discharge current at the same experimental condition in different <b>light</b> <b>devices</b> are given. It is found that, the widths of discharge pulse in different <b>light</b> <b>devices</b> are about 1 μs and 0. 3 μs respectively. That is, the discharge in the coaxial dielectric barrier discharge is slower {{and that in the}} micro-hollow cathode discharge is faster. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to investigate the glow discharge characteristics in two <b>light</b> <b>devices.</b> Atmospheric pressure glow discharges are realized in argon in a coaxial electrode geometry {{controlled by a}} dielectric barrier and a micro-hollow cathode <b>light</b> <b>device.</b> By comparing the different emission spectra in two <b>light</b> <b>devices,</b> it is found that spectral lines of Ar II can only be found in the micro-hollow cathode discharge. Electron excited temperature is obtained from several Ar I lines of the optical emission spectra by Boltzmann plot, and it can be found that the electron excited temperature in the micro-hollow cathode discharge is higher than that in the coaxial dielectric barrier discharge. However, the electron excited temperature is much higher, estimated by using several spectral lines of Ar II in the micro-hollow cathode. Consequently, a non-equilibrium plasma is obtained in our discharge. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Power-electronics {{interface}} and {{the technique}} of pulsewidth modulation have been the heart of controlling the illumination intensity of <b>lighting</b> <b>devices.</b> It is, however, observed that for some <b>lighting</b> <b>devices,</b> {{the use of such}} a methodology leads to a lower energy-conversion efficiency (with a lower light intensity for the same amount of electrical input power) than potentially possible. The main problem is related to the saturable characteristic of the electrical-to-optical energy conversion, which follows that of an exponential characteristic, and the fast nature of this reaction in these <b>lighting</b> <b>devices.</b> This paper presents an in-depth discussion on the phenomenon and offers a solution to the problem. Specifically, it is proposed that an n -level type of driving approach to be adopted in the design and construction of power-electronic drivers for fast-response saturable <b>lighting</b> <b>devices</b> to achieve a quasi-optimal lighting efficacy. The result is energy saving for the same required light illumination. Theoretical proofs and experimental results are provided for verification. The topic of discussion in this paper and the proposed approach are not only applicable to the area of electronic circuits and <b>lighting</b> <b>devices,</b> but also to general controlled systems which comprise components that inherit a saturable and fast-reactive energy conversion characteristic. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

According to this analysis, we have developed a new method for tuning slow <b>light</b> <b>device</b> bandwidth center frequency and slow down factor. Analysis and simulation of a basic GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells optical slow <b>light</b> <b>device</b> based on excitonic population oscillation shows that size of quantum wells could tune both of the frequency properties and slow down factor of an optical slow <b>light</b> <b>device.</b> In our simulation with 34 quantum wells each with the width of 60 ?, we have received the slow down factor of more than 60, 000.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{have been}} widely discussed in many applications. In this paper, we propose a WSN-based intelligent light control system for indoor environments. Wireless sensors are responsible for measuring cur-rent illuminations. Two kinds of <b>lighting</b> <b>devices,</b> namely, whole <b>lighting</b> and local <b>lighting</b> <b>devices,</b> are used to provide background and concentrated illuminations, respectively. Users may have various illumination requirements according to their activities and profiles. An illumination requirement is as the combination of background and concentrated illumination demands and users’ locations. We consider two requirement models, namely, binary satisfaction and continuous satisfaction models, and propose two decision algorithms to determine the proper illuminations of devices and to achieve the desired optimization goals. Then, a closed-loop device control algorithm is applied to adjust the illu-mination levels of <b>lighting</b> <b>devices.</b> The prototyping results verify that our ideas are practical and feasible.
