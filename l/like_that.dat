5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a fish, then in turn <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 {{that there was no}} linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, like starfish; molluscan, like clams; articulate, like lobsters; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E
5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E

I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track.
