25|$|Number 1 engine, {{built by}} Boulton and Watt in 1812 and rebuilt as a Cornish engine in the 1840s, is a single-acting, {{condensing}} engine with a bore of 42.25 inches (1073mm), {{a stroke of}} 7 feet (2134mm) and indicated power of 38.6 horsepower (28.8kW). It drives a 30-inch (762mm) <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> capable of lifting 2274lb (1031kg), or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, {{at a rate of}} 11 strokes a minute.|$|E
500|$|At {{full power}} the wheel uses 2tons (2tonnes) {{of water per}} second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives a {{flexible}} coupling to a pit wheel with a diameter of , which has 408 hand-fitted wooden teeth that mesh with a [...] cast iron gear, increasing the speed to 16 rpm. From there, cranks drive vertical connecting rods that transfer the energy to two [...] long cast iron rocking beams made by Boulton and Watt. Each rocking beam drives an [...] diameter <b>lift</b> <b>pump,</b> which also takes its supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises 50imperial gallons (230litres) of water to the canal via [...] of [...] diameter cast iron pipe.|$|E
500|$|It then flows past Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped {{water from}} the River Avon into the canal, using power from {{the flow of the}} river. The pumping station is located in a pump house built of Bath Stone, located at river level. Water is {{diverted}} from the river by Warleigh Weir, about [...] upstream. The water flows down a leat to the pumping station, where it powers a water wheel, [...] wide and [...] in diameter, with 48wooden slats. At full power the wheel uses 2tons (2tonnes) of water per second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives gearing which increases the speed to 16rpm. From here, cranks drive vertical connecting rods which transfer the energy to two [...] long cast iron rocking beams. Each rocking beam in turn drives an 18in (0.5m) diameter <b>lift</b> <b>pump,</b> which also take their supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises [...] of water to the canal. In 1981, British Waterways installed two [...] electric pumps just upstream from the station.|$|E

2500|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are held in}} place automatically by a vacuum system that draws the ambient air pressure down from [...] of vacuum. The vacuum {{is also used to}} lift milk vertically through small diameter hoses, into the receiving can. A milk <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> draws the milk from the receiving can through large diameter stainless steel piping, through the plate cooler, then into a refrigerated bulk tank.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to draining deep mines {{was found by}} Thomas Newcomen who developed an [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine that also worked on the vacuum principle. It employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to {{one end of a}} rocking beam that worked a mechanical <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> from its opposite end. At the bottom of each stroke, steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston. As the piston rose within the cylinder, drawn upward by a counterbalance, it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure. At the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed, and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam. This water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston. The atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder, thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder. The piston, attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the [...] "rocking beam", pulled down the end of the beam, lifting {{the opposite end of the}} beam. Hence, the pump deep in the mine attached to opposite end of the beam via ropes and chains was driven. The pump pushed, rather than pulled the column of water upward, hence it could lift water any distance. Once the piston was at the bottom, the cycle repeated.|$|E
40|$|When a deep-seabed <b>lifting</b> <b>pump</b> is {{kept this}} device has bending and {{deformation}} in the axis {{due to its}} long length(8 m). These influences can be caused a breakdown. Therefore, a mounting must be developed to keep the <b>lifting</b> <b>pump</b> safe. This paper discusses the hydraulic cylinder design of the <b>lifting</b> <b>pump</b> and structural safety estimation of the mounting using SBD(simulation-based design). The multi-body dynamic simulation method is used, which {{has been used in}} the automotive, structural, ship building, and robotics industries. In this study, the position and diameter of the hydraulic cylinder were determined {{based on the results of}} the strokes and buckling loads for the design positions of the hydraulic cylinder. A structural dynamic model of the mounting system was constructed using the determined design values, and the structural safety was evaluated using this dynamic model. According to these results, this system has a sufficient safety factor to manufacture...|$|R

50|$|Most images {{show only}} the engine side, giving no {{information}} on the pumps. Current opinion is that {{at least on the}} early engines, dead-weight force pumps were used, the work of the engine being solely to <b>lift</b> the <b>pump</b> side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/10 gallons (54.6litres) lifted per stroke. The later Watt engines worked <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> powered by the engine stroke {{and it may be that}} later versions of the Newcomen engine did so too.|$|R

50|$|Deep well hand {{pumps are}} used for high lifts of more than 15 m. The weight of the column of water is too great to be lifted {{directly}} and some form of mechanical advantage system such as a lever or flywheel is used.High <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> need to be stronger and sturdier {{to cope with the}} extra stresses.

About 107,000 cubic meters of raw water can be provided per day; while the demineralisation plant has a capacity of 5,420 cubic metres per day.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We can {{calculate}} various <b>pump</b> <b>lifts</b> utilizing {{the method of}} solving the pressure balance loop equations in the distributed power system. For the system pumps are set at heat (cold) source and on each branch, {{if the number of}} independent loops is less than the pumps, the equations of the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> have multiple solutions. When considering the constraint conditions, if we determine the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> of the first branch, others can be determined. For the system pumps are set on the main pipes, if we install pumps at heat (cold) source and on each main water supply and backwater pipes, and the pumps of a corresponding pair of main water supply and backwater pipes are the same, when the number of independent loops is equal to the <b>pump</b> <b>lifts,</b> the equations can have solutions. Furthermore, the method can also be applied for other systems where pumps are set on the main pipes, and the equations of the <b>pump</b> <b>lift</b> have a unique solution...|$|R

5000|$|When built, the Langford {{pumping station}} {{contained}} two triple-expansion steam engines, with {{room for a}} third, which was fitted in 1931. There were used in pairs, and each drove a low <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> to transfer water to the treatment works, and a high <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> to take treated water and pump it along a 28 in cast iron pipe to Southend. The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at Hullbridge, where shafts were built {{on either side of}} the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver [...] per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a backup supply when necessary.|$|E
