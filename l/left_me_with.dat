500|$|Both {{his parents}} were {{interested}} in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as [...] "a normal Anglican upbringing". He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that {{the theory of evolution}} was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god. Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|However, the {{relationship}} between the two brothers had become strained throughout 2009, leading eventually to a last-minute cancellation of an Oasis concert scheduled to take place on 28 August 2009 in Paris, due to an [...] "altercation within the group." [...] Later that evening, Gallagher confirmed he had left Oasis as he [...] "simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer." [...] Through the Oasis website, he said [...] "It's with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight". On 29 August, Gallagher expanded further on his blog, stating [...] "the level of verbal and violent intimidation towards me, my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable. And the lack of support and understanding from my management and band mates has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

His death, on January 29, was perceived as a tragedy by his fellow Junimists. Poet Anton Naum wrote, shortly after the events, [...] "We have lost poor Melik {{in the space of}} 7 days, however good and healthy he had been.

I know that I did my best at that time, but it wasn't good enough. When we make mistakes, you got to step up and own them.

2500|$|There were {{claims that}} {{producer}} goods were favoured over consumer goods, causing consumer goods to be lacking in {{quantity and quality}} in the shortage economies that resulted. However, this is disputed. An article in [...] "Russian Life" [...] writes, [...] "Today the Soviet reality is discussed, there are stories about food shortages. This {{is one of the}} most persistent, propagandistic cliches... It is necessary to say that in reality, nothing of the sort happened. Starting in 1979, when I was seven, my mother regularly took me to the farm market in Butyrsky. The abundance of groceries at the market <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a strong impression. I remember fresh meat for 3-5 rubles per kg, potatoes at 20 kopecki, and pineapples and watermelons in mid-winter." ...|$|E

'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which unlocked the door to all that lay beyond—Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the King’s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; I hated to be corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a complex about Cornish dialect. The inhibition which I had imposed on myself left me, by the time I got to Oxford, incapable of speaking it; and for years, with the censor operating subconsciously...' ...|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a staunch [...] "hard federalist" [...] favoring a strong federal government {{at the expense of the}} provinces, much along the same lines as his predecessor Trudeau. However unlike Trudeau, Chrétien supported the Charlottetown Accord of August 1992, which proposed devolving federal powers to the provinces and once again recognized Quebec as a [...] "distinct society". At the urging of Pelletier, Chrétien met secretly with Trudeau at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, where the two men argued about the meaning of [...] "distinct society" [...] for more than two hours. While the two did not resolve their differences, Trudeau promised to refrain from undermining Chrétien's authority in public. Trudeau denounced the Accord at the Maison Egg Roll in Montreal on October 1, 1992. Chrétien had major reservations about the Charlottetown accord, but as his opposition to Meech had done him much damage in Quebec, he was anxious not to be seen as an opponent of another set of constitutional amendments designed to secure Quebec's ratification of the 1982 constitution, especially as Charlottetown was very similar to the amendments that Chrétien had proposed to Meech Lake in 1990. Chrétien endorsed the Charlottetown accord on the rather negative grounds that the constitutional debate of the late 1980s-early 1990s were destroying Canada, saying it [...] "was bleeding the nation to death" [...] and that Charlottetown was the best way of ending that debate in order to move political debate back to the economic recession, which had begun in 1990. At a Liberal caucus meeting on September 8, 1992, Chrétien declared that [...] "if we had been the government we would not have made this deal", and that only reason to support Charlottetown was that to reject it would increase support for Quebec separatism. [...] The unity minister Joe Clark recalled that Chrétien did not champion the Charlottetown accord in the 1992 referendum with any great conviction or passion, stating: [...] "We were trying to bring everybody into the tent on it, and I made a practice taking proposals to the other party, particularly Chrétien...I just didn't think he was following the issue...I don't know what it was...But it <b>left</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> was the belief that here was a guy for whom the substance of things doesn't matter much." [...] During the 1992 referendum, Chrétien kept a low profile, and delivered only a few speeches in favor of Charlottetown.|$|E
