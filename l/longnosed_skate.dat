500|$|The velvet belly's liver {{accounts}} for 17% {{of its body}} mass, three-quarters of which is oil, making it nearly neutrally buoyant. To deal with the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the deep sea, the velvet belly has T-cells in its bloodstream that can identify and mark toxic compounds for elimination. These T-cells are produced by a lymphomyeloid gland in its esophagus called a [...] "Leydig's organ", which {{is also found in}} some other sharks and rays. In its liver, specialized proteins are also capable of detoxifying cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc, and other toxic contaminants. The velvet belly's bioluminescence is thought to function in counter-illumination, which eliminates the shark's silhouette and camouflages it from upward-looking predators. Its bioluminescence may also serve a social function, such as finding mates or co-ordinating groups, as the pattern is species-specific. The velvet belly is an important food of larger fishes such as other sharks; a major predator of this species is the <b>longnosed</b> <b>skate</b> (Dipturus oxyrinchus).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Skates (Rajiformes: Rajoidei) are an {{extremely}} {{diverse group of}} cartilaginous, marine fishes that are common mesopredators in benthic communities. Population declines, shifts in assemblage structure, and ecological interactions with exploited groundfishes have focused increased scientific and management attention on skates. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to address a knowledge gap in the ecology of eastern North Pacific (ENP) skates, and thereby inform the development of improved monitoring and management strategies for exploited skate stocks off the U. S. West Coast and in the Gulf of Alaska. Chapter 1 investigated spatial associations of ENP skates in continental shelf and upper continental slope waters of each study region. Chapter 2 focused on the other aspect of the traditional niche by examining trophic relationships within each skate assemblage and among distant populations of big and <b>longnose</b> <b>skates.</b> The goal of this chapter was to address the paradox of ecological redundancy in skates (i. e., skates occupy similar habitats and eat similar prey). Chapter 3 utilized an improved understanding of ENP skate ecology to establish baseline information for the development of fisheries management strategies. Space appears to be more important than food in structuring ENP skate assemblages. Spatial segregation among sympatric skate species and their life stages was demonstrated off central California and in the western Gulf of Alaska. In contrast, ENP skate assemblages displayed a high degree of trophic redundancy, with the timing and location of collection trawls explaining the great majority of dietary variation. Species-level and length-based differences were highly significant, but explained a relatively minor portion of the observed dietary variability, especially in the western Gulf of Alaska. Big and <b>longnose</b> <b>skates</b> had different predatory roles in each region, with a greater reliance on decapods in the Gulf and fishes off California. Distribution and abundance patterns of U. S. West Coast skate species and their life stages were modeled and can be used to characterize essential fish habitat. Updates to a Gulf of Alaska food web model indicated that skates (especially big skate) are major predators of Tanner crab and may considerably influence regional trophodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 In the past, sharks, skates and ray {{species have}} mainly {{occurred}} in incidental fisheries. Now they {{are increasingly being}} directly targeted due to the depleted status of traditionally targeted species. The life history characteristics of many elasmobranch species make them more sensitive to high rates of fishing mortality. The combination of these factors {{has resulted in the}} known local depletion of several elasmobranch species; including the barndoor skate, Raja laevis, of the Northwest Atlantic and the common skate, Raja batis, of Irish Sea. The <b>longnose</b> <b>skate,</b> Raja rhina, occurs commonly as incidental catch in trawl fisheries off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.

5000|$|Big skates are {{frequently}} caught by recreational anglers, who usually release or discard them. They adapt well to captivity {{and are often}} displayed in public aquaria. This species {{is one of the}} three most important skates fished off the coast of California, though compared to other commercial fisheries, it is of only minor importance. This species is usually taken as bycatch in bottom trawls; the pectoral fins are sold as [...] "skate wings" [...] and are eaten baked or fried, often being labeled as imitation scallops. In the 1990s, the market value of skate wings rose to US$0.40-$1.00 per pound, and catches of the big skate off California increased tenfold as the trawl fishery began marketing its skate and ray bycatch. In 2003, a targeted fishery for the big <b>skate</b> and the <b>longnose</b> <b>skate</b> (Raja rhina) commenced in the Gulf of Alaska. Population data following this increased exploitation are lacking, but the big skates' slow reproductive rate has led them to be assessed as Least Concern by the World Conservation Union.|$|R
40|$|The <b>longnose</b> <b>skates</b> (Zearaja chilensis and Dipturus trachyderma) are {{the main}} {{component}} of the elasmobranch fisheries in the south-east Pacific Ocean. Both species are considered to be a single stock by the fishery management in Chile however, {{little is known about the}} level of demographic connectivity within the fishery. In this study, we used a genetic variation (560 bp of the control region of the mitochondrial genome and ten microsatellite loci) to explore population connectivity at five locations along the Chilean coast. Analysis of Z chilensis populations revealed significant genetic structure among off -shore locations (San Antonio, Valdivia), two locations in the Chiloe Interior Sea (Puerto Montt and Aysen) and Punta Arenas in southern Chile. For example, mtDNA haplotype diversity was similar across off -shore locations and Punta Arenas (h = 0. 46 - 0. 50), it was significantly different to those in the Chiloe Interior Sea (h= 0. 08). These results raise concerns about the long-term survival of the species within the interior sea, as population resilience will rely almost exclusively on self -recruitment. In contrast, little evidence of genetic structure was found for D. trachyderma. Our results provide evidence for three management units for Z chilensis, and we recommend that separate management arrangements are required for each of these units. However, there is no evidence to discriminate the extant population of Dipturus trachyderma as separate management units. The lack of genetic population subdivision for D. trachyderma appears to correspond with their higher dispersal ability and more offshore habitat preference...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStock {{assessment}} {{scientists and}} fishery managers {{operate under the}} necessary assumption that the identities of species and quantities of catch from industry landing reports are known without error. To evaluate this assumption, we compared industry-generated reports of landed catch to independent observer estimates. An observer sampling design for shore-based processing plants was developed and implemented at four plants in Kodiak, Alaska. A total of 13 deliveries from three fisheries were examined. Observers were able to track different portions of the catch and treat them as strata from which to randomly sample or completely enumerate. Differences between observer- and industry-derived species proportions were negligible when measured across the entire study, but differed by fishery. Industry weight in the shallow-water flatfish fishery exhibited a small negative bias not related to processor or species type. Weight differences in complete enumerations for big (Beringraja binoculata) and <b>longnose</b> <b>skates</b> (Raja rhina) were of similar magnitude but in opposite directions, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the identification of these species is confused since there is no detection error. Where observers needed to sample, they were able to detect most species in open access fisheries, with a resolution comparable to that of the industry, and were more likely to detect skates than industry. However, in the cooperative rockfish fishery, where tighter controls on the dockside sorting of fish by plant staff are in place, industry reports had enhanced detection of rare species relative to observer sampling. Notwithstanding, differences between data sources remained substantial in strata where the observer sampled even after considering rarity. The results here highlight the utility of using third-party verification to improve data quality of self-reported data, and identified the logistical, database, and analytical challenges to effectively monitor fishery quotas...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Knowing how {{groundfish}} distribute {{in relation}} to ocean conditions is of primary importance to fishery managers as they are tasked with estimating stock size and designing effective monitoring programs amidst a changing climate. This research examined near-bottom environmental data alongside Pacific halibut survey catch data for the years 2006 - 2009 on the continental shelf of Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia. The objectives of the research were: 1) characterize summer environmental and fish distribution conditions at depth observed during the setline survey throughout the study area; 2) explore ranges and possible tolerance thresholds for temperature, DO, salinity, and pH for Pacific halibut and six other species commonly caught during the survey including arrowtooth flounder, spiny dogfish, sablefish, <b>longnose</b> <b>skate,</b> lingcod, and yelloweye rockfish; 3) identify the primary environmental factors affecting distribution of these species and model the observed relationships; and 4) assess {{the ability of the}} longline survey to adequately account for target species across environmental gradients. All of the organisms except sablefish were found in increasing numbers from south to north and occupied varying depth strata. Upwelling-induced seasonal hypoxia (i. e. DO less than 1. 4 ml/L) is a feature of the study area and all of the organisms except sablefish exhibited apparent species-specific DO minimum thresholds between 0. 75 ml/L to 1. 0 ml/L, i. e. where animals were found above, but not below these thresholds. Ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression analysis indicated a variety of variables unique to each species as significant in predicting distribution, with temperature, DO, and pressure as the most common. Poor model performance led to the use of two other methods, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and tree regression, to examine regional variation and mitigate the effect of correlated explanatory variables. The tree regression model, which allows for predictor variable correlation, was a comparable or better fit than OLS and GWR for all species except Pacific halibut, where GWR, using DO as a predictor variable, was the best fit. GWR addresses regional variation of processes. Results here suggest that many of the animals, including halibut, use avoidance as a coping mechanism for below-threshold DO. However, given that GWR yielded the best fitting model for halibut, low (but above threshold) DO may also be contributing to catchability differences in the survey. Multivariate analysis was used to examine the relationship among the environmental variables and to examine species assemblages {{in relation to}} these variables. Depth and latitude were of primary importance in describing relationships...|$|R
