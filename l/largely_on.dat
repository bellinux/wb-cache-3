5|$|Adolf Seilacher has {{suggested}} the Ediacaran sees animals usurping giant protists {{as the dominant}} life form. The modern xenophyophores are giant single-celled protozoans found throughout the world's oceans, <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> the abyssal plain. A recent genetic study suggested that the xenophyophores are a specialised group of Foraminifera. There are approximately 42 recognised species in 13 genera and 2 orders; one of which, Syringammina fragilissima, is among the largest known protozoans at up to 20 centimetres in diameter.|$|E
5|$|All {{properties}} {{which had}} been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families. Nerva also sought to involve the Senate in his government, {{but this was not}} entirely successful. He continued to rely <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> friends and advisors that were known and trusted, and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro-Domitianic faction of the Senate, he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life.|$|E

5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> the grounds of {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court {{did not need to}} go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E

In 1996, GCC published a report entitled Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction written by Robert E. Davis.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} dragonfly populations across the world, {{for example in}} Japan. Over 60% of Japan's wetlands {{were lost in the}} 20th century, so its dragonflies now depend <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> rice fields, ponds, and creeks. Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice, acting as a natural pest control. Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa, and represent a conservation priority.|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E

Although it contains dogfights, the game focuses <b>largely</b> <b>on</b> air-to-ground combat, hence the title.|$|E
5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce.
