5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace <b>lung</b> <b>tissue.</b> This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in the lung.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium {{directly}} from pressurized cylinders or even balloon filling valves is extremely dangerous, as high flow rate and pressure {{can result in}} barotrauma, fatally rupturing <b>lung</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of mice at a {{wet weight}} of 30 – 100  mg were collected. The HYP levels in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were {{detected}} using alkaline hydrolysis colorimetry. <b>Lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were hydrolysed using an alkaline solution. Chloramine T, perchloric acid, and 4 -(dimethylamino) benzaldehyde were sequentially added. After mixing thoroughly, samples were incubated in a 60  °C water bath for 15  min. The samples were cooled down and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. The absorbance values at 550  nm wavelength and 1  cm optic path were measured. Calibration was performed using a blank tube {{and a standard}} tube. The results arepresented as μg/mg.|$|R
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. <b>Lung</b> <b>tissue</b> distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} levels of antioxidant enzymes and free radical-induced DNA base modifications in human cancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> {{and in their}} cancer-free surrounding tissues. Various DNA base lesions in chromatin of <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were also measured in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> Higher levels of DNA lesions were observed in cancerous tissues than in cancer-free surrounding tissues. Antioxidant enzyme levels were lower in cancerous tissues. The results indicate an association between decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased levels of DNA lesions in cancerous tissues. Higher levels of DNA lesions suggest that free radical reactions may be increased in malignant tumor cells...|$|R
30|$|After killing, <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> {{were fixed}} by {{immersion}} in 10 % phosphate-buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) for 8  h at room temperature. Following fixation, tissues were washed {{three times in}} PBS. After fixation, <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were placed in 10 % sucrose until tissues sink, then 20 % overnight. <b>Lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were removed from sucrose, excess was blot off, and tissues were placed into molds. Tissues were then transferred to OCT (optimum cutting temperature compound) chamber and surrounded with OCT. The mold was placed in Styrofoam container, which holds dry ice/ 2 -methyl butane slurry, and the block was allowed to freeze until the OCT becomes white and solid. Eight-µm frozen sections were performed using the Cryostat.|$|R
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from <b>lung</b> <b>tissue,</b> may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral <b>lung</b> <b>tissue.</b> Although most cases of adenocarcinoma {{are associated with}} smoking, adenocarcinoma {{is also the most}} common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the bronchial airways that terminate in alveoli, the <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective It {{has been}} proven that p 120 ctn plaied an {{important}} role in cell adhesion and correlates with tumorigenesis significantly, the aim of this work is to investigate the expression of p 120 ctn(p 120 catenin) isoform proteins in lung squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, and analyze the correlations between p 120 ctn and clinicopathological parameters. Methods Immunofluorescence and Westren Blot were used to detect the expression of p 120 ctn isoforms in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and the corresponding normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> ResultsCompared to normal epithelium of <b>lung,</b> <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> show reduction or absence of membrane expression or cytoplasmic accumulation of p 120 ctn. In normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues,</b> the total levels of p 120 ctn proteins were significantly higher than that in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> (P < 0. 001). The isoform 1 (120 KD) and isoform 3 (100 KD) proteins were the major isoforms of p 120 ctn expressed in normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues,</b> which were significantly reduced in lung cancer samples (P = 0. 001 andP < 0. 001, respectively). Furthermore, the changes in isoform 3 protein levels was negatively associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0. 005). Conclusion Reductions of p 120 ctn isoform 1 and 3 is a common phenomenon in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and {{may play a role in}} metastasis progression in human lung cancer...|$|R
40|$|Dexmedetomidine {{has been}} {{reported}} to reduce mortality in septic rats. This study was designed to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on inflammatory reaction in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of septic rats induced by CLP. After induction of sepsis, the rats were treated with normal saline or dexmedetomidine (5, 10, or 20 [*]μg/kg). The survival rate of septic rats in 24 [*]h was recorded. The inflammation of <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> was evaluated by HE stain. The concentrations of IL- 6 and TNF-α in BALF and plasma were measured by ELISA. The expressions of TLR 4 and MyD 88 were measured by western blotting. The activation of NF-κB in rat <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> was assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. It was found that the mortality rate and pulmonary inflammation were significantly increased in septic rats. IL- 6 and TNF-α levels in BALF and plasma, NF-κB activity, and TLR 4 /MyD 88 expression in rat <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> were markedly enhanced after CLP. Dexmedetomidine (10 and 20 [*]μg/kg) significantly decreased mortality and pulmonary inflammation of septic rats, as well as suppressed CLP-induced elevation of TNF-α and IL- 6 and inhibited TLR 4 /MyD 88 expression and NF-κB activation. These results suggest that dexmedetomidine may decrease mortality and inhibit inflammatory reaction in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of septic rats by suppressing TLR 4 /MyD 88 /NF-κB pathway...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} S 100 A 7 {{is a member}} of S 100 family and its overexpression has been previously associated with carcinogenesis of certain cancers. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the expression of calcium-binding protein S 100 A 7 in lung cancer. Methods In the present study, RT-PCR, Western-blot and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the different expression of S 100 A 7 in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and paired noncancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> Results The specific expression of S 100 A 7 was found in squamous cell carcinomas and large cell lung carcinomas, whereas it was not detected in adenocarcinomas, small cell carcinomas, other cell types of lung cancer and normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> as well as paired noncancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> Conclusion S 100 A 7 was selectively expressed in squamous cell carcinomas and large cell lung carcinomas and may serve as a potential marker for lung cancer diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|Folkloric vampirism {{has been}} {{associated}} with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of <b>lung</b> <b>tissue.</b> The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{evaluation}} value of HMGA 2, Tiam 1 and Notch 1 expression for cancer cell proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in non-small cell <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissue.</b> Methods: Non-small cell <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> and para-carcinoma tissues surgically removed in our hospital between May 2013 and December 2015 were collected, immunohistochemical staining method {{was used to}} determine HMGA 2, Tiam 1 and Notch 1 protein expression, and fluorescence quantitative PCR {{was used to determine}} the mRNA expression of HMGA 2, Tiam 1, Notch 1 as well as proliferation, invasion and epithelialmesenchymal transition molecules. Results: HMGA 2, Tiam 1 and Notch 1 mRNA expression and positive protein expression rate in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> were significantly higher than those in para-carcinoma tissues (P< 0. 05); E-cadherin mRNA expression in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with positive HMGA 2 expression was significantly lower than that in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with negative HMGA 2 expression (P< 0. 05) while N-cadherin and Vimentin mRNA expression were significantly higher than those in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with negative HMGA 2 expression (P< 0. 05); MMP 2, MMP 3, MMP 8 and MMP 9 mRNA expression in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with positive Tiam 1 expression were significantly higher than those in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with negative Tiam 1 expression (P< 0. 05); CyclinD 1, Bcl- 2 and Survivin mRNA expression in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with positive Notch 1 expression were significantly higher those in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> with negative Notch 1 expression (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Highly expressed HMGA 2, Tiam 1 and Notch 1 in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> can regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and proliferation of cancer cells respectively...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{diagnosis}} of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae infection by the conventional culture and identification method usually requires 3 to 4 days. Since H. pleuropneumoniae may be disseminated from infected individuals during this period, {{this amount of}} time required for diagnosis may be too slow to aid in epidemic control. To obtain an earlier diagnosis, a coagglutination test was successfully used to detect serotype-specific antigens in lung extracts of infected pigs. A total of 19 <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> from experimentally infected pigs, 240 <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> from naturally infected pigs that died of pleuropneumonia, and 571 lung specimens from an apparently healthy pig population were examined for culture isolation {{as well as for}} antigen detection. The results showed that detection of antigens in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> by the coagglutination test is an extremely rapid, simple, quite specific, and highly sensitive procedure for the {{diagnosis of}} H. pleuropneumoniae infection. Further, detection of antigens in <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> was found to be a much simpler and much more rapid method than culture isolation. The coagglutination test seems to be especially useful for detecting H. pleuropneumoniae in pigs exposed to chronic infection as well as those in which multiple serotypes are involved...|$|R

5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the <b>lung</b> <b>tissue.</b> Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a life or death operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When <b>lung</b> <b>tissue</b> is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} alternations of human tenascin (TN) expression in virally transformed lung fibroblasts and in <b>lung</b> tumor <b>tissues</b> were investigated using S, nuclease protection analysis in com parison {{with those of}} fibronectin (FN).

Methods The expression of Bmi- 1 was detected in 25 NSCLC tissues as well as in the normal paracancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> by immunofluorescence technique and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results Immunofluorescently, the positive expression of Bmi- 1 proteins was revealed in nucleus of tumor cells in 76 (19 / 25) of NSCLC tissue but not in paracancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> RT-PCR results showed that the expression of Bmi- 1 in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> was significantly higher than that in paracancerous <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> (P< 0. 05).

The aim of this work is to investigate the level of expression of heparanase protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the relationship between heparanase expression and NSCLC histological types and prognosis. Methods Immunohistochemical method was used to detect the heparanase expression in the routinely paraffin-embedded sections of surgical specimen of 66 cases with NSCLC and 15 ones with normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> Results Heparanase was highly expressed in <b>lung</b> cancer <b>tissues</b> (74. 2 ％) while negative in epithelia of normal <b>lung</b> <b>tissues.</b> Theexpression of heparanase was significantly correlated with TNM stage (P = 0. 042) and lymphatic metastasis (P = 0. 005).

Using a competitive PCR method, we determined the relative content of mtDNA in the <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of 49 subjects aged 16 – 85 years. The results showed that the relative content of mtDNA (with respect to the β-actin gene) in the <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> was significantly increased with age (P< 0. 005). The average mtDNA content in the <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of the subjects over 80 years of age was found to be about 2. 6 -fold higher than that of the subjects below age 20. However, the relative content of mtDNA was slightly increased in the <b>lung</b> <b>tissues</b> of light smokers but significantly decreased in heavy smokers. Moreover, we found a significant increase with age in the level of oxidative damage to DNA as indicated by the ratio of 8 -OH-dG/dG in total DNA (P< 0. 0005).
