5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora),</b> the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the <b>labia</b> <b>minora)</b> and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E

50|$|A {{clitoral}} pump {{may be used}} on the clitoris, clitoral hood, <b>labia</b> (both <b>minora</b> and majora), {{the entire}} genital area and, in some cases, the nipples. The clitoral pump, like the penis pump, {{may be used for}} temporary effect prior to, or during, masturbation or sexual activity. The clitoral pump is not designed to be applied to the vaginal opening nor the inside of the vagina, since it may cause injuries.|$|R

5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} testosterone, the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of testosterone, the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

40|$|The vulva is {{the outer}} part of the female genital tract, bordered by the symphisis pubis, the labiocrural folds and the anus. It {{consists}} of the following structures: the mons pubis, the <b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora,</b> the clitoris, the vestibule of the vagina and the urethral orifice (Figure 1). Embryologically all three germ layers are present at the vulva; the cloacal endoderm, the urogenital ectoderm and the paramesonephric mesoderma. Different epithelia, from keratinized squamous epithelium on the <b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora</b> to squamous mucosa in the vestibule, cover the vulva. Dysplastic changes in the epithelium of the vulva are known as Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN). In the past, various definitions {{have been used to}} describe these dysplastic vulvar lesions: morbus Bowen, Queyrat’s erythroplasia, carcinoma simplex, bowenoid papulosis, early vulvar cancer, vulvar atypia, hyperplastic dystrophy, carcinoma in situ and dysplasia (graded into mild dysplasia (VIN 1), moderate dysplasia (VIN 2) and severe dysplasia (VIN 3)). To simplify this complexity of terms and to enhance diagnostic reproducibility, the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Diseases (ISSVD) defined a new terminology in 2004. 7 We nowadays classify two types of VIN: 1. Usual type VIN (uVIN), which is caused by a persistent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection. 2. Differentiated type VIN (dVIN), which is not associated with HPV, but with chronic inflammatory and/or autoimmune processes, such as lichen sclerosus and lichen planus, involving vulvar mucosa and skin. Spontaneous regression of VIN lesions has been described, but malignant transformation into vulvar cancer has also been reported. Vulvar cancer is the fourth most common gynecological type of cancer. 11 Worldwide the incidence rate is 1 to 2 per 100. 000 women, and around 27. 000 women are diagnosed each year. 12 In the Netherlands about 200 new cases are identified each year...|$|R
40|$|The female {{reproductive}} system {{consists of the}} internal and external genitalia. The external genitalia are formed by the vulva, which includes the clitoris, <b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora,</b> urethral orifice and vestibule of the vagina (lower part of the vagina). The internal genital system is located within the pelvis and can be divided into the reproductive tract and the two ovaries (Fig. 1). The reproductive tract consists of the Müllerian duct-derived upper vagina, uterus and two fallopian tubes (oviducts) and functions to transport and guide semen to the oocyte in order to fertilize it (vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes), to hold and nurture the fertilized oocyte during its completion of development from embryonic to fetal stage (uterus) and to form the birth canal (uterus, vagina). The ovaries produce oocytes and secrete hormones necessary for secondary sexual development, regulation of the menstrual cycle, facilitation of implantation and maintenance of the early pregnancy...|$|R
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} by de-epithelialization {{cuts and}} removes the unwanted tissue and preserves the natural rugosity (wrinkled free-edge) of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> and preserves the capabilities for tumescence and sensation. Yet, {{when the patient}} presents with much labial tissue, a combination procedure of de-epithelialization and clamp-resection is usually more effective for achieving the aesthetic outcome established by the patient and her surgeon. In {{the case of a}} woman with labial webbing (redundant folding) between the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and the labia majora, the de-epithelialization labiaplasty includes an additional resection technique — such as the five-flap Z-plasty ("jumping man plasty") — to establish a regular and symmetric shape for the reduced <b>labia</b> <b>minora.</b>|$|E
25|$|Labiaplasty (also {{known as}} labioplasty, <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> reduction, and labial reduction) is a plastic surgery {{procedure}} for altering the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> (inner labia) and the labia majora (outer labia), {{the folds of}} skin surrounding the human vulva. There are two main categories of women seeking cosmetic genital surgery: those with congenital conditions such as intersex, and those with no underlying condition who experience physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals because they believe they do not fall within a normal range.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of laser resection of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> involves the de-epithelialization of the labia. The technical disadvantage of laser labiaplasty is that the removal of excess labial epidermis risks causing the occurrence of epidermal inclusion cysts.|$|E
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{insight into}} the female genital anatomy is crucial for understanding and performing pelvic reconstructive procedures. The intimate relationship between the genitalia and the muscles, ligaments, and fascia that provide support is complex, but critical to restore during surgery for correction of prolapse or aesthetic reasons. The external female genitalia include the mons pubis, <b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora,</b> clitoris, vestibule with glands, perineal body, and the muscles and fascia surrounding these structures. Through the perineal membrane and the perineal body, these superficial vulvar structures are structurally related to the deep pelvic muscle levator ani with its fascia. The levator ani forms the pelvic floor with the coccygeus muscle and provides vital support to all the pelvic organs and stability to the perineum. The internal female genital organs include the vagina, cervix, uterus, tubes, and ovaries with their visceral fascia. The visceral fascia also called the endopelvic fascia, surrounds the pelvic organs and connects them to the pelvic walls. It is continuous with the paraurethral and paravaginal fascia, which {{is attached to the}} perineal membrane. Thus, the internal and external genitalia are closely related to the muscles and fascia, and work as one functioning unit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background SRY (sex-determining region, Y) is {{the gene}} {{responsible}} of gonadal differentiation {{in the male}} and {{it is essential for}} the regular development of male genitalia. Translocations involving the human sex chromosomes are rarely reported, however here we are reporting a very rare translocation of SRY gene to the q -arm of a deleted X chromosome. This finding was confirmed by cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Case presentation A 7 -month infant was clinically diagnosed as an intersex case, with a phallus, <b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora,</b> a blind vagina and a male urethra. Neither uterus nor testes was detected by Ultrasonography. G-banding of his chromosomes showed 46,X,del(X) (p 11) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed a very small piece from the Y chromosome translocated to the q-arm of the del(X). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed the presence of material from the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene. Conclusion It is suggested that the phenotype of the patient was caused by activation of the deleted X chromosome with SRY translocation, which is responsible for gonadal differentiation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vulvar cancer {{corresponds}} to 3 to 5 % of all female reproductive tract malignancies. Therefore it is classifed as a low frequency disease. Aim: To estimate overall and conditional survival {{one and two}} years after diagnosing women with vulvar cancer. Material and Methods: Retrospective cohort study. The patient database of an oncological hospital was revised and patients with vulvar cancer diagnosed between 1997 and 2006 were selected. The clinical records of these women were reviewed. Results: Eighty six women aged 32 to 92 years, were identified. Eighty percent had a squamous carcinoma, 46 % were in stage III, 48 % received incomplete treatment, 40 % consulted due {{to the presence of}} a vulvar mass and 18 % had lesions in <b>labia</b> majora or <b>minora.</b> Overall five years survival at 5 years was 41. 8 %. There were statistically significant differences in survival depending on the initial stage of cancer (p = 0. 02). Five year conditional survival, one and two years after the diagnosis, was 59 and 79 %, respectively. Conclusions: Five years overall survival of these group of women with vulvar cancer was 41. 8 %. The figures increased to 59 and 79 % in patients who had survived one and two years after the diagnosis. The stage of the lesion and the initial survival are survival prognostic factors for vulvar cancer...|$|R
25|$|Estradiol is also {{responsible}} for the increased production of pheomelanin, resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and sometimes labia majora. Estradiol together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the areola.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} genitalia {{of a woman}} are collectively {{known as}} the vulva. This comprises the labia majora (outer labia), the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> (inner labia), the clitoris, the urethra, and the vagina. The labia majora extend from the mons pubis to the perineum.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} unhooding of the clitoris {{involves a}} V–to–Y {{advancement of the}} soft tissues, {{which is achieved by}} suturing the clitoral hood to the pubic bone in the midline (to avoid the pudendal nerves); thus, uncovering the clitoris further tightens the <b>labia</b> <b>minora.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: bladder exstrophy is {{characterized}} by an incomplete development of anterior portion of bladder, urethra, abdominal wall and a median separation of pubic symphysis. We describe 2 clinical cases in adolescent treated with different surgical approach. Materials and Methods: two patients, one male and one female, respectively, 10 and 14 years old. Both cases had relapse: the bladder plate was performed in female when she was 2 years and in male when he was 6 years old. The male showed bladder exstrophy with epispadias; the female showed bifido clitoris, absence of <b>minora</b> <b>labia</b> with a small vaginal orifice. In both patients ano-rectal manometric and barium enema had normal parameters. The x-Ray basin showed diastasis of pubic bones, respectively, 7. 5 cm in male and 10 cm in female. The male had closure of bladder and abdominal wall with transformation of epispadias to peno-scrotal hypospadias. The female had rectal reservoir (about 250 cc), with amputation of the rectum with Hartmann’s method and recanalization with Duhamel’s method, anastomosis uretero rectal and vaginoplasty. Results: clinical and laboratory follow-up to date is 6 months. The female holds the urine about 2 - 3 hours during the day; in the night losses are not reported; the male shows dehiscence of abdominal and vesical wall with suprapubic fistula and loss of urine. The urethral peno-scrotal meatus appears patent. Conclusions: our experience, although limited {{in the number of}} cases and in the time of observation, is in agreement with the literature: we can say that the correction of bladder exstrophy in adolescents might be a urinary diversion with creation of rectal reservoir, useful for age of the patients and postoperative management. It is always necessary an adequate follow-up to check any complications...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{literature}} on sexual assault has not directly addressed {{the question of}} genital injuries in women without prior sexual intercourse experience. Given the paucity of research and the current importance of physical evidence {{in the criminal justice}} system, {{this study was designed to}} document the type and site of genital injuries from sexual assault in women without and with prior sexual intercourse experience. METHODS: The charts were reviewed of 132 women who had been sexually assaulted and had sought medical treatment at the Sexual Assault Care Centre (SACC), Women's College Hospital, Toronto, within 10 days after the assault. Half (66) of the women reported that, at the time of the assault, they had no prior sexual intercourse experience. The Sexual Assault Evidence Kit in each patient's file was reviewed to ascertain the type and location of genital injuries. Types of injuries were classified into 3 categories (nonperforating soft-tissue injuries, lacerations or current bleeding) and locations into 6 categories (<b>labia</b> majora and <b>minora,</b> posterior fourchette and introitus, hymen, vagina, cervix, and anus). RESULTS: Significantly more women without than with prior sexual intercourse experience had visible genital injuries (65. 2 % v. 25. 8 %, p < 0. 01). However, of the women without prior experience, only 9. 1 % had hymenal perforation. Analyses of the data for only women with genital injuries indicated no difference between those without and those with prior sexual intercourse experience in the overall mean number of injured sites (1. 65 and 1. 47 respectively) or in the mean number of sites with nonperforating soft-tissue injuries (0. 349 and 0. 706), lacerations (0. 953 and 0. 471) and bleeding (0. 279 and 0. 294). INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that genital injuries are more common in women without prior sexual intercourse experience but that substantial proportions of all women, regardless of their prior sexual experience at the time of assault, will not have visible genital injuries. Emergency department staff and members of the criminal justice system need to be aware of the variable presentation of genital trauma related to sexual assault in women with and without prior sexual intercourse experience...|$|R
25|$|In sexual {{reassignment}} surgery, in {{the case}} of the male-to-female transgender patient, labiaplasty is usually the second stage of a two-stage vaginoplasty operation, where labiaplastic techniques are applied to create <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and a clitoral hood. In this procedure, the labiaplasty is usually performed some months after the first stage of vaginoplasty.|$|E
25|$|During sexual {{differentiation}} of females, without testosterone, the urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina. The two urogenital folds (elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to}} the formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle) form the <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{complications}} to a labiaplasty procedure are uncommon, yet occasional complications — bleeding, infection, labial asymmetry, poor wound-healing, undercorrection, overcorrection — do occur, {{and might}} require a revision surgery. An over-aggressive resection might damage the nerves, causing painful neuromas. Performing a flap-technique labiaplasty occasionally presents {{a greater risk}} for necrosis of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> tissues.|$|E
25|$|The vaginal opening is at {{the outer}} end of the vulva, {{posterior}} {{to the opening of}} the urethra, at the posterior end of the vestibule. The opening is closed by the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> in female virgins and in females who have never given birth (nulliparae), but may be exposed in females who have given birth (parous females).|$|E
25|$|Typically, a lesion {{presents}} in {{the form}} of a lump or ulcer on the labia majora and may be associated with itching, irritation, local bleeding or discharge, in addition to pain with urination or pain during sexual intercourse. The <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> clitoris, perineum and mons are less commonly involved. Due to modesty or embarrassment, patients may put off seeing a doctor.|$|E
25|$|In the female, a {{deep groove}} forms around the phallus. The sides of it grow dorsalward as the labioscrotal folds, which {{ultimately}} form the labia majora in females. The <b>labia</b> <b>minora,</b> in contrast, arise by the continued {{growth of the}} lips of the groove on the under surface of the phallus; {{the remainder of the}} phallus forms the clitoral glans.|$|E
25|$|Genital defects {{characteristically}} seen {{in males}} include a micropenis with a normally developed scrotum and testes. Sometimes, testicles may be undescended, or the patient may suffer from hypospadias. Female genital defects may include a reduced size clitoris and underdeveloped <b>labia</b> <b>minora.</b> Infrequently, the labia majora {{may also be}} underdeveloped. Some {{research has shown that}} females may experience vaginal atresia or haematocolpos.|$|E
25|$|Vulvar {{cancer is}} a malignant, {{invasive}} growth in the vulva, or the outer portion of the female genitals. The disease accounts for only 0.6% of cancer diagnoses but 5% of gynecologic cancers in the United States. The labia majora {{are the most common}} site involved representing about 50% of all cases, followed by the <b>labia</b> <b>minora.</b> The clitoris and Bartholin glands may rarely be involved.|$|E
25|$|In females, the {{excitement}} phase can last from several minutes to several hours. The onset of vasocongestion results in {{swelling of the}} woman's clitoris, <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening grows tighter and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating organic liquid. Meanwhile, the breasts increase slightly in size and nipples become hardened and erect.|$|E
25|$|In girls, {{estradiol}} (the primary female sex hormone) causes thickening of {{lips and}} oral mucosa {{as well as}} further development of the vulva. In the vulva and vagina, estradiol causes thickening (stratification) of the skin {{and the growth of}} both the myoepithelial layer and the smooth muscle of the vagina. Typically estradiol will also cause pronounced growth of the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and to a lesser degree of the labia majora.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} under local anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anaesthesia, either as a discrete, single surgery, or in conjunction with another, gynecologic or cosmetic, surgery procedure. The resection proper is facilitated with the administration of an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> to achieve the tumescence (swelling) of the tissues and the constriction of the pertinent labial circulatory system, the hemostasis that limits bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Even after {{differentiation}} {{can be seen}} {{between the}} sexes, some stages are common, e.g. the disappearing of the membrane. On the other hand, sex-dependent development include further protrusion of the genital tubercle in the male to form the glans of the penis and in the female, the clitoral glans. The urogenital fold evolves into the shaft of the penis in males and the <b>Labia</b> <b>minora</b> in females; the labioscrotal swelling evolves into the scrotum in males, and into the Labia majora in females.|$|E
25|$|Female circumcision, as {{it exists}} among the Kikuyu, is an {{operation}} which varies in severity, some sections of the tribe practising a more drastic form than others. It involves the removal of not only the Clitoris, but also the <b>labia</b> <b>minora</b> and half the labia majora, together with the surrounding tissue, resulting in the permanent mutilation affecting the woman's natural functions of maturation, menstruation, and parturition, with disastrous results {{not only to the}} birth rate, but also to the physique and vitality of the tribe.|$|E
