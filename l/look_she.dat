5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this <b>look</b> <b>she</b> utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, the Mystics officially {{announced}} that Lindsay had successfully secured {{a place on}} the Washington Mystics roster and she would be spending the upcoming summer playing on the team. Taylor's selection on the team was considered unusual for a team noted for its average-sized post players and fast-paced style of play and gave the mystics a completely different <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> did not compete in the Mystics Season opener against the Indiana Fever. Her absence was noted in the game as it was the only loss suffered by the Mystics.|$|E
25|$|Soon after touring {{she began}} to record her second album, Fake Chemical State, which was {{released}} for sale on 20 March 2006, preceded by new single Just Let the Sun two weeks earlier. The first single actually issued from this album was Alone in My Room, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. 'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the <b>look</b> <b>she</b> had in her Skunk Anansie days.|$|E
60|$|Nancy (who has a fine appetite) <b>looked</b> pleased. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> pleased, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> nice. When <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> nice, I chuck {{her under}} the chin. It isn't immorality--it's only habit.|$|R

500|$|She {{was a part}} {{of online}} market portal eBay's 2010 [...] "Dream House" [...] challenge, where she {{transformed}} an empty three-room apartment in Bandra into an attractive home with online shopping. She had been provided a budget of [...] and two weeks to create a <b>look</b> <b>she</b> wants with items on sale on the website. On the occasion of Children's Day (14 November), D'Souza auctioned a few items from the apartment. All proceeds received from the auction was given to Aseema, a Non-governmental organization (NGO), which aims to provide education to underprivileged children.|$|E
500|$|That scene, where Andi {{delivers}} the Book, the mockup {{of the magazine}} in progress, to Miranda's apartment, was, according to the Dengels, who played Miranda's twin daughters, totally improvised. [...] "That was just something we did with Anne and it made the cut," [...] Colleen Dengel told BuzzFeed in 2017. Nevertheless, it took three more days of filming to get the shot of the girls up in the stairwell the way Frankel wanted it, a <b>look</b> <b>she</b> believes {{was inspired by a}} similar scene with twin girls in The Shining.|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} first started, people—especially women—thronged {{to see it}} wearing clothes {{inspired}} by Madonna. Debbi Voller, author of Madonna: The Style Book, observed that [...] "Hundreds of thousands of young girls came to the concert dressed like her, with bleached and tousled hair, see-through tops, bras, fingerless gloves and crucifixes. Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions." [...] This frenzy regarding Madonna {{gave rise to a}} new term called Madonna wannabe—a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991. Madonna was mystified as to why all the women would want to copy her <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> commented, ...|$|E
60|$|She stopped exactly {{opposite}} to Valentine; and when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> up, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> on him alone.|$|R
60|$|She heard him. She {{lifted her}} feebly declining head. <b>She</b> <b>looked.</b> <b>She</b> knew.|$|R
60|$|And {{when they}} <b>looked</b> <b>she</b> was neither of them, and yet {{all of them}} at once.|$|R
500|$|As Lear explains, Potter titled The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden {{and sent}} it to publishers, but [...] "her {{manuscript}} was returned... including Frederick Warne & Co.... who nearly a decade earlier had shown some interest in her artwork. Some publishers wanted a shorter book, others a longer one. But most wanted coloured illustrations which by 1900 were both popular and affordable". [...] The several rejections were frustrating to Potter, who knew exactly how her book should <b>look</b> (<b>she</b> had adopted the format and style of Helen Bannerman's Little Black Sambo) [...] "and how much it should cost". She decided to publish the book herself, and on 16 December 1901 the first 250 copies of her privately printed The Tale of Peter Rabbit were [...] "ready for distribution to family and friends".|$|E
500|$|In her autobiography, she {{explained}} that all the people from her own town who {{had been to the}} big cities described them as [...] "marvelous places, where nothing was given but wealth". In 1934, at the age of 15, Eva escaped her poverty-stricken village when, according to popular myth, she ran off with a young musician to the nation's capital of Buenos Aires. The young couple's relationship would end almost as quickly as it began, but Eva remained in Buenos Aires. She began to pursue jobs on the stage and the radio, and eventually became a film actress. Eva had a series of relationships, and via some of these men she did acquire a number of her modeling appointments. She bleached her natural black hair to blond, a <b>look</b> <b>she</b> would maintain for the duration of her life.|$|E
500|$|During production, {{the film}} {{underwent}} two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 65, and prosthetic makeup {{was used for}} her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period {{was that of the}} 65-year-old woman. The actress said, [...] "prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I’m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother’s photos to create her <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character.|$|E
2500|$|This {{illustration}} {{is accompanied}} by the text, [...] "Rosamond did not look hungry or sleepy. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> like <b>she</b> always <b>looks.</b> Strange." [...] The first Emily the Strange design by Cosmic Debris says: [...] "Emily did not look tired or happy. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> like <b>she</b> always <b>looks.</b> Strange." ...|$|R
60|$|Rose <b>looked</b> up, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> pleased. Then <b>she</b> mused in silence, {{for some}} time, when she again spoke.|$|R

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She would sit on the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, or should I say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the <b>look</b> <b>she</b> gave to George when he opened the door, clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Paul, [...] "if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> {{at a man}} {{she says}} haughtily 'Nevermore,' and if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> {{at herself in the}} looking-glass she says disdainfully 'Nevermore,' and if she thinks back she says it in disgust, and if <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> forward <b>she</b> says it cynically." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Joshua, thank you. You see how {{blooming}} {{my mother}} <b>looks.</b> <b>She</b> beats us younger people hollow. But what's the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she could}} not {{understand}} why Gigi, and then the others after him, went off into a shout of laughter. <b>She</b> kept <b>looking</b> round with bright, puzzled eyes. Her face was slightly flushed and tender <b>looking,</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> naïve, young.|$|R
500|$|Following its release, Body Language was {{considered}} to be an example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". During this period, Minogue was often referred to as [...] "Bardot Kylie" [...] due to the Brigitte Bardot-inspired <b>look</b> <b>she</b> sported on the cover, and Body Language was seen as a step forward from the [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern" [...] image she had adopted during the release of Fever. Chris True from AllMusic regarded the album as [...] "another successful attempt [...] at broadening her sound (with electro and hip-hop for instance) and winning more fans". Later in his review of Minogue's tenth studio album X (2007), he remarked that [...] "By the time of 2004's Body Language, Kylie Minogue was seemingly unassailable, with three hit albums, a number of hit singles, and a recharged career that only a few years before had seemed precarious at best". In 2006, Larissa Dubecki from The Age commented that [...] "Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities, from the [...] "singing budgie" [...] who emerged from Neighbours to score her first hit single with a cover of the Little Eva classic [...] "Locomotion" [...] in 1987, to the 1960s ingenue of her most recent album, 2003's Body Language". She used the title [...] "Eurotrash princess" [...] to describe Minogue during this period.|$|E
500|$|Three months later, Meg {{returns home}} with the mind and {{attitude}} of a hardened criminal, complete with a new thuggish and rebellious <b>look.</b> <b>She</b> immediately begins abusing her family, retaliating to the many years of abuse she had endured under them, such as curb-stomping Peter, raping him in the shower with a loofah, and using her mother's shirts as toilet paper (while also keeping a [...] "poop bucket" [...] next to her bed and refusing to empty it until it gets full). In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make fun of her at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended. Wanting {{to start a new life}} away from home, Meg ambushes Brian in his car and threatens him with a gun to drive to Mort's Pharmacy so she can rob him. Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E
500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To Bring You My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a <b>look</b> <b>she</b> affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To Bring You My Love tour.|$|E
6000|$|To all {{comparative}} strangers who, unconscious of the {{alterations in}} her spirits, {{commented on the}} alteration in her <b>looks,</b> <b>she</b> had one reply,-- ...|$|R

2500|$|The role of Ophelia in the 1964 Grigori Kozintsev film Hamlet (starring Innokentiy Smoktunovsky) made Vertinskaya known internationally {{and proved}} to be a turning point in her career. As Kozintsev later wrote, Vertinskaya's {{strength}} was her [...] "fragile purity and this Renaissance <b>look</b> <b>she</b> had." [...] For the young actress working next to masters like Smoktunovsky {{proved to be}} invaluable in terms of learning, introducing the young actress to many of what she called [...] "this magic kitchen's secrets." [...] "Ophelia made me realize {{for the first time that}} acting was indeed my destiny," [...] she later said.|$|E
2500|$|The artwork for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was {{released}} by Rihanna's official Facebook page on September 22, 2011. Grady Smith of Entertainment Weeklys The Music Mix criticized the song's artwork, writing [...] "'We found love in a hopeless place,' Rihanna repeats over a David Guetta-ish synth beat. But judging by the single cover, her place doesn't look too hopeless, does it? Maybe there's a building on fire outside the frame, and that fire hydrant doesn't work. I guess that would be hopeless." [...] A reviewer for Sugar Magazine wrote that [...] "On anyone else {{this would be a}} pretty odd look but Rihanna somehow makes a denim overload look good." [...] A reviewer for Neon Limelight commented that Rihanna appeared to be adopting a tomboy image for the new project, writing, [...] "She really is going for that sexy tomboy look this album era it seems; remember the laid back <b>look</b> <b>she</b> rocked on the single's cover art?".|$|E
2500|$|Margaret {{was finally}} called on Thursday {{afternoon}} and she arrived the next morning. [...] However, Lukwiya's colleagues were strict in the protocols. [...] While {{she was forced}} to sit on a stool three feet away from his bed, she was eventually allowed to hold his foot through three layers of glove. [...] On Sunday, his breathing had become so laboured that he was put on a respirator. [...] By early Monday evening the oxygen level of his blood was rising and his pulse was near normal. [...] It appeared that he might pull through but later that evening Lukwiya's lungs began haemorrhaging, a worst-case scenario. [...] Lukwiya died at 1:20 am on Tuesday, 5 December 2000. [...] When Margaret was informed and came to the ward, the body had already been put into a polyethylene bag. [...] When she asked if they could unzip it a little so she could have a last <b>look,</b> <b>she</b> was refused; the body was too infectious to take any risks.|$|E
5000|$|We used still {{pictures}} and [...] "hold frames," [...] {{and a lot}} of the stuff they think is so new today. If we wanted to show a guy making a successful play for a girl, we would use four still pictures: he <b>looking,</b> <b>she</b> <b>looking,</b> he winking, <b>she</b> winking, hold frame. It was almost a comic-strip technique and hadn't been used on television.|$|R
