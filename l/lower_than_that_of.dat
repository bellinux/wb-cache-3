5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} three {{different}} European populations showed a mean clutch size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected between males and females. Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> adults. The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{design of}} a {{coplanar}} waveguide (CPW) fed rectangular-ring-slot antenna with a back-patch is presented. This design is achieved by introducing a protruded tuning-stub and a back-patch to a conventional CPW-fed rectangular-ring-slot antenna. Prototypes of the design are implemented. Experimental {{results show that the}} resonant frequency of the proposed antenna is greatly <b>lowered</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a CPW-fed conventional rectangular-ring-slot antenna.

5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> iodine (2.66) {{and the same}} as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted {{to be on the}} hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is {{not strong enough to}} oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance.
