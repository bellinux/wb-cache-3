Measured angles of rotation agreed with corresponding calculated values in which the torsion bending factor of the cross section was involved; the agreement was better for the I-beam and the Z-bar than for the channel. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> measured at the mid-span were found {{to agree with the}} calculated values that involved unit warping as well as the torsion-bending factors: the channel showed the greatest discrepancy between measured and calculated values.

40|$|Reactor {{pressure}} vessels are internally clad with austenitic stainless steel. This welding operation generates residual stresses which {{can have an}} important role in integrity assessments. In order to evaluate these stresses, an experimental and numerical programme has been conducted. The experiments includes cladding operations, macrographic analyses, temperature and residual stresses measurements with different methods. According to these measurements, transversal stresses (perpendicular to the welding direction) and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> (parallel to the welding direction) are highly tensile in stainless steel and they are compressive in the HAZ. Finite element calculations were used to simulate both welding operations and post weld heat treatment. These calculations coupled the thermal, metallurgical and mechanical aspects in a 2 D representation. Different models were studied including effect of generalised plane strain, transformation plasticity, creep and tempering. The transversal stresses calculated are similar to the measured ones, but the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> showed to be very sensitive to the model used. As expected because of the two-dimension model, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> can't be well estimated. More work is needed to improve measurements of stresses in depth (important differences appeared between the different methods). A predictive model would be also very useful to determine the thermal loading which is at present dependant on measurements. A 3 D calculation appears to be necessary to evaluate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R
50|$|Sir William Fairbairn (1789-1874) {{was one of}} {{the most}} mathematically {{inclined}} of the Victorian mechanical engineers. Assisted by his mathematical analyst Eaton Hodgkinson, he conducted the first theoretical analysis of the stress in cylinders.

50|$|The {{stationary}} {{steam engines}} used to power machinery {{first came to}} prominence during the industrial revolution, {{and in the early}} days there were many boiler explosions from a variety of causes. One of the first investigators of the problem was William Fairbairn, who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the hoop stress in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress.</b> Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of stress concentrations in weakening boilers.|$|E
50|$|In {{continuum}} mechanics, lateral strain, {{also known}} as transverse strain, {{is defined as the}} ratio of the change in diameter of a circular bar of a material due to deformation in the longitudinal direction. It occurs when under the action of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress,</b> a body will extend {{in the direction of the}} stress and contract in the transverse or lateral direction (in the case of tensile stress). When put under compression, the body will contract in the direction of the stress and extend in the transverse or lateral direction. It is a dimensionless quantity, as it is a ratio between two quantities of the same dimension.|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{improving}} the ice physics inderpinning time-dependent glacier flowline models, three independent approaches for solving <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> in glaciers are discussed and verified by application to Haut Glacier'Aro la. To highlight any shortcomings, the reduced and much utili ed driving stress approximation is also applied and compared. Modelled velocity patterns using the three full stress schemes exhibit consistency {{with one another and}} good coincidence with observed velocities for the 1991 summer melt season. Furthermore, these stress patterns indicate that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> are significant and of a similar order of magnitude as the basal shear stress components. However, the driving stress approximation yields erratic fluctuations in the stress and velocity fields which are neither realistic in terms of mass continuity nor agree with observations. Basal decoupling experiments indicate a complex relationship between basal velocity and englacial stresses with considerable dampening of any basal perturbation occuring as it is dissipated towards the surface and transferred throughout the ice mass. The driving stress approximation fails to account at all for any such coupling. Experiments to identify the length scale over which longitudinal effects operate indicate that they are significant even up to 10 ice thicknesses. The implication here is that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> {{play a significant role in}} determining glacier dynamics on length scales up to at least 2 km and that the predictive power of models of glacier flow based purely on the driving stress approximation is therefore subject to significant limitations. Inclusion of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses</b> overcomes one of the main limitations mposed on such models and, given the potential ease of incorporation of the schemes described here, this deficiency may readily be resolved.

It is known as the hoop stress and is twice the value of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress</b> which occurs {{along the length of the}} cylinder. The precise value depends only on the wall thickness and the internal pressure. His work was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society and was of great help in analysing failures in steam boilers and pipes. In 1854 he founded the Manchester Steam Users' Association, which quickly became recognised as setting national standards for high-pressure steam boilers.

Fairbairn realised that the hoop stress was twice the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress,</b> an important factor in the assembly of boiler shells from rolled sheets joined by riveting. Later work was applied to bridge building, and the invention of the box girder. In the Chepstow Railway Bridge, the cast iron pillars are strengthened by external bands of wrought iron. The vertical, longitudinal force is a compressive force, which cast iron is well able to resist. The hoop stress is tensile and so wrought iron, a material with better tensile strength than cast iron, is added.|$|E

A common surgical procedure to repair a torn nerve via the epineurium is termed an epineurial repair.|$|E
40|$|A two-material {{composite}} cylinder model (CCM) {{was considered}} {{for the study of}} the mechanical behavior at different temperatures of a fiber-reinforced silicon carbide/aluminum (SiC/Al) composite. An elastoplastic analysis of the model was performed in which the fiber was assumed to be linear elastic and the matrix elastoplastic with work-hardening. The analysis was based on the deformation theory of plasticity in conjunction with the von-Mises yield criterion. Experimental stress-strain curves of an SiC/Al composite were obtained at 24 and 288 C (75 and 550 F). The complete three-dimensional stress distribution in the composite using the CCM was determined. It was found that, in addition to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stresses,</b> transverse stresses in both the fiber and the matrix were developed as a result of the different Poisson's ratios of the two materials.

50|$|Laser induced {{spallation}} is {{a recent}} experimental technique developed to understand the adhesion of thin films with substrates. A high energy pulsed laser (typically Nd:YAG) is {{used to create a}} compressive stress pulse in the substrate wherein it propagates and reflects as a tensile wave at the free boundary. This tensile pulse spalls/peels the thin film while propagating towards the substrate. Using theory of wave propagation in solids it is possible to extract the interface strength. The stress pulse created in this fashion is usually around 3-8 nanoseconds in duration while its magnitude varies as a function of laser fluence. Due to the non-contact application of load, this technique is very well suited to spall ultra-thin films (1 micrometre in thickness or less). It is also possible to mode convert a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress</b> wave into a shear stress using a pulse shaping prism and achieve shear spallation.|$|E
5000|$|To achieve optimal loading in a {{straight}} rubber hose the fibres must be positioned under an angle of approximately 54.7 angular degrees, {{also referred to as}} the magic angle. The magic angle of 54.7 exactly balances the internal-pressure-induced <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress</b> and the hoop (circumferential) stress, as observed in most biological pressurized fiber-wound cylinders, like arteries. If the fiber angle is initially above or below 54.7, it will change under increased internal pressure until it rises to the magic angle where hoop stresses and longitudinal stresses equalize, with concomitant accommodations in hose diameter and hose length. A hose with an initially low fiber angle will rise under pressure to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter increase and a length decrease, whereas a hose with an initially high fiber angle will drop to 54.7, inducing a hose diameter decrease and a length increase. The equilibrium state is a fiber angle of 54.7. In this situation the fibres tend to be loaded purely in tension, so ~100% of their strength resists the forces acting on the hose due to the internal pressure. (The magic angle for cylindrical shapes of 54.7 angular degrees is based on calculations in which the influence of the matrix material is neglected. Therefore, depending on the stiffness of the rubber material used, the actual equilibrium angle can vary a few tenths of degrees from the magic angle.) ...|$|E

This paper presents fundamental dynamic data for two examples of bainitic steels. Hugoniots and shear-strength variation with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress</b> is reported. These were similar for both materials and in agreement with values for mild steel. The ferrite in the lower-temperature bainite was found to undergo a shock-induced phase transition at 13 GPa, whereas no phase transition was observed in the upper bainite. Further research is being conducted to account for this difference by studying the microstructure and the effect of impact on it. The lower-temperature bainite was found to behave in a brittle fashion, fragmenting extremely, whereas upper bainitic samples were usually recovered intact indicating ductile behaviour. The dynamic tensile or spall strength was also measured in these materials over a range of impact conditions. For the upper bainite, the spall strength dropped slightly with increasing <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress.</b> However, for the lower-temperature bainite, there was a significant drop in spall strength above the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>stress</b> at which the phase transition occurs.
