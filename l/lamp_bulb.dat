25|$|In 1924, Marvin Pipkin, an American chemist, {{patented}} {{a process}} for frosting the inside of <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> without weakening them, and in 1947, he patented {{a process for}} coating the inside of lamps with silica.|$|R
50|$|Two {{systems are}} {{described}} below - plasma lamps, which use electrostatic induction to energize a bulb filled with sulfur vapor or metal halides, and fluorescent induction lamps, {{based upon a}} conventional fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> in which current is induced by an external coil of wire via electrodynamic induction.|$|E
5000|$|The LED {{filament}} {{style of}} lamp combines many relatively low-power LEDs on a transparent glass substrate, coated with phosphor, and then encapsulated in silicone. The <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> {{is filled with}} inert gas, which convects heat away from the extended array of LEDs to the envelope of the bulb. This design avoids the requirement for a large heat sink.|$|E
5000|$|According to Contreras, the {{incandescent}} <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> {{case against}} General Electric was notable {{not only because}} it required dedication of GE's vast aggregation of lamp patents—"arsenal of a huge body of patents"—but also because the court held that “it is advisable to require the defendants to license whatever machinery patents they have without possessing the correlative right to demand licenses in return." ...|$|E
50|$|The Edison and Swan Electric Light Company Limited was an English {{manufacturer}} of incandescent <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> and other electrical goods. It {{was formed in}} 1883 with the name Edison & Swan United Electric Light Company with the merger of the Swan United Electric Company and the Edison Electric Light Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{addition}} of other {{chemicals in the}} bulb might improve color rendition. Sulfur <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> with calcium bromide (CaBr2) added produce a similar spectrum plus a spike in red wavelengths at 625 nm. [...] Other additives such as lithium iodide (LiI) and sodium iodide (NaI) {{can be used to}} modify the output spectra.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> with dual (carbon) {{filaments}} {{were built}} {{as early as}} 1902 to allow adjustable lighting levels. Large lamps of 500-watt rating were used for street lighting in France, which had a second filament at 200 watts to reduce lighting costs. In 1933 in the United States, Westinghouse announced a dual-filament lamp for commercial lighting and a smaller lamp for residential use.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 Pipkin {{developed}} {{a process for}} etching {{the inside of a}} <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> with acid, using a two-step process so that the lamp would not be excessively weakened. He obtained a patent for this invention, which was assigned to General Electric, but in a later suit for infringement, the patent was held invalid by the United States Supreme Court. In 1947 a silica coating process also invented by Pipkin replaced the etching.|$|E
5000|$|The Note {{then turned}} to the (at the time) recent {{decision}} in United States v. General Elec. Co., in which the government had challenged GE under the antitrust laws for regimenting the incandescent <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> industry. GE had used restrictive patent licensing practices that gave GE and its licensees an [...] "almost impregnable front" [...] against competition. The district court entered a decree enjoining the defendants from the restrictive practices and requiring dedication of all existing patents on lamps, and GE then dedicated 177 existing patents and 38 pending patent applications.|$|E
50|$|The GH6 version {{produced}} a rated output of 6 V, 0.33 A (2 W) from a 20-pole ring magnet with a stator having a continuous winding. Original headlamp bulbs are 6 V, 0.25 A (1.5 W) (e.g., CRY5) and a rear bulb of 6 V 0.04A (0.24W) (e.g., CRY8). This {{is different from}} a modern standard bicycle dynamo, though replacements can still be had. Common substitutions are the modern standard 2.4 W headlamp bulb and a tail <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> of 0.6 W. One rider reports much more light with a 6.3 V, 0.25 A (1.6 W) type 40 bulb.|$|E

50|$|The {{first plasma}} lamp was an {{ultraviolet}} curing <b>lamp</b> with a <b>bulb</b> filled with argon and mercury vapor developed by Fusion UV. That lamp led Fusion Systems {{to the development}} of the sulfur <b>lamp,</b> a <b>bulb</b> filled with argon and sulfur which is bombarded with microwaves through a hollow waveguide.|$|R
50|$|To reduce unintentional {{ultraviolet}} (UV) exposure, and {{to contain}} hot bulb fragments {{in the event}} of explosive <b>bulb</b> failure, general-purpose <b>lamps</b> usually have a UV-absorbing glass filter over or around the <b>bulb.</b> Alternatively, <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> may be doped or coated to filter out the UV radiation. With adequate filtering, a halogen lamp exposes users to less UV than a standard incandescent lamp producing the same effective level of illumination without filtering.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Swan had {{established}} the Swan United Electric Light Company {{in the early}} 1880s to market the incandescent <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> he had invented. In 1882 the British Edison Company of Thomas Edison sued Swan, claiming infringement of Edison's U.S. patent of 1879; however, the lawyers became aware that Swan would be able demonstrate prior research and publication, and instead negotiated a merger with Swan's company. The lamp bulbs manufactured by the company were almost entirely to Swan's design. From 1887 or earlier Sir Ambrose Fleming was {{an adviser to the}} company, and conducted research at Ponders End.|$|E
50|$|Poul Henningsen, a self-taught {{inventor}} {{and true}} Functionalist, {{was an important}} participant in the Danish Modern school, not for furniture but for lighting design. His attempt to prevent the blinding glare from the electric <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> succeeded in 1926 with a three-shade lamp, known as the PH lamp. The curvature of the shades allowed his hanging lamp to illuminate both {{the table and the}} rest of the room. He went on to design many similar lamps, some with frosted glass, including desk lamps, chandeliers and wall-mounted fixtures. Though he died in 1967, many of his designs have remained popular to this day.|$|E
50|$|The lamp {{possesses}} {{a number of}} peculiar features which it is claimed give to it certain elements of superiority above all others. The filament is square cut by means of automatic machinery from sheets of material produced by a secret chemical process. The cut filament, after being formed, is attached to platinum terminals which are sealed into the sides {{at the lower end}} of the <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb.</b> The filament is of such high resistance that in the Shelby lamps it is shorter than that of most other commercial lamps of equal rating. The bulb is not exhausted from the top, which in connection with the exceedingly small filament used makes the completed lamp one of the smallest, also one of the neatest, lamps on the market.|$|E

The performance of PV panel depends on the environmental factors, which is solar radiation and operating temperature. These environmental factors will be reduced the electrical efficiency of PV panel due to increase in operating temperature of PV panel. The solar simulator is set up on a steel frame is used to lift all the halogen <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The halogen <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> act as a natural sunlight. Four sets of average solar radiation at the test surface of the solar simulator are measured as 413, 620, 821 and 1016 W/m 2. A DC water pump is used to overcome the problem of low efficiency of PV panel with water flow over the front surface of PV panel. This water cooling mechanism is one way to enhance the efficiency of PV panel for maintaining a low operating temperature during its operation period. The experimental results mentioned that the decrement of operating temperature and increase the power output of the PV panel with water cooling mechanism based on different fixed of solar radiation. The water spraying can be reduced heat on the front surface of the PV panel...|$|R

40|$|Heliodons {{have been}} {{developed}} to simulate the position of the sun in relation to a building model. Early heliodons (Dufton and Beckett 1931 : 509) simulated the position of the sun with a movable <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb,</b> impinging light onto a building model which had to be titled and rotated to simulate the required latitude and time. Later heliodons (Olgyay and Olgyay 1957 : 22 - 22; Phillips 1987) improved on operation convenience, allowing the building model to be placed horizontally, and stationary once the latitude is set. Other practitioners (Robbins 1986) examined annual insulation/shading on massing models by putting red, green, blue lamps (i. e. dichromatic lamps) respectively at June, September/ March, December locations of the lamp holder on the D & F heliodon (Dufton and Beckett 1931), thus improving its capability. Aiming at combining the convenience ofplacing physical building models horizontally and stationary, and putting up dichromatic lamps if required, a heliodon has been developed.

40|$|Neste projeto investigou-se o uso de três técnicas: (i) eletrólise, (ii) fotoeletrocatálise e (iii) fotólise, na degradação do hormônio {{estradiol}}, comumente encontrado nos esgotos domésticos, e que geram sérias preocupações com a ação nefasta que podem provocar na vida selvagem e humana. 	Os ensaios eletroquímicos foram realizados sobre eletrodos de platina e carbono vítreo. A técnica de fotoeletrocatálise foi aplicada empregando-se placas de titânio recobertas com nanocamadas de TiO 2. Como fonte de radiação ultravioleta utilizou-se uma lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio de 125 W tanto na fotoeletrocatálise como na fotólise. Através dos estudos da oxidação do estradiol por voltametria cíclica, sobre os eletrodos acima mencionados, foi possível definir o seu potencial de oxidação em soluções de KCl e tampão fosfato (pH 7), sobre platina e carbono vítreo. Estes parâmetros serviram de base para a realização das eletrólises sob condições controladas. A fotoeletrocatálise do estradiol foi realizada sobre Ti/TiO 2 preparado por técnica sol-gel e se mostrou muito mais efetiva que a eletrólise eletrolítica. Finalmente, a fotólise também foi testada empregando-se apenas a lâmpada de vapor de mercúrio. Neste último caso a degradação do estradiol foi ligeiramente inferior que aquela observada por fotoeletrocatálise. Identificou-se que em soluções de KCl há a formação de hipoclorito, o que auxilia o processo oxidativo do estradiol. Espectroscopia de UV-vís e cromatografia líquida (HPLC) foram empregadas para acompanhar os processos de degradação. Apesar de ter sido observado o surgimento de bandas e picos cromatográficos devidos aos produtos formados, não foi possível identifica-los. In {{this project}} {{the use of}} three techniques was investigated: (i) electrolysis, (ii) photoelectrocatalysis and (iii) photolysis, in the degradation of the hormone estradiol, commonly found in the domestic sewers. This hormone can generate serious concerns with a disastrous action that can provoke in the wild and human life. The electrochemistry studies were accomplished on platinum and glassy carbon electrodes. The photoelectrocatalysis technique was applied using titanium plate covered with nanolayers of TiO 2. As a source of ultra-violet radiation was used a <b>lamp</b> <b>bulb</b> of mercury vapor of 125 W for the photoelectrocatalysis as also in the photolysis. Through the studies of the oxidation of the estradiol by cyclic voltammetry, on the electrodes above mentioned, {{it was possible to}} define the oxidation potential of the organic specie in both solutions, KCl and phosphate buffers (pH 7), for platinum and glassy carbon. These parameters served as base for the realization of the electrolysis under controlled conditions. The photoelectrocatalysis of the estradiol was accomplished on Ti/TiO 2 prepared by sol-gel technique and it was shown much more effective than the electrolyitc electrolysis. Finally, the photolysis was also tested being just used the mercury vapor lamp. In this last case the degradation of the estradiol was lightly inferior to that observed by photoelectrocatalysis It was identified that in solutions of KCl there is the hypochlorite formation, what aids the oxidation of the estradiol. Spectroscopy of UV-vis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to accompany the degradation processes. In spite of the appearance of bands and chromatographyc peaks owed to the formed products having been observed, however, it were not possible identify them...|$|E
5000|$|A 3-way lamp, {{also known}} as a tri-light, is a lamp that uses a 3-way light bulb to produce three levels of light in a low-medium-high configuration. A 3-way lamp {{requires}} a 3-way bulb and socket, and a 3-way switch. Unlike an incandescent lamp controlled by a dimmer, each of the filaments operates at full voltage, so the color of the light does not change between the three steps of light available. Certain compact fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>bulbs</b> are designed to replace 3-way incandescent bulbs, and have an extra contact and circuitry to bring about similar light level.
