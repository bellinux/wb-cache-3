5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century {{it seems that}} a middle ground between the mother and sister culture {{positions}} may be emerging. Pool (2007) thus concludes that while San Lorenzo emerged early as the largest the most developed polity of Mesoamerica and the earliest evidence {{of several of the}} defining traits of Mesoamerican culture is found there, the Olmecs emerge looking less <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> culture than as a promiscuous father culture spawning offspring generously with many different mothercultures all over mesoamerica. This formulation emphasises the viewpoint that influence from the Olmec heartland merged with many local traditions creating local expressions with both Olmec and non-Olmec roots. it follows from this approach that the type and degree of Olmec influence varies greatly from location to location within Mesoamerica.|$|E
25|$|When Harry {{arrives at}} the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's {{experimentation}} with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that something might have happened to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, {{for the first time}} in his life, he has someone to be there for him, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{enormous}} labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire — who normally approved his partner's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals — saw the dress {{for the first time}} on the day of the shoot, and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: [...] "It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, I never saw so many feathers in my life." [...] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, [...] "came charging at him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> rhinoceros protecting her young." ...|$|E

Kylie was initially described as having a [...] "full on" [...] personality, similar to Becky. When she arrives, she ruins her and Steve's plans for adoption. She and Kylie brawl violently over the incident; Lane received bruising from filming the scenes. They were so violent that they were toned down before transmission. Kelly described Kylie and Becky as having a love-hate relationship with her, but at the time she [...] "wants to kill her".

In the movie BATMAN, everything is dark. Dark background and dark characters. However, {{in the case of}} Honey-chan, she’s super cheerful and sunny. She really stands out due to the dark background." [...] He believed that New Cutie Honey differed from other anime that focus on settings and characters' expositions, and that Honey instead [...] "makes her own moves, and she carries the whole story". On the relative weakness of male characters in the series, he said, [...] "Honey-chan is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother,</b> and she loves to protect weak men.

500|$|Upon her introduction, Kylie was {{described}} as being a big character in her {{first six months of}} storylines. When she arrives she ruins Becky and Steve McDonald's (Simon Gregson) plans for adoption. Kylie and Becky violently clash over the incident, and Lane received bruising from filming the scenes. The scenes were so violent that they were toned down before transmission. Lane said that the fight was her favourite set of scenes for Kylie. Kelly described Kylie and Becky as having a love-hate relationship, but at the time Becky [...] "wants to kill her".

500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of her}} time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more {{inflexible}} battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's [...] "dutiful son", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to [...] "share her son like a normal mother", commenting, [...] "she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> tiger with her cub." ...|$|E
500|$|Cortese {{believed}} that Ruby {{fell in love}} with Sam {{over the course of the}} season, though she questioned whether this was [...] "true love" [...] or her being [...] "in love with what he can do".

Sam's all , so it's almost like giving birth, in a weird, messed-up way." [...] She stated that the sex scene between her character and Sam was [...] "about two people who are so broken and sad" [...] and compared it to similar sex scenes from the film Monster's Ball. Although Ruby eventually reveals herself as a traitor, Kripke wrote her final scene with the intention of depicting Ruby as [...] "the opposite of evil" [...] and to show that Ruby does care about Sam, despite her manipulation of him to free Lucifer; Kripke explained that, in Ruby's mind, she had to lead Sam down that path because [...] "it was for his own good".|$|E
60|$|Though so young, she infused {{in these}} parting words {{a love that}} was far more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother's</b> than <b>a</b> sister's, and before which the boy was quite bowed down.

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{difference of opinion}} amongst commentators regarding the complicated personality of Noriko.

Even the common belief of film scholars that she is an upholder of conservative values, because of her opposition to her father’s (feigned) remarriage plans, has been challenged. Robin Wood, writing about the three Norikos as one collective character, states that [...] "Noriko" [...] "has managed to retain and develop the finest humane values which the modern capitalist world… tramples underfoot—consideration, emotional generosity, the ability to care and empathize, and above all, awareness." ...|$|E
