5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E

5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other bumblebees, and have <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, {{such as that of}} the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive.|$|E
40|$|To further {{elucidate}} the biosynthesis of lipids in flor strains under fermentative conditions, the transcription {{levels of the}} lipid biosynthetic genes ACS 1, ACS 2, ACC 1, OLE 1, ERG 1, ERG 11, ARE 1 and ARE 2, {{as well as the}} lipid composition and cell viability of a flor strain were compared with that of a non-flor strain during hypoxic and aerobic fermentations in the absence of lipid nutrients. While no significant differences in transcription levels or lipid compositions were observed between the two strains when oxygen was not limiting, significant differences were seen during hypoxic fermentation. In this last condition, the flor strain, in spite of higher levels of transcription of hypoxic genes, <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> desaturate fatty acids and complete ergosterol biosynthesis, and showed a dramatic loss of viability. In contrast, the non-flor strain, which showed lower transcription levels, was able to reach a balanced lipid composition and maintained a higher cell viability. One possible explanation is that the flor strain requires a higher amount of oxygen than the non-flor strain in order to carry out the oxygen-dependent steps of lipid biosynthesis under fermentative conditions...|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E

It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right.

40|$|Recently, we {{have shown}} that the rabies virus (RV) matrix (M) protein regulates the balance of virus RNA {{synthesis}} by shifting synthesis activity from transcription to replication (S. Finke, R. Mueller-Waldeck, and K. K. Conzelmann, J. Gen. Virol. 84 : 1613 - 1621, 2003). Here we describe the identification of an M residue critical for regulation of RV RNA synthesis. By analyzing the phenotype of heterotypic RV M proteins with respect to RNA synthesis of RV SAD L 16, we identified the M proteins of the RV ERA and PV strains as deficient. Comparison of M sequences suggested that a single residue, arginine 58, was critical. A recombinant virus having this amino acid exchanged with a glycine, SAD M(R 58 G), has <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> downregulate RV transcription and to stimulate replication. This resulted in an increase in the transcription rate of more than 15 -fold, as previously observed for M deletion mutants. Most importantly, the efficiencies of virus assembly and budding were equal for wild-type M and M(R 58 G), as determined in assays studying the transient complementation of an M- and G-deficient RV construct, NPgrL. In addition, virus particle density, protein composition, and specific infectivity of SAD L 16 and SAD M(R 58 G) viruses were identical. Thus, we have identified mutations that affect the function of M only in regulation of RNA synthesis, but not in assembly and budding, providing evidence that these functions are genetically separable...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{regulation}} of uncoupling protein is mediated by purine nucleotides, which bind to the protein and allosterically inhibit fatty acid-induced proton transport.

We studied nucleotide binding as well as inhibition of fatty acid-induced proton transport in wild-type and six mutant uncoupling proteins. None of the mutations interfered with proton transport.

5|$|The Chiroptera {{as a whole}} are in {{the process}} of losing the ability to {{synthesize}} vitamin C: most have lost it completely.

5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce urea and used ammonia only, {{they would have to}} evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo <b>lost</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} human CRM 1 (hCRM 1) (exportin 1) in the function of Rex protein encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. hCRM 1 promoted the export of Rex protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities.

The attack was intended to push forward the left flank of the Fifth Army, to guard against a German counter-attack on the flank of the Canadian Corps, when it attacked Passchendaele. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed.
