5|$|The first U.S. Marine {{operation}} against Japanese forces {{west of the}} Matanikau, conducted between 23 September and 27 September 1942 by {{elements of}} three U.S. Marine battalions, was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Colonel Akinosuke Oka's <b>local</b> <b>command.</b> In the second action, between 6 October and 9 October, a larger force of U.S. Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd (Sendai) Infantry Division {{under the command of}} generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment. The second action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau.|$|E
5|$|Lafontaine had hesitated {{over the}} 24 hours since the {{afternoon}} of 13 May. He spent hours reconnoitring the terrain, sometimes trying to contain and reason with fleeing, routing scores of French infantrymen and artillerymen of the 55th and 71st Infantry Divisions, and travelling around the area to various regimental headquarters, looking for his Corps commander, General Gransard (whom was deliberately reconnoitring the terrain, for some time, at that relative point in time), for an order to attack, and, in the meantime, extemporarily assessing and conferring with some <b>local</b> <b>command</b> personnel. Owing to this Lafontaine also delayed issuing orders to the tactical attack units until 05:00 on 14 May, by which time the Germans had consolidated their bridgehead and the Panzer divisions' combined arms infantry teams were already advancing inland to Bulson. Lafontaine had had a mission plan since 20:00 on 13 May to defeat the Germans and retake the Meuse bridgeheads, but he waited for an order to proceed. Lafontaine's need for an order was contrary to the unit actions of the Germans, who operated the tactically more efficient Auftragstaktik (Mission Command) system. Ultimately, Lafontaine had squandered valuable hours essential for a prompt, perhaps opportune and timely, perhaps potentially decisive counter-attack effort.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1941, {{control of}} the harbor {{security}} forces was gradually switched to new units known as Sicherungs-Divisionen (Security Division). These units grouped all minesweepers, patrol boats, and submarine chasers into combined <b>local</b> <b>commands</b> which answered to the senior security commander for a given geographical region. By 1944, there were eleven security divisions established {{in order to control}} security within German Navy ports and harbors.|$|R
25|$|While {{the exact}} {{implementation}} varied with {{the stage of}} the war and <b>local</b> <b>command</b> variations, the basic model was to combine a Marine squad with local forces to form a village defense platoon. It was effective in denying the enemy a sanctuary at the local village level. The pacification campaign seemed to work under the CAP concept, and the Marines fully embraced it. Objectively, there is no solid proof that the CAP concept was a resounding success; however, subjectively the evidence suggests otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip {{were under}} the <b>local</b> <b>command</b> of Brigadier General Johnson K. Duncan. The average quality of the {{soldiers}} in the garrison was probably {{not as high as}} Lovell and Duncan would have liked; the most militant had been drawn off for other fields, leaving the irresolute and the unfit. Because New Orleans was something of an international city, the ranks contained a greater proportion of foreign-born soldiers than most units of the Confederate Army. Nevertheless, they could be expected to perform their duty, even if they would not make extraordinary exertions.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of New Bern {{was no more}} obvious to Burnside {{than it was to}} the Confederate authorities in Richmond, but they did little to secure it. Although more than a month passed after Roanoke Island fell before Burnside could mount an attack on the city, the <b>local</b> <b>command</b> received no reinforcements. One of General Branch's aides estimated that the lines would need at least 6,130 men to hold them, but he had only about 4,000 at his disposal, a number often reduced by sickness. Furthermore, many of the men were poorly armed militiamen. The disparity between necessity and reality persuaded Branch to draw his lines in, abandoning some of the strong breastworks erected by his predecessor. The principal defense would be the line based on Fort Thompson.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To meet urgent needs, DOD can issue undefinitized contract actions (UCA), which authorize contractors to begin work before reaching a final agreement on contract terms. Such actions {{are considered to be}} a risky contract vehicle for the government because contractors lack incentives to control costs during this period. Defense regulations provide that the government determination of contractors' allowable profit or fee should reflect any reduced cost risk. Pursuant to the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, GAO assessed whether DOD actions taken as required by the act have (1) improved departmental insight and oversight of UCA use and (2) resulted in <b>local</b> <b>commands</b> meeting DOD's standards for documenting the basis for negotiating the contractor profit or fee, definitization timelines, and obligation amounts. GAO reviewed relevant DOD regulations and policies, and contract files for 83 randomly-selected UCAs totaling $ 6. 1 billion at eight <b>local</b> <b>commands.</b> The findings from this contract file review can not be generalized across DOD. ...|$|R
25|$|Typically, the ACU is {{worn with}} the Advanced Combat Helmet, a patrol cap, or a boonie hat and/or fleece cap as {{appropriate}} in winter months. The patrol cap is a kepi-styled straight-sided, flat-topped soft cap, {{with a double}} thick bill and internal pocket. When in garrison, the maroon, tan, and green berets may be worn by paratroopers, Army Rangers, and Army Special Forces respectively. The green micro fleece cap is authorized for field and garrison use outside of unit PT, per <b>local</b> <b>command.</b> A name tape is worn {{on the back of}} the patrol cap. Sew-on rank is recommended but pin-on rank is authorized on the ACU Patrol Cap and ACU Boonie Hat. The MICH (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet) Camouflage cover rank must be sewn on if worn but is often not used as the night vision device mount would obstruct it.|$|E
25|$|Kalimnos {{had fallen}} to the Germans on 7 September, and three days later the {{batteries}} of Leros had started firing on that island. This continuous firing, along with the constant air strikes, wore the guns, and seriously depleted the ammunition reserves; the <b>local</b> <b>command</b> asked for more ammunitions, and the destroyer Artigliere and Velite were sent from Taranto, but most of their cargo of ammunition was unloaded during their stop in Alexandria, so only a minimal part of them was eventually delivered to Leros. In {{the last part of}} October, Italian and British submarines made several supply runs to Leros: HMS Rorqual (three), HMS Severn (three), the Italian submarines Zoea (two), Atropo (one), Filippo Corridoni (one) and Ciro Menotti (one); overall, the submarines brought to Leros 17 men, 225 tons of supplies, twelve 40mm Bofors guns, and one jeep. Aircraft were also used for transport of supplies. Despite all efforts, ammunitions were still scarce, whereas food and medicines would last for many months.|$|E
25|$|Since the Army {{was officially}} {{responsible}} {{for the security of}} the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together {{near the center of the}} airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the <b>local</b> <b>command</b> and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority.|$|E

500|$|On 17 October, Himmler {{met with}} Meyszner at Kraljevo while {{inspecting}} {{the newly created}} 7th SS Division. While mildly rebuking Meyszner and warning him that if such behaviour recurred, Himmler would have to dismiss him, Himmler {{was impressed with the}} new division. According to Moll, an important factor in Himmler's final decision was undoubtedly the fact that the dismissal of Turner, part of the Wehrmacht command structure, would be much less embarrassing for him than the dismissal of his personal representative, Meyszner. Despite the fact that Turner was [...] "strict and unyielding", he was far more considerate of the concerns of Nedić, his regime and the Serbian population than any other senior member of the government of occupation. It was not just Meyszner's machinations that eventually unseated Turner, because he had been joined in his call for Turner's replacement by Kuntze. On 7 or 8 November 1942, Turner and his deputy Georg Kiessel were finally forced out and Turner was succeeded by his legal department chief, Walter Uppenkamp. In December 1942, Löhr was redesignated as Commander-in-Chief South-East Europe and Commander Army Group E but the <b>local</b> <b>command</b> situation did not change. During 1942, Meyszner was awarded the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords.|$|E
