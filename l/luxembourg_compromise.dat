25|$|During the {{establishment}} of the European Community, de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises {{in the history of the}} EEC, the Empty Chair Crisis. It involved the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, but almost more importantly the use of qualified majority voting in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> was reached in January 1966. De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding. He vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle had {{not been}} {{instrumental}} in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged, he put forward in 1961 the so-called Fouchet Plan that maintained all decision-making powers {{in the hands of}} governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see Empty chair crisis below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the community institutions to the detriment of national sovereignty, and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise.</b>|$|E

500|$|Until 2002, {{the venue}} for European Council summits was the member state {{that held the}} {{rotating}} Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification of the Nice Treaty to forego this arrangement {{at such a time}} as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. [...] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise,</b> with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{crisis was}} {{triggered}} {{in regard to}} proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity {{had come to an}} end, and majority-voting in the Council had taken effect. Then-French President Charles de Gaulle's opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an [...] "empty chair policy" [...] whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, the {{decision}} was made through Treaty of Rome 1957 to launch the first European Economic Community. It shared the Assembly and Court with the Coal and Steel Community, but set up parallel bodies for the Council and Commission. Based on the Spaak Report of 1956, it sought to break down all barriers to trade in a common market for goods, services, labour and capital, and prevent distortion of competition and regulate areas of common interest like agriculture, energy and transport. A separate treaty was signed for a European Atomic Energy Community to manage nuclear production. In 1961 the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway applied for membership only to be vetoed in 1963 by France's Charles de Gaulle. Spain also applied and was rejected as it was still led by the Franco dictatorship. The same year, the Court of Justice proclaimed that the Community constituted a [...] "new legal order of international law". The Merger Treaty 1965 finally placed the ECSC and Euratom within the EEC. Shortly after, de Gaulle boycotted the Commission, which he believed was pressing supranationalism too far. The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> in 1966 agreed that France (or other countries) could veto issues of [...] "very important national interest", particularly relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, instead of making decisions by [...] "qualified majority". But after the May 1968 events in France and de Gaulle's resignation, the way was free for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to join in 1973. Norway had rejected joining in a 1972 referendum, while the UK confirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum. Aside from the European Economic Community itself, the European continent underwent a profound transition towards democracy. The dictators of Greece and Portugal were deposed in 1974, and Spain's dictator died in 1975, enabling their accession in 1981 and 1986. In 1979, the European Parliament had its first direct elections, reflecting a growing consensus that the EEC should be less a union of member states, and more a union of peoples. The Single European Act 1986 increased the number of treaty issues in which qualified majority voting (rather than consensus) would be used to legislate, as a way to accelerate trade integration. The Schengen Agreement of 1985 (not initially signed by Italy, the UK, Ireland, Denmark or Greece) allowed movement of people without any border checks. Meanwhile, in 1987, the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev announced policies of [...] "transparency" [...] and [...] "restructuring" [...] (glasnost and perestroika). This revealed the depths of corruption and waste. In April 1989, the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June elections. These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism. In November 1989, protestors in Berlin began taking down the Berlin Wall, which became a symbol of the collapse of the Iron Curtain, with most of Eastern Europe declaring independence and moving to hold democratic elections by 1991.|$|E

50|$|The Common Agricultural Policy {{was born}} of the Treaty of Rome. CAP was {{partially}} reformed in 1966 {{as a result of}} the empty chair crisis and the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b> Policies of CAP are voted on using qualified majority voting, a stipulations of the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b> The CAP set up an international agricultural organisation that set prices for market goods like fruits, vegetables, sugar and cereals. Some of the CAP’s other goals are to: increase agricultural productivity, ensure a standard of living for farmers, stabilise markets, to readily provide available supplies at reasonable prices to consumers.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> (or [...] "Luxembourg Accord") was an {{agreement}} reached in January 1966 {{to resolve the}} [...] "empty chair crisis" [...] which had caused a stalemate within European Economic Community.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> {{is viewed}} as a turning of the tide in the history of European integration. It safeguarded the {{intergovernmental}} nature of the EC, therefore preserving state sovereignty. It also prevented the EC from further consolidating power and therefore becoming more supranational, or taking power {{out of the hands of}} the states. This meant the EC was moving in the opposite direction of the original assumption that it [...] "would eventually transform itself into a fully-fledged state". Instead, a norm developed in the Council that all decisions should be taken unanimously. Although the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> was only formally invoked around ten times between 1966 and 1981, its [...] "shadow" [...] hung over the Council and made decision-making much more difficult. Today, although majority voting has come to be used more frequently and the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> is all but defunct, the member states still prefer to take decisions by unanimity, because a decision reached by consensus means national authorities are more likely to implement EU directives into national law with enthusiasm, vigor, and in a timely manner.|$|E
50|$|In practice, in {{the years}} {{following}} the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise,</b> very little qualified majority voting took place in Council. This was partly due to a reluctance to force a new crisis with France, but the tendency was reinforced in 1973 by the accession of new Member States who essentially shared the French view on these matters.|$|E
5000|$|Within the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise,</b> a {{de facto}} veto power was given to every state on topics that were deemed to be ‘very {{important}} national interest(s)'. It was agreed upon that should a topic of concern arise, Members of the Council would seek to create a solution that all members could unanimously agree upon, {{regardless of whether or}} not the treaty required only a majority. However, the question of what should be done if no agreement was reached was interpreted differently by various members of the Community. While the flaws of such a system seemed evident, the Compromise assumed that if an agreement was not reached, it would [...] "not prevent the Community’s work being resumed in accordance with the normal procedure". Contrary to this assumption, the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> did prevent the Community’s decision-making for almost 20 years, until a veto by Britain was over-ridden in 1982 when, ironically, its interests were challenged by the French.|$|E
50|$|Another was the {{internal}} crisis of 1965, {{which ended in}} the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b> Preparations for the new round were immediately overshadowed by the Chicken War, an early sign of the impact variable levies under the Common Agricultural Policy would eventually have. Some participants in the Round had been concerned that the convening of UNCTAD, scheduled for 1964, would result in further complications, but {{its impact on the}} actual negotiations was minimal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965 the Council {{was hit by}} the [...] "empty chair crisis".

50|$|After the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise,</b> the West German and Italian governments found a {{new balance}} in the {{majority}} voting procedure, something that allowed them both to override the French government when they felt the French were being too aggressive. This would serve Italy exceptionally well, namely for the new majority vote on the regulations of fats and oils, and the fixing of common price for beef. The German gains from the Compromise were more political, mainly in weakening the intergovernmental forces that allowed France to be so dominant.|$|E
50|$|A {{change in}} the {{treaties}} could not in itself affect the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise,</b> as a political agreement with no legal basis, let alone a treaty one. Indeed, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared to the House of Commons that it remained. However, such a change to the treaties, duly ratified by all national parliaments, changed the constitutional framework within which the decisions concerned would be taken, and signified at least an intention to take majority votes more frequently. There would, after all, be little point in modifying the treaties if this were not the case.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> was, in fact, not a compromise: {{it was an}} {{agreement}} to disagree. Whereas all Member States accepted that, {{in a situation where}} a Member State's important national interests were at stake, an attempt should be made to find a solution acceptable to all, they did not agree to what should happen if no such solution was found within a reasonable period of time. France considered that the discussions should continue indefinitely. All other Member States took the view that a vote should be taken in accordance with the treaties.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Santer (born 18 May 1937) is a Luxembourg {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 9th President of the European Commission from 1995 to 1999. He served as Finance Minister of Luxembourg from 1979 until 1989, and the 22nd Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 1984 to 1995, {{as a member of the}} Christian Social People's Party, which has been the leading party in the Luxembourg government since 1979. As Prime Minister of Luxembourg he also led the negotiations on the Single European Act, which effectively set aside the 20-year-old <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{crisis was}} {{triggered}} {{in regard to}} proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity {{had come to an}} end, and majority-voting in the Council had taken effect.

Eventually, a compromise was reached with the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{followed}} up this treaty change with {{an amendment to}} its internal Rules of Procedure. After a year of negotiations, it agreed in 1987 to change its rules to oblige the President-in Office {{to move to a}} vote upon the request of the Commission or the representative of any Member State, provided that the request is supported by a simple majority of Member States. The context was also changed by accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community. It was no longer clear that states seeking to invoke the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> would have sufficient support in Council to constitute a blocking minority.|$|E
50|$|A {{compromise}} between all {{the member states}} was reached {{on the issue of}} qualified majority voting (QMV) in the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b> The Commission planned to extend the Community's power by expanding the number of issues subject to QMV. Charles de Gaulle was against the expansion of the Community's powers. The agreement reached was that, whenever a decision was subject to QMV, the Council would postpone the decision if a Member State claimed their national interests were being threatened. This compromise meant that no decision could be taken until a unanimously accepted agreement was reached. The QMV gave the smaller states greater voting weight since they were given a higher proportion relative to their population.|$|E

50|$|Following these {{developments}} there was reluctance by Member States to risk invoking the compromise and finding {{it was not}} accepted. There were even cases in which Member States in the minority, rather than invoke the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> during a vote, have challenged it in the Court of Justice on grounds of an incorrect legal basis - arguing that an article requiring unanimity should have been used. Gradually, votes were taken on increasingly controversial subjects such as a ban on hormones in meat (leading to a 'trade war' with the United States), permitted radioactivity levels in foodstuffs, rules for trans-frontier television broadcasts, several fishing controversies, foreign aid, {{and some of the}} crucial reforms of the CAP. By the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of Maastricht in 1991, it was widely recognised that votes would be taken wherever the treaty provided for it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first major}} {{crack in the}} {{practice}} of unanimity came in 1982 when the UK attempted to block the final adoption of the annual package of farm prices (details of which it had already agreed to) to extract concessions in separate negotiations on the Community's budget. This was perceived by other Member States to be almost a form of blackmail. The Community had to decide urgently on the agricultural prices for that year, and Britain was not objecting to the contents of that decision but merely using its supposed right of veto to extract concessions on another matter. This attitude provoked a sufficient majority of member states - including France - {{to take part in a}} vote openly putting Britain in a minority, and adopting the package. This was possible because the [...] "bottom line", constitutionally, was the treaty provision for majority voting in this area, rather than the political understanding (and a disputed one at that) of the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The EU {{has tried}} to bridge {{decision}} making by qualified majority and unanimity {{over the years by}} expanding qualified majorities (consensus) or by making unanimities easier to achieve. I call this decision-making procedure q-"unanimity" andtrace its history from the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> to the Lisbon Treaty, and to more recent agreements. I analyze the most recent and explicit mechanism of this bridging (article 31 (2) of the Lisbon Treaty) and identify one specific means by which the transformation of qualified majorities to unanimities is achieved: the reduction of precision or scope of the decision, so that different behaviors can be covered by it. I provide empirical evidence of such a mechanism by analyzing legislative decisions. Finally, I argue that this bridging is a ubiquitous feature of EU institutions, used in Treaties as well as in legislative decision-making. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{empty chair}} crisis of 1965, {{resolved}} in the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1966, forms part of the dramatic past of the European Union, and is for many a turning-point in European political integration. This volume, based on new research, revisits these events. It sheds fresh light on the mixed motives of the principal member states, European institutions and third-country actors, and identifies the shadows cast over subsequent legal and political practice. The book results from a collaborative project among historians, lawyers, and political scientists. It draws on new archival material and on many insights from practitioners, both some involved in the events of 1965 - 66 and others engaged in subsequent negotiations in the Council of the EU. Traces of these events persist in the consensus-oriented culture in the Council, where a concern to avoid sharply polarised confrontation limits recourse to active voting, even though the formal use of qualified majority voting has been greatly extended. Arguments over agricultural policy, the EU budget and world trade negotiations thus continue to provide occasions for some member states to insist on their `very important interests'. This book stems from a co-funded project of the Fondation Paul-Henri Spaak in Brussels and of the European University Institute and the Historical Archives of the European Union in Florence...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis of}} the 'chaise vide' (empty chair), July 1965 -January 1966, {{represented}} the greatest danger of break-up for the EEC. Its fundamental cause was the collision between two opposite ideas {{about the process of}} European integration: the view of intergovernmental, confederal cooperation, as General Charles de Gaulle imagined it, against the project of a supranational and federalizing integration, professed by the then-president of the EEC-Commission Walter Hallstein. The starting-point of the crisis was the failure of the Council of Ministers in Brussels of June 28 - 30, 1965, that had to decide about the Commission's package for the financing of a common agricultural policy, the Community's direct budgetary revenues, the rule of the majority decision and the extension of the European Parliament's powers. As a result of the non-financing of a common agricultural policy de Gaulle ordered the withdrawal of the French delegation from the EEC. The French chair was empty for six months. De Gaulle wanted to solve once and for all the problems of the Council-Commission relations and of the majority vote. The crisis was settled by the Luxembourg agreement (January 29, 1966). As a matter of fact, this agreement restored normality in the Community, but caused a limitation of its dynamism, particularly in the Commission's proposal power and in the Council's decision-making, that was mantained until the Eighties under the implied threat of the member states' veto power. Rethinking about those weighty events can be interesting in these days of reform of the EU institutions, because the intent of the <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>compromise</b> has not been cancelled completely and lives on the spirit of present euroscepticism. ...|$|E
