Genes necessary for the aerobic degradation of γ-HCH (called <b>lin</b> genes) were initially identified and characterized for UT 26 (Nagata et al. 1999) and were subsequently recovered from B 90 A (Dogra et al. 2004 : Kumari et al. 2002).

40|$|SummaryLin 28 A and <b>Lin</b> 28 B {{selectively}} {{block the}} expression of let- 7 microRNAs and function as oncogenes in a variety of human cancers. <b>Lin</b> 28 A recruits a TUTase (Zcchc 11 /TUT 4) to let- 7 precursors to block processing by Dicer {{in the cell}} cytoplasm. Here we find that unlike <b>Lin</b> 28 A, <b>Lin</b> 28 B represses let- 7 processing through a Zcchc 11 -independent mechanism. <b>Lin</b> 28 B functions in the nucleus by sequestering primary let- 7 transcripts and inhibiting their processing by the Microprocessor. The inhibitory effects of Zcchc 11 depletion on the tumorigenic capacity and metastatic potential of human cancer cells and xenografts are restricted to <b>Lin</b> 28 A-expressing tumors. Furthermore, the majority of human colon and breast tumors analyzed exclusively express either <b>Lin</b> 28 A or <b>Lin</b> 28 B. <b>Lin</b> 28 A is expressed in HER 2 -overexpressing breast tumors, whereas <b>Lin</b> 28 B expression characterizes triple-negative breast tumors.

We found that the expression level of <b>Lin</b> 28 was closely associated with the resistance to paclitaxel treatment. The T 47 D cancer cell line, which highly expresses <b>Lin</b> 28, is more resistant to paclitaxel than the MCF 7, Bcap- 37 or SK-BR- 3 cancer cell lines, which had low-level expression of <b>Lin</b> 28. Knocking down of <b>Lin</b> 28 in <b>Lin</b> 28 high expression T 47 D cells increased the sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment, while stable expression of <b>Lin</b> 28 in breast cancer cells effectively attenuated the sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment, resulting in a significant increase of IC 50 values of paclitaxel. Transfection with <b>Lin</b> 28 also significantly inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. We also found that <b>Lin</b> 28 expression was dramatically increased in tumor tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or in local relapse or metastatic breast cancer tissues. Moreover, further studies showed that p 21, Rb and Let- 7 miRNA were the molecular targets of <b>Lin</b> 28. Overexpression of <b>Lin</b> 28 in breast cancer cells considerably induced p 21 and Rb expression and inhibited Let- 7 miRNA levels. Our results indicate that <b>Lin</b> 28 expression might be one mechanism underlying paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer, and <b>Lin</b> 28 could be a potential target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer...|$|R
50|$|Once, <b>Lin</b> Chong meets Lu Zhishen while {{accompanying}} {{his wife}} to the temple and becomes sworn brothers with Lu. His wife catches the eye of Gao Yanei, the lecherous foster son of Grand Marshal Gao Qiu. Gao Yanei tries to molest <b>Lin</b> Chong's wife but <b>Lin</b> appears {{in the nick of}} time and stops him. Since then, Gao Yanei becomes obsessed with <b>Lin</b> Chong's wife and wants to have her for himself. He enlists the help of <b>Lin</b> Chong's friend Lu Qian, asking Lu Qian to distract <b>Lin</b> Chong by asking him out for drinks. Gao Yanei then tricks <b>Lin</b> Chong's wife to a house and tries to rape her there. <b>Lin</b> Chong's servant alerts him in time and <b>Lin</b> rushes there and saves his wife from Gao Yanei's sexual advances. Gao Yanei escapes in a frenzy.|$|R
40|$|Resistance to {{radiation}} therapy {{is a major}} obstacle for the effective treatment of cancers. <b>Lin</b> 28 {{has been shown to}} contribute to breast tumorigenesis; however, the relationship between <b>Lin</b> 28 and radioresistance remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the association of <b>Lin</b> 28 with radiation resistance and identified the underlying mechanisms of action of <b>Lin</b> 28 in human breast cancer cell lines. The results showed that the expression level of <b>Lin</b> 28 was closely associated with resistance {{to radiation}} treatment. The T 47 D cancer cell line, which highly expresses <b>Lin</b> 28, is more resistant to radiation than MCF 7, Bcap- 37 or SK-BR- 3 cancer cell lines, which have low-level <b>Lin</b> 28 expression. Transfection with <b>Lin</b> 28 siRNA significantly led to an increase of sensitivity to radiation. By contrast, stable expression of <b>Lin</b> 28 in breast cancer cells effectively attenuated the sensitivity to radiation treatment. Stable expression of <b>Lin</b> 28 also significantly inhibited radiation-induced apoptosis. Moreover, further studies have shown that caspases, H 2 A. X and Let- 7 miRNA were the molecular targets of <b>Lin</b> 28. Stable expression of <b>Lin</b> 28 and treatment with radiation induced H 2 AX expression, while inhibited p 21 and γ-H 2 A. X. Overexpression of Let- 7 enhanced the sensitivities to radiation in breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that <b>Lin</b> 28 might be one mechanism underlying radiation resistance, and <b>Lin</b> 28 could be a potential target for overcoming radiation resistance in breast cancer...|$|R
