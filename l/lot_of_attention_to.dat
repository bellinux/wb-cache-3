25|$|These {{ideas were}} {{arranged}} into a true calculus of infinitesimals by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who was originally accused of plagiarism by Newton. He is now {{regarded as an}} independent inventor of and contributor to calculus. His contribution {{was to provide a}} clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities, allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and providing the product rule and chain rule, in their differential and integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz paid a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the formalism, often spending days determining appropriate symbols for concepts.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the primary}} goal of the TeX {{language}} is high-quality typesetting for publishers of books, Knuth gave a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the spacing rules for mathematical formulae. He took three bodies of work that he considered to be standards of excellence for mathematical typography: the books typeset by Addison-Wesley Publishing's house (the publisher of The Art of Computer Programming), in particular the work of Hans Wolf and Joseph Louis Lagrange (thermodynamics innovation, +1856); editions of the mathematical journal Acta Mathematica dating from around 1910; and a copy of Indagationes Mathematicae, a Dutch mathematics journal. Knuth looked closely at these printed papers to sort out and look for a set of rules for spacing. While TeX provides some basic rules and the tools needed to specify proper spacing, the exact parameters depend on the font used to typeset the formula. For example, the spacing for Knuth's Computer Modern fonts has been precisely fine-tuned over the years and is now set; but when other fonts, such as AMS Euler, were used by Knuth for the first time, new spacing parameters had to be defined.|$|E

Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{wrote that}} [...] "this episode wasn't a stinker by any measure, {{but after the}} run of early episodes, {{this is the first}} that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others", adding that [...] "The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making you long for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point." [...] The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being [...] "obvious and cheesy" [...] and [...] "beautifully paced and structured". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is [...] "one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series.

500|$|The game's swipe-based swordplay {{was based}} on Donald Mustard's desire for an {{uncommon}} gameplay based on nuanced sword fighting and parrying. He described the game's influences as the combat of Karateka and Prince of Persia combined with the [...] "lonely epicness" [...] of Shadow of the Colossus. Chair sought to develop an experience that could be picked up and played for a minute (a single battle) or {{for half an hour}} (a bloodline). They felt that many other developers accustomed to consoles were wrong to make iOS games that required long playing experiences to feel meaningful, and so Chair developed the bloodline concept as a natural breakpoint. They also felt that mobile games like Infinity Blade with constant action elements went too long without giving the player time to relax and resulted in player exhaustion, and so Chair kept their individual battles short with brief cinematic pauses in longer battles. Chair showed their playable demo at the Apple conference on September 1, 2010, after weeks of rehearsal, and attracted a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the game. It was released on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on marketing, Apple used the game extensively in advertisements for its devices.|$|E

He has been noted {{to be one of}} the most common [...] "fan favorite" [...] characters from the series. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network praised Steve Staley for giving an interesting variation of his voice rather than [...] "integrity-destroying abominations". Also, he commented that Hitsugaya's unresolved personal issue is, along with the ones from others characters, a good part from the climax of the Soul Society story arc. He additionally praised the animation of Hitsugaya's bankai in the anime. Later, however, Kimlinger criticized it as [...] "it makes him look like an arthritic blue crow". IGN's Ramsey Isler lamented the fact that his first fight against an Arrancar was not very entertaining and his character did not [...] "get a chance to shine." [...] Hitsugaya's early appearances were criticized by Isaac Hale from Pop Culture Shock who found Kubo was ignoring other characters and giving a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> him and Matsumoto's gags. However, in a later arc, Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted he [...] "has a pretty good arc" [...] and [...] "shine brightly" [...] facing Aizen.
