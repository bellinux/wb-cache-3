50|$|The closed sink {{simultaneously}} makes a <b>locking</b> <b>flap</b> {{inside of}} a sink. It is difficult because the paper cannot be opened out further than a triangle. This technique is illustrated in the Origami Forum's thread #462. The closed sink appears in some high-intermediate and complex models.|$|E
5000|$|The closed unsink inverts {{a closed}} sink without {{completely}} opening out the affected paper. In theory, it is [...] "just" [...] {{the opposite of}} a closed sink. In practice, it is very difficult, because the paper being [...] "popped" [...] into place usually must be pulled (not pushed), and because it involves simultaneously folding over a <b>locking</b> <b>flap</b> that is hidden inside the sink. However, {{it is easier to}} manipulate than an open unsink as there is an internal flap to pull to pop the unsink in place; in an open unsink there is nothing to hold. The closed unsink appears in some complex models, such as a few of Lang's insects.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1955 {{engineer}} Antonio Fessia joined Lancia as technical director, {{and started}} off fixing the Appia's shortcomings. Jano left shortly after, when Lancia withdrew from Formula 1.The resulting second series Appia, introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1956, {{had a more}} powerful engine, a modernized body and better interior room. The C10 and C10S type codes were kept.The rear {{part of the body}} had been redesigned to enlarge the boot, and the wheelbase was stretched by 3 cm to provide better rear seat accommodation; this resulted in a [...] cm growth in length. From the front the second series could be recognized from its rectangular instead of round turn signal lamps and the steel bumpers with over-riders. The fuel filler cap was moved outside, under a <b>locking</b> <b>flap</b> on the right hand side rear wing. Fessia's changes to the engine included lowering the compression ratio, redesigning the cylinder head incorporating hemispherical combustion chambers and a new arrangement of the valves, new pistons, a new carburettor and different camshaft profiles. Output increased to 43 PS, and top speed to 120 km/h. In the cabin a front bench seat took place of the two single ones, the binnacle held two round instruments, and steering wheel and switchgear went from ivory to black.|$|E
50|$|The 15 meter Class LS6 was however {{achieving}} {{surprisingly good}} results flying with <b>locked</b> <b>flaps</b> in the non-FAI sanctioned Sports Class in the United States. Following this lead, Rolladen-Schneider modified an LS6-c {{by removing the}} flap handle, resetting the wing at a slightly higher angle of incidence and adding winglets. This experimental prototype outperformed state-of-the-art standard class sailplanes both in side-by-side flight tests and in contests including the German Championships at Neustadt-Glewe.|$|R
60|$|Next day {{he slowly}} trotted ninety times about the clearing, his chin {{up and his}} chest out, while Crook McKusick, excited at being a trainer again, snapped orders at him and talked about form.... A ludicrous figure, a little old man, his white <b>locks</b> <b>flapping</b> under a mushy cap as he galloped earnestly through the light snow. But his cheeks were one red glow, his eyes were bright, and in his laugh, when he finished, was {{infinite}} hope.|$|R
50|$|In around 1942 the Swiss army {{initiated}} a competition {{for a new}} service machine gun to replace both the “heavy” MG 11 and the “light” Lmg25, adopted in 1911 and 1925 respectively. Three participants joined the competition-government-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, and privately owned factories SIG and Hispano-Suiza. Waffenfabrik Bern based its development on the hugely successful German MG 42. The first prototypes emerged in around 1944, and looked much like MG42, although the shape of receiver and butt was somewhat different. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects similar to the MG 42, although many parts were produced by machining instead of stamping, and the locking system was changed from roller to <b>flap</b> <b>locking.</b> The resulting weapon was heavier than the German original, and much more finely made and finished. In certain respects it was a “Rolex” of machine guns. Until very recently MG 51 served as a primary infantry and vehicle machine gun for Swiss army, although it is now being gradually replaced in service with lighter and less expensive, but also less powerful 5.56mm FN Minimi machine gun of Belgian origin and manufacture. The MG 51 is a short-recoil-operated, locked breech, air-cooled and automatic only, belt-fed weapon. It uses a modified MG 42 type locking system with a two-piece bolt and dual <b>locking</b> <b>flaps</b> located in the front part of the bolt. These flaps engage the cuts made in the short barrel extension to provide rigid locking. Upon recoil, the flaps are retracted {{toward the center of}} the bolt, to unlock it. An additional lever-type bolt accelerator is provided; it is located in receiver, next to the barrel breech and below the bolt. The gun housing also somewhat resembles the German MG 42, although it is made from two separate parts - the barrel jacket (made from stamped steel) and receiver (a solid machined body). The barrel jacket is permanently welded to the front of the receiver. The barrel can be changed rapidly if required; the barrel change procedure is similar to that of the MG 42, with the locking latch located at the right side of the jacket, which is opened to provide a barrel replacement window.|$|R
40|$|Tests {{were made}} to {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of a}} long-period dynamically overbalanced flap in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For two gust shapes, one gust velocity, one forward velocity, and one wing loading, a series of flights was made with the <b>flap</b> <b>locked</b> and was then repeated with the flap free to operate. The records were evaluated by routine methods. The results indicate that the flap reduced the maximum acceleration increment 39 percent for a severe gust but with a representative gust shape (a sharp-edge gust), the reduction was only 3 percent. The results also indicate that the flap tended to reduce the longitudinal stability of the airplane. Computations made of the effectiveness and the action of the flap were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
60|$|Festus had {{sat down}} on the hollow window-bench, and was {{continuing}} the statement of his wrongs. 'If he only knew what he was sitting upon,' she thought apprehensively, 'how easily he could tear up the <b>flap,</b> <b>lock</b> and all, with his strong arm, and seize upon poor Uncle Benjy's possessions!' But he did not appear to know, unless he were acting, which was just possible. After a while he rose, and going to the table lifted the candle to light his pipe. At the moment when the flame began diving into the bowl the door noiselessly opened and a figure slipped across the room to the window-bench, hastily unlocked it, withdrew the box, and beat a retreat. Anne in a moment recognized the ghostly intruder as Festus Derriman's uncle. Before he could get out of the room Festus set down the candle and turned.|$|R
50|$|The {{manifestations of}} autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from {{individuals}} with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and <b>locked</b> into hand <b>flapping</b> and rocking—to high functioning individuals {{who may have}} active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, {{the extent of the}} overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear.|$|R
40|$|Some {{experimental}} {{results are presented}} from wind tunnel studies of a dynamic model equipped with an aeromechanical gust alleviation system for reducing the normal acceleration response of light airplanes. The gust alleviation system consists of two auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces that deflect the wing flaps through mechanical linkages when a gust is encountered to maintain nearly constant airplane lift. The gust alleviation system was implemented on a 1 / 6 -scale, rod mounted, free flying model that is geometrically and dynamically representative of small, four place, high wing, single engine, light airplanes. The effects of flaps with different spans, two size of auxiliary aerodynamic surfaces, plain and double hinged flaps, and a flap elevator interconnection were studied. The model test results are presented in terms of predicted root mean square response of the full scale airplane to atmospheric turbulence. The {{results show that the}} gust alleviation system reduces the root mean square normal acceleration response by 30 percent in comparison with the response in the <b>flaps</b> <b>locked</b> condition. Small reductions in pitch-rate response were also obtained. It is believed that substantially larger reductions in normal acceleration can be achieved by reducing the rather high levels of mechanical friction which were extant in the alleviation system of the present model...|$|R
