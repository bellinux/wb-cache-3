5|$|The 2012 book Rising Above the Gathering Storm by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine {{cited the}} fact that the Obama Administration hosted the first White House Astronomy Night, as a {{reflection}} of the President's support for education in the STEM fields. The 2014 book The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation by Arlin Crotts discussed the appreciation of the importance of science education by the Obama Administration, citing the White House Astronomy Night and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama as key examples. Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of the astronaut by <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr,</b> discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 a book, Peter Jennings: A Reporter's Life, was published, co-edited by {{his widow}} Kayce Freed and his ABC {{colleague}} <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr.</b> The book contained an oral history compiled {{from a number}} of interviews.

500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr.</b> Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of time devoted to research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E

The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of [...] "Auld Lang Syne"; the songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr {{discusses the}} evolution of the lyrics, for instance, changes to the original third verse written by Bates. The song appears in Ellen Raskin's The Westing Game.|$|R

5000|$|MacNair {{named the}} SBA List after the famous suffragist, Susan B. Anthony. The {{leaders of the}} SBA List say that Anthony was [...] "passionately pro-life". According to the SBA list, Susan B. Anthony [...] "called {{abortion}} 'child murder'" [...] This topic has been subject to a modern-day dispute about Anthony's views on abortion, with scholars and pro-choice activists [...] "concerned that their heroine is being appropriated." [...] While Anthony deplored abortion, she never worked against it. Anthony scholar Ann D. Gordon and Anthony biographer <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr</b> say the quotes SBA List cites are misattributed or taken out of context. Gordon said that Anthony [...] "never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life ... and she never voiced an opinion about using {{the power of the}} state to require that pregnancies be brought to term." ...|$|E

50|$|Daisy {{was soon}} joined by another baby giraffe, Marlon (named after Marlon Brando), {{and since then}} the Manor, in {{conjunction}} with locations such as Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire, England, has run a breeding programme to reintroduce the Rothschild giraffe into the wild to expand the gene pool. At any one time the Manor has around a dozen giraffes in residence, although at present there are only eight, {{and part of the}} land of the Manor is given over to the Giraffe Centre, run by the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, a charitable organisation set up by Jock Leslie-Melville in 1972. By tradition the giraffes themselves are named after individuals who have contributed significantly (whether financially or otherwise) to the work of AFEW, such as Lynn, named for author and journalist <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr,</b> a giraffe devotee who wrote an entire book devoted to the creature.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1993 by {{sociologist}} and psychologist Rachel MacNair, the SBA List was {{a response}} {{to the success of the}} pro-choice group EMILY's List, which was partly responsible for bringing about the 1992 [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] in which a significant number of women, all pro-choice, were elected to Congress. MacNair wished to help anti-abortion women gain high public office. She recruited Marjorie Dannenfelser and Jane Abraham as the first experienced leaders of SBA List. Dannenfelser is now president of the organization and Abraham is chairwoman of the board. Named for suffragist Susan B. Anthony, SBA List identifies itself with Anthony and several 19th-century women's rights activists; SBA List argues that Anthony and other early feminists were opposed to abortion. Regarding Anthony's beliefs, the SBA List has been challenged by scholars and pro-choice activists. Anthony scholar Ann D. Gordon and Anthony biographer <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr</b> write that Anthony [...] "spent no time on the politics of abortion".|$|E

5000|$|In May 2010, Sarah Palin {{addressed}} the SBA List, saying Anthony {{was one of}} her heroes, and that Palin's own opposition to abortion rights was influenced by her [...] "feminist foremothers". She said [...] "Organizations like the Susan B. Anthony List are returning the woman's movement back to its original roots, back to {{what it was all about}} in the beginning. You remind us of the earliest leaders of the woman's rights movement: They were pro-life." [...] In response to this, journalist <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr,</b> author of Failure is Impossible: Susan B. Anthony in Her Own Words, joined with Gordon to write an opinion piece for The Washington Post. They said: [...] "We have read every single word that this very voluble—and endlessly political—woman left behind. Our conclusion: Anthony spent no time on the politics of abortion. It was of no interest to her, despite living in a society (and a family) where women aborted unwanted pregnancies." [...] Sherr and Gordon said that their argument [...] "is not over abortion rights. Rather it is about the erosion of accuracy in history and journalism." ...|$|E
5000|$|A 2006 {{article by}} Allison Stevens for Women's eNews said [...] "a {{scholarly}} disagreement ...is growing into a heated skirmish over the famous suffragist's position on reproductive rights." [...] Stevens said pro-choice activists were [...] "outraged {{over what they}} say is an unproven claim and concerned that their heroine is being appropriated by a community led by the very people Anthony battled during her lifetime: social conservatives." [...] Nora Bredes, the director of the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Leadership at the University of Rochester in New York and a pro-choice Democratic politician, said that she wished to [...] "reclaim" [...] Anthony's legacy. In the anti-alcohol Temperance speech [...] "Social Purity", which Anthony gave repeatedly in the 1870s, she includes [...] "infanticides and abortions" [...] among the examples of [...] "perpetual reminders of men’s incapacity to cope successfully with this monster evil of society," [...] meaning drunkenness which leads to licentiousness. However, Anthony scholars <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr</b> and Ann Gordon contend that Anthony expressed her disapproval of an abortion only once, privately in a diary entry which is open to other interpretations, and that she did not publicly or politically work against abortion.|$|E

5000|$|Since 2006, Gordon {{has written}} and spoken out against pro-life {{organizations}} such as Feminists for Life (FFL) and Susan B.

Gordon holds that Anthony [...] "never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life" [...] and that [...] "she never voiced an opinion about using {{the power of the}} state to require that pregnancies be brought to term." [...] In October 2006, Gordon stated that she was beginning to see college students who only knew Anthony as an activist opposed to abortion, a view she said was [...] "based more on fiction than fact". Gordon stated that [...] "comparing the debate over abortion today with the debate that was taking place in the 19th century is misleading." [...] For the North Adams Transcript in February 2010, Gordon said [...] "I've watched the anti-abortion movement make these assertions since 1989. It's pretty far fetched". In a May 2010 opinion piece in The Washington Post's [...] "On Faith" [...] blog, co-authored with <b>Lynn</b> <b>Sherr,</b> Gordon noted that Anthony's statements on abortion are limited to a single, ambiguous diary entry, and concluded that, [...] "Anthony spent no time on the politics of abortion.

[...] In a piece in the [...] "On Faith" [...] blog posted the same day, SBA List president Marjorie Dannenfelser responded to Gordon and Sherr, citing one anonymous anti-abortion article in Anthony's paper, to argue that [...] "Anthony was passionate and logical in her arguments against abortion, which were consistent with the views of her suffragist contemporaries." ...|$|E
