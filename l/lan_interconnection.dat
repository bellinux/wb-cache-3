40|$|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{can provide}} {{deterministic}} channels as required for real time signals, {{as well as}} statistical multiplexing. For this reason, ATM has been chosen as the underlying technology for providing a Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). Two main classes of services {{are expected to be}} supported over a B-ISDN. These classes are real-time services and data services. Data services include computer communications (Local Area Network (<b>LAN)</b> <b>interconnections)</b> and general non-real time traffic, such as file transfer and small transactions. The provision of data services over ATM are better served with statistical multiplexing, provided that the service is loss-free. For multiplexing to be loss-free and still statistical, while the maximum service rate is fixed, the multiplexer tributaries must be controlled in flow, to assure no overflow of the multiplexing buffer. Provision of a service over ATM is accomplished by an ATM layer. Transfer Capability (ATC). This thesis investigates and reports on the operating characteristics of an ATM layer Transfer Capability proposed to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and called Controlled Cell Transfer (CCT). CCT uses credit window based flow control on links and a quota based control in switches, and will give loss free statistical multiplexing for data. Other ITU defined ATCs are examined in regard to data service provision and compared with CCT. It is found that only CCT can provide a fast {{and at the same time}} efficient data service. The thesis also examines the impact that support of the CCT capability would have on an ATM switch, through determination of required functionality, and mapping of the required functions into a switch design.

Thus, a distributed scheme is deemed indispensable for the proper performance of the network. In this field, previous work [9] aimed to reduce signaling costs in femtocell deployments by establishing a local OAM element, allowing hybrid algorithms and minimizing backhaul use. Additionally, since the proposed on-site OAM element was only responsible for a local small cell network, the number of cells to be operated by such entity is much reduced, significantly limiting computational costs. While such scheme could be adopted for the mechanisms proposed in the present work, it is still vulnerable to failure in that centralized entity. Also the small cells may not be part of the same <b>LAN,</b> or their <b>interconnection</b> capacity may be low (e.g., if it is based on WiFi-LAN).

40|$|A {{combination}} of evolving technologies, economic circumstances, {{and the need}} to manage the increased flow of information culminated in the utilization of computer networks in libraries to enhance information retrieval and document delivery and facilitate access to resources. Computer networks have enabled librarians to streamline support services and reduce the costs of labor intensive operations. A computer network is a structure that makes available to an end user at one place some service performed at another place. Ever since computer users started accessing central processor resources from remote terminals three decades ago, computer networks have become complex, powerful, and versatile. Technically, computer networks have evolved from dedicated private networks to those utilizing multiplexed links or accessing hosts from multiple vendors. Geographically, computer networks have the capability to link several buildings, a few states or span the globe. Advanced telecommunications technology in concert with computer technology triggered the emergence of all sizes, shapes, and types of computer networks to enable terminals and/or users connected to the networks to communicate with each other. While libraries 2 ̆ 7 needs are changing in the fields of video and voice communications, the most profound alterations are in the realm of data communications or telecommunications among computers and between terminals and computers. To cope with the mix of requirements for sharing resources ranging from bibliographic citations and cataloging and circulation records to grant proposals and publications, librarians in the 1980 s are turning to a special form of computer network, the extended local area network or linked LAN, as a tool for connecting diverse communications equipment. A local area network is a facility providing data communications within a geographically limited area. Essentially, a local area network can bind together proliferating personal computers, terminals, host computers, and other communications equipment for information interchange. These local area networks can be connected into linked LANs or extended local area networks through fiber optic transmission in a dispersed geographical area for maximum communications efficiency. The dissertation, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A <b>LAN</b> PATH TO <b>INTERCONNECTION,</b> is about the mortar and bricks out of which computer networks are built. Special emphasis is placed on the process of designing, installing, and implementing local area networks and on the linkage of these LANs as a strategy for information management for multi type library consortia such as SEFLIN (SouthEast Library Information Network). Consisting of public and academic libraries in Southeast Florida, SEFLIN is responsible for promoting resource sharing and the dissemination of new knowledge in all areas of study for the 3. 2 million residents of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach Counties. SEFLIN participants include the Broward Community College Library, the Broward County Library System, the Florida Atlantic University Library, the Florida International University Library, the Miami – Dade Community College Library, the Miami-Dade Public Library, and the University of Miami Library. Scarcity of space, shrinking budgets, growing user demands and expectations, spiraling costs of materials and services, and price reductions in communications and computing equipment contributed to the emergence of multi type library networks such as SEFLIN for resource sharing. SEFLIN was formed to serve the needs of a mixed community of library users by supplying access to a full range of information resources and offering sophisticated support for a host of library and management function including online processing and cataloging, circulation control, serials control, fund accounting, statistical reporting, word processing and electronic mail. SEFLIN 2 ̆ 7 s primary mission is to link libraries in a common pattern of information exchange through the creation of an extended local area network or linked LAN. Sharing decision making data among public and academic libraries broadens the scope of sources and services available to the user community. Few areas in data communications much recent offering as technological innovation and local area networks. Local have seen as new commercial area network development has responded to the users 2 ̆ 7 demand for greater transmission speed and capacity. Among user advantages provided by a LAN are enhanced reliability; faster response time; flexibility in applications programming; better supported facilities; and internetworking capabilities for multiple remote locations. Spanning short distances ranging from a few meters to several kilometers and involving high data rates and short propagation delays, local area networks are characterized by a variable number of devices requiring interconnection. As more and more materials become available and the costs of operations skyrocket, library professionals have {{to come to terms with}} the facts that not only is there not enough money around to be self-sufficient but often any semblance of self-sufficiency has become an impossibility. As a consequence, computer networks such as linked LANs are playing an increasingly important role in library activities. NETWORKING: CHOOSING A <b>LAN</b> PATH TO <b>INTERCONNECTION</b> is the result of efforts to explore the processes involved in developing a framework for interconnecting disparate computer systems in use by SEFLIN members in an extended local area network (LAN) or linked LAN based on the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Within a multi-type library consortium such as SEFLIN, an extended local area network or linked LAN facilitates access to decision making data. A networking system such as Network Systems Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s HYPERbus which can be extended via private or public communications facilities such as Bell South T 1 transmission technology, compatible Timep 1 ex devices, and Microtel 2 ̆ 7 s LaserNet, a fiber optic transmission system, into an extended local area network or linked LAN is a mechanism for facilitating the accomplishment of this mission. Inasmuch as HYPERbus has been utilized since 1984 by the Broward County Main Library, the major reference and research facility of the Broward County Library System, and can provide maximum performance networking capabilities for high speed digital data communications applications, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A <b>LAN</b> PATH TO <b>INTERCONNECTION</b> examines the feasibility of using HYPERbus as the basis for an extended local area network linking two SEFLIN participants, namely, the Broward County Main Library and the Florida Atlantic University Library. Developed by Network Systems Corporation, HYPERbus is a local area network implemented by Broward County 2 ̆ 7 s Information Resources Management Division in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Presently, HYPERbus is used to link the Broward County Main Library, the Broward County Governmental Center, the Broward County Courthouse, and the new jail facility. A multi-drop coaxial cable based system which transmits data at speeds up to 10 M bps, HYPERbus features a flexible architecture capable of handling simultaneously diverse data rate, traffic types, and protocols and incorporating a variety of transmission media within the network. Moreover, HYPERbus can support extended span geographic distances using communication links. HYPERbus provides a data communications resource that is transparent to differences in communications media and equipment. As a consequence, network reconfiguration and expansion can be readily accomplished as new technologies, protocols, and user requirements emerge. The generic model developed in this dissertation for interconnecting two SEFLIN participants based on HYPERbus technology, however, is by no means exhaustive of all existing schemes; the field is presently so wide open that new schemes are being introduced constantly. Technological advances and economic pressures have stimulated interest in resource sharing through computer networking as an option for overcoming barriers in accessing information. The linking of computerized systems to enable one system to exchange data with another system is an essential and basic goal to any effective cooperative intersystem resource sharing effort. In this world of electronic communications, the future of computer networking which provides tailored data communications services to the user community is definitely on an upward climb as a consequence of such factors as competitive pricing, improved and faster transmission speeds, and conformance to standards devised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). NETWORKING: CHOOSING A <b>LAN</b> PATH TO <b>INTERCONNECTION</b> deals with designing and implementing a computer network for resource sharing and is intended for technical service and public service staff of the Broward County Library System who are using the building blocks of a local area network and still appear to be somewhat mystified by its information capabilities as well as for those who are not yet doing so. This dissertation examines the history of library involvement with networking, briefly reviews the history of library networking and automation, presents examples of library use of networking, and provides the user with the basic information needed for understanding networking technology and terminology. Further, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A <b>LAN</b> PATH TO <b>INTERCONNECTION</b> proposes an enhanced role for the Broward County Library System as a community information provider by using an extended local area network or linked LAN to actively pursue, organize, and make available to present and potential library patrons a range of information resources never before offered in today 2 ̆ 7 s information based society...|$|R

We investigate {{the effect of the}} length of the holding time of an idle VC on the total cost per frame transmitted. Our simulation results suggest that there is no optimum holding time for minimising the total cost. Increasing the holding time either increases or decreases the total cost depending on the cost associated with a connection setup and frame loss. We also show that for a given cost associated with a frame loss the practical range of buffer sizes is bounded by a minimum and a maximum value. Within the practical range, larger buffer reduces total cost. Increasing buffer beyond the maximum size does not have any impact on the total cost. For buffers below the minimum size, a connection should never be closed; such buffer sizes have, therefore, no benefit at all. Keywords LA [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The recent advancements in the {{telecommunication}} {{industry have}} brought forth many {{changes in the}} field. One {{of the most important}} is a shift towards the wireless communication scenario. Wireless ATM is fast becoming a solution in this direction. With WATM gaining momentum {{it is very important that}} the underlying ATM network is well laid out. One of the most important research issues in the ATM scenario is the optimized usage of bandwidth. In this paper we have proposed an Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA) algorithm approach based solution for optimization of bandwidth through dynamic routing in ATM network. Previous research work shows that traditional optimization heuristics result in sub-optimal solution. In this paper we have explored non-traditional optimization technique specifically EGA. The results obtained thus prove that EGA can become a potential solver algorithm for obtaining optimized bandwidth. The optimized bandwidth could mean that some attractive business applications would become feasible such as high speed <b>LAN</b> <b>interconnection,</b> teleconferencing etc. We have also performed a comparative study of the selection mechanisms in GA and listed the best selection mechanism and a new initialization technique which improves the efficiency of the EGA...|$|E
40|$|The {{interconnection}} {{of local}} area networks is increasingly important, but little {{data are available}} on the characteristics of the aggregate traffic that LANs will be submitting to the interconnection media. In order to understand the interactions between LANs and the proposed interconnection networks (MANs, WANs, and BISDN networks), it is necessary to study the behavior of this external LAN traffic over many time scales – from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. We present a high time-resolution hardware monitor for Ethernet LANs that avoids the shortcomings of previous monitoring tools, such as traffic burst clipping and timestamp jitter. Using data recorded by our monitor for several hundred million Ethernet packets, we present an overview of the short-range time correlations in external LAN traffic. Our analysis shows that LAN traffic is extremely bursty across time domains spanning six orders of magnitude. We compare this behavior with simple formal traffic models and employ the data in a trace-driven simulation of the LAN-BISDN interface proposed for the SMDS SM service. Our results suggest that the pronounced short-term traffic correlations, together with the extensive time regime of traffic burstiness, strongly influence the patterns of loss and delay induced by <b>LAN</b> <b>interconnection.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Proliferating {{deployment}} of amphidromic broadband services over commercial cable TV networks is bringing {{a taste of}} IBCN capabilities to vast numbers of domestic customers. The fluctuating and unpredictable traffic of the new services favours TDMA multiplexing of traffic fi om manu customers inside each channel for flexible and dynamic bandwidth sharing {{on the basis of}} a medium access protocol, As penetration grows, traffic aggregations will exceed the capabilities of store-and-forward switching bringing more and more into prominence fast switching techniques and ATM networking. The first HFC systems designed primarily for <b>LAN</b> <b>interconnection</b> and Internet traffic are not optimised for ATM sources even when they employ ATM cells as a unit of transport. A novel contention approach designed to greatly reduce the distortions to traffic profiles characterising first generation HFC medium access protocols is the theme of this paper, The proposed method provides a high number of simultaneous orthogonal contention opportunities which allow quick identification of cell arrivals which is a key to preserving temporal relationships of contending traffic, vastly reducing cell delay variations in line with the traffic control philosophy of ATM.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a complete fade counter measure system, based on up-link transmission power control, plus data coding and bit rates variation. The {{system is designed}} for thin route TDMA user-oriented satellite networks, used for <b>LAN</b> <b>interconnection.</b> A multicarrier access to the satellite transponder is envisaged to exploit the entire transponder bandwidth with limited data rates of each carrier. The modest performance required by the earth stations means that the antennas can easily be installed on the user?s premises. In order to avoid excessive intermodulation noise, the satellite transponder in put back-off must be constant and sufficient to in operate in the linear zone. This imposes a calibrated action of the up?link power control, which is possible only by knowing the up-link attenuation with good accuracy. The total signal degradation, due to the residual up?link attenuation after up?power control intervention, and to the down-link attenuation,is compensated for by varying the coding and bit rates of the data signal to noise estimator, based on the statistics of quantised levels of the demodulated PSK signal and a narrow band signal level estimator are employed to apply the countermeasures {{that are able to}} maintain the data bit error rate required by the use...|$|E
