5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E

40|$|Time <b>Limit</b> <b>for</b> Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This time limit thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of time limits. It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of time limits. Part Two explains general aspects of the time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of time limits. Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the time <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment.

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
