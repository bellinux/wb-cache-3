500|$|In 2004 he {{commissioned}} modern harpsichord {{music by}} English composer John Webb, whose Surge (2004) [...] "is {{built up over}} an implacable rhythmic repeat-figure. Though neither is explicitly tonal, each skilfully avoids the merely percussive effect that the harpsichord's complex overtones can all too easily impart to more densely dissonant music." [...] He has also played the same composer's Ebb (2000), which [...] "comprises a spasmodic discourse against a manic background of descending scale patterns <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of out-of-kilter change-ringing".|$|E
500|$|The novel {{approaches}} allegory {{in many of}} its details, such as {{the green}} plums of the title. Mothers warn their children not to eat green, unripe plums, claiming that they are poisonous. Yet the novel regularly depicts police officers gorging themselves on the fruit: [...] "The officers' lack of constraint in engulfing the fruit parallels the remorseless persecution of the human race" [...] under Nicolae Ceauşescu. The green plums also suggest childhood, or regression into childhood: [...] "The narrator watches the Romanian police guards {{in the streets of}} the city as they greedily pocket green plums... 'They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality." ...|$|E

500|$|Brock hypothesises {{that it is}} not a ghost, {{but that}} somehow the stone in the room has {{preserved}} an image of the girl's death—this [...] "stone tape" [...] may be the new recording medium they have been seeking. Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also see images, but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the [...] "tape" [...] does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during [...] to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of telepathy.|$|E
2500|$|Barceloneta has {{recently}} added {{the use of}} trolly cars free of charge for local transport within the town itself. If you're looking to go further than the town limits, there is a station for [...] "carros publicos" [...] or public car transportation. These work <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of taxi and, for a small fee, {{will take you to}} the next town, for example, Manati.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century Lüchow's was prospering, and a good part of the bottom line came from beer sales. Although he was not the first man to serve these fine {{imported}} beers in America, he was first to make them popular, a fact attested to by the popular song Harry Von Tilzer wrote to honor August and his restaurant, [...] "Down Where the Würzburger Flows". [...] "The song traveled from Fourteenth Street to the beer gardens of Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and far beyond, and attained such popularity that August declared in some bewilderment: 'I feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of beer Columbus!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Floaters {{have been}} {{reported}} in patients as young as 3. Floaters in teenage patients and young adults are usually harder to treat. For persons in this age group, the floater that is seen usually looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of translucent worm/web/cell. [...] Very little is known about this region, and it only becomes distinct after the vitreous humour detaches from the retina at later stages of life. Due to their microscopic size they cannot be seen by doctors. They only appear as big as they do because of their proximity to the retina. This type of floater is still described occasionally in people in their 30s and very rarely occurs in people in their 40s.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of little holiday {{from my own}} work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, {{it became clear that}} we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
50|$|One of ED's lieutenants, accidentally {{defeated}} by Kon's swivel chair. He {{is the youngest}} of the group, despite being a major sadist; admitted himself when trying to go up against Kon's party solo. He's been intrigued with the idea of nudity, shown when he gladly joined Gustave 's plan to distract Kon by nudity and when he stripped into his underwear during Incognito's karoke vacation. Variation is as well the most normal one in the group; he answered KT by sharing that he <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> girls. He shows distrust with his high rank superiors, the Ulga Sorority. He is very skilled in spying.|$|R
5000|$|In rather {{different}} fashion, Doris Lessing argued that [...] "there is no fool <b>like</b> <b>an</b> intellectual ... <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of clever stupidity, bred {{out of a}} line of logic in the head, nothing to do with experience." ...|$|R
50|$|Errenzhuan is <b>a</b> popular <b>kind</b> {{of opera}} that {{evolved from a}} folk dance called dongbeidayangge and folk songs <b>like</b> lianhualao, <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of ballad. Jilin opera is a recent invention, coming from 1959, while Fuyu County's Xincheng opera is based on Man {{octagonal}} drum music. The Huanglong opera of Nong'an County is based on shadow play.|$|R
2500|$|Cleckley concludes {{from his}} {{clinical}} {{experience that the}} cause of the disorder of psychopathy is probably not, in general, demonstrably psychodynamic or even psychogenic, although life influences {{may play a role in}} some cases and he notes the progression of the disorder can seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of social and spiritual (but not actual) suicide, or [...] "semi-suicide". He suggests rather that a subtle yet profound defect at a fundamental biological level, probably inborn in some sense but not hereditary (gives the example of agenesis of the embryo) could be the main cause. He admits [...] "This, too, is still a speculative concept and is not supported by demonstrable evidence." [...] Having called it a defect, he notes that it would be [...] "one that affects complex mechanisms of integration in a subtle and abstruse manner", and as such could actually sometimes be a positive trait or ability which could nevertheless end up bringing about personal problems in society.|$|E
2500|$|Besides the {{previously}} mentioned family of popular 40-mm grenades, {{the only other}} major use of a High-Low System was by the Swedish firm FFV in their development of the 1960s-era Miniman one man infantry antitank weapon. [...] The Miniman was simpler and cheaper than anything imagined by designers in World War II. [...] Inside {{what looked like a}} rocket launcher tube, is a HEAT projectile attached by a break away bolt to an alloy aluminum tube with ports drilled in it and which acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of high-pressure chamber. [...] The launch tube in which it is mounted acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] When the propellant is ignited in the aluminum tube, gases escape through the ports and are allowed to build up in the launch tube to the point of almost causing a recoil. [...] The break-away bolt then snaps, allowing the projectile to move forward. [...] Unlike other High-Low Systems, gases are allowed to escape {{to the rear of the}} launch tube, achieving a totally recoilless effect.|$|E
2500|$|Diving cliffs: The {{area around}} Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of grotto, with many lower-intensity attractions. One {{was a pair}} of diving cliffs—one 23 feet (7 m), the other 18 feet (5.4 m)—above a 16-foot (5 m) deep pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be {{swimming}} in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them - or right on top of them. [...] The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions. Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white {{to make it easier to}} spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes. Still operating, known as Canyon Cliffs.|$|E
6000|$|Throughout {{all this}} my lord was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cold, <b>kind</b> spectator with his wits about him. At the first cry, which was indeed {{enough to call}} the house about us, he {{had said to me}} over his shoulder, [...] "Close the door." [...] And now he nodded to himself.|$|R

40|$|The {{collaboration}} and parallel mechanisms in a spatial multi-agent system Geo-Agents are explored and analysed in details. GIS agent in Geo-Agents are designed as four types: system manager – Facilitator, users or applications oriented agent- Interface Agent, spatial task undertaker – GIS Function Agent, and spatial database manager- GuServer. In Geo-Agents, Collaboration is embodied in two aspects: (1) collaboration among interface agents. Three types of collaboration among interface agents are discussed: direct cooperation, peer group cooperation and charge-tributary group cooperation. (2) collaboration under control of interface agent. Geo-Agents <b>likes</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of cluster parallel system, and parallel is performed by GIS function agents. Parallel of GIS function agents {{takes place in}} collaboration under control of interface agent, and exists as three modes: isomorphic cooperative parallel, heterogeneous cooperative parallel and exclusive parallel...|$|R
5000|$|... “For me, one of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} with pure documentary photography is how the photographer, like the artist, engineers something to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>kind</b> of social statement—for instance, you can make someone look miserable, when this is just one side, a nuance of their personality. They might just be looking away at something, but their expression could be read as showing <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of depression in their overall behavior. I couldn’t bear the idea of taking photographs of people without knowing.” ...|$|R
