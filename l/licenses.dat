5|$|Because the law grants a {{municipality}} significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities {{are currently}} dry. Conversely, {{because of the}} grandfathering of <b>licenses,</b> several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of <b>licenses.</b> For instance, the resort town of Wildwood has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor <b>licenses.</b>|$|E
5|$|On , 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the {{landmark}} case of Obergefell v. Hodges, , holding {{that the fundamental}} right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Fourteen counties in three Southern states continued to deny marriage <b>licenses</b> for same-sex marriage. The Alabama Supreme Court allowed the probate judges of ten counties in Alabama to deny such marriage <b>licenses,</b> the clerk of one Texas county chose to resign rather than issue such <b>licenses,</b> and the clerks of two counties in Kentucky were not issuing <b>licenses</b> due to paperwork delays. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear ordered all Kentucky county clerks to begin issuing same-sex marriage <b>licenses</b> immediately.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, {{asking for}} an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage <b>licenses,</b> as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage <b>licenses</b> in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage <b>licenses.</b> David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage <b>licenses,</b> she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} <b>licenses.</b> Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the <b>licenses</b> being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the <b>licenses</b> issued or the means by which the marriage <b>licenses</b> were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms <b>licenses.</b> The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C <b>licenses,</b> while E <b>licenses</b> remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E <b>licenses).</b> The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms <b>licenses</b> by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>License</b> plate {{localization}} {{is considered}} {{as the most}} important part of <b>license</b> plate recognition system. The high accuracy rate of <b>license</b> plate recognition is depended on the ability of <b>license</b> plate detection. This paper presents a novel method for <b>license</b> plate localization bases on <b>license</b> plate features. This proposed method consists of two main processes. First, candidate regions extraction step, Sobel operator is applied to obtain vertical edges and then potential candidate regions are extracted by deploying mathematical morphology operations [5]. Last, <b>license</b> plate verification step, this step employs the standard deviation of <b>license</b> plate features to confirm <b>license</b> plate position. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high quality <b>license</b> plate localization results with high accuracy rate of 98. 26 %.
