500|$|In October 2004, Brosnan said he {{considered}} himself dismissed from the role. Although Brosnan had been rumoured frequently as {{still in the}} running to play 007, he had denied it several times, and in February 2005 he posted on his website that he was finished with the role. Daniel Craig took over the role on 14 October 2005. In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Brosnan was asked {{what he thought of}} Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. He replied, [...] "I'm <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> like we're all <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Daniel Craig is a great actor and he's going to do a fantastic job". He reaffirmed this support in an interview to the International Herald Tribune, stating that [...] " [...] on his way to becoming a memorable Bond." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis said, [...] "It {{was a huge}} thrill. I {{was excited}} to be picked by New York." [...] He {{received}} fatherly advice from his dad, and recalled: [...] He just said they've got the best fans, and it's a blast because every game is live or die for them. It's a great environment to grow up playing baseball, {{and learning how to}} play under pressure in front of all those people. He loved it, and I'm <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> too.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Red Dress" [...] {{was directed by}} Tim Royes and filmed in January 2006. Berrabah revealed details about the music video during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "We're shooting the vid this week with director Tim Royce. We're really <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as {{there are going to}} be lots of costume changes. It's going to have a catwalk show theme with lots of mad outfits – very [...] over the top and extravagant – we can't wait!" [...] Royes went on to direct the music video for Sugababes' single [...] "Easy" [...] in the same year. The Sugababes wore endorsed hosiery in scenes for the video as part of their endorsement with Pretty Polly.|$|E

500|$|... "Book of the Stranger" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. He joined the series as a director in the sixth season. He also directed the previous episode, [...] "Oathbreaker". In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in front of you, and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record. I didn't want to tour, I was too tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> it's going to be unbelievable. [...] I would love to try to roll a little bit of 'Orange County Girl' in there. We'll see. Anything can happen in rehearsals. I don't even know how long the show can be right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1954, Florance's 18-year-old {{daughter}} Susan Oyston {{fell from}} the roof of the nine-storey National Bank building in Collins Street, Melbourne, where she worked. Florance said at the time she believed the fall was accidental, saying, [...] "She had her bags all packed to go to Cairns for a holiday, and was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> eagerly...She often went [...] in the early morning, and in her lunch-hour to enjoy the sunshine and the breeze". She later told interviewer Sam Newman she thought it was probably suicide and that she had failed her daughter.

2500|$|In 2001, an {{upcoming}} storyline, involving Zoe and Kat, when Zoe asks {{if she can}} live with Harry. [...] The News of the World reported that Kat would tell Zoe that she was actually her mother and that Harry had raped {{her when she was}} 13. An EastEnders source said, [...] "Zoe thinks her mother is dead—but the truth is very different." [...] In 2002, a story where Zoe runs away with Anthony to get married in secret was announced. That year, Ryan was rested from the soap on doctor's orders, by agreement from Louise Berridge, the executive producer, Ryan and her parents. Plans for character developments between Zoe and Anthony were delayed and plans for their on-screen marriage were pushed back, with the wedding storyline being re-written. In September that year, Ryan said she would return and was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> and Berridge said she was [...] "delighted" [...] and hoped viewers would look forward to Zoe being reunited with the rest of her family.|$|E
2500|$|Rehearsals for {{the live}} {{section of the}} episode started on 21 July 2012 and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some {{tentative}} rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, [...] "Summer arrives {{just in time for}} me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On the plus side, I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!" [...] He explained that he was inspired by Usain Bolt, saying, [...] "I watched a documentary on him [...] and he's inspired me to torch bear. Obviously I won't be going [...] near as fast him!" [...] He had to check the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> being over. He practiced the route at least 100 times, using washing line rope instead of the flame, and had cut down on alcohol to prepare. He was worried about sustaining an injury during rehearsals and about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character.|$|E
2500|$|Foley then {{returned}} to ECW to team with Tommy Dreamer. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley wasn't unique. Cactus began a gimmick where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce {{his status as a}} hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling to make people upset. He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with The Pitbulls against Raven, Stevie Richards and The Dudley Brothers (Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). [...] Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve Raven's [...] "higher purpose". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated 911. As part of Foley's heel gimmick, he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In Have a Nice Day, Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of [...] "You sold out" [...] by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater Shane Douglas, who won when he put Jack into a figure four leglock that allowed Mikey Whipwreck to hit him repeatedly with a steel chair. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, [...] "Please don't go!". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie to Frank Sinatra's song [...] "New York, New York". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.|$|E
