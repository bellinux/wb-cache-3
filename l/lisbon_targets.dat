Both the employment and the innovation rate in the economy {{have a major impact on}} the overall participation rate. Furthermore, comprehensive education systems appear to generate higher participation. A high overall participation rate in LLL is strongly associated with fewer social inequalities in participation.

The Italian labour market shows remarkable gender inequalities notwithstanding the advanced labour market regulation in terms of Equal Opportunities. Italian women still experience many inequalities at their workplaces such as: wage differences, lower career paths, higher percentages of fixed-term and short-term contracts, etc. Women’s employment rate on average in Italy was 46. 6 % in year 2007 (Istat, Labour Force Survey data) far below the 60 % <b>Lisbon</b> <b>target</b> and far below men’s employment rate (70. 7 %). This fact produces difficulties in a good connection between quality of work and life. From the other side the high level of paid and unpaid work, due to the assistance at home of children and elder people produces analogous difficulties in quality of work and children wellbeing. The results we present are relative to a research devoted to a “level of certification” of private Italian firms who respect equal opportunities between men and women. For this evaluation we use a Fuzzy Expert System (FES). The scope for using FES is connected not only to the multidimensional nature of certification and to the need of providing its synthetic indicator without losing its complexity, but even with the composite group of experts involved.

Of 135 countries, the World Economic Forum (2011) ranks Italy in 90 th place in Economic Participation and Opportunity {{because women are}} much more likely to be unemployed (or out of the labor force) and to earn less than men. 2 The average employment rate for Italian female workers in 2010 was 46 %, well below the abovementioned European <b>Lisbon</b> strategy <b>target</b> of 60 %, and only two out of twenty Italian regions reached the 2010 target. 3 The average male [...] employment rate, 69 %, was almost on target (70 %) in all Italian regions.

Several governments have therefore tried, albeit with varied success, to liberalise their employment laws {{in order to}} meet the <b>Lisbon</b> employment <b>targets.</b> This project examines such efforts in the EU’s new member states and accession countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC 10 +Croatia). The aim is to understand not only the causes of national variation in EPL strictness and their consequences for employment, but also the dynamics of EPL reforms over time and conditions that make these politically difficult reforms viable. To this end, the project will develop a comparative database of EPL reforms documenting annual changes in employment protection since 1990, and political and economic factors associated with these reforms. To examine whether there may be more than one recipe for good/bad employment performance, statistical analysis and standard regression techniques will be combined with state-of-the-art qualitative methods in the form of crisp-set and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). By recognising that poor employment performance may not have the same causes in all countries, this analysis may provide evidence against one-size-fits-all policy recommendations, which often wrongly assume that what works in one country will work everywhere...|$|R

We find that R&D activity in the EU is a direct Granger-cause of both R&D and economy-wide productivity in the US, and the effects are negative. On the other hand, the EU reacts positively to increases in R&D productivity in the US. Thus, the US can be said to respond submissively to an R&D move by the EU, while the EU’s reaction to the R&D efforts by the US firms is on the aggressive side. These findings are largely in line with the actual developments in the productivity differentials between the EU and the US and the patterns in their relative shares in the world market for high tech exports.

The latter acknowledges the diversity of national socio-economic models and reluctance of member states to transfer key areas of economic and social policy-making to the EU level.

The lack of commitment amongst member states towards applying the OMC and the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>targets</b> as a basis for national policy development illustrates that the Commission has yet to achieve a consensus amongst the EU- 27 member states on common economic and social policy priorities.

40|$|Abstract: The {{innovation}} performance {{effects are}} considered the key indicators {{of the success of}} innovation activity. Their quantification is however difficult and its results, especially when based on a traditional industry approach, call for careful interpretation in countries with an incomplete value chain and underdeveloped local knowledge base. In the paper, alternative approaches are presented, which consider the significance of qualitative characteristics of the innovation performance effects and allow a more sophisticated analysis of their components at a microeconomic level. Attention is given to four cross-sectional indicators which evaluate the sources of competitive advantage as quality-based as opposed to cost-based (in the combination of the completeness of the value chain and the sophistication of company operations), the level of cluster development (assessed in terms of the frequency and intensity of the links between participating entities), the level of technological readiness (according to dependence on external sources of technology knowledge {{and the quality of the}} specific research and skill inputs) and the knowledge-intensity of employment (according to the significance of quality-intensive occupations). By using the given indicators, firstly, the position of countries within the EU- 25 is defined in a matrix of the innovation performance effects, and, secondly, their key characteristics in the new member countries of the EU are identified. Conclusions formulate the related challenges for the policy support focused to overcome the new EU entrants lagging behind in the transition to knowledge-based economy and achieving the <b>Lisbon</b> strategy <b>targets...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the participation {{of women in the}} labour market and source of policy-marking interest in the subject can be considered from various points of view. First, a higher average degree of female education, and the changing of cultural models regarding the division of roles within the family, have resulted in a higher preference by women for work on the market. Second, interest in this issue also aries from the deep changes that have occured, and still occur, within the family structure: the older age at which families are started and the rise of divorce and separation contribute to the spreading of families headed by single women, who cannot rely on a spouse for economic support. Finally, the rise of female employment is vitally important for the sustainability of social protection system, in a context defined by the fast and relevant ageing of the population and by the widespread reduction in fertility rates. The latter phenomenon is extrremely relevant in Italy, where the fertility rate is one of the lowest among OECD countries. According to forecasts, by 2020 the eldeerly dependency index - i. e. the ratio of population above age 64 to the working age population (age rank 15 - 64) - will surpass 30 % (Visco, 2000). The low fertility rate implies the impossibility of increasing labour supply through demographic dynamics; an increase in female labour force becomes, therefore, a fundamental tool for the overall growth of employment. The increse in female employment is an important goal also at Eurpean level: briding the gap between the female employment rates in the EU and the USA would increase the number of employed women in Europe by 21 milion (European Commission, 2000), and Eurpean policy makers believe that the EU "must set itself the goal of restoring full employment as the key objective of economic and social policy" (European Commission, 2000). In light of this, the Lisbon strategy states that the female employment rate in the European Union should reach 60 % by 2010, up from 51 % now. Meeting this goal is an especially difficult task for Italy, where the female employment rate in 2001 was 41. 6 %. The participation rate was also much lower than 60 % - in the same year it was at 48 % - indicating how distant the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>target</b> is, {{even in the absence of}} unemployment. Indeed, in Italy women employment is low not only because female unemployment rate is high, but also because partecipation rate is small; the latter can be seen as an indication of "volontary" non-employment. Therefore, the partecipation rate is the first issue to address if the goal is to increase female employment. Figure 1 shows the female employment, unemployment and partecipation rates in Italy and in the European Union from 1979 to 2001. From the graph one can infer two especially interesting phenomena. First, there is a marked increase in the rates of female employment and partecipation both in Italy and the EU, while the ratio of unemployed women to working age female population and the unemployment rate do not vary greatly. This suggest that the better employment performance of women over the last 20 years is largely tied to a shifting of preference towards jobs on the market, rather than better demand conditions...|$|R
