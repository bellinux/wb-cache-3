Environmental noise exposure represents a burden to people and can result in cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance or annoyance. Road traffic noise is a main contributor to environmental noise, thus, {{it is intended to}} be reduced and limited by legislation in order to increase health and life quality. Vehicle <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> tests are conducted according to the international standard ISO 362, which is suppose to reflect the noise emission of a vehicle in an urban traffic environment. It is discussed that nowadays urban traffic situation requires a change of the test procedure with accompanying reductions in <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> limits. To achieve compliance with the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> test it is important that vehicle engineers have access to predictive tools at the design stage.

40|$|International audienceDue to legislation, {{exterior}} noise targets have been continuously reduced {{in the last}} decades and a new normalsation <b>for</b> <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> is expected. Thus, a numerical tool to predict the noise radiated from a vehicle in an early design stage is needed. Due to the large frequency range {{to be taken into}} account [100 Hz- 2. 5 kHz], the complexity of the domain to be simulated (partial enclosures, exterior field) and the number of DOFs to be considered, {{exterior noise}} simulation reaches the limits of standard deterministic method like FEM or BEM. In the frame of the European project VISPeR, a benchmark of several numerical methodologies aiming at exterior noise simulation has been conducted by the partners Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF), INSA Lyon, Ecole Centrale de Lyon (ECL) and Rieter. Simple test cases with different treatment configurations, the mock-up of an engine comprtment as well as a real engine compartment have been considered. Deterministic LF methods like indirect BEM and FEM/FEM were tested for their potential to be extended to higher frequencies with a descretisation criterion of lambda/ 6 and a realistic number of DOFs. The Patch Acoustic Impedance PAI method, developed at INSA Lyon and applied together with CRF, is aiming at coupling two uncoupled calculations (one interior, one exterior), thus offering a potential for optimisation. Energetic methods adapted rather for the HF range, like incoherent ray-tracing, applied by Rieter, and the "simplified energy method" SEM method, developed and applied at ACL-LTDS, have been tested.

SNCF has therefore developed the software VAMPPASS dedicated to <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> simulation. The synthesis method implemented in VAMPPASS requires the definition of equivalent noise sources representative to real noise sources on the train. Equivalent sources definition is mainly based on experimental characterization. Measurement methods based on 1 D-array devices have been optimized on a real train and post-processing methods have been developed for identifying mono-multipole equivalent sources, defined with the spherical harmonics formalism. This kind of method needs a heavy optimization process, applied on several parameters. It can imply large error coefficients on the radiated pressure field. The present study aims to investigate the potential of Equivalent Source Method (ESM, a transfer matrix based method) to fulfil the requirements of VAMPPASS. In the first chapter, the ESM basis is presented. The second chapter is dedicated to the ESM implementation on a train scale model, with multi-monopoles or multi-dipoles equivalent sources.

40|$|International audienceRolling {{noise is}} the major {{contribution}} to train <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise.</b> Array processing provides noise maps of the source location on the train.

Flexion wave causes the rail to radiate in privileged direction due to fluid structure interaction. Beamforming processing identifies this acoustical radiation only under particular conditions, which is an explanation to the underestimation of the rail radiation on the global noise map of the train.

To be able to meet the upcoming, stricter regulations, the automotive OEMs seeks new techniques to be able to front load the <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> engineering in the vehicle development process and to identify and understand the different sources that contributes to the exterior noise. Earlier exterior sources ranking using ASQ (Airborn Source Quantification) with an energetic approach during <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> test has yielded very good and reliable results for an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicle. In this Master Thesis, two exterior source ranking methods have been tested and evaluated for an electric vehicle during in-room <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> test. The two methods were: ASQ and OPA (Operational Path Analysis). In total, five models were built from the two methods and each model was evaluated for, in total, three driving conditions corresponding to the current ISO 362 - 1 : 2007 and the proposed, revised version. The results show that the ASQ models are not capable to correctly estimate the engine contribution due to its high tonality. Moreover, it was seen that the energetic ASQ model is very sensitive to small changes. Both ASQ models underestimated the tire noise. The OPA model on the other hand managed to estimate the total contribution very well. Both the engine contribution and the tire contributions are well estimated. Nevertheless, OPA as method has several weaknesses and building an OPA model is not a straightforward task. Its weaknesses and the process to reach a final OPA model are discussed in this thesis. It was seen that one of the most crucial steps in an OPA model is to have clean references to get meaningful results. A MIMO-FIR filter was therefore used to filter out engine harmonics from the tire references. Its principles and importance for the end results are also discussed.

The strongest sympathetic stress reaction as measured by SCL was found for the older female group. In regression analysis, the SCL response was predicted by the female gender and low score of sensation seeking only (adjusted R 2 = 0. 139). The FPA response was strongest among the young men and age was the only significant predictor. For affective responses of pleasantness and activation, regression analysis proved noise sensitivity and sensation seeking to be significant predictors (adjusted R 2 = 0. 187 respectively 0. 154).

This case study is performed {{as part of a}} project which aims at developing a numerical tool for prediction of rail corrugation growth on curves. The development of corrugation on a 120 m radius curve of the Stockholm metro has been monitored by repeated measurements of rail roughness and train <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise.</b> Within a grinding interval of 1 year, severe short-pitch corrugation was build up with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm. Spectral analysis of measurement data shows large roughness magnitudes in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm, with peaks at approximately 5 cm and 8 cm. The corrugation pattern has a pure longitudinal direction (with corrugation ridges transverse to the track direction) and an irregularly varying magnitude along the 100 m long measured track section. The roughness growth rate increased with time until 300 days after rail grinding, thereafter only moderate additional roughness growth was observed. Because of moderate train speeds of about 30 km/h, the rolling noise caused by the corrugation has a low-frequency content (< 200 Hz). A 10. 1 dB unit increase (139 - 300 days after grinding) in roughness level in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm was found to correspond to an increase in rolling noise level in the frequency interval 60 - 200 Hz of 4. 9 dB.

In such methods the inuence {{of the road}} surface type is taken into account through a correction to the noise emission level determined for the so-called reference surface. Depending {{on the kind of}} car-riageway surface and its condition the road noise emission level may vary by several dB, which signicantly affects the determined road noise propagation range. The paper presents the results of <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> measurements <b>for</b> vehicles moving in the real city trafc. The investigations were carried out for 11 road with different pavements typical for city streets in Poland, including asphalt, asphalt concrete, stone mastic asphalt and cobblestones pavements. Also the results of comparative analyses of measurements and NMPB calculations for the investigated are be presented...|$|R
40|$|Low noise road {{pavements}} can {{be considered}} as attractive means for road traffic noise reduction. An overview of the current low noise pavements used in France is presented in this paper. Their acoustic performances and the strategies of use are discussed. In parallel to the development of low noise pavements, measurement methods were developed in order to quantify their acoustic performance. This performance can be introduced in noise predicting models, or can give relevant information to support strategic decisions of road authorities. The <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> measurement method is traditionally used for this evaluation, but due to many restrictions of application, dynamic close proximity measurement devices (CPX) are currently developed all around the world. The CPX method recently standardized in France is described in the paper. Then the use of these methods for the acoustic monitoring of road networks is illustrated through two applications: the effect of ageing and the effect of pavement discontinuities on acoustic performances...|$|R
40|$|Global {{competition}} requires {{product development}} cycles to bring technology innovation into new products while consistently shortening time to market. In software industry, new product releases are yearly launched to commercially better exploit technology added value. Such a fast changing scenario {{makes it very}} hard for users to get acquainted with newly implemented functionalities. This problem is even more critical in case commercial software - often very technical - is used to simplify complex industrial applications. A typical example in NVH measurement is pass-by-noise testing, where complex test set-up and strict data validation procedures require several expert operators to perform the test. This paper presents a multiagent system that assists a single non-expert test engineer to correctly perform <b>pass-by</b> <b>noise</b> measurement. The proposed solution uses interface agent technology to control the data acquisition system, deal with the complex test set-up and perform automatic and on-line data validation check on measured data. status: publishe...|$|R
