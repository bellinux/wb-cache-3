5|$|Mihardja {{later wrote}} that he {{intended}} the novel {{to deal with the}} question of the existence of God. Mahayana et al. agree, noting that the theme of faith– a theme unknown in modern Indonesian <b>literature</b> <b>at</b> the time– is found throughout the novel. Maier notes that the psychological concepts of guilt, fear, and remorse drive the novel. Teeuw describes the work as taking up the classic theme of modernity versus tradition in a new, more worldly manner. Balfas writes that this approach to the theme was soon followed by other writers.|$|E

5|$|Propagated {{from seed}} {{collected}} by William Baxter in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825.

Knopf literary fellowship, and in May her application was judged the best of the forty-four entries.|$|E

His good looks are also seen as a physical manifestation of his moral and kind nature.|$|E
