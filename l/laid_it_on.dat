25|$|In {{the dying}} {{seconds of the}} game with Adelaide {{trailing}} by four points, McLeod raced into an open forward line while being hotly pursued by Hawk Ray Jencke. Swooping onto the loose ball, he calmly <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his foot under pressure, dribbling it through for a miraculous goal from a tight angle at the Northern End of the ground to give his side a remarkable 2-point victory after they had trailed by 34 points at half-time. The Crows were able to avenge their worst ever home loss in history the year before (Round 9 1994 by 97 points to Hawthorn).|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, Carson {{told his}} life story to someone who wrote it down. This book is called Memoirs. The {{manuscript}} was lost when taken East to find a professional writer who would work it into a book. Washington Irving was asked, but declined. The lost manuscript {{was found in a}} trunk in Paris in 1905. It was later printed. The first biography of Carson was written by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859. The book was called Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself. When the book was read to Carson he said, [...] "Peters <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a leetle too thick." ...|$|E
2500|$|After graduation, Buchanan {{became a}} {{principal}} {{at a public}} high school, in the Houghton school in Detroit. In 1870, she moved to Chicago {{to pursue a career}} in journalism. Her reception by the Chicago editors was anything but favorable. Her youth and sex, they told her frankly, were against her. It was some time, therefore, before she received a position on any of the Chicago dailies. During the time when she was without regular work, she wrote continuously, sending her stories to the various papers. Her manuscripts, as a rule, were accepted but the acceptances brought her no staff position. The editors refused consistently to take a woman on their papers. The first story which she had accepted was an account of the reception at Sacred Heart Convent, where she boarded during her first years in Chicago. She took the story to the offices of the Chicago Times and <b>laid</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the desk of the managing editor. He picked it up, glanced at it and gave Sullivan US$5. A few days later, as she was walking down Madison Avenue, some one tapped her on the shoulder. It was the editor of the Times. “I am sorry, Miss Buchanan, that I did not read your article before I paid you. It was extremely well written and worth more than five dollars.” At that, he handed her a $10 bill. Margaret Buchanan was 20 {{years old at the time}} and bore a striking resemblance to Rosa Bonheur.|$|E
