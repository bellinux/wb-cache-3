40|$|Background: Ablation of the low-affinity {{receptor}} subunit for leukemia inhibitory factor (<b>LIFR)</b> causes multi-systemic {{defects in}} the late gestation fetus. Because corticosterone {{is known to have}} a broad range of effects and LIF function has been associated with the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal axis, {{this study was designed to}} determine the role for <b>LIFR</b> in the fetus when exposed to the elevated maternal glucocorticoid levels of late gestation. Uncovering a requirement for <b>LIFR</b> in appropriate glucocorticoid response will further understanding of control of glucocorticoid function. Methods: Maternal adrenalectomy or RU 486 administration were used to determine the impact of the maternal glucocorticoid surge on fetal development in the absence of <b>LIFR.</b> The mice were analyzed by a variety of histological techniques including immunolabeling and staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin, Alizarin red S and alcian blue). Plasma corticosterone was assayed using radioimmunoassay. Results: Maternal adrenalectomy does not improve the prognosis for <b>LIFR</b> null pups and exacerbates the effects of <b>LIFR</b> loss. RU 486 noticeably improves many of the tissues affected by <b>LIFR</b> loss: bone density, skeletal muscle integrity and glial cell formation. <b>LIFR</b> null pups exposed during late gestation to RU 486 in utero survive natural delivery, unlike <b>LIFR</b> null pups from untreated litters. But RU 486 treated <b>LIFR</b> null pups succumb within the first day after birth, presumably due to neural deficit resulting in an inability to suckle. Conclusion: <b>LIFR</b> plays an integral role in modulating the fetal response to elevated maternal glucocorticoids during late gestation. This role is likely to be mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor and has implications for adult homeostasis as a direct tie between immune, neural and hormone function. ...|$|R

Here we report that the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR),</b> one of the signaling molecules shared by several neuropoietic cytokines of the interleukin- 6 family, is specifically up-regulated in PC 12 cells following treatment with NGF. Attenuation of <b>LIFR</b> signaling through stable transfection of antisense- or dominant negative-LIFR constructs enhances NGF-induced neurite extension in PC 12 cells. On the contrary, overexpression of <b>LIFR</b> retards the growth of neurites.

40|$|Leukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF), cardiotrophin- 1, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and oncostatin M (OSM) lead to heterodimerization of LIF receptor (<b>LIFR)</b> or the OSM-specific receptor (OSMR) with glycoprotein (gp) 130, {{the common}} receptor subunit for IL- 6 -type cytokines. Thereby intracellular signaling via Janus kinases (Jaks) and STAT transcription factors is initiated. We investigated {{the contributions of}} <b>LIFR</b> and OSMR to signal transduction {{in the context of}} heterodimers with gp 130. Chimeric receptors based on the extracellular parts of the IL- 5 R alpha- and beta-chains were generated, allowing the induced heterodimerization of two different cytoplasmic tails. Our studies demonstrate that upon heterodimerization with the gp 130 cytoplasmic region, the cytoplasmic parts of both <b>LIFR</b> and OSMR were critical for activation of an acute phase protein promoter in HepG 2 hepatoma cells. The membrane-proximal region of <b>LIFR</b> or OSMR was crucial for the ability of such receptor complexes to induce DNA binding of STAT 1 and STAT 3 in COS- 7 cells. Membrane-distal regions of <b>LIFR</b> and OSMR contributed to STAT activation {{even in the absence of}} gp 130 STAT recruitment sites. We further show that the Janus kinases Jak 1 and Jak 2 constitutively associated with receptor constructs containing the cytoplasmic part of <b>LIFR,</b> OSMR, or gp 130, respectively. Homodimers of the <b>LIFR</b> or OSMR cytoplasmic regions did not elicit responses in COS- 7 cells but did in HepG 2 cells and in MCF- 7 breast carcinoma cells.

40|$|AbstractLeukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF) is {{a member}} of the IL- 6 cytokine family that functions in the survival, repair and formation of neurons as well as in the maintenance of neural and embryonic stem cells. The functions of LIF have been well documented in mammals, however until recently, the presence of IL- 6 family cytokines in ectothermic vertebrates has only been speculated. We report on the identification of lif and <b>lifr</b> transcripts in the zebrafish and document the expression of these molecules in the developing embryos and tissues of adult zebrafish. We also examined the phylogenetic relationship between these molecules and other IL- 6 cytokine family members known in mammals. In adult zebrafish, lif is expressed in the kidney and brain while <b>lifr</b> is expressed in the kidney, gill, brain, spleen and liver. During zebrafish embryogenesis, lif and <b>lifr</b> are both expressed as early as 12  hours postfertilization (hpf). In developing zebrafish, lif is expressed in the otic vesicle, retina and cranial sensory ganglia, and <b>lifr</b> is strongly expressed in the notochord, forebrain, otic vesicle, cranial ganglia and the retina. Morpholino knockdown of Lif and <b>Lifr</b> in developing embryos suggests that <b>Lifr,</b> but not Lif is required for proper neural development. <b>lifr</b> morpholino-injected embryos exhibit defects in the trigeminal, facial and vagal branchiomotor neurons, and improper axonal development as measured by acetylated tubulin staining. These embryos also display severe hydrocephaly by 48  hpf. This suggests that <b>Lifrs</b> are involved in proper neural development in zebrafish.

40|$|The RUNX 1 {{transcription}} factor {{is an important}} regulator of haematopoiesis and {{has been found to}} influence gene activity at both the transcriptional and chromatin levels. In leukaemia, particularly Acute Myeloid Leukaemia, RUNX 1 activity is frequently altered by point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, the most common being the t(8; 21) translocation that produces a RUNX 1 -ETO fusion protein. While RUNX 1 is generally associated with gene activation, RUNX 1 -ETO mainly acts as a transcriptional repressor and its presence is therefore associated with altered expression of RUNX 1 target genes. Previous microarray analysis performed in our laboratory identified both the <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 genes as novel putative RUNX 1 targets. <b>LIFR</b> together with gp 130 forms a heterodimeric receptor complex that mediates LIF signalling, and in doing so controls various cellular processes including cellular development, differentiation and inflammatory responses. However, despite their important biological roles little is known about regulation of the <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 genes. Bioinformatic analysis identified potential RUNX 1 binding sites in the promoters of both the <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 genes, and this study therefore examined the hypothesis that <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 are RUNX 1 target genes and their altered expression in leukemic cells in which RUNX 1 is disrupted may therefore contribute to leukaemia. The <b>LIFR</b> gene is regulated by alternate promoters, with a so called ‘general’ and ‘placental’ promoter previously described. Analysis of <b>LIFR</b> mRNA across a number of cell types demonstrated that activity of the placental promoter is limited to cell lines of placental origin, while the general promoter is active in a range of cell types, including myeloid cells. This was confirmed by analysis of the chromatin status of the two promoters, which found that the general, but not placental promoter is assembled into highly acetylated histones in myeloid cells. The expression of the gp 130 mRNA was detected across all cells lines examined. Reporter analysis demonstrated that both the placental and general promoters can be activated by RUNX 1 in placental and myeloid cell lines respectively. In addition, the gp 130 promoter was activated by RUNX 1 in myeloid cell lines. In contrast, RUNX 1 -ETO repressed both the <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 promoters in myeloid cells. Further, binding of RUNX 1 to the endogenous <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 promoters was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the endogenous promoters are targeted by RUNX 1. In support of this RUNX 1 knockdown reduced <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 expression in myeloid cell lines, and decreased expression of the placental <b>LIFR</b> transcript in placental cells. Put together, the data presented in this thesis demonstrates that RUNX 1 regulates expression of the <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 promoters, suggesting that activity of the LIFR/gp 130 receptor complex is likely to be altered in leukaemic cells in which RUNX 1 is altered...|$|R

40|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) {{is a member}} of the gp 130 family of cytokines. The functional receptor complex of CNTF is composed of CNTF, the CNTF receptor α (CNTFR), gp 130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR).</b> Three regions on CNTF have been identified as binding sites for its receptors. The ligand-receptor interactions are mediated through the cytokine binding domains (CBD) and/or the immunoglobulin (Ig) -like domains of the receptors. However, in the case of CNTF, the precise nature of the protein-protein contacts in the signaling complex have not yet been resolved. The present study shows that the membrane distal CBD (CBD 1), the membrane proximal CBD (CBD 2) of <b>LIFR,</b> the CBD and Ig-like domain of gp 130 associate in vitro with CNTF. <b>LIFR</b> CBD 1 and gp 130 CBD associate in vitro with soluble CNTFR in the absence of CNTF. Alanine substitution of Lys 219 / Leu 220 in the B strand of the C-terminal (BC) module of the gp 130 CBD and Leu 155 /Lys 156 in the similar region of <b>LIFR</b> CBD 1 reduced their binding to sCNTFR. Alanine substitiution of Thr 268 and Asp 269 in the E strand of BC module of CNTFR result in the loss of its binding capacity to gp 130 CBD but not <b>LIFR</b> CBD 1. Moreover, the CBD of gp 130 competes with CBD 1 of <b>LIFR</b> for the binding of soluble CNTFR and both domains partially block CNTF signaling, suggesting that they bind to the same site on CNTFR other than the E strand. More importantly, these soluble CBDs enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or IL- 6 signaling in NT- 2 cells. These data provide the first evidence that soluble CNTFR can independently bind to <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130 in the absence of CNTF and raise the interesting possibility that CNTFR may pre-associate with the β receptor components of the CNTFR complex on the cell surface. Having established the structural details of CNTFR complex, we try to study the putative cross-talks between gp 130 -LIFR signaling and neurotrophins in the process of neuronal differentiation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the development of sympathetic neurons and subsets of sensory neurons. Current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological function of NGF is mainly based on the studies with PC 12 cells, which differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons with long neurite outgrowth upon NGF treatment. The present study demonstrates that expression of <b>LIFR,</b> but not gp 130 and CNTFR, is gradually upregulated in PC 12 cells when treated with NGF but not EGF. Attenuating <b>LIFR</b> signaling through stable transfection of antisense or dominant negative <b>LIFR</b> constructs enhanced NGF induced neurite extension in PC 12 cells. On the contrary, overexpression of <b>LIFR</b> retarded the neurite outgrowth and induced cell clumping. These novel findings suggest that <b>LIFR</b> signaling, besides its known function for cell survival and neuronal cell type switch, can be specifically induced by NGF and exert negative regulatory effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells...|$|R

Indeed, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity LIF receptor alpha-subunit (<b>LIFR)</b> in Mono Q-fractionated, LIF-stimulated 3 T 3 -L 1 extracts occurred only in those fractions containing activated MAPK; Ser- 1044 served as the major phosphorylation site in the human <b>LIFR</b> for MAPK both in agonist-stimulated 3 T 3 -L 1 lysates and by recombinant extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 in vitro.

To address this issue we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal or BC domain of CNTFR and studied the interactions of CNTFR with <b>LIFR</b> and gp 130. We reported previously that the membrane distal cytokine-binding domain (CBD 1) of <b>LIFR</b> could interact in vitro with soluble CNTFR (sCNTFR) in the absence of CNTF. Here we show that the CBD of human gp 130 can also bind in vitro to sCNTFR in the absence of CNTF. In addition, the gp 130 CBD could compete with the <b>LIFR</b> CBD 1 for the binding of sCNTFR. Substitution of residues in the gp 130 CBD, the <b>LIFR</b> CBD 1, and the CNTFR BC domain that are expected to be involved in receptor-receptor interactions significantly reduced their interactions. An NMR chemical shift perturbation study of the interaction between the BC domains of CNTFR and gp 130 further mapped the interaction surface.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) regulates gene transcription in cells in response to cytokines and growth factors. Activation of STAT 3 involves phosphorylation of both Tyr 705 and Ser 727, leading to dimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA binding of STAT 3. In the nervous system, STAT 3 signaling mediates the differentiation of neuronal and glial cells, as well as survival and phenotypic switching of subtypes of neurons. To further study the mechanism behind the inhibitory effect of <b>LIFR</b> signaling in neurite outgrowth, we have examined the activation of STAT 3 during NGF-induced differentiation in PC 12 cells. Upon treatment with NGF, phosphorylation of STAT 3 on Ser 727, but not Tyr 705, was detected in PC 12 cells. During different stages of neuronal development, phosphorylation of Ser 727 by NGF could be mediated through different signaling mechanisms, such as ERK pathway, H 7 - sensitive signaling pathway, PI 3 K and/or p 35 /CDK 5 pathway(s). We found that Ser 727 phosphorylation of STAT 3 induced by NGF could attenuate CNTF-induced Tyr 705 phosphorylation in <b>LIFR</b> overexpressing PC 12 cells. When Rac 1 and STAT 3 were overexpressed in COS- 7 and PC 12 cells, Rac 1 was found to associate with STAT 3. Both STAT 3 and Rac 1 could be detected in the growth cones of PC 12 cells during the initiation phase of neurite outgrowth. Activation of STAT 3 by NGF also enhanced its DNA binding ability and transcription activity. We propose that Ser 727 phosphorylation of STAT 3 could {{play an important role in}} NGF-induced neuronal differentiation...|$|R

LIF binds to the LIF receptor (<b>LIFR)</b> and activates the JAK-STAT 3 pathway, but it remains unknown how the receptor complex triggers differentiation or self-renewal. Here, we report that the <b>LIFR</b> cytoplasmic domain contains a self-renewal domain within the juxtamembrane region and a differentiation domain within the C-terminal region. The differentiation domain contains four SPXX repeats that are phosphorylated by MAPK to restrict STAT 3 activation; the self-renewal domain {{is characterized by a}} 3 K motif that is acetylated by p 300. In mESCs, acetyl-LIFR undergoes homodimerization, leading to STAT 3 hypo- or hyper-activation depending on {{the presence or absence of}} gp 130.

40|$|AbstractCiliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) {{is a member}} of the gp 130 family of cytokines. The functional receptor complex of CNTF is composed of the CNTF receptor α (CNTFR), gp 130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR).</b> Three regions on CNTF have been identified as binding sites for its receptors. The ligand–receptor interactions are mediated through the cytokine binding domains (CBDs) and/or the immunoglobulin-like domains of the receptors. However, in the case of CNTF, the precise nature of the protein–protein contacts in the signaling complex has not yet been resolved. In this study, we provide the first demonstration that the membrane distal CBD (CBD 1) of <b>LIFR</b> associates in vitro with soluble CNTFR in the absence of CNTF. Moreover, purified CBD 1 partially blocks CNTF signaling, but not that of interleukin- 6 or LIF, in human embryonal carcinoma cell line Ntera/D 1 cells. These data raise the possibility that <b>LIFR</b> has the capability to form a ligand-free complex with CNTFR...|$|R
40|$|Suppressor of {{cytokine}} signaling  3 (SOCS 3) binds cytokine receptors {{and thereby}} suppresses cytokine signaling. Deletion of SOCS 3 causes an embryonic lethality that is rescued by a tetraploid rescue approach, demonstrating {{an essential role}} in placental development and a non-essential role in embryo development. Rescued SOCS 3 -deficient mice show a perinatal lethality with cardiac hypertrophy. SOCS 3 -deficient placentas have reduced spongiotrophoblasts and increased trophoblast secondary giant cells. Enforced expression of SOCS 3 in a trophoblast stem cell line (Rcho- 1) suppresses giant cell differentiation. Conversely, SOCS 3 -deficient trophoblast stem cells differentiate more readily to giant cells in culture, demonstrating that SOCS 3 negatively regulates trophoblast giant cell differentiation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes giant cell differentiation in vitro, and LIF receptor (<b>LIFR)</b> deficiency results in loss of giant cell differentiation in vivo. Finally, <b>LIFR</b> deficiency rescues the SOCS 3 -deficient placental defect and embryonic lethality.

40|$|The {{receptor}} for leukemia inhibitory factor (<b>LIFR),</b> {{in combination}} with the signal-transducing subunit for interleukin- 6 -type cytokine receptors, gp 130, and LIF, activates transcription of acute-phase plasma protein genes in human and rat hepatoma cells and the vasoactive intestinal peptide gene in a human neuroblastoma cell line. To identify the regions within the cytoplasmic domain of <b>LIFR</b> that initiate signal transduction independently of gp 130, we constructed a chimeric receptor by linking the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of human <b>LIFR.</b> The function of the chimeric receptor protein in transcriptional activation was assessed by G-CSF-mediated stimulation of cotransfected cytokine-responsive reporter gene constructs in hepatoma and neuroblastoma cells. By using the full-length cytoplasmic domain and mutants with progressive carboxy-terminal deletions, internal deletions, or point mutations, we identified the first 150 amino acid residues of <b>LIFR</b> as the minimal region necessary for signaling. The signaling reaction appears to involve a cooperativity between the first 70 -amino-acid region containing the two sequence motifs conserved among hematopoietin receptors (box 1 and box 2) and a critical sequence between residues 141 and 150 (box 3). Analogous analyses of the cytoplasmic domains of G-CSFR and gp 130 indicated similar arrangements of functional domains in these receptor subunits and the requirement of a box 3 -related motif for signaling...|$|R
40|$|Stüve-Wiedemann {{syndrome}} (SWS) is {{a severe}} autosomal recessive condition characterized by bowing {{of the long}} bones, with cortical thickening, flared metaphyses with coarsened trabecular pattern, camptodactyly, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and hyperthermic episodes responsible for early lethality. Clinical overlap with Schwartz-Jampel type 2 syndrome (SJS 2) has suggested that SWS and SJS 2 could be allelic disorders. Through studying a series of 19 families with SWS/SJS 2, we have mapped the disease gene to chromosome 5 p 13. 1 at locus D 5 S 418 (Zmax= 10. 66 at θ= 0) and have identified null mutations in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR</b> or gp 190 chain) gene. A total of 14 distinct mutations were identified in the 19 families. An identical frameshift insertion (653 _ 654 insT) was identified in families from the United Arab Emirates, suggesting a founder effect in that region. It is interesting that 12 / 14 mutations predicted premature termination of translation. Functional studies indicated that these mutations alter the stability of <b>LIFR</b> messenger RNA transcripts, resulting {{in the absence of}} the <b>LIFR</b> protein and in the impairment of the JAK/STAT 3 signaling pathway in patient cells. We conclude, therefore, that SWS and SJS 2 represent a single clinically and genetically homogeneous condition due to null mutations in the <b>LIFR</b> gene on chromosome 5 p 13...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cardiomyocyte loss is {{involved}} in the transition from compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to heart failure (HF). Our aim was to investigate the status of the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR)</b> /gp 130 survival pathway and its cytoprotective activity in intact cardiac tissue and in cardiomyocytes obtained from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with LVH (non-failing SHR) and from aged SHR with overt HF (failing SHR). METHODS: Cardiac morphometry was assayed by planimetry in an image analysis system. mRNA and protein expression were quantified by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Receptors were localized by immunocytochemistry. Trypan blue staining, TUNEL, and MTT cell viability assays were employed to study the cytoprotective activity of cardiotrophin- 1 (CT- 1) in isolated caridomyocytes. RESULTS: Compared to non-failing SHR, failing SHR exhibited enhanced myocardial cell death (p< 0. 01) demonstrated by the increase in Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio, caspase- 3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) fragmentation. Failing SHR had a 7 -fold diminished expression (p< 0. 01) of <b>LIFR,</b> no changes in gp 130, and 1. 6 -fold increased myocardial expression (p< 0. 01) of CT- 1. In cardiomyocytes isolated from non-failing SHR, recombinant CT- 1 inhibited apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death induced by angiotensin II or hydrogen peroxide. <b>LIFR</b> protein was entirely absent in cardiomyocytes isolated from failing SHR, which were resistant to the cytoprotective effects of CT- 1. Finally, stimulation of non-failing SHR cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II, aldosterone, norepinephrine or endothelin- 1 significantly decreased (p< 0. 01) <b>LIFR</b> expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that loss of CT- 1 -dependent survival mechanisms may contribute to the increase of cell death associated with HF in SHR. Neurohumoral activation may contribute to this alteration via suppression of <b>LIFR...</b>|$|R

Substitution of either F 152 or K 155 with alanine was found to specifically inhibit cytokine interaction with <b>LIFR</b> without affecting binding to CNTFRa or gpl 3 O. The resulting variants behaved as partial agonists with varying degrees of residual bioactivity in different cell-based assays. Simultaneous alanine substitution of both F 152 and K 155 totally abolished biological activity. Combining these mutations with amino acid substitutions in the D-helix, which enhance binding affinity for the CNTFRa, gave rise to a potent competitive CNTF receptor antagonist.

40|$|Enhancement of {{oligodendrocyte}} survival through {{activation of}} leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<b>LIFR)</b> signaling {{is a candidate}} therapeutic strategy for demyelinating disease. However, in other cell types, <b>LIFR</b> signaling is under tight negative regulation by the intracellular protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3). We, therefore, postulated that deletion of the SOCS 3 gene in oligodendrocytes would promote the beneficial effects of <b>LIFR</b> signaling in limiting demyelination. By studying wild-type and LIF-knockout mice, we established that SOCS 3 expression by oligodendrocytes was induced by the demyelinative insult, that this induction depended on LIF, and that enclogenously produced LIF {{was likely to be}} a key determinant of the CNS response to oligodendrocyte loss. Compared with wild-type controls, oligo-dendrocyte-specific SOCS 3 conditional-knockout mice displayed enhanced c-fos activation and exogenous LIF-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Moreover, these SOCS 3 -deficient mice were protected against cupri-zone-induced oligodendrocyte loss relative to wild-type animals. These results indicate that modulation of SOCS 3 expression could facilitate the endogenous response to CNS injury...|$|R
