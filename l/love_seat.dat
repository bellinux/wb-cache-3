5000|$|The rustic {{furniture}} movement {{developed during}} the mid- to late-1800s. [...] Rustic furniture was originally made from whatever natural materials were in greatest supply, and often by poor people as items of trade for food or cash. The style {{is associated with the}} Great Depression and other hard times in America; however, it is also associated with the Great Camps built by wealthy Americans in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, of which the most familiar modern form is the Adirondack chair. Various rustic styles reflect the personality of their maker, with techniques such as chip carving, silver or gold brushwork, milk paint, peeled bark and other decorative enhancements. Many different wood species were used including willow, hickory, mountain laurel, and Alaska cedar. In the American South, palm fronds were occasionally employed. Historical examples of rustic furniture may be found in museums and antique shops, although fine historical pieces are rare outside a museum setting. One showcase for this style of furniture is the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York. The New York State Museum is home to: [...] "Rustic Furniture: The Clarence O. Nichols Collection". [...] Typical items of rustic furniture include chairs, <b>love</b> <b>seats,</b> tables, desks, smoking stands (often with a cabin on top), clocks, chest of drawers, rockers, coat racks, mirror frames and lamps.|$|R
