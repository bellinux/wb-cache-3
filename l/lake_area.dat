5|$|A {{variety of}} {{national}} forests and wildlife preserves—including the Klamath National Forest, Six Rivers National Forest, Klamath National Wildlife Refuges Complex, and Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge—are {{located in the}} Klamath River watershed. The Klamath National Forest is located in Siskiyou County with a small portion in Oregon, and Six Rivers National Forest {{is located in the}} southern Klamath watershed, mostly in the Trinity River watershed. The latter two are located in the Upper Klamath Lake-Lower Klamath <b>Lake</b> <b>area.</b> Lava Beds National Monument, which contains a large array of lava tubes and formations, is also in the Lower Klamath <b>Lake</b> <b>area,</b> to the south of the remnants of the lake.|$|E

5|$|After she {{graduated}} from Forest <b>Lake</b> <b>Area</b> High School in 1996, Nora left home with $200 and a '65 Oldsmobile, which she drove from Minnesota to Florida. Before training as a wrestler, Greenwald was employed at a Subway restaurant and as a telemarketer for Special Data Processing. While working at Subway, it was suggested to Nora that she try out for wrestling, and out of curiosity, she did.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>Area</b> Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>Area,</b> and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E
5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{industries}} in the Guild's <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> was a sawmill built in the 1880s. Although {{large parts of the}} land remained undeveloped until the early 20thcentury, lumber mills, grain storage structures, railroads, and docks appeared along the waterfront. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area has {{a diverse}} economy {{with much of}} it built around aerospace, petrochemicals, and high tech industries.Chang (2006), p. 185. The region's economy is {{closely tied to the}} rest of the Houston area though the mix of local {{businesses}} is somewhat unusual. In 2005, the median household income for the Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> was $62,061 compared to $50,868 for the Houston area as whole and $45,472 for all of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 along {{a portion of}} the current roadway. In a series of extensions, M-55 was lengthened to connect its current endpoints by the early 1930s. The trunkline has been rerouted in sections since that time resulting in the modern roadway alignment. One set of changes produced a business loop in the Houghton <b>Lake</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{most populous}} {{community}} {{in the region is}} Pasadena (though Houston is a much larger city, the portion within this region is smaller than Pasadena). Taylor Lake Village has (by far) the highest median household income; and Bacliff and San Leon have the lowest. Texas City and La Marque have the largest African-American populations. La Porte and the Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> of Houston have the largest Asian populations.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the <b>lake</b> <b>area</b> in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|After the war area {{economic}} diversification {{brought on by}} the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected the area to Houston. Tourism and recreation re-emerged and blossomed particularly around the Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> and the nearby shoreline.Barrington (2008), p. 266.Antrobus (2005), p. 57.|$|E
50|$|The whole Resort can {{be divided}} into three <b>areas</b> which are <b>lakes</b> <b>area,</b> plains area and hills <b>area.</b> The <b>lakes</b> <b>area,</b> which {{includes}} 8 <b>lakes,</b> covers an <b>area</b> of 496,000 square meters. The plains area covers an area of 607,000 square meters. The emperors held horse races and hunted in the area. The largest area of the three is the hills area. It covers an area of 4,435,000 square meters. Hundreds of palaces and temples were built on the hills in this area.|$|R

5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> {{became the first}} people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 45 (the Gulf Freeway) is {{the major}} freeway for the core areas of the Bay Area linking them with Houston and Galveston. Highway 146 (Bayport Blvd.) is a coastal highway linking the waterfronts of the communities. The Gulf Freeway and Bayport Blvd. {{together}} are the main arteries linking the Clear <b>Lake</b> <b>Area</b> communities and Pasadena, though Highway 225, East Beltway 8, Highway 3 and others are important as well. The Fred Hartman Bridge on Highway 146 crosses the ship channel connecting Baytown and La Porte, while the Galveston Causeway on the Gulf Freeway crosses the bay connecting Texas City and Galveston Island.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route164 (NY164) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located entirely {{in the town of}} Patterson in northeastern Putnam County, New York, in the United States. It is a short, two-lane back road that does not pass through any major {{populated}} areas and serves primarily as a connector between NY311 and NY22. NY164 also allows for faster passage from Interstate84 (I-84) to the Putnam <b>Lake</b> <b>area</b> via NY311. The route was originally designated as NY312 during the 1930s and later became part of NY216. NY164 was established on January1, 1970, following the truncation of NY216 to its current eastern terminus.|$|E

5|$|The Bay Area covers {{multiple}} municipalities {{with multiple}} school districts.

The area is sometimes seen as {{the heart of the}} Bay Area in spite of the relative youth of its history.|$|E
5|$|The Segaran <b>lake</b> <b>area</b> was {{the main}} complex of the Taman Sari during its era. This complex {{consisted}} of a man-made lake called Segaran ("artificial sea") with some buildings located on artificial islands {{in the middle of}} a lake. The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel. It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel. Today, the Segaran lake cannot be seen any longer as the water had been drained and the lake bed is now filled with human settlements. The underwater tunnel, which is now underground after the water had gone, still exist and can be accessed.|$|E
