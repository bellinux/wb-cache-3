Some of the Exhibited artists include Andy Warhol, Alice Neel, Chris Makos, Marie Cosindas, Paul Outerbridge, Walter Chappell, Winter Prather, Imogen Cunningham and others.

Mark Sink has been teaching, lecturing and reviewing photography since 1995 in Colorado and around the country. After taking the gallery to a nomadic style, Sink has been traveling for countless photo festivals and juried shows including FotoFest, CENTER, PhotoLucida, PhotoFence, <b>Palm</b> Springs <b>Photo</b> festival in NY and AZ.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908, Emily and Lillian {{traveled}} to Europe and Asia for pleasure and study. In Vienna, Emily studied classical architecture and Lillian metal work. On their return, {{they settled in}} San Francisco and Lillian was successful producing and selling her metal artwork at [...] "The Palmer Shop". Emily received only a few commissions but built their own home at 1037 Broadway and a weekend cabin “Wake Robins” in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Around 1920, the Palmers moved to Los Gatos and Emily designed a house for herself and Lillian on the same property. They lived in the Santa Cruz Mountains during the Great Depression while they rented out their San Francisco and Los Gatos houses for income. Around 1914, Emily received a most unusual commission for an exhibition stand for the Alaska Garnet Mining and Manufacturing Company which was owned and run by twelve women from St. Paul, Minnesota. The connection was quite likely established through Don Palmer, a mining engineer and father of Lillian <b>Palmer.</b> Unfortunately, no <b>photos</b> of the design have been found.|$|R
