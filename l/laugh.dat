Autumn migration for Northeast <b>Laughing</b> Gulls was initiated in October. Northeast <b>Laughing</b> Gulls migrated greater distances and were recovered farther south during winter than Gulf Coast gulls. Significantly more Gulf Coast <b>Laughing</b> Gulls wintered along the Gulf Coast than did Northeast <b>Laughing</b> Gulls. In contrast, significantly more Northeast <b>Laughing</b> Gulls wintered in Central and South America. Adult <b>Laughing</b> Gulls returned to breeding areas between March and May. Sixty-four percent of adult recoveries during subsequent breeding seasons were within 50 km of their natal banding locations. Significantly more <b>Laughing</b> Gulls were recovered north of their natal banding location than south during subsequent breeding seasons. Autumn dispersal of hatching-year <b>Laughing</b> Gulls {{was characterized by}} northward movements before migration. There was little interchange between Northeast and Gulf Coast populations...|$|R
