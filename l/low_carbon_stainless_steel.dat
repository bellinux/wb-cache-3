This paper focuses on the role of coated and uncoated <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> powders, having d 50  =  7. 3  [mu]m, normal particle size distribution and a shape factor of 1 on additive processes used in micromanufacturing, e. g. micro powder injection moulding ([mu]PIM). Surfaces were treated using a magnetron sputtering deposition apparatus equipped with a high frequency powder vibration and a continuous feed system. The results clearly show that the coated powders assume an "artichoke" morphology, which significantly increases the surface area. This combined with their nanocrystalline character leads to higher flowability than uncoated powders. However, no improvements have been observed concerning the critical powder volume concentration (CPVC) in feedstocks for [mu]PIM processing. In consolidation processes, the debinding temperatures can attain values higher than 500  °C. After debinding and sintering, the coating of steel powders can show lower carbon contamination in solid solution than uncoated ones.

This on-going work is done to help identify and mitigate degraded materials with flaws in their incipient stages rather than later, when the flaws have grown to critical flaw dimensions. Two separate AC eddy current and DC magnetic field measurement systems were utilized during the fatigue testing of “dog-bone ” shaped stainless steel plate samples. The acquired NDE data consisted of both the DC magnetic field measurements by Feritscope MP 30 and the normalized eddy current coil impedance measurements by a Swept-Frequency Eddy Current Tester. Individual measurements by AC eddy current and DC magnetic field measurements provided complementary information about the changing material conditions prior to and after the cracks were formed.

For the ferrous alloys, nanoscale oxides and oxygen-containing phases were formed that exhibited excellent adhesion to the substrate.

40|$|Abstract. Advanced high {{strength}} steels (AHSS) {{are increasingly being}} applied in safety related automotive components. Thus, a detailed knowledge of their fracture properties, as fracture toughness, is needed to properly design high performance components. Fracture toughness (KIC) cannot be readily measured in metal sheet. It is because the small thickness (1 - 3 mm) {{is not enough to}} develop a plane strain state, requirement that must be met to properly calculate KIC, as states the ASTM E 399 procedure. In this sense the essential work of fracture (EWF) has been successfully applied to determine fracture toughness in polymers films and some metal sheets as aluminum alloys, <b>low</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> brass, etc. However, there is no enough information about the applicability of this methodology to AHSS, due to the assumption that the ligament area must be fully yielded before the onset of crack propagation.

In the present work the fracture toughness of some advanced {{high strength}} steel sheets has been measured by means of the EWF. The results show that AHSS sheets can meet the requirements of the method, and therefore the values obtained for the EWF are valid. Thus, the EWF is postulated as methodology to evaluate the fracture toughness and {{can be used as a}} mechanical parameter to characterize the crash behavior of AHSS steel sheets...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{beam welding}} of UNS S 41500, a <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> {{martensitic}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> utilized in hydroelectric turbine manufacturing, was investigated by applying a single pass autogenous process to penetrate a section thickness of 72 mm without preheating. In the as-welded and post-weld heat treated conditions, the evolution in microhardness and microstructure across the weldments, {{as well as}} the global and local tensile properties, were evaluated. In the as-welded condition, assessment of the microhardness and the associated microstructure across the welds led to the identification of six regions, including the fusion zone, four heat affected zones and the base metal; each of these regions consisted of different phase constituents, such as tempered martensite, untempered martensite, delta ferrite and retained austenite. Post-weld heat treatment, undertaken to temper the untempered martensite in the as-welded microstructure, was effective in homogenizing the hardness across the weldment. The mechanical response of the welds, determined through tensile testing at room temperature with an automated non-contact three-dimensional deformation measurement system, indicated that the global tensile properties in the as-welded and post-weld heat treated conditions met the acceptance criteria in the ASME Section IX standard. Also, evaluation of the local tensile properties in the fusion and heat affected zones of the as-welded samples allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the strength and ductility associated with the different microstructures in the 2 ̆ 01 ccomposite 2 ̆ 01 d nature of the weldment. Fractographic analysis demonstrated dimpled features on the tensile fracture surfaces and failure was associated with debonding between the martensitic matrix and the secondary phases (such as delta ferrite and retained austenite) that resulted in the formation, growth and coalescence of voids into a macroscale crack.

40|$|During {{heavy ion}} operation, large {{pressure}} rises, up {{to a few}} orders of magnitude, were observed at CERN, GSI, and BNL. The dynamic pressure rises were triggered by lost beam ions that impacted onto the vacuum chamber walls and desorbed about 10 /sup 4 / to 10 /sup 7 / molecules per ion. The deterioration of the dynamic vacuum conditions can enhance charge-exchange beam losses {{and can lead to}} beam instabilities or even to beam abortion triggered by vacuum interlocks. Consequently, a dedicated measurement of heavy-ion induced molecular desorption in the GeV/u energy range is important for Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ion operation. In 2003, a desorption experiment was installed at the super proton synchrotron to measure the beam-loss induced pressure rise of potential LHC collimator materials. Samples of bare graphite, sputter coated (Cu, TiZrV) graphite, and 316 LN (<b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> with nitrogen) <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> were irradiated under grazing angle with 158 GeV/u indium ions. After a description of the new experimental setup, the results of the pressure rise measurements are presented, and the derived desorption yields are compared with data from other experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{elastoplastic}} {{properties of}} the austenitic matrix and martensitic volume areas induced during cyclic tensile-compressive loading of <b>low</b> <b>carbon</b> metastable austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> were studied in an in situ neutron diffraction stress rig experiment on the ENGIN instrument at the ISIS pulsed neutron facility. Samples prepared from the steel AISI 321 annealed at 1050 °C and quenched in water were subjected to low-cycle fatigue under total-strain control with an amplitude of 1 % at a frequency of 0, 5 Hz. Subsequent applied stress-elastic strain responses of the austenitic and martensitic phases were obtained by Rietveld and Le Bail refinements of the neutron diffraction spectra, and {{were used to determine}} the elastic constants of the phases as a function of fatigue level. The results of modified refinements accounting for the elastic anisotropy in polycrystalline materials under load are also presented. The residual strains in the austenitic matrix were determined as a function of fatigue cycling, using a noncycled sample as a reference sample. The residual macrostresses and the deviatoric components of the phase residual microstresses were determined assuming that the elastic properties of both phases are similar. The Investigation has been performed at the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics, JINR...|$|R
