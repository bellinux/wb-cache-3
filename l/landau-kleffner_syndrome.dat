In other cases, suspected or known causes of APD in children include delay in myelin maturation, ectopic (misplaced) cells in the auditory cortical areas, or genetic predisposition. In a family with autosomal dominant epilepsy, seizures which affected the left temporal lobe seemed to cause problems with auditory processing. In another extended family with a high rate of APD, genetic analysis showed a haplotype in chromosome 12 that fully co-segregated with language impairment.|$|E

40|$|Targeting pro-inflammatory {{events to}} reduce {{seizures}} is gaining momentum. Experimentally, antagonism of inflammatory processes and of blood-brain barrier (BBB) {{damage has been}} demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing status epilepticus (SE). Clinically, a role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of drug resistant epilepsies is suspected. However, the use anti-inflammatory drug such as glucocorticosteroids (GCs) is limited to selected pediatric epileptic syndromes and spasms. Lack of animal data {{may be one of}} the reasons for the limited use of GCs in epilepsy. We evaluated the effect of the CG dexamethasone in reducing the onset and the severity of pilocarpine SE in rats. We assessed BBB integrity by measuring serum S 100 b and Evans Blue brain extravasation. Electrophysiological monitoring and hematologic measurements (WBCs and IL- 1 b) were performed. We reviewed the effect of add on dexamethasone treatment on a population of pediatric patients affected by drug resistant epilepsy. We excluded subjects affected by West, <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> or Lennox-Gastaut <b>syndromes</b> and Rasmussen encephalitis, known to respond to GCs or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The effect of two additional GCs, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, was also reviewed in this population. When dexamethasone treatment preceded exposure to the convulsive agent pilocarpine, the number of rats developing status epilepticus (SE) was reduced.

Relatamos as características clínicas e eletroencefalográficas de 15 patientes com a síndrome de ponta-onda contínua do sono não-REM (POCSNR). O diagnóstico diferencial da POCSNR inclue a epilepsia benigna da infância com pontas centro-temporais e as síndromes de Landau-Kleffner e Lennox-Gastaut. Encontramos TC e RNM de crânio normais em 6 casos, leucomalácia periventricular em 4 e hidrocefalia em 1. Não houve associação de achados neurológicos específicos e a POCSNR. Nove dos nossos casos tinham descargas relativamente focais, como alguns casos da literatura. A ocorrência da POCSNR parece ser idade-dependente, geralmente entre 5 e 12 anos, com forte relação temporal à deteriorização neurocognitiva, em sua natureza, severidade e prognóstico.

50|$|In childhood, {{auditory}} verbal agnosia {{can also}} be caused by <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> <b>syndrome,</b> also called acquired epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease.

In extremely rare cases, {{auditory verbal agnosia}} {{has been known to}} present as a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. In such cases auditory verbal agnosia is a symptom that is typically followed by more severe neurological symptoms typical of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
50|$|A {{pediatrician}} commonly {{performs a}} preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted {{with help from}} ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The presence of autism can {{make it harder to}} diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{children}} with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have electrographic seizures, including electrographic status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first {{indication of the}} language problem is usually auditory verbal agnosia. This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment {{of the ability to}} lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> <b>syndrome,</b> 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension.

40|$|Multiple subpial transection (MST) {{is a novel}} {{technique}} in surgery for epilepsy, employed in patients where {{some or all of}} the epileptogenic zone cannot be resected because it lies in a vital cortical area. Twenty one patients subjected to MST were reviewed. Eighteen patients had medically intractable epilepsy and three patients had <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Their ages ranged from 6 to 47 (mean 15 - 9) and duration of epilepsy ranged from 0. 33 to 42 (mean 8. 6) years. Preoperative MRI showed focal abnormalities in eight cases. Detailed electrophysiological examination was carried out on all patients. Brain resection was performed in addition to MST in 12 patients. A further six patients underwent brain biopsy. Three patients with <b>Landau-Kleffner</b> <b>syndrome</b> were subjected neither to resection nor to biopsy. Histopathological examination showed Rasmussen's syndrome in six patients, cortical dysplasia in six, cerebral tumour in one, and non-specific changes in five. Multiple subpial transection was carried out mainly in precentral and postcentral regions. Eighteen patients have been followed up for one to five years, and three for 10 months.
