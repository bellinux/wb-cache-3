500|$|In {{response}} to the new sense of urgency, the head of Baltimore's Department of Planning, Philip Darling, put together a 1960 report titled A Study for an East–West Expressway. [...] Darling proposed I-70N pass through <b>Leakin</b> Park and Gwynns Falls Park, pass through the Rosemont neighborhood, and head east between Franklin Street and Mulberry Street. [...] The East–West Expressway would turn south near Pine Street and turn east again to follow an elevated highway just south of Pratt Street, between the central business district and the Inner Harbor. [...] At {{the east end of}} the Inner Harbor, at approximately the modern intersection of President Street and Eastern Avenue, I-70N would reach its terminus at a four-way interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) and I-95 (Southwestern Expressway). [...] I-95 would cross the Inner Harbor on a [...] high bridge immediately to the southwest of the interchange.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the major}} opposition, the {{initiation}} of federal funding allowed the city to start acquiring property in the Franklin–Mulberry corridor in 1966 {{to clear the way}} for construction of the stretch of freeway that did get built between Pulaski Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. [...] That same year, the city of Baltimore decided to resolve the deadlock on the 10-D System by forming another consulting group, Urban Design Concept Associates, to work with various experts and stakeholders {{to come up with a}} new, less disruptive freeway system proposal for Baltimore. [...] In 1969, the city adopted the group's proposal for the 3-A System. [...] I-70N would pass through <b>Leakin</b> Park and Gwynns Falls Park, then follow Gwynns Falls south to an interchange with the modern alignment of I-95 east of Caton Avenue. [...] Another freeway, later designated I-170, would be constructed in the Franklin–Mulberry corridor to connect I-70 with the west side of the central business district.|$|E
500|$|Had I-70 been {{constructed}} as planned in the 3-A System, I-70 would have continued east from its present terminus {{just west of}} the Baltimore city limits near Security Boulevard. [...] The Interstate would curve to the northeast and traverse Dead Run and Franklintown Road, then pass through a short tunnel underneath a hill in <b>Leakin</b> Park. [...] I-70 would curve east through Gwynns Falls Park, where the freeway would cross over Dead Run and Franklintown Road again just south of the stream's confluence with Gwynns Falls. [...] The Interstate would parallel Gwynns Falls southeast to an interchange with Hilton Parkway, a four-lane divided highway that connects the portions of Hilton Street {{on either side of the}} Gwynns Falls valley. [...] The Directional T interchange would provide access from both directions of I-70 to northbound Hilton Parkway and from southbound Hilton Parkway to I-70. [...] I-70 would continue south while paralleling Hilton Parkway on the east until the freeway's underpass of US40 (Edmondson Avenue).|$|E
500|$|Darling's {{outreach}} {{with various}} civic groups meant {{there was little}} opposition to the proposed route of the East–West Expressway. [...] The last obstacle before the freeway could receive federal funding was a review by independent consultants. [...] A group of three consulting firms that came together as Expressway Consultants reviewed Darling's plan and made major changes without consulting the civic groups Darling had engaged. [...] As a result, when the consultants released their 10-D System in 1962, the plan faced widespread opposition. [...] In the 10-D System, I-70N would follow roughly the same route as in the Darling Plan east to Fremont Avenue. [...] There, the freeway would follow Fremont Avenue south to a junction with I-95 at Hamburg Street. [...] The route of the East–West Expressway in the 10-D System would require condemning {{a greater number of}} properties compared to Darling's plan due to I-70N and I-95 passing through several residential neighborhoods south of the central business district. [...] Several of the civic groups with which Darling had compromised opposed Expressway Consultants's uncompromising position toward their route through <b>Leakin</b> Park.|$|E
500|$|A sign on {{eastbound}} I-70 correctly informs motorists that I-70 ends at its four-level stack interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). West of the interchange, {{the freeway}} has {{an average annual}} daily traffic value of 94,221 vehicles. [...] East of the interchange, I-70 formally continued as a four-lane highway for local traffic that averaged 25,300 vehicles per day. [...] The Interstate's speed limit reduces to [...] and then [...] as it passes through its final interchange, a partial cloverleaf junction with MD122 (Security Boulevard), which continues southeast into Baltimore as Cooks Lane. Just east of the interchange, I-70 entered the city of Baltimore and the freeway's median expands into a park and ride facility that was accessed at the Interstate's eastern terminus at a U-turn adjacent to <b>Leakin</b> Park. Eastbound I-70 traffic that wished to access Cooks Lane {{had to make a}} U-turn at the terminus and exit from a westbound loop ramp. Westbound access to I-70 is done via a single entrance ramp off Ingleside Avenue, which is considered part of the MD 122 interchange. The very short section of I-70 in the city of Baltimore is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation instead of the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The 1.95-mile extension beyond I-695 to the I-70 Park and Ride facility was formally dropped from the Interstate system at the AASHTO Spring 2014 meeting.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{years after}} the {{beginnings}} of the first four lower level grammar / primary schools of the Baltimore City Public Schools system in 1829, two for boys and two for girls in the four quadrants of Baltimore, soon created a need for more further advanced opportunities for learning of swiftly increasing numbers of growing children. Public pressure and increasing needs of the trade and commercial classes induced several progressive farsighted political leaders to call for and introduce resolutions into the old City Hall structure on Holliday Street. This was at the former Rembrandt Peale museum, built 1812 as the first building constructed for use as a museum in the Western Hemisphere and acquired by the city government in 1830 for the few municipal offices then existing including two City Council chambers - later the site for the first public school for young African-Americans (then called [...] "colored schools") in the late 1870s. [...] Then it later served from 1931-1997 as a city history museum). Here was the action taken on resolutions introduced calling {{for the creation of a}} high school [...] "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" [...] was unanimously passed and authorized by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839, and signed by the tenth Mayor, Shepard C. <b>Leakin,</b> who only served one [...] two-year term, 1838-1840.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Leakin</b> Park has a {{reputation}} as a dumping ground for the city's murder victims. It has been described as [...] "the city's largest unregistered graveyard." [...] A webpage devoted to tracking the bodies found there counts 71 since the 1940s; its compiler says the actual number is probably higher due to incomplete archives of the Baltimore Sun.|$|E

[...] A bike trail around the park's perimeter has made the park an even less attractive place for body disposal. [...] "Leakin Park is about the bodies, yes," [...] Kobell says, ... but those bodies end up there because a city was {{and is willing to}} embrace a wild, wide space inside its boundaries. So <b>Leakin</b> Park is also about the elderly Koreans who gather chestnuts every fall, about the middle-aged black women who began playing tennis there after Arthur Ashe won the U.S. Open, about the truly outsider art gallery along some of the park’s trails. <b>Leakin</b> Park is about the grand Olmsted vision as well as the grimmer reality.|$|E
