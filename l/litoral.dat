5|$|Prosecutor Graciela Argüelles said that, {{according}} to the investigation, <b>Litoral</b> Gas ignored calls for help from García, who was not properly trained to manage such a situation. The judge suggested that documents seized from <b>Litoral</b> Gas might prove the existence of customer reports of a gas leak. Curto thought that the employees might not bear sole responsibility, and that the liability of <b>Litoral</b> Gas had to be investigated as well.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. <b>Litoral</b> Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of <b>Litoral</b> Gas to clarify that point. <b>Litoral</b> Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Litoral</b> Gas {{proposed}} an out-of-court settlement to {{the relatives of}} the victims, offering about 1200 US dollars per square meter of collapsed building, in addition to compensation for loss of life. Vice Governor Jorge Henn rejected it as immoral, {{and most of the}} families also initially rejected the proposal. By May 2014, however, almost half of the families had accepted the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Neighbors {{reported}} to the press that they had smelled a gas leak several hours before the explosion and had called <b>Litoral</b> Gas. Company director José María González said {{that the company had}} received no such calls, and thought that callers might have dialed the 911 emergency number instead. Prosecutor Camporini reported at the trial that the building had experienced several gas leaks before the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transportation}} {{within the}} city is provided by private-owned companies. The Central de Camionagem is a terminus for urban and long distance buses that provide mass transit in the surrounding region, namely the city's countryside, Porto, Minho Region, and Galicia in Spain. <b>Litoral</b> Norte as a wholly urban transportation network with 5 lines, while Linhares has the oldest bus network operating in the city, now owned by Transdev.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the cause of the explosion. Primary suspects were <b>Litoral</b> Gas (the natural-gas provider for Rosario) and an employee who carried out maintenance work at the building that day. Several public figures sent condolences, and most of the candidates for the 2013 primary elections suspended their political campaigns.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in <b>litoral</b> West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, {{the lack of any}} {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the <b>Litoral,</b> where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of <b>Litoral</b> Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest of Carlos Osvaldo García, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to García, who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial. Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify García's testimony.|$|E
5|$|In 1819 Buenos Aires was at {{war with}} José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López, and {{requested}} San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies {{to take part in}} the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano's health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the <b>litoral</b> or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, just one year old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew's fiddle, but Belgrano's doctor Josef Redhead objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took control of the government of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.|$|E

25|$|The word Atacama had two meanings. It {{was and is}} a Chilean region, then province, (1. meaning) South of the Atacama desert (2. meaning). The Atacama desert mostly {{coincides with}} the disputed Antofagasta province, also named <b>Litoral</b> in Bolivia.|$|E
25|$|The city is circled {{by three}} half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the {{mountain}} side), Ronda del <b>Litoral</b> (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt {{in the north}} and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{acquired}} the Peruvian territory of Tarapacá, the disputed Bolivian department of <b>Litoral</b> (cutting Bolivia {{off from the}} sea), as well as temporary control over the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica. In 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed the “Treaty of Peace and Friendship” establishing definite boundaries. The 1929 Tacna–Arica compromise gave Arica to Chile and Tacna to Peru.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the provinces}} were {{reestablished}} as administrative divisions in Portugal. However, instead the six traditional provinces, 11 new ones were established: Minho, Douro <b>Litoral,</b> Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Beira Alta, Beira Baixa, Beira <b>Litoral,</b> Estremadura, Ribatejo, Alto Alentejo, Baixo Alentejo and Algarve. These were {{based in the}} natural regions identified by the geographer Amorim Girão in several studies he published between 1922 and 1930. The Estado Novo regime used the provinces to characterize traditional and rural Portugal. Each province {{intended to be a}} regional community, to which were given decentralized powers. Yet, the Districts continued to define administrative and political control, much like the organization of public security for the State, limiting the powers of local government. This organizational structure for the territory resulted in a loss of the sense of regional identity, which was only kept alive by oral traditions, based on regional references of origin.|$|E
25|$|Argentina {{is divided}} into 24 provincial unions which all organise their own provincial club competitions. Since the 1990s, some provincial unions have started organising {{regional}} club competitions with neighbouring unions {{in order to raise}} the standards of rugby and make their clubs more competitive. An example of this is the Torneo del <b>Litoral,</b> which is organised by the unions of Rosario, Santa Fe and Entre Ríos.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 {{the poets}} Emilio Prados (1899–1962) and Manuel Altolaguirre (1905–1959) became editors for the Sur {{printing}} house in Málaga. Sur {{was responsible for}} publishing {{most of the work}} of the Generation of '27, and the quality of their editing brought Prados and Altolaguirre international prestige. In 1926 they founded the magazine <b>Litoral,</b> {{one of the most influential}} literary and artistic publications of 1920s Spain.|$|E
25|$|Construction with Argentina of the Salto Grande Dam {{across the}} Río Uruguay north of Salto {{was a major}} boost to the {{development}} of the northern <b>litoral</b> in the 1970s. By contrast, the closure of the famous meat-packing plant at Fray Bentos in the department of Río Negro transformed it into a virtual ghost town. Farther south, the <b>litoral</b> economy had benefited from completion of the General Artigas Bridge across the Río Uruguay from Paysandú to the Argentine province of Entre Ríos. However, the advent of a convenient (if circuitous) land route from Montevideo to Buenos Aires via the new bridge reduced freight and passenger traffic through the small port of Colonia on the Río de la Plata just opposite the Argentine capital. To compensate, the Uruguayan government encouraged the architectural restoration of Colonia, which was originally built by the Portuguese in colonial times. By 1990 Colonia had become one of Uruguay's most historic tourist attractions, and many of its houses had been bought by vacationers from Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|Argentina, {{along with}} other areas of new {{settlement}} like Canada, Australia, New Zealand or the United States, is considered a country of immigrants where the vast majority originated from Europe. Although no official censuses based on ethnic classification {{have been carried out}} in Argentina, some international sources state that White Argentines and other whites (Europeans) in Argentina make up somewhere between 89.7% (around 36.7 million people) and 85.8% (34.4 million) of the total population. White people can be found in all areas of the country, but especially in the central-eastern region (Pampas), the central-western region (Cuyo), the southern region (Patagonia) and the north-eastern region (<b>Litoral).</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{consortium}} called Pacific LNG {{was formed}} to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies BG Group and BP, and Spain's Repsol YPF. Repsol {{is one of three}} companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia, along with Petrobras and Total. A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and liquefied before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (Baja California and California), through a Chilean port, for example Iquique. The 2003 Lozada deal was opposed heavily by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalism (Bolivia feels resentment after the territorial losses of the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, which deprived it of the <b>Litoral</b> province and hence access to the sea).|$|E
25|$|Stretching west {{along the}} Río de la Plata from Montevideo, are the {{agricultural}} and dairying departments of San José and Colonia. To the {{north along the}} Río Uruguay lie the departments of Soriano, Río Negro, Paysandú and Salto. Their western halves form part of the <b>litoral,</b> a region that is somewhat more developed than the interior. Here soils are alluvial and more fertile, favoring crop production and farms of more modest size than in the interior. Citrus cultivation for export has increased in the departments along the Río Uruguay. The department of Colonia, some of which was settled by the Swiss, was famous {{for the production of}} milk, butter, cheese, and dulce de leche (a dessert made from concentrated milk and sugar). Most wheat (in which Uruguay was self-sufficient) also was produced in this region.|$|E

500|$|Weeks {{before the}} explosion, several social {{networking}} sites had scheduled a country-wide cacerolazo (a pot-banging protest demonstration), known as 8A, against Kirchner for August 8. The websites had already conducted successful cacerolazos (8N and 18A). Despite the national mourning, the 8A protest went ahead as planned, with the added slogan [...] "No more pointless deaths". Candidate Ricardo Gil Lavedra thought the cacerolazo should have been canceled, as the campaigning was, but fellow candidate Rodolfo Terragno supported it. It was attended by fewer people than previous ones in Buenos Aires {{and the rest of}} the country. The demonstration in Rosario was not a cacerolazo, but a silent candlelight vigil attended by nearly a hundred people. There was a second demonstration in Rosario on August 22, proceeding from the National Flag Memorial to the headquarters of <b>Litoral</b> Gas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} the airline began in 1929, when Compagnie Générale Aéropostale (Aéropostale) started airmail {{operations}} between Buenos Aires and Asunción using Laté-25 equipment, later expanding its network to cities located in the Patagonia. Many French pilots (including aviator and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry) flew for the company in its beginnings. Argentine personnel replaced the Frenchmen as they gradually withdrew from the airline, and shortly after Aéropostale's Argentine subsidiary Aeroposta Argentina was formed. In 1947, this airline became a mixed-stock company in which the Government had a 20% stake and private investors held the balance. As Aeroposta expanded its network southwards and incorporated the Douglas DC-3 into its fleet, another three mixed-stock companies were in operation at the time: ALFA (Aviación del <b>Litoral</b> Fluvial Argentino) mainly operated flying boats northwards to the Mesopotamia, FAMA (Flota Aérea Mercante Argentina) operated overseas services with DC-4s as its mainstay equipment, and ZONDA (Zonas Oeste y Norte de Aerolíneas Argentinas) was mainly concerned with operations in the northwest region.
