5|$|The first {{full-length}} {{version was}} Murders in the Rue Morgue by Universal Pictures in 1932, directed by Robert Florey and starring Bela Lugosi, Leon Ames and Sidney Fox, with Arlene Francis. The film bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> {{to the original}} story.|$|E
5|$|Believers in Planet X/Nibiru {{have given}} it many names since it was first proposed. All are, in fact, names for other real, {{hypothetical}} or imaginary Solar System objects that bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.|$|E
5|$|Many dwarf galaxies may orbit {{a single}} larger galaxy; the Milky Way {{has at least}} a dozen such satellites, with an {{estimated}} 300–500 yet to be discovered. Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to large ellipticals, they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead.|$|E
50|$|The Siege of Trencher's Farm (1969) is a Psychological Horror-Thriller {{novel by}} Scottish author Gordon Williams. It was first {{published}} by Secker & Warburg, and is better known for the 1971 film adaptation Straw Dogs (starring Dustin Hoffman) by Sam Peckinpah. A re-make of that film under the same name was made to less favorable reviews, both films bearing <b>little</b> <b>resemblances</b> to the novel. The Siege of Trencher's Farm was republished by Titan Books as in 2011 as Straw Dogs, {{to coincide with the}} release of the re-make.|$|R
5000|$|Aldus {{is named}} for the Venetian Renaissance printer Aldus Manutius. The {{decision}} annoyed Zapf (who preferred the name [...] "Palatino Book") since it bears <b>little</b> direct <b>resemblance</b> to Aldus's typefaces.|$|R
25|$|The rebuilt ship, {{the largest}} and grandest in Hurtigruten service at the time, bore <b>little</b> {{exterior}} <b>resemblance</b> to the original royal yacht. Prins Olav was considered the flagship of the Hurtigruten service.|$|R
5|$|Targeting bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> {{to reality}} {{in that the}} {{sequence}} of attacks was uncoordinated and the targets were approved randomly – even illogically. The North's airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should have been hit first in the campaign, were also off-limits.|$|E
5|$|Sud-Est's design bureau, {{while working}} on the Sud Aviation Caravelle in 1953, {{licensed}} several design features from de Havilland, building on previous collaborations on earlier licensed designs, including the DH 100 Vampire; the nose and cockpit layout of the Comet 1 was grafted onto the Caravelle. In 1969, when the Comet 4's design was modified by Hawker Siddeley to become {{the basis for the}} Nimrod, the cockpit layout was completely redesigned and bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to its predecessors except for the control yoke.|$|E
5|$|CP+B and Burger King then filed counter-suit against Slipknot, {{stating that}} the Coq Roq band was fictitious, {{visually}} and musically bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Slipknot's style, and at best was a general parody of heavy metal bands that wear masks or try to achieve a mask-like effect, such as Mushroomhead, KISS or GWAR. Partly mentioned in the counter-suit included the notion that Slipknot were parodies of bands themselves, further citing the specific example of Mushroomhead, who wore near identical style masks and jumpsuits, and had been playing several years before Slipknot even formed, let alone went mainstream. Both suits were eventually dropped, and Burger King ended the campaign shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Despite having <b>little</b> {{physical}} <b>resemblance</b> to any known {{representations of}} the historical Caesar who was balding, the series aims to present him in an authentic fashion (as opposed to an accurate one).|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt ship, {{the largest}} and grandest in Hurtigruten service at the time, bore <b>little</b> {{exterior}} <b>resemblance</b> to the original royal yacht. Prins Olav was considered the flagship of the Hurtigruten service.|$|R
5000|$|The basins and {{tubes in}} the [...] "biological" [...] section are {{sometimes}} interpreted as implying {{a connection to}} alchemy, yet they bear <b>little</b> obvious <b>resemblance</b> to the alchemical equipment of the period.|$|R
5|$|SMS Oldenburg {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin in 1883, launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended {{to have been a}} fifth member of the Sachsen class, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ships of the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24cm guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the original population.|$|E
5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline {{began in the early}} 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|Teenagers from Outer Space (R. Talsorian): A wild anime {{high school}} comedy game. The third edition was marketed as a Fuzion title, {{but the system}} predates Fuzion by several years and bears <b>little</b> {{mechanical}} <b>resemblance</b> to other Fuzion games.|$|R
50|$|In {{the film}} Young Guns II Henry Brown was {{combined}} with fellow Regulator Jim French and {{presented as a}} composite named Hendry William French. Timid and clumsy, the film's portrayal of French by actor Alan Ruck bears <b>little</b> actual <b>resemblance</b> to either outlaw.|$|R
50|$|With Francesco (1989) Liliana Cavani {{returned}} {{to the life of}} St Francis of Assisi in a film starring American actor Mickey Rourke as the title character, and English actress Helena Bonham-Carter as Chiara. The film bore <b>little</b> stylistic <b>resemblance</b> to Cavani's earlier efforts.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Even {{cities and}} states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their {{merchant}} Republics, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as Venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while Florence was a capital of textiles. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from {{promoting}} a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
50|$|Other than in some motifs and {{compositional}} arrangements, Schut's work displays <b>little</b> stylistic <b>resemblance</b> {{to that of}} Rubens. Schut's {{skill in}} interpreting the themes of the Counter-Reformation led to many commissions for altarpieces in churches and monasteries in Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent, Bruges and Cologne.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the film}} has a <b>little</b> bit of <b>resemblance</b> to Notting Hill (1999), {{it is not an}} {{absolute}} copy of the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] said Sam a <b>little</b> vaguely. The <b>resemblance</b> had not struck him. It {{seemed a}} silly hobby, and rough on the lions, too.|$|R
5|$|The Zerg are a {{collective}} consciousness {{of a variety}} of different races assimilated into the Zerg genome. The Zerg were originally commanded by the Zerg Overmind, a manifestation of this hive mind, and under the Overmind's control the Zerg strove for genetic perfection by assimilating the favorable traits of other species. After a species has been assimilated into the Swarm, it is mutated towards a different function within its hierarchy, from being a hive worker to a warrior strain. StarCrafts manual notes that some species bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to their original forms after just a short time into assimilation (An example would be the formerly peaceful Slothien species, which was assimilated and mutated into the vicious Hydralisk strain and so on). The Overmind controls the Swarm through secondary agents called cerebrates. Cerebrates command an individual brood of Zerg, each with a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Cerebrates further delegate power through the use of overlords for battlefield direction and queens for hive watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, with {{demobilisation}} of Australia's wartime army complete, {{the decision}} was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division's component units bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve the readiness of the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in Korea was undertaken on a voluntary basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.|$|E
25|$|Video {{of water}} tank testing in 2013 {{indicates}} that the stern lines of Titanic II bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to Titanics 1912 era counter stern.|$|E
50|$|The DOHC {{cam gear}} train engine from the NC23 was later {{used in the}} NC29 and the CB400F CB-1, model number NC27, a naked bike that is {{credited}} with inspiring the popular 'Hornet' range. However the NC27 bears <b>little</b> mechanical <b>resemblance</b> to those machines and is probably the first true factory streetfighter.|$|R
50|$|If one {{compares the}} large number of etchings, {{drawings}} and paintings with the purpose of recognizing Hendrickje it appears more often than not that there is <b>little</b> mutual <b>resemblance</b> between all the candidates. It is surprising how, still, in recent art historical literature numerous works are identified as Hendrickje Stoffels as a matter of course.|$|R
50|$|The {{plate is}} {{difficult}} to date. Earlier scholars tended to date it to the 2nd century AD, because of its classicizing style, but stylistic characteristics also permit a later date. Technical analyses, however, support a provenance in the 4th-5th centuries, even though it bears <b>little</b> stylistic <b>resemblance</b> to other silver pieces from that period.|$|R
25|$|Very modern oasts bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to {{traditional}} oasts. These vast buildings can process hops from several farms, as at Norton near Teynham, built in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{pronunciation}}s reconstructed by such {{means are}} used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.|$|E
25|$|Ediacara biota bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> {{to modern}} lifeforms, and their {{relationship}} even with the immediately following lifeforms of the Cambrian explosion is rather difficult to interpret. More than 100 genera have been described, and well known forms include Arkarua, Charnia, Dickinsonia, Ediacaria, Marywadea, Onega, Pteridinium, and Yorgia.|$|E
6000|$|It was now {{several years}} since Deerslayer {{had been in}} a spot {{especially}} devoted to the uses of females of his own color and race. The sight brought back to his mind a rush of childish recollections; and he lingered in the room with a tenderness of feeling to which he had long been a stranger. He bethought him of his mother, whose homely vestments he remembered to have seen hanging on pegs like those which he felt must belong to Hetty Hutter; and he bethought himself of a sister, whose incipient and native taste for finery had exhibited itself somewhat in the manner of that of Judith, though necessarily in a less degree. These <b>little</b> <b>resemblances</b> opened a long hidden vein of sensations; and as he quitted the room, it was with a saddened mien. He looked no further, but returned slowly and thoughtfully towards the [...] "door-yard." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{conventional}} four door three box design, it bore very <b>little</b> external <b>resemblance</b> to {{the original}} Ritmo, although it hinted strongly at {{the look of the}} 1982 facelift for that car. In the Swedish market, the car was called [...] "Regatta", as Regata was uncomfortably close to a derogatory term for an overbearing woman. The same name was used in Latin American markets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} poorly received, {{critically}} and commercially. [...] It was widely criticized as having <b>little</b> if any <b>resemblance</b> to the H. Rider Haggard stories {{on which it}} was supposedly based.|$|R
