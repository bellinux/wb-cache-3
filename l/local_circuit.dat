40|$|Hierarchical {{processing}} of sensory information requires interaction at multiple levels along the peripheral to central pathway. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} interaction between driving and modulating components can shape both top down and bottom up {{processing of}} sensory information. Here we show that a component inherited from extrinsic sources combines with local components to code sound intensity. By applying high concentrations of divalent cations to neurons in {{the nucleus of the}} inferior colliculus in the auditory midbrain, we show that as sound intensity increases, the source of synaptic efficacy changes from inherited inputs to <b>local</b> <b>circuits.</b> In neurons with a wide dynamic range response to intensity, inherited inputs increase firing rates at low sound intensities but saturate at mid-to-high intensities. <b>Local</b> <b>circuits</b> activate at high sound intensities and widen dynamic range by continuously increasing their output gain with intensity. Inherited inputs are necessary and sufficient to evoke tuned responses, however <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> change peak output. Push-pull driving inhibition and excitation create net excitatory drive to intensity-variant neurons and tune neurons to intensity. Our results reveal that dynamic range and tuning re-emerge in the auditory midbrain through <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> that are themselves variable or tuned...|$|R

40|$|In {{the adult}} {{mammalian}} cortex, {{a small fraction}} of spines are created and eliminated every day, and the resultant synaptic connection structure is highly nonrandom, even in <b>local</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, it remains unknown whether a particular synaptic connection structure is functionally advantageous in <b>local</b> <b>circuits,</b> and why creation and elimination of synaptic connections is necessary in addition to rich synaptic weight plasticity. To answer these questions, we studied an inference task model through theoretical and numerical analyses. We demonstrate that a robustly beneficial network structure naturally emerges by combining Hebbian-type synaptic weight plasticity and wiring plasticity. Especially in a sparsely connected network, wiring plasticity achieves reliable computation by enabling efficient information transmission. Furthermore, the proposed rule reproduces experimental observed correlation between spine dynamics and task performance...|$|R

40|$|Hippocampal {{networks}} of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that produce γ-frequency rhythms display behavior {{in which the}} inhibitory cells produce spike doublets when there is strong stimulation at separated sites. It {{has been suggested that}} the doublets {{play a key role in}} the ability to synchronize over a distance. Here we analyze the mechanisms by which timing in the spike doublet can affect the synchronization process. The analysis describes two independent effects: one comes from the timing of excitation from separated <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> to an inhibitory cell, and the other comes from the timing of inhibition from separated <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> to an excitatory cell. We show that a network with both of these effects has different synchronization properties than a network with either excitatory or inhibitory type of coupling alone, and we give a rationale for the shorter space scales associated with inhibitory interactions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of the neuromodulator nitric oxide (NO) on proprioceptive information processing by ascending intersegmental interneurons that form part of the <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> within the terminal abdominal ganglion of the crayfish. NO modulates the synaptic inputs to ascending interneurons, enhancing the amplitude of class I interneurons and reducing the amplitude of class II interneurons. Repetitive proprioceptive stimulation leads to rapid depression in a specific set of identified interneurons but not in others. Bath application of a nitric oxide scavenger, PTIO, causes a significant decrease in the rate of depression of the interneurons showing a rapid depression, independent of interneuron class, but has no effect on the dynamic responses of the interneurons that show little initial depression. These results indicate that NO exerts multiple effects at the very first stage of synaptic integration in <b>local</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R
25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} what purpose. This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the <b>local</b> <b>Circuit</b> Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E

Although he lost, he sufficiently impressed Marshall-Hall for the latter to offer him a place in his chambers in London.

40|$|Hierarchical {{processing}} of sensory information occurs at multiple levels between the peripheral and central pathway. Different extents of convergence and divergence in top down and bottom up projections {{makes it difficult}} to separate the various components activated by a sensory input. In particular, hierarchical processing at sub-cortical levels is little understood. Here we have developed a method to isolate extrinsic inputs to the inferior colliculus (IC), a nucleus in the midbrain region of the auditory system, with extensive ascending and descending convergence. By applying a high concentration of divalent cations (HiDi) locally within the IC, we isolate a HiDi-sensitive from a HiDi-insensitive component of responses evoked by afferent input in brain slices and in vivo during a sound stimulus. Our results suggest that the HiDi sensitive component is a monosynaptic input to the IC, while the HiDi-insensitive component is a <b>local</b> polysynaptic <b>circuit.</b> Monosynaptic inputs have short latencies, rapid rise times and underlie first spike latencies. Local inputs have variable delays and evoke long-lasting excitation. In vivo, <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> have variable onset times and temporal profiles. Our results suggest that high concentrations of divalent cations should prove to be a widely useful method of isolating extrinsic monosynaptic inputs from <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Yoonsuck Choe Neurons are {{connected}} to form functional networks in the brain. When neurons are combined in sequence, nontrivial effects arise. One example is disinhibition, inhibition to another inhibitory factor. Disinhibition may be serving an important purpose because {{a large number of}} <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> in the brain contain disinhibitory connections. However, their exact functional role is not well understood. The objective of this dissertation is to analyze the computational role of disinhi-bition in brain function, especially in visual perception and attentional control. My approach is to propose computational models of disinhibition and then map the model to the <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> in the brain to explain psychological phenomena. Several compu-tational models are proposed in this dissertation to account for disinhibition. (1) A static inverse difference of Gaussian filter (IDoG) was derived to explicitly account for the spatial effects of disinhibition.

Here we investigated how neurons with sensitivity to different kinematic features of whisker stimuli are distributed across <b>local</b> <b>circuits</b> in supragranular layers of the barrel cortex. Using two-photon calcium population imaging in anesthetized mice, we found that nearby neurons represent diverse kinematic features, providing a rich population representation at the local scale. Neurons interspersed in space therefore responded differently to a common stimulus kinematic feature. Conversely, neurons with similar feature selectivity were located no closer to each other than predicted by a random distribution null hypothesis. This finding relied on defining a null hypothesis that was specific for testing the spatial distribution of tuning across neurons. We also measured how neurons sensitive to specific features were distributed relative to barrel boundaries, and found no systematic organization. Our results are compatible with randomly distributed selectivity to kinematic features, with no systematic ordering superimposed upon the whisker map...|$|R
