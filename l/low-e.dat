500|$|Designed by Duda/Paine Architects, LLP with HKS, Inc. as the Architect of Record, the Frost Bank Tower is {{considered}} one of the most recognizable buildings in Austin. The building starts with a rectangular shape on the ground that eventually becomes a square point in the crown. The base of the building is expressed in honed finish limestone while the main superstructure of the building is a blue <b>low-e</b> glass skin, which is a thicker type of glass, that covers the entire tower. The Frost Bank Tower is one of only two places in the world with blue <b>low-e</b> glass skin, the other being the Reuters Building in New York City, which was the earlier structure. The folded panes of the building step back to create a segmented pyramidal form. Lighting covers the crown, where a section of the building [...] lights up, and sometimes changes color for special occasions, such as the 2006 Rose Bowl, when the Austin-based University of Texas Longhorns defeated the USC Trojans. More than 200,000 sq ft (60,960 sq m) of glass was used for the facade of the building alone and 45,000 sq ft (13,716 sq m) of glass was used in the crown. [...] The building also contains an 11 level parking garage with spaces for more than 1,400 vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|One Canada Square has 3,960 {{windows and}} was one of the first {{buildings}} to incorporate metallicised windows and other advanced window technologies, to assist with the building's energy efficiency plans. [...] The tower uses super-insulated windows at triple-pane glazing (with a high solar heat-gain coefficient), low-emissivity (<b>low-e)</b> coatings to prevent heat loss in winter months, UV coatings, scratch resistant outer layers, sealed argon / krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, 'warm edge' insulating glass spacers, air-seals and specially developed thermally designed window frames. [...] The windows were manufactured with ehigh R-values [...] for the time, thereby the thermal resistance is one of the highest rated in the world for the entire window including the frame.|$|E
50|$|Modern double-pane and triple-pane windows {{often include}} {{one or more}} <b>low-e</b> {{coatings}} to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat <b>low-e</b> coatings tend {{to result in a}} lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat <b>low-e</b> coatings.|$|E
50|$|Another {{area where}} <b>low-e</b> films are used is thermal {{barriers}}. Some thermal barriers (like insulbar LEF) decreases thermal losses due to radiation by a <b>low-e</b> folio {{applied to the}} thermal insulation profile.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced {{in the mid}} 2000's, newer [...] "triple silver" [...] <b>low-e,</b> {{also called}} High Performance <b>low-e,</b> are testing for even lower SHGC ratings, making the windows {{suitable}} for even the hottest southern climate (mostly cooling) zones. Also notable are new interior surface <b>low-e</b> coatings that provide very low u-values that are comparable to triple pane windows, often in the low 20's. Combining these two low-emissivity coatings can make a dual pane window exceed every Energy Star climate zone in the US.|$|E
50|$|Selkowitz led {{research}} at Berkeley Lab {{to reduce the}} amount of heat transfer through windows. The low-emissivity (<b>low-E)</b> windows they developed have saved $7.7 billion on energy costs and 1.2 quadrillion BTUs, according to National Academy of Sciences' data. Selkowitz had to convince window manufacturers of the benefits of <b>low-E</b> glass before its use became widespread.|$|E
5000|$|Windows {{and doors}} have Solarban 80 glass, a high-performance, <b>Low-E</b> glass for solar control.|$|E
50|$|<b>Low-E</b> is a {{film that}} is several layers of metal poured microscopically thin {{over the surface of}} newly poured glass. This heat {{reflective}} film is transparent but can be darker or lighter depending on the type and manufacturer. This data is rated in Visible Light Transmission. Darker glass with heavier <b>Low-E</b> will have less VT. The NFRC rates most energy star rated window manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Low-E</b> windows {{may also}} block radio {{frequency}} signals. Buildings without distributed antenna systems may then suffer degraded cell phone reception.|$|E
50|$|Glass units {{typically}} include {{at least}} one low emissivity (<b>Low-E)</b> coating applied {{to one or more}} glass surfaces to reduce the U-factor and especially SHGC by suppressing radiant heat flow. Many varieties of <b>Low-E</b> coatings also reduce daylight potential to different degrees. High purity inert gas is frequently used in the space(s) between panes, and advances in thermally efficient glass spacing and supporting elements can further improve thermal performance of glass-glazed skylight assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|On June 30, 2015, Glass Magazine named Onyx Solar 2015's [...] "Most Innovative Glass Product" [...] for its <b>Low-E</b> Photovoltaic Glass. The {{reasons behind}} this award include {{the ability of}} this product's layers to filter out 95% of {{ultraviolet}} radiation and 85% of infrared radiation {{as well as its}} solar heat coefficient (from 10 to 40%). Onyx Solar claims that passive properties of its <b>Low-E</b> Photovoltaic Glass are at least on par with the most advanced conventional low-emissive glass.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{double and}} triple-glazing windows have <b>low-e</b> {{coatings}} - their glass panes have thin metallic coatings, able to significantly improve their thermal insulating performance.|$|E
5000|$|... {{loses the}} two lowest semitones on the <b>low-E</b> string {{and the two}} highest semitones from the high-E string in {{standard}} tuning; it can use string sets for standard tuning.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{direct solar gain}} systems is significantly enhanced by insulative (e.g. double glazing), spectrally selective glazing (<b>low-e),</b> or movable window insulation (window quilts, bifold interior insulation shutters, shades, etc.).|$|E
50|$|To tune {{a guitar}} from {{standard}} tuning to Open D tuning:Lower the 1st (high-E), 2nd (B), and 6th (<b>low-E)</b> down a full step. Lower the 3rd string (G) down half a step to F.|$|E
50|$|They {{can also}} reduce {{exterior}} air infiltration significantly, and are inexpensive: {{even the best}} storm windows - three track exterior windows, with <b>low-E</b> glass - will cost {{a small fraction of}} the price of standard replacement windows.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, PECI {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to a LEED Platinum Platinum building in downtown Portland. PECI added many energy-efficient features {{to the core}} building, including insulated <b>low-e</b> glass windows, a high-efficiency HVAC system, daylight dimming mechanisms and energy-efficient data center systems.|$|E
50|$|A plastic PVC {{interior}} storm {{panel is}} particularly inexpensive {{and easy to}} install but these panels lose quality over time and may get broken quite easily. Storm windows with <b>Low-E</b> glass and metal frames are a more durable choice, and can provide better insulation.|$|E
50|$|At present, {{the museum}} is {{outfitted}} with low-energy-consuming light fixtures, zoned climate control, exterior cooling towers, low-flow plumbing fixtures for water-use reduction and low-emissivity (<b>low-E)</b> glass on the south elevation. Landscape planning for the courtyard made use of xeriscape planning, porous paving materials and custom irrigation plans.|$|E
50|$|AFC was {{acquired}} by Applied Materials in 2006. At the time of acquisition, AFC operated three product divisions, Display, Web (roll to roll products) and coated glass (<b>low-e</b> coatings for architectural glass applications). Approximate AFC revenues {{at the time of}} acquisition were $220M with approximately 750 people.|$|E
5000|$|Pyrolitic {{glass is}} made mostly of tin oxides and {{is applied to}} [...] "hot" [...] float plate glass as it is cooling. Pyrolytic <b>Low-e</b> glass is {{extremely}} durable and gives glazing a lower u-value, or heat loss rating, than clear glass, making it ideal for northern Energy Star climate zones.|$|E
50|$|Anyway, the {{insulation}} provided by {{double or triple}} glazing falls very short of the best. We need to further improve its performance, which {{can be done by}} selecting windows with <b>low-e</b> coatings, thermal breaks and argon or other similar gas between the panes; and also by selecting windows with high energy-efficient frames.|$|E
50|$|A {{composting}} yard treats all {{the household}} organic and garden wastes and provides high grade compost fertilizer for the vegetable and fruit gardens. It has an overall roof U value of 0.14. The glazing roof comprises 9.38mm thick <b>low-E</b> safety laminated glass {{which can be}} opened up to 90%. The overall building envelope OTTV is 29.63.|$|E
50|$|Some radiant {{barriers}} are spectrally selective and will preferentially reduce {{the flow of}} infra-red radiation in comparison to other wavelengths. For instance low-emissivity (<b>low-e)</b> windows will transmit light and short-wave infra-red energy into a building but reflect the long-wave infra-red radiation generated by interior furnishings. Similarly, special heat-reflective paints are able to reflect more heat than visible light, or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|A window {{covering}} is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some {{window covering}}s control {{solar heat gain}} and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices. <b>Low-e</b> window film is a low-cost alternative to window replacement to transform existing poorly-insulating windows into energy-efficient windows. For high-rise buildings, smart glass can provide an alternative.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of double skin facades over conventional single skin facades are not clear-cut; similar insulative values {{may be obtained}} using conventional high performance, <b>low-e</b> windows. The cavity results in a decrease in usable floor space, and depending on the strategy for ventilating the cavity, it may have problems with condensation, becoming soiled or introducing outside noise. The construction of a second skin may also present {{a significant increase in}} materials and design costs.|$|E
50|$|ITO is {{also used}} for various optical {{coatings}}, most notably infrared-reflecting coatings (hot mirrors) for automotive, and sodium vapor lamp glasses. Other uses include gas sensors, antireflection coatings, electrowetting on dielectrics, and Bragg reflectors for VCSEL lasers. ITO {{is also used}} as the IR reflector for <b>low-e</b> window panes. ITO was also used as a sensor coating in the later Kodak DCS cameras, starting with the Kodak DCS 520, {{as a means of}} increasing blue channel response.|$|E
50|$|During the Summer of 2008, Sugarloaf {{saw more}} than $5 million in offseason upgrades, {{including}} all new pumps for the snowmaking system, 25 new Boyne <b>Low-E</b> fan guns, and 50 low energy HKD tower guns. The resort also installed all new trail signage, replaced old, run-down lift shacks with new lift building, and completely redesigned its Terrain Parks, {{including a new}} snowboardcross course designed by Olympian Seth Wescott. The resort also saw a significant expansion to its on-mountain restaurant, Bullwinkle's.|$|E
50|$|The {{units are}} kept cool with a {{combination}} of window placement for cross ventilation; double-glazed, krypton-filled, <b>low-e</b> windows with stainless steel spacers; and blown-in recycled cellulose insulation that boosts the thermal value of the wall to 75% above a conventional, type-five wall and reduces envelope infiltration. Building appliances are highly efficient. The specially selected refrigerators consume only 1 kWh per day per unit. Light switches employ motion sensors to avoid wasting energy indoors and outdoors and compact fluorescent lights are used throughout the building.|$|E
5000|$|Glass can be {{made with}} differing thermal emissivities, but this is not used for windows. Certain {{properties}} such as the iron content may be controlled, changing the thermal emissivity properties of glass. This [...] "naturally" [...] low thermal emissivity is found in some formulations of borosilicate or Pyrex. Naturally <b>low-e</b> glass does not have the property of reflecting near infrared (NIR)/thermal radiation; instead, this type of glass has higher NIR transmission, leading to undesirable heat loss (or gain) in a building with that type of window.|$|E
50|$|On October 11, 2009, {{the airport}} {{constructed}} a new terminal and demolished the old terminal {{which was built}} in 1948. The new terminal is built around the modern TSA standards. In addition to architectural design and better security, the main terminal now has six jet-bridges (up from the former five). The 2,700m2 of custom unitised curtain wall was designed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong. The special design incorporated double <b>low-e</b> triple glazing. The new building's footprint is smaller than the old building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{school is}} Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified. This [...] "green building" [...] rating system {{emphasizes}} sensible land-use, energy efficiency, and comfort. Examples of LEED {{elements in the}} project include the field sod roof of the cafeteria (a green roof), collected rainwater used for flushing toilets, waterless urinals, extensive use of construction materials with recycled content, use of <b>Low-E</b> glazing and a reflective white ThermoPlastic Olefin roof membrane. Low-emitting materials were used in interior fittings and furniture to improve indoor air quality.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} heat {{transfer}} from a surface, such as a glass window, a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can {{be placed on the}} interior of the surface. “Low-emittance (<b>low-E)</b> coatings are microscopically thin, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the U-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow”. By adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2010, Fulton Homes {{became the}} first builder in Arizona to build all of its homes to Energy Star Version 3.0 standards, with {{inspection}} done on every home by a third party. [...] Some energy-efficient features that Fulton has incorporated in homes since 2010 include a Louisiana-Pacific TechShield radiant barrier to deflect heat from the attic, tinted <b>Low-E</b> vinyl-framed windows to reduce heat and UV rays from entering the home, and a 14 SEER Energy Star qualified Carrier air conditioning system as standard (with a 16 SEER air conditioning system available as an upgrade).|$|E
