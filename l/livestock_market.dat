5|$|The {{timetable}} for January 1883 shows {{a variety of}} passenger, goods and mixed trains, giving five passenger services down to Amlwch, and six up. The first train of the morning, departing Bangor at 04:20, and the 19:35 from Amlwch also carried mail {{to and from the}} island. The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen. As Llangefni held a <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> on a Thursday, an extra service from Bangor to Llangefni on Thursdays was introduced by the 1896 timetable.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford {{served the}} {{surrounding}} agricultural {{communities and the}} town maintained a weekly market throughout the 19th century and a <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> on Northgate from 1874 until 1984. According to a 2010 council report, the public sector was the town's main employer, along with agriculture and manufacturing. Unemployment was lower {{than the national average}} as were wages reflecting pay in the food processing and agricultural industries. At the 2011 Census, the largest group of working-age persons by economic activity are those in full-time employment, who make up 43.8% of this section of the population, while 15% are part-time employees and 7.7% are self-employed; 15% of the working-age population are retired. 4.2% were unemployed, with 40% of those in long-term unemployment and roughly one third were aged 16 to 24. The largest socio-economic grouping is those working in lower-tier managerial or administrative roles (21.9%), followed by semi-routine (17.8%), routine (15%) and intermediate (12.5%) occupations; no other group comprised 10% or more. In terms of industry, the most common, based on those working in the sector, are wholesale and retail trade (including automotive repairs) at 16.9%, health and social care (13.4%), public administration and defence (13.3%) and manufacturing (10.9%), with no other groups representing 10% or more. An unemployment survey of Lincolnshire in 2014 found that the county experienced a decline in unemployment (based on Jobseekers Allowance claimants) by 29% over the preceding 12 months, while the county's unemployment rate was marginally below the national average.|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the issues {{surrounding}} <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> in Turkana District. The report 's authors undertook an extensive literature review and conducted field work in Turkana in early 2006. They characterized and described the <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> systems operating in the district, identified problems and constraints, and {{made a series of}} recommendations intended {{to increase the number of}} pastoralists profitably accessing <b>livestock</b> <b>markets.</b> Finally, they identified researchable issues which would enable a better understanding of <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> in Turkana District. Topics of discussion include pastoralism in Turkana: then and now; failed livestock interventions; is Turkana District overstocked? How many people and livestock? Reluctance to sell or slaughter; <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> and consumption in Turkana; problems associated with <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> in Turkana including subsistence orientation, marketing infrastructure, transport, trader cartels and brokers, insecurity, taxes and bribes, lack of cash, quarantine restrictions, and information...|$|R
40|$|Korean {{economy has}} been rapidly {{developing}} since 1960 s. Per capita income has increased, and industrialization and urbanization have been progressed. As a result, demand for livestock products has been increasing. As the pattern of consumption and supply has changed, the <b>livestock</b> <b>markets</b> should be changed. The objective {{of this study is}} to find out problems and to make recommendations for improvement of <b>livestock</b> <b>markets</b> in Korea. In this study, special attention has been focused on changes of circumstances surrounding <b>livestock</b> <b>markets,</b> problems of <b>livestock</b> <b>markets</b> and improvement of <b>livestock</b> <b>markets</b> in Korea. The method adopted for this stucy was a comparative analysis between Korea and Japan. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The circumstances surrounding <b>livestock</b> <b>markets</b> have remarkably changed. The number of farmers raising 10 Korean native cattles or over increased from 257 in 1968 to 5, 413 in 1983, or by 21 times.

5|$|The {{relocation}} of the <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> had {{done little to}} resolve the problems of congestion {{in and around the}} market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly unpaved. Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18thcentury, this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18thcentury for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly from the loss of export markets during the French Wars, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19thcentury the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.|$|E

25|$|By 1850, {{the whole}} area had been taken up for grazing. Dandenong Creek was first bridged in 1840.

A township was surveyed in 1852. Milling of the red gum timber became an important industry, and charcoal burning, tanning, quarrying and brick making also flourished. A <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> was established in 1866.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{continues}} to be an important crossing point over the river, linking the centre of Ludlow with Ludford and places to the south and southwest of the town, including the town's <b>livestock</b> <b>market.</b> Until the opening of the Ludlow by-pass in 1979, the A49 road used the bridge (the B4361 through Ludlow and Ludford was then the A49). Vehicular traffic over the bridge is restricted to one direction at a time, and the two-way traffic of the road is controlled by traffic lights on both sides. Pedestrian refuges exist above the cutwaters between the arches.|$|E

40|$|This {{bulletin}} is {{a report}} of some recent developments in <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> practices abroad. Several years ago we began to feel that our <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> research would benefit from an investigation of marketing methods in other countries. Accordingly, while I was visiting several European countries during the last 4 months of 1935, I paid particular attention to their <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> methods. Two countries were particularly interesting—Denmark, which has a world wide reputation for advanced marketing methods, and Great Britain, which, until quite recently, has been very backward in that respect. My investigation was then rounded out {{in the fall of}} 1936 by a month spent in Canada, which is a country of special interest because of its proximity and similarity to the United States. In these three countries, every opportunity was given me to study <b>livestock</b> <b>marketing</b> from the ground up. I spent days and weeks in local auction markets, in central or terminal stockyards, on packing house slaughtering and processing floors, and in the offices of farmers’ representatives, packing house managers, and government men...|$|R
25|$|Two monastic {{institutions}} once {{existed in}} Ludlow — one Augustinian ("Austin") Friars {{on the corner}} of Lower Galdeford and Weeping Cross Lane, and the other Carmelite ("White") Friars between Linney and Corve Street. Both were dissolved in 1538. The White Friars site became the town's cemetery in 1824, with a new church constructed, dedicated to St Leonard (a St Leonard's chapel existed {{on the corner of}} Corve Street and Linney in medieval times). The St Leonard's graveyard and church still exist but are no longer used for burials or worship (instead the church building is now a commercial premises). The Austin Friars site became the town's <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> (the Smithfield) and is now a public car park.|$|E
25|$|Metro 3175, {{named after}} Dandenong's {{postcode}} {{is a major}} redevelopment of the former Dandenong <b>Livestock</b> <b>Market</b> (established 1866 and closed in 1998) begun in November 2005 consisting of a mixed-use development consisting of 1100 residences as well as cafes and restaurants. Because the site is isolated {{from the rest of}} the central Dandenong area, George Street was widened and extended with a bridge across the railway lines to improve access between the precincts. The bridge provides access for cars, pedestrians and cyclists and improves connections to bus services in the area. Additionally, Cheltenham Road, a major east-west arterial has been realigned in order to remove traffic from nearby streets and encourage pedestrian use.|$|E
25|$|Past {{industries}} {{were more}} strongly {{connected to the}} rural economy, such as a beet sugar factory in Scawby Brook, a <b>livestock</b> <b>market,</b> and Spring's jam factory; the latter being a nationally known brand.

Scawby Brook was also home to Bratleys roller flour mill, which was demolished in the 1940s although several of the old houses built for the mill owners in the 1830s remain, formerly known as mill place, now numbers 83-91 Scawby Road. The town was home to the Falcon Cycles factory for much of its independent existence, the company having moved to Brigg from nearby Barton-upon-Humber in the early 1900s.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> {{south of}} St Peter Mancroft was {{becoming}} overwhelmingly crowded on market days. Eventually {{part of the}} eastern side of the castle mound was levelled, and in 1738 the livestock sales were moved to this new site. The old hay market remained on the old site for more than a century, until it was also moved to the new <b>livestock</b> <b>market</b> site in the early 19thcentury.

40|$|Agricultural {{insurance}} {{does not}} only affect investment decisions in agriculture {{but also in}} a secondary, unrelated income earning activity that {{can serve as a}} risk mitigation and risk coping strategy, such as livestock farming.

Using data from a lab-in-the-field experiment with agricultural decision makers in rural Senegal we study the effects of agricultural insurance on investments in livestock with complete and seasonal <b>livestock</b> <b>markets.</b> In general, insurance increases investment in livestock farming.
