5|$|After {{returning}} to England in 1897, Chamberlain became a successful businessman {{in his home}} city of Birmingham. He was interested in social affairs, and successfully stood for Birmingham City Council in 1911. He became Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1915. His second term was interrupted in December 1916 when Prime Minister David Lloyd George asked him to become Director of National Service. Chamberlain received <b>little</b> <b>support</b> from Lloyd George in the post, and his eight-month tenure sparked a hatred between the two which lasted Chamberlain's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{had been}} a dark horse {{candidate}} with <b>little</b> <b>support</b> in the convention. His speech, delivered {{at the close of}} the debate on the party platform, electrified the convention and is generally credited with getting him the nomination for president. However, he lost the general election to William McKinley and the United States formally adopted the gold standard in 1900.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found <b>little</b> <b>support</b> among modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not enjoy}} the limited {{influence}} of his judicial role in the later years of his term, when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases. After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with <b>little</b> <b>support</b> for many of his opinions, which led him to begin considering retirement.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 November a YouGov poll {{conducted}} for The Daily Telegraph appeared {{to show that}} {{public support for the}} industrial action had dropped in comparison to a similar {{poll conducted}} two weeks earlier.

5|$|Soviet dissidents {{and human}} rights groups were {{routinely}} repressed by the KGB. Overall, political repression tightened during the Brezhnev era and Stalin experienced a partial rehabilitation. The two leading figures in the Soviet dissident movement during the Brezhnev Era were Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. Despite their individual fame and widespread sympathy in the West, they attracted <b>little</b> <b>support</b> from {{the mass of the}} population. Sakharov was forced into internal exile in 1979, and Solzhenitsyn was forced out of the country in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa {{supported}} Poland's {{entry into}} NATO and the European Union, {{both of which}} occurred after his presidency, in 1999 and 2004, respectively. In the early 1990s he proposed {{the creation of a}} sub-regional security system called NATO bis. The concept was supported by right-wing and populist movements in Poland but garnered <b>little</b> <b>support</b> abroad; Poland's neighbors, some of which (e.g. Lithuania), had recently regained independence and tended to see the proposal as Polish neo-imperialism.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively <b>little</b> <b>support</b> in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|Ambrose's bowling method {{relied on}} {{accuracy}} and conceding few runs; {{several of his}} best performances came when he took wickets in quick succession to devastate the opposition. He was particularly successful against leading batsmen. From 1995, Ambrose was increasingly affected by injury, and several times critics claimed {{that he was no}} longer effective. However, he continued to take wickets regularly up until his retirement, although he was sometimes less effective in the early matches of a series. In his final years, the West Indies team was in decline and often relied heavily on Ambrose and Walsh; both men often bowled with <b>little</b> <b>support</b> from the other bowlers. Following his retirement, Ambrose has pursued a career in music as the bass guitarist in a reggae band.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{visit was}} a highmark in {{relations}} between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, {{who began to}} criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By {{the time of his}} assassination, he had <b>little</b> <b>support.</b> Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam and opposition to the Vietnam War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Chamberlain was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} Central Control Board on liquor traffic. In December 1916 the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, offered Chamberlain the new position of Director of National Service with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. However, his tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George and in August 1917, having received <b>little</b> <b>support</b> from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would be one thenceforth of hatred.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing <b>little</b> <b>support</b> for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received <b>little</b> <b>support</b> nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is <b>little</b> <b>support</b> for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

The pore pressure hypothesis has a difficulty in explaining the localized nature of the asperity, and there is very <b>little</b> <b>supporting</b> evidence for the seamount hypothesis.

5|$|It {{would take}} almost two full years {{until the first}} French Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and it {{required}} another popular intervention to make it happen. Louis attempted {{to work within the}} framework of his limited powers after the women's march but won <b>little</b> <b>support,</b> and he and the royal family remained virtual prisoners in the Tuileries. Desperate, he made his abortive flight to Varennes in June 1791. Attempting to escape and join up with royalist armies, the king was once again captured by a mixture of citizens and national guardsmen who hauled him back to Paris. Permanently disgraced, Louis was forced to accept a constitution more denuding of his kingship than any previously put forward. The spiral of decline in the king's fortunes culminated at the guillotine in 1793.|$|E
5|$|Many princes {{were also}} {{pressured}} by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant {{their plans for}} independence had <b>little</b> <b>support</b> from their subjects. The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. In a few states, the chief ministers or dewans {{played a significant role}} in convincing the princes to accede to India. The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the States Department, which was in charge of relations with the princely states.|$|E
