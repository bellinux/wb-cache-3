The rest of the tracks were recorded in their mother's lounge room back in Newport with Pritchett. 2007 commenced with the duo playing at January's Big Day Out.|$|E
25|$|However, a wave <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> {{definite}} wavelength is not localized in space, and so cannot {{represent a}} particle localized in space. To localize a particle, de Broglie proposed a superposition of different wavelengths ranging around a central {{value in a}} wave packet, a waveform often used in quantum mechanics to describe the wave function of a particle. In a wave packet, the wavelength of the particle is not precise, and the local wavelength deviates {{on either side of}} the main wavelength value.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{compensated}} instruments {{tended to}} sound stuffy and blow less freely {{due to the}} air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more ‘straight’ valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still built <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>with</b> five valves being common on CC- and BB-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.|$|E

500|$|After {{the joint}} {{production}} of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End cost over $300 million, Disney {{decided to give}} a lower budget to the fourth installment. Many costs had to be cut, including moving primary production to Hawaii and London, where tax credits are more favorable, and having a shorter shooting schedule and fewer scenes featuring special effects compared to At World's End. The tighter schedule—according to Bruckheimer, [...] "We had a 22-week post, and for a picture <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>with</b> almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks"—meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming. The British financial statements of the film revealed total expenditures of £240.7 million ($410.6 million) by 2013, with Disney receiving a rebate of $32.1 million from the British government, making Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides the most expensive film ever made to date.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reception. According to Darrell Giles of The Courier Mail, several American critics [...] characterized it as {{the best}} episode of the show. Jason Steele of the Chicago Tribunes RedEye named it one of his three favorite episodes of Will & Grace. Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk wrote that the episode was hilarious. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Damon's spunky appearance... as a straight guy posing as homosexual and competing with Jack (Sean Hayes) for a spot in a gay men's choir. The show is endlessly imaginative in the ways it explores themes <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a humor that doesn't betray or belittle its core gay characters." [...] Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News was less positive about the episode, stating that it [...] "plays like bad camp. There's nothing realistic about it— seem more like the inhabitants of a lame Saturday Night Live sketch than marginally real characters." [...] He also noted that [...] "the extent of the tastelessness of the sex talk and Karen faking a sexual encounter is amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{pictures}} of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for [...] "promoting gun violence", since {{the area had}} been badly affected by the 2011 England riots. The Council told London Tonight {{that they had not}} agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity [...] "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." [...] When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted: [...] "It is only a music video but it's images <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>with</b> popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better." [...] Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly explained that the United Kingdom [...] "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years." [...] On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, [...] "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened." [...] The production company apologized to the Council before the release of the video. Marrs Piliero stated about the controversy, ...|$|E

2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film {{two out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "House of Wax {{is not a good}} movie, but it is an {{efficient}} one and will deliver most of what anyone attending House of Wax could reasonably expect...assuming it would be unreasonable to expect very much." [...] He said of Hilton's performance that [...] "she is no better or worse than the typical Dead Post-Teenager and does exactly what she is required to do in a movie <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>with</b> all the skill—admittedly finite—that is required." [...] Film critic Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and wrote that it gives horror fans exactly what they want. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, [...] "After a month, no one will talk about this movie again. Still, with a picture like this, there is really only one question: Is it fun? Yes. Lots. Definitely." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it boring and poorly-acted, though he complimented Cuthbert and Murray. [...] A. O.
