5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) <b>lift</b> hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} <b>lift,</b> the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the <b>lift,</b> it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the <b>lift.</b> Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} <b>lift</b> hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the <b>lift</b> hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} <b>lift</b> in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical <b>lift</b> like an aircraft wing; supercritical <b>lift</b> with the wing above the critical angle, generating high <b>lift</b> and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lifting</b> is {{a common}} task that many people face every day. Some jobs, like manual garbage collecting, require {{considerably}} more frequent <b>lifting.</b> Heavy weight, improper posture and repetition can apply excessive forces to different body parts, especially on the lower back, {{which is one of}} the most affected parts during <b>lifting.</b> The current study focuses on infrequent, symmetric <b>lifting.</b> A box, weight 2, 60, or 130 N, is picked up from the floor and <b>lifted</b> to different heights using either knee or hip <b>lifting.</b> Ergonomic checklists are used to evaluate these <b>lifts.</b> They typically take into account body posture, weight <b>lifted</b> and frequency.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>lifting,</b> i. e., {{the process}} of taking a valid inequality for a polyhedron and extending it to a valid inequality in a higher dimensional space. <b>Lifting</b> is usually applied sequentially, that is, variables in a set are <b>lifted</b> one after the other. This may be computationally unattractive since it involves the solution of an optimization problem to compute a <b>lifting</b> coefficient for each variable. To relieve this computational burden, we study sequence independent <b>lifting,</b> which only involves the solution of one optimization problem. We show that if a certain <b>lifting</b> function is superadditive, then the <b>lifting</b> coefficients are independent of the <b>lifting</b> sequence. We introduce the idea of valid superadditive <b>lifting</b> functions to obtain good aproximations to maximum <b>lifting.</b> We apply these results to strengthen Balas' <b>lifting</b> theorem for cover inequalities and to produce <b>lifted</b> flow cover inequalities for a single node flow problem.

40|$|Group <b>lifting</b> {{structures}} {{are introduced to}} provide an algebraic framework for studying <b>lifting</b> factorizations of two-channel perfect reconstruction finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter banks. The <b>lifting</b> factorizations generated by a group <b>lifting</b> structure are characterized by Abelian groups of lower and upper triangular <b>lifting</b> matrices, an Abelian group of unimodular gain scaling matrices, {{and a set of}} base filter banks. Examples of group <b>lifting</b> {{structures are}} given for linear phase <b>lifting</b> factorizations of the two nontrivial classes of two-channel linear phase FIR filter banks, the whole- and half-sample symmetric classes, including both the reversible and irreversible cases. This covers the <b>lifting</b> specifications for whole-sample symmetric filter banks in Parts 1 and 2 of the ISO/IEC JPEG 2000 still image coding standard. The theory is used to address the uniqueness of <b>lifting</b> factorizations. With no constraints on the <b>lifting</b> process, it is shown that <b>lifting</b> factorizations are highly nonunique. When certain hypotheses developed in the paper are satisfied, however, <b>lifting</b> factorizations generated by a group <b>lifting</b> structure are shown to be unique.

5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat <b>lift</b> was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The <b>lift</b> was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new <b>lift</b> was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E
