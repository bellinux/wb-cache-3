25|$|Nobel {{also began}} to adopt a single-hull design, where the ship's hull forms part of its tank structure. In November 1880 he ordered his first single-hulled tanker, the Moses. Within a year, he ordered seven more single-hulled tankers: the Mohammed, Tatarin, Bramah, Spinoza, Socrates, Darwin, Koran, Talmud, and Calmuck. Branobel {{experienced}} {{one of the first}} oil tanker disasters. In 1881 Zoroasters sister-ship, Nordenskjöld, exploded in Baku while taking on kerosene. The pipe carrying the cargo was jerked away from the hold when the ship was hit by a gust of wind. Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, <b>leakproof</b> loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.|$|E

40|$|Aortic {{clamping}} {{time needed to}} carry out anastomosis during aortic surgery {{is one of the}} major predictive factors of morbidity/mortality. Because of the difficulties inherent in this technique, the duration of aortic clamping can be increased significantly with laparoscopy, which may explain why this kind of surgery is not often undertaken. We designed an original connector that will help us perform automated end-to-end vascular anastomoses. This anastomotic device was tested on a cadaver, test benches, and finally on pigs. The connector consists of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface. Once the prosthesis has been introduced into the arterial lumen over a 15 -mm length, the connector is placed into the prosthesis; then, upon inflating a balloon and employing stent spikes, the prosthesis can be anchored in the artery. A feasibility study was carried out, first on cadaveric arteries and then on bench tests. In vivo, using this connector, the infrarenal aorta of 7 pigs was replaced with a 6 e 8 -mm-diameter prosthesis. One to 42 days after implantation, angiography was performed before explanting the prosthesis. Evaluation criteria included anastomosis performance time, <b>leakproofing</b> capacity, tensile strength, patency, and histologic changes induced by the device. On the cadavers, manual traction tests showed that the anastomoses were satisfactory. Median force needed to rupture an automated anastomosis was 15. 85 N. No leakage was seen under a systolic/diastolic pressure of up to 250 / 180 mm Hg. All pigs benefited from automated anastomosis. Once the designed device had been assessed, the median connection time was 2 minutes. In 4 cases, aortic thrombosis was found, 1 of which was septic. The implanting ancillary was responsible for 2 posterior aortic wall perforations, which extended the {{clamping time}}; therefore, this device should be modified. Anastomosis patency and tensile strength tests were satisfactory. Histologic results showed the connector incorporation, integration of the spikes in the arterial wall, and the absence of inflammation in the aortic wall. These preliminary studies confirm that the connector is quick and reliable for performing in vivo arterioprosthetic anastomoses. Further studies are needed to improve the ancillary device, which will enable its use it in laparoscopic and conventional surgery...|$|R

All liquid waste must be stored in <b>leakproof</b> containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. Snap caps, mis-sized caps, parafilm and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases.|$|E

50|$|Although {{accepted}} for bridges, etc., exposing structural Cor-Ten {{in a building}} was not possible using standard construction methods because steel needed to be protected by concrete or an applied insulation to meet the fire-protection requirements of building codes.

50|$|John Sears {{adopted a}} {{different}} solution {{based on the}} evaporation of seawater in large wooden vats, which he constructed near his Cape Cod home in Dennis, Massachusetts. The process was inefficient and unrewarding at first, but he improved it by making the vats <b>leakproof,</b> providing moveable covers {{to keep out the}} rain and installing a salvaged bilge pump to draw water directly from the sea via leadlined wooden pipes. He profited considerably both from his production improvements and from the increase in the price of salt from 50 cents a bushel to $8 by the time the war finished in 1783. In 1785 he built a windmill to pump the water automatically from the sea.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1894, Deport {{was passed}} over for promotion, and {{resigned}} to join [...] "Chatillon-Commentry", a private armaments firm. Two young military engineers from Ecole Polytechnique, Captains Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Emile Rimailho, continued development and introduced an improved version in 1896. Their contribution was a <b>leakproof</b> hydro-pneumatic long-recoil mechanism which they named [...] "Frein II" [...] ( [...] Brake # II [...] ). A major improvement was the placement of improved silver-alloy rings on the freely moving piston which separated the compressed air and the hydraulic fluid inside the main hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder. These and other modifications achieved the desired result: the long-term retention of hydraulic fluid and compressed air inside the recoil system, even under the worst field conditions.|$|E
50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a grooved {{coupling}}, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, coupling housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by cold-forming (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a <b>leakproof</b> seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|E

5000|$|The {{ergonomic}} design and materials {{used to make}} pads also changed through the 1980s to today. With earlier materials not being as absorbent and effective, and early pads being up to two centimetres thick, leaks were a major problem.

The materials used to manufacture most pads are derived from the petroleum industry and forestry. The absorbent core, made from chlorine bleached wood pulp, could be reduced to make slimmer products with the addition of polyacrylate gels which sucks up the liquid quickly and holds it in a suspension under pressure. The remaining materials are mostly derived from the petroleum industry, the cover stock used is polypropylene non woven, with the <b>leakproof</b> barrier made from polyethylene film.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the crime}} scene has been {{thoroughly}} documented and {{the locations of the}} evidence noted, then the collection process can begin. Most items of evidence will be collected in paper containers such as packets, envelopes, and bags. Liquid items can be transported in non-breakable, <b>leakproof</b> containers. Arson evidence is usually collected in air-tight, clean metal cans. Only large quantities of dry powder should be collected and stored in plastic bags. Moist or wet evidence (blood, plants, etc.) from a crime scene can be collected in plastic containers at the scene and transported back to an evidence receiving area if the storage time in plastic is two hours or less and this is done to prevent contamination of other evidence. Once in a secure location, wet evidence, whether packaged in plastic or paper, must be removed and allowed to completely air dry. That evidence can then be repackaged in a new, dry paper container. Under no circumstances should evidence containing moisture be packaged in plastic or paper containers for more than two hours. Moisture allows the growth of microorganisms which can destroy or alter evidence. Any items which may cross contaminate each other must be packaged separately. The containers should be closed and secured to prevent the mixture of evidence during transportation. Each container should have: the collecting person's initials; the date and time it was collected; a complete description of the evidence and where it was found; and the investigating agency's name and their file number.|$|E
