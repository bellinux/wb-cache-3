We hope the present study will be a step towards chang-ing this attitude. Using a laboratory-made, flexible, single-phototube system, the value of 2 basic parameters has been determined from the pulse-height spectra of 1) single-photocathode electrons; 2) Cerenkov radiation; and 3) fluorescence; using the calculated cathode photon efficiency. The 2 parameters include a) the photon collection efficiency of the vial/pho-totube unit, which depends only on the counting system used; and b) the photon scintillation yield, which depends only on the scintillation cocktail. From these 2 parameters, other parameters are derived. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates the advantage of single-tube detector units...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this {{proposed}} isotopic dilution method, {{the activities of}} target isotope-analytes are determined relative to the known activity of an isotope tracer that is added in the initial stage of analysis {{in order to determine}} the chemical yield. A key aspect of activity calculation, undertaken on the basis of new mathematical approaches, is the splitting of a complex spectrum obtained by <b>liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> (LS) <b>counting</b> into its separate individual reference spectra, corrected for the sample quench-ing parameter. This method avoids applying alternative techniques for chemical yield determination, such as gravimetry, var-ious modifications of optical methods (SF, AAS, AES), or γ spectrometry. Based on our experience, it is possible to formulate the following criteria to select tracer isotopes for LS spectrometry: absence (or negligible content) in analyzed samples, suf-ficiently long half-life (at least 1 month), and, most importantly, minimal overlapping of the spectra of the isotopes to be deter-mined. Because of the poor energy resolution of the LS spectra, it is necessary to optimize the amount of the isotope tracer in order to minimize the statistical uncertainties when determining the activities of target isotopes. In the present work, we present methods for identifying and quantifying the individual isotopic activity, and for evaluating the components of uncer-tainties resulting from the analysis of complex LS spectra.

40|$|All four {{naturally}} occurring radium isotopes (223 Ra, 224 Ra, 226 Ra, 228 Ra) and 222 Rn in the groundwater affected Eckernförder Bay (EB) of the Baltic Sea (Germany) were measured using alpha-spectrometry and <b>liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> (LS) <b>counting.</b> The applied analytical methods are optimally adapted for extensive field surveillance of short-lived radiotracers. Dispersive physical mixing acting over time scales {{on the order}} of days is responsible for the distribution of 223 Ra, 224 Ra and 222 Rn in EB. The distribution of these natural tracers is controlled by the strength of the sedimentary source, the influence of direct groundwater input, the dispersive mixing coefficient in the water column and their radioactive decay. Using a simple one-dimensional transport model, the distribution of 224 Ra near the sea floor can be described with a horizontal dispersivity in the range between 100 to 5 × 101 m 2 s− 1. From the inventory of 222 Rn (72. 4 ± 7. 4 Bq m− 2) in the EB, the groundwater discharge rate is estimated to be < 1. 7 m 3 s− 1. In order to balance the inventory of 223 Ra (0. 52 ± 0. 22 Bq m− 2) and 224 Ra (6. 46 ± 2. 6 B qm− 2) a source other than groundwater seepage has to be responsible for almost all of the 224 Ra and 223 Ra inventory of the EB.

40|$|A typical {{problem in}} {{low-level}} <b>liquid</b> <b>scintillation</b> (LS) <b>counting</b> is {{the identification of}} alpha particles {{in the presence of}} a high background of beta and gamma particles. Especially the occurrence of beta-beta and beta-gamma pile-ups may prevent the unambiguous identification of an alpha signal by commonly used analog electronics. In this case, pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) and pile-up rejection (PUR) units show an insufficient performance. This problem was also observed in own earlier experiments on the chemical behaviour of transactinide elements using the liquid-liquid extraction system SISAK in combination with LS counting alpha-particle signals from the decay of the transactinides could not be unambiguously assigned. However, the availability of instruments for the digital recording of LS pulses changes the situation and provides possibilities for new approaches in the treatment of LS pulse shapes. In a SISAK experiment performed at PSI, Villigen, a fast transient recorder, a PC card with oscilloscope characteristics and a sampling rate of 1 giga samples s(- 1) (1 ns per point), was used for the first time to record LS signals. It turned out, that the recorded signals were predominantly alpha, beta-beta and beta-gamma pile up, and fission events. This paper describes the subsequent development and use of artificial neural networks (ANN) based on the method of "back-propagation of errors" to automatically distinguish between different pulse shapes. Such networks can "learn" pulse shapes and classify hitherto unknown pulses correctly after a learning period. The results show that ANN in combination with fast digital recording of pulse shapes can be a powerful tool in LS spectrometry even at high background count rates...|$|R
