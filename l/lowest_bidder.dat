5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder</b> gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder,</b> Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E

Prior to 1996, the Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Volunteer Fire Department served the town, with Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue serving until 2001. The Broward County Sheriff's Office Department of Fire Rescue & Emergency Services provided fire suppression services to the town from 2001 until 2008.

25|$|Throughout the Black Committee {{process and}} a smaller, {{parallel}} {{investigation by the}} Justice Department directed by special prosecutor Carl. L.

The original air mail contracts were instead voided {{on the basis that}} they were illegally bid, without revealing what evidence was gathered on which that judgment was made and disregarding that most were obtained by the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder</b> with the rest through statutory provisions of the Air Mail Act of 1930. The Air Mail Act of 1934 repealed those provisions, but with one exception, the carriers charged with illegally securing contracts under them were permitted to reacquire them despite provisions in the new act forbidding it.|$|E

Through its investigations, the committee identified as one example of fraud violations by the executive departments of laws requiring them to advertise contracts for proposals, and award those contracts to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder.</b> However, according to the committee, the department secretaries made contracts with their friends for the furnishing of supplies, on the grounds that such procurements were urgent and in the public interest. The committee did offer an amendment condemning this practice, which was passed unanimously. The resolution was especially aimed at the Navy Department, which the most peculiar contracts appeared. Other suspect contracts were found in the War Department, under the administration of President Lincoln's first War Secretary, Simon Cameron.|$|E

25|$|The bidding date, {{originally}} December 20, 1961, {{was postponed}} to January 22, 1962, {{to clarify the}} details of the arch construction. About 50 companies that had requested the construction requirements received bidding invitations. Extending from $11,923,163 to $12,765,078, all four bids exceeded the engineer estimate of $8,067,000. Wirth had a committee led by George Hartzog determine the validity of the bids in light of the government's conditions. Following a meeting with the bidders, the committee affirmed the bids' reasonableness, and Wirth awarded the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder,</b> MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis, the contract for the construction of the arch and the visitor center. On March 14, 1962, he signed the contract and received from Tucker $2,500,000, the city's subsidy for the phase. MacDonald reduced its bid $500,000 to $11,442,418. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company served as the subcontractor for the shell of the arch.|$|E

25|$|Governments {{may choose}} to give {{subsidies}} to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer externalities than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide direct subsidies in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company– with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state {{may choose to}} provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or public service obligation tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Total EU rail subsidies amounted to €73 billion in 2005.|$|E

25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder</b> in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will have no recourse to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well. In 1981, Metro had proposed building 1,000 parking spaces in a three-level parking garage and 300 spaces at a ground-level {{parking lot at}} the station and using interstate highway funds to pay for them. Metro officials argued the facility was highway-related, since it provided parking, but the Federal Highway Administration refused to allow the District of Columbia use its funds to pay for the parking garage. Local citizens also opposed the parking garage in favor of ground-level-only parking at the station, and demanded that Metro provide more connecting bus routes at the proposed station. These disagreements were put off as Metro officials and others focused on getting the Green Line built, but by 1985 the parking garage remained part of the station's overall transportation and construction plan. Metro solicited bids for an $11 million contract to build the parking garage in early 1985, but rejected all bids when the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder</b> failed to meet minority-contracting standards. In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on the parking garage would begin in June.|$|E

To counter this acquisition by a major rival, Argentina began seeking bids for at least two dreadnoughts in 1908. Over the next two years, shipbuilders from five countries vied for the contracts, complemented by efforts from their respective governments. Argentina was able to play this hyper-competitive environment to its own advantage by rejecting all of the initial proposals and calling for new ones that required the best aspects of each. They then repeated this process, despite complaints from shipbuilders that their trade secrets were being given away. The contracts were awarded to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder,</b> Fore River, in early 1910. This move shocked the European bidders, but could partly be explained by the American steel trust's ability to produce steel at a lower cost than any other country.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's term {{as mayor}} was spent {{fighting}} the entrenched {{interests of the}} party machines.

The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland {{would have none of}} it. His veto message said, [...] "I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money." [...] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the <b>lowest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.
