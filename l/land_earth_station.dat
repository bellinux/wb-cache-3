40|$|At this moment, the European GNSS Supervisory Authority, {{the public}} agency-half of the Public-Private Partnership principally {{in charge of}} the Galileo system, is built up, and the first {{full-fledged}} operations on a global scale are currently envisaged by 2010 or shortly thereafter. Thus, one set of legal questions which now becomes of interest concerns those surrounding the possibility for third countries to host Galileo ground stations. The present paper seeks to analyse these issues from the perspective of space law, in particular as regards issues of international responsibility and liability under the Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention, and how they would or might impact upon the specific context of operating ground stations for the Galileo satellite system. In doing so, it will include a brief update as to the institutional structure being developed for Galileo, as well as a summary comparison with existing precedents of third states hosting ground stations for a satellite system principally operating outside of their control, such as the <b>Land</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Station</b> Operator Agreements in the context of INMARSAT/Inmarsat and the bilateral agreements between the United States and third countries on the hosting of ground stations for the LANDSAT system...|$|E
40|$|Constable Hansen Kalran of the Vanuatu Police Maritime Wing {{has just}} logged {{on to the}} Internet and has {{downloaded}} a report that gives her cause for concern. Her monitor shows a satellite map of the entire exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Vanuatu and the coordinates of all fishing vessels currently navigating its waters. All of the ships are following routes stipulated in their fishing agreements with the island state, save one: a foreign tuna fishing vessel that should be on its way home. Instead of directly leaving the EEZ from the port where it cleared customs, the vessel has stopped off en route, in all probability to catch extra fish illegally. Kalran wastes no time - she alerts her colleagues {{and within a few}} minutes the Police Maritime Wing´s patrol boat is preparing to intercept and inspect the suspect ship. Dealing with incidents such as {{this is part of the}} daily routine of the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) Division of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). The division has been successfully operating a satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS) for its member states in the western and central Pacific since 1999. The VMS is primarily used to ensure that foreign fishing vessels comply with regulations designed to promote the sustainable management and development of and thus to protect the livelihoods of local small-scale tuna fishermen. Enforcing compliance has become increasingly difficult, however. The Pacific tuna fisheries - which support an industry worth $ 1. 8 billion per year - currently account for one-third of global tuna catches, and everyone wants a piece of the pie. To complicate matters, artisanal, subsistence and commercial tuna fishers are searching for four principal species - skipjack, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore - as they migrate through the numerous national jurisdictions and areas of high seas. Approximately 50 - 60 % of the total catch is taken within the EEZs of FFA members, which cover about 30 million km? of ocean. To stem the increase in illegal fishing vessels in this vast area, most FFA members have reserved their 12 nautical-mile exclusion zones for fishing by artisanal and subsistence fishermen, while other islands have put in place 40 nautical-mile exclusion zones that are off-limits to all foreign fishing vessels. Intruders, however, are always on the alert for good fishing opportunities and, increasingly, can only be controlled with the help of advanced ICT systems such as the FFA VMS. How the FFA VMS works The FFA VMS uses satellite technology to pinpoint a vessel´s position and then relays that information to an FFA member monitoring station. At the core of the system is an automatic location communicator (ALC), a sophisticated transponder that every fishing vessel operating in FFA territory is required to have onboard. This device, about the size of a car radio, consists of an integrated global positioning system unit and an Inmarsat transceiver, and monitors the vessel´s position, speed and course. The information is beamed up from an inbuilt aerial to an Inmarsat satellite, which is fixed in geostationary orbit above the Pacific. The satellite transmits the data to a <b>Land</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Station</b> in Australia, from where it is carried by telephone lines to the VMS hub computer at the FFA Secretariat in Honiara, in the Solomon Islands, for further processing. This computer identifies any vessels violating fishing regulations and generates alert reports. The reports are downloaded via an encrypted Internet connection by the FFA members in whose EEZ the vessels are operating. In January 2004, for example, FFA members were able to use the system to track the activities of 883 foreign fishing vessels. The FFA VMS has already proven to be a cost-effective means of providing support to the region´s compliance and monitoring programme. According to recent statistics, reported cases of illegal fishing have remained at a consistently low level since its introduction in 1999. Its annual ongoing operating costs, estimated at $ 845 per vessel, are recovered from the participating tuna fishing vessels. The system also shows strong future potential - it could, for example, easily be applied to track other vessels, such as those that illegally transport live coral reef fish. The FFA VMS is thus paving the way in the development of a fully integrated fisheries management approach for the region. mailto:andrew. richards@ffa. int Andrew Richards is FFA´s Monitoring, Control & Surveillance manager.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study and examine the various {{reliability}} characteristics of a global mobile satellite communication System (GMSCS) {{with the help of}} mathematical modelling. GMSCS basically comprises of four subsystems; Space segment, <b>Land</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations,</b> Telecommunication terminals and Mobile <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> The system under consideration can have three different modes of working: normal, partial and complete failure. The system is characterized by determination of probabilities being in ‘up’ and ‘down’ states at any instant. Integro-differential equations are derived for these probabilities by identifying the system at suitable regeneration epochs. Based {{on the assumption that the}} failure rates of units are distributed exponentially while the repair rates are distributed arbitrarily, different reliability measures like operational availability, reliability, mean time to failure and cost effectiveness have been computed with the principle of Laplace transforms and supplementary variable technique. Considerable attention is devoted to illustrate the results with numerical examples to highlight the important features of reliability measures of the system...|$|R

40|$|Inmarsat {{has been}} {{providing}} near global mobile satellite communications since 1982 and Inmarsat terminals {{are currently being}} used in more than 130 countries. The terminals have been reduced in size and cost {{over the years and}} new technology has enabled the recent introduction of briefcase sized personal telephony terminals (Inmarsat-M). This trend continues and we are likely to see Inmarsat handheld terminals {{by the end of the}} decade. These terminals are called Inmarsat-P and this paper focuses on the various elements required to support a high quality service to handheld terminals. The main system elements are: the handheld terminals; the space segment with the associated orbits; and the gateways to terrestrial networks. It is both likely and desirable that personal handheld satellite communications will be offered by more than one system provider and this competition will ensure strong emphasis on service quality and cost of ownership. The handheld terminals also have to be attractive to a large number of potential users, and this means that the terminals must be small enough to fit in a pocket. Battery lifetime is another important consideration, and this coupled with radiation safety requirements limits the maximum radiated EIRP. The terminal G/T is mainly constrained by the gain of the omnidirectional antenna and the noise figure of the RF front end (including input losses). Inmarsat has examined, with the support of industry, a number of Geosynchronous (GSO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite options for the provision of a handheld mobile satellite service. This paper describes the key satellite and orbit parameters and tradeoffs which affect the overall quality of service and the space segment costing. The paper also stresses not only the importance of using and sharing the available mobile frequency band allocations efficiently, but also the key considerations affecting the choice of feeder link bands. The design of the gateways and the terrestrial network is critical to the overall viability of the service, and this paper also examines the key technical parameters associated with the <b>Land</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Stations</b> (LES), which act as gateways into the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). These not only include the design tradeoffs associated with the LES, but also the different terrestrial network interface options. The paper concludes with a brief description of the satellite propagation conditions associated with the use of handheld terminals. It describes how the handheld results in a number of propagation impairments which are not common to the previous measurements associated with vehicle mounted antennas. These measurements indicate that there is a complex tradeoff between link margin and the elevation angle to the satellite which has a significant impact on the space segment requirements and costing...|$|R
