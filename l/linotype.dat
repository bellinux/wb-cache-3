5|$|A major {{professional}} competitor to Bembo is Agmena, {{created by}} Jovica Veljović and released by <b>Linotype</b> in 2014. Intended {{as a unified}} serif design supporting Roman, Greek {{and a range of}} Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian, it features a more calligraphic italic than Bembo with swash capitals and support for Greek ligatures.|$|E

5|$|In Petrograd, {{the work}} of {{beginning}} publication was assisted by the nascent Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda Union, and the new paper bolstered the city's indigenous anarcho-syndicalist movement. Its editorial staff included Maksim Rayevsky, Vladimir Shatov (the <b>linotype</b> operator), Volin, Gregori Maksimov, Alexander Schapiro, and Vasya Swieda.|$|E
5|$|Several digitisations {{have been}} made of both ATF's {{original}} Garamond and the <b>Linotype</b> adaptation, most notably a 2015 digitisation by van Bronkhorst with optical sizes and the original swash characters. A loose adaptation with sans-serif companion by Christian Schwartz is the corporate font of Deutsche Bahn.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Warde's article was {{published}} some revivals {{had been released}} that were more authentic revivals of Garamond's work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out a crisp revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did <b>Linotype</b> in Britain.|$|E

50|$|Between 2004-2007, Frutiger, {{together}} with <b>Linotype's</b> in-house type designer Akira Kobayashi, reworked the Avenir family {{to expand the}} range of weights and features. The result was titled Avenir Next.|$|R
50|$|When Dodsworth took over, he {{immediately}} laid off {{most members of}} both staffs. He didnt want writers who couldnt write on the newfangled typewriting machines or compositors who couldnt run <b>linotypes.</b>|$|R
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by <b>Linotype,</b> that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|These revivals {{could be}} made using {{pantograph}} machine engraving systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of a family in a large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype's branches in Britain and the United States brought out separate versions, and the American branch of <b>Linotype</b> licensed that of ATF.|$|E
5|$|After resting {{for several}} months, Berkman began to recover. He {{remained}} anxious about {{his lack of}} employment. He considered returning to his old job as a printer, but his skills had become obsolete in light of innovations in <b>linotype</b> machines. With Goldman's encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of his prison years, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist, and she invited him to become the editor of her journal, Mother Earth. He served as editor from 1907 to 1915, and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, {{in contrast to the}} more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, Max Baginski. Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of Mother Earth rose as high as 10,000 and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|A fully {{equipped}} printing area consisting of letterpresses, offset press, cutters, folders, bindery, <b>linotypes</b> etc. contributed toward making the church independent of commercial printers {{for the production}} for its printing needs at that time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Linotype's</b> Baskerville {{was cut in}} 1923 by George W. Jones, {{though it}} was {{subsequently}} re-cut in 1936. A bold version was cut by Chauncey H. Griffith in 1939. It may sometimes be called Baskerville LT.|$|R
50|$|It also {{resembles the}} Letraset face Compacta and <b>Linotype’s</b> Helvetica Inserat, and {{is similar to}} the {{masthead}} of Private Eye (which is caps-only but based on a never-released typeface with a lower case), designed by Matthew Carter slightly earlier.|$|R
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the <b>linotype</b> machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of the Arts and Crafts period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by <b>Linotype</b> and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E
5|$|Sabon is a Garamond revival {{designed}} by Jan Tschichold in 1964, jointly released by <b>Linotype,</b> Monotype and Stempel in 1967. It {{is named after}} Jacques Sabon, a Frankfurt-based printer, who introduced the typefaces of Garamond and his contemporaries to German printing. An unusual feature of many releases of Sabon is that the italic, based on Granjon's work, is wider than most normal italics, at the same width as the roman style. This suited Linotype's hot metal typesetting system. Later Sabon versions, such as Jean François Porchez's Sabon Next, have not always maintained this principle. Porchez and Mosley, as part of Porchez's research into Sabon, suggest that aspects of its design may have been copied from a font by Guillaume Le Bé, a large-size specimen {{of which he had}} previously reproduced in a textbook.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{distortion}} problems, Adobe dropped Helvetica Narrow in its release of Helvetica in OpenType format, recommending users choose Helvetica Condensed instead. However, in <b>Linotype's</b> OpenType version of Helvetica Narrow, {{the distortion}}s {{found in the}} Adobe fonts are non-existent.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Linotype's</b> Caslon Old Face {{hot metal}} {{typesetting}} adaptation. It {{was based on}} types provided by the H.W. Caslon company, although these may actually have been secretly re-engraved {{around the end of}} the nineteenth century rather than being Caslon's original work.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Garamond' fonts {{actually}} {{based on}} Jannon's work include Monotype Garamond, the version included with Microsoft Office, and <b>Linotype's</b> Garamond No. 3. František Štorm's 2010 revival, Jannon Pro, {{is one of}} the few modern revivals of Jannon's work released under his name.|$|R
25|$|Some <b>linotype</b> {{machines}} {{included a}} paper tape reader. This allowed {{the text to}} be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare paper tape to be processed by a single <b>linotype</b> machine, essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the <b>linotype</b> machine.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Akzidenz-Grotesk was {{available}} {{under the name}} ‘Standard’. <b>Linotype</b> also sells a version of Akzidenz-Grotesk under the other common alternative name, Basic Commercial. This is based on Linotype's digitization of the typeface; <b>Linotype</b> uses a different name to avoid trademark infringement.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Linotype</b> {{company would}} even supply {{kerosene}} heaters and line-shaft operated machines, in locales without electricity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Linotype's</b> Times Roman is {{the default}} Apple Mac OS X font for the serif/roman generic font family and {{has long been}} {{installed}} by default in Mac OS X. Monotype's Times New Roman is also installed by default in recent versions of Mac OS X (10.5+).|$|R
50|$|It {{was one of}} Western Australia's oldest {{family owned}} {{newspapers}} and was still set on <b>linotypes</b> up until its closure in 2003. The closure {{was caused by a}} number of factors including insufficient finance to expand the business, declining local populations and the overhead costs.|$|R
50|$|Monotype {{also created}} some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was {{intended}} for body text. While these are not sold by Monotype in digital format, <b>Linotype's</b> Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) remains available and {{could be used as}} a substitute.|$|R
25|$|In 1910, the Mokarzel {{brothers}} {{decided to}} adapt the <b>linotype</b> machine to Arabic script to mitigate the expensive cost and tedious task of manual typesetting. Naoum Mokarzel imported Arabic type letters from Egypt and acquired the first such machine for Al-Hoda from the Mergenthaler company. While the <b>linotype</b> machine made printing cheaper, there was significant competition for readership since New York's Arabic-speaking community did not exceed 10,000 before World War II.|$|E
25|$|At <b>Linotype,</b> Barr {{improved}} punch-cutting machines by substituting {{ball bearings}} for oil lubrication {{to achieve a}} more precise fit, and using tractrix-shaped sleeves to distribute wear uniformly.|$|E

50|$|An {{automatic}} teletype machine, {{which was}} 50 percent {{faster than the}} best Morse operator, {{was introduced to the}} newsroom in 1926. It could produce both typed copy and punched ticker tape to be fed directly into the <b>linotypes.</b> These clattering devices continued to bring the world to the Evening News editorial office until the advent of a computerized system in the mid-1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Arial Rounded: Arial Rounded Light, Arial Rounded Regular, Arial Rounded Medium, Arial Rounded Bold, Arial Rounded Extra Bold. The regular {{versions}} of the rounded glyphs {{can be found in}} Gulim, Microsoft's Korean font set. Originally only available in bold form as Arial Rounded MT Bold, extra fonts appeared as retail products. In <b>Linotype's</b> retail version, only Arial Rounded Regular supports WGL character set.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Adair {{was born}} in Glasgow, Scotland in 1877. He apprenticed as a printer in Glasgow and came to Canada in 1899. He worked for {{newspapers}} in Toronto and Winnipeg before settling in Edmonton in 1906 to work for Frank Oliver's Edmonton Bulletin. He founded his own <b>linotyping</b> business in 1911, which he would operate {{until his retirement in}} 1946. He also produced a throwaway sheet called Town Topics.|$|R
