2500|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{carved from}} white stone. This is usually Portland stone, {{but it is}} {{sometimes}} granite or any type of white limestone commonly found in France or Belgium. In Italy, Chiampo Perla limestone was used. The proportions of the cross, with short arms close {{to the top of}} the shaft are similar to some Celtic crosses, the crossarm being one-third the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> (as measured from the point where the shaft emerges from the base). The cross consists of three pieces: The shaft, from base to crossarm; the crossarm; and the upper shaft, above the crossarm. The crossarm is fastened to the lower and upper shaft by two bronze dowels. [...] A joggle (a portion of the shaft which extends into the base, acting as a joint) about [...] long extends into the base, where it is secured by another bronze dowel. The shaft and crossarm are both octagonal in shape, and the shaft tapers slightly as it rises to give the cross entasis. [...] On the large size version, there are three plain mouldings on the shaft near the base, often reduced to one in smaller sizes, and the three extremities of the cross finish at a plain moulding projecting sideways from the main element. The crossarms are sometimes irregular octagons in section, with four wide faces at front, back, top and bottom, and four shorter faces in between them.|$|E
60|$|U---- and I {{walked out}} in the afternoon, {{and went into the}} Piazza del Campo, the {{principal}} place of the city, and a very noble and peculiar one. It is much {{in the form of an}} amphitheatre, and the surface of the ground seems to be slightly scooped out, so that it resembles the shallow basin of a shell. It is thus a much better site for an assemblage of the populace than if it were a perfect level. A semicircle or truncated ellipse of stately and ancient edifices surround the piazza, with arches opening beneath them, through which streets converge hitherward. One side of the piazza is a straight line, and is occupied by the Palazzo Publico, which is a most noble and impressive Gothic structure. It has not the mass of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence, but is more striking. It has a long battlemented front, the central part of which rises eminent above the rest, in a great square bulk, which is likewise crowned with battlements. This is much more picturesque than the one great block of stone into which the Palazzo Vecchio is consolidated. At one extremity of this long front of the Palazzo Publico rises a tower, shooting up its shaft high, high into the air, and bulging out there into a battlemented fortress, within which the tower, slenderer than before, climbs to a still higher region. I do not know whether the summit of the tower is higher or so high as that of the Palazzo Vecchio; but the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> free of the edifice, is much greater, and so produces the more elevating effect. The whole front of the Palazzo Publico is exceedingly venerable, with arched windows, Gothic carvings, and all the old-time ornaments that betoken it to have stood a great while, and the gray strength that will hold it up at least as much longer. At one end of the facade, beneath the shadow of the tower, is a grand and beautiful porch, supported on square pillars, within each of which is a niche containing a statue of mediaeval sculpture.|$|E

6000|$|The Somali spear {{is a form}} of the Cape Assegai. A long, thin, pliant and knotty {{shaft of}} the Dibi, Diktab, and Makari trees, is dried, polished, and greased with rancid butter: it is {{generally}} of a dull yellow colour, and sometimes bound, as in Arabia, with brass wire for ornament. Care is applied to make the rod straight, or the missile flies crooked: it is garnished with an iron button at the head, and a long thin tapering head of coarse bad iron [16], made at Berberah and other places by the Tomal. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> may be four feet eight inches; the blade varies from twenty to twenty-six inches, and the whole weapon is about seven feet long. Some polish the entire spear-head, others only its socket or ferule; commonly, however, it is all blackened by heating it to redness, and rubbing it with cow's horn. In the towns, one of these weapons is carried; on a journey and in battle two, as amongst the Tibboos,--a small javelin for throwing and a large spear reserved for the thrust. Some warriors especially amongst the Eesa, prefer a coarse heavy lance, which never leaves the hand. The Somali spear is held in various ways: generally the thumb and forefinger grasp the third nearest to the head, and the shaft resting upon the palm is made to quiver. In action, the javelin is rarely thrown at a greater distance than six or seven feet, and the heavier weapon is used for [...] "jobbing." [...] Stripped to his waist, the thrower runs forward with all the action of a Kafir, whilst the attacked bounds about and crouches to receive it upon the round targe, which it cannot pierce. He then returns the compliment, at the same time endeavouring to break the weapon thrown at him by jumping and stamping upon it. The harmless missiles being exhausted, both combatants draw their daggers, grapple with the left hand, and with the right dig hard and swift at each other's necks and shoulders. When matters come to this point, the duel is soon decided, and the victor, howling his slogan, pushes away from his front the dying enemy, and rushes off to find another opponent. A puerile weapon during the day, when a steady man can easily avoid it, the spear is terrible in night attacks or in the [...] "bush," [...] whence it can be hurled unseen. For practice, we plant a pair of slippers upright in the ground, at the distance of twelve yards, and a skilful spearman hits the mark once in every three throws.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrilled shafts are {{sometimes}} built in an MSE wall to support superstructures subjected to lateral loads. However, current design methodology isolates {{the interaction between}} drilled shafts and MSE walls, and the designs are independent. This design practice results in inappropriately designed drilled shafts and MSE walls. A three-dimensional numerical model of drilled shafts within an MSE wall was developed using FLAC 3 D and was calibrated with published data of a full-scale field study. Then the calibrated model was used for a parametric study to investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> various parameters on <b>the</b> synergistic performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilled <b>shafts</b> and <b>the</b> MSE wall. The performance was assessed in terms of lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drilled <b>shaft</b> and MSE wall, the induced lateral earth pressure, and the induced strain in the geogrid.

In this study we attempted to delineate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> fiber <b>length</b> in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) - and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad 5, Ad 9, or Ad 35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad 5 or Ad 9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/αv integrin-expressing cells. Ad 5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad 35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/αv integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. <b>The</b> weak attachment <b>of</b> short-shafted Ad 5 or Ad 9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad 5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers.
