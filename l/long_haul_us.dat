This paper describes {{the concept of a}} multi haul DWDM platform combining traditional <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> with ultra <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> system features. A cost comparison of a typical national ring network shows that a multi haul platform provides a solution at a competitive cost to traditional <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> systems for low traffic levels and a low incremental upgrade cost advantage typical of an ultra <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> system. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We present {{structural}} {{results on}} optimal number of clusters and optimal rate {{with respect to}} <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance in a cluster based cooperative multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) sensor network. Using the concepts of super and sub modular functions and their associated properties it has been proved {{that the number of}} clusters to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance. From this, we conclude that as the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance increases the cooperation among the nodes increases to counter the path loss due to fading in the channel. Furthermore, we also prove the rate to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> distance. Finally, through our numerical results we observe that optimizing node cooperation can lead to large scale energy savings. I...|$|R

50|$|A {{year after}} Escort came Rayner's first novel, {{the story of}} a {{prolonged}} duel between a U-boat and a British destroyer - The Enemy Below - adapted in 1957 for a film by Dick Powell, in which the writer's destroyer Hecate became the USS Haynes - in actuality USS Whitehurst - while his British captain, John Murrell, became an American played by Robert Mitchum with Curt Jürgens playing Rayner's U-boat skipper, Kapitän von Stolberg. Powell displays Rayner's book {{at the start of the}} trailer of The Enemy Below. Some of the actual experiences described in the novel and later transferred to film can be read in Rayner's low-key account of his encounter between corvettes and U-1200 off southern Ireland on 11 November 1944 between pages 224 and 228 of Escort. In his novel The Long Fight (1958) Rayner wrote about a three-day ship-to-ship engagement in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars; about tank warfare in The Small Spark of Courage (1959) (titled Valor in US editions of the novel), and about convoy escort duty in The Crippled Tanker (1962) (titled The <b>Long</b> <b>Haul</b> in the <b>US).</b> In 1966, with Alan Wykes, he wrote The Great Yacht Race, an illustrated account of a millionaires' yacht race from New York to Cowes in December 1866. Between 1961 and 1963 Rayner also published books on sailing, safety at sea in small craft and starting motorboating.|$|R
