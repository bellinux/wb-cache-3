40|$|Economic {{analysis}} has {{been central to}} the development of greenhouse abatement policy in Australia. Current Australian policy is to remain outside the Kyoto Protocol, while still attempting to meet the emission targets established under the Protocol. Australia’s failure to ratify the Protocol has incurred international criticism; it is therefore appropriate to examine the validity of the economic analysis used to support this policy position. This paper reviews approaches to economic analysis that have been prominent in the greenhouse policy debate in Australia, including computable general equilibrium modelling, bottom-up energy sector modelling and policyspecific cost benefit analysis. Alternative approaches that have received less attention in Australia are also reviewed. Flaws in existing economic analyses include a failure to consider the net cost to society of greenhouse abatement measures, a tendency to exclude abatement benefits, inadequate consideration of ethical and moral issues, a lack of accessibility and the assumption that economic systems are in an optimal equilibrium state. In response to these flaws, an alternative approach to economic analysis termed ‘integrated abatement planning’ is developed.

40|$|The {{electric}} utility capacity expansion problem {{is a problem of}} choosing the type, size and timing of capacity additions to meet a projected demand in the specified planning horizon. Traditionally the problem has been separated into a generator and a separate transmission capacity-expansion problem. A <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> generator only capacity expansion plan would be found and then a transmission line expansion plan to match. This planning paradigm sufficed in the regulated monopoly environment where transmission lines were built mainly for system reliability. In the emerging unregulated environment, transmission lines, in addition to enhancing system reliability are recognized as a significant economic resource, a resource whose economic planning is vital in maintaining a utility 2 ̆ 7 s competitive advantage. This has brought about the need for planning models that take into account the location in space of generators and demands and the cost associated with transmitting power among these spatially separated elements. Such models that have recently emerged have relied on the transshipment constraints to capture this flow of power. ^ The model presented in this dissertation improves on this by adding DC power flow equations onto the transshipment formulation. The DC power flow equations provide approximate but linear relationships between the generation and demand levels at nodes and the real power flow through the lines. In addition, the model provides for transmission capacity additions. This is done by grouping the transmission lines into a limited set of alternatives whose network characteristics can be constructed prior to starting the solution search process. The model then chooses the <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> alternative by adding the cost of each alternative to the <b>cost</b> of the <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> generation <b>plan</b> associated with that transmission alternative. ^ Data from the country of Kenya is used to compare the expansion plan from the model with power flow equations with that from the transshipment only model. Five different transmission expansion alternatives are considered. The transmission capacity expansion plans recommended by the two models differ significantly.

We first develop a simple model for estimating the cost of providing local government services, and then introduce the notion of the "optimal " size of a municipality. The model allows us to determine the optimal number of districts for a fixed population size in a given geographic area, and to arrive at the extent of cost savings possible in the absence of additional considerations. We statistically estimate a municipal cost function and use this to construct a <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> consolidation <b>plan</b> subject o certain constraints on how far the socioeconomic characteristics of the new, consolidated districts can differ from those of their constituent parts prior to consolidation. The constraints make the combinatorial problem of consolidation computationally more tractable.
