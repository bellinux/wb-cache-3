The results show that even in this complex situation, multi modalinstruction led to a better performance than unimodal instruction.

40|$|Energy {{is saved}} when an {{effective}} natural ventilation system can provide comfort {{air to the}} occupants in a building by replacing a mechanical ventilation system. It also minimizes {{the risk of the}} environmental pollution and the global warming. A one story, full scale building was considered to carry out a comparative study of three different cases of wind-driven natural (WDN) cross ventilation with the help of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In each case, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>window</b> was changed in lateral direction to predict the probable position for optimum ventilation performance and the angle of wind was varied to check the sensitivity of the wind direction on the flow field. After validating the current methodology through two satisfactory comparisons with the experimental investigations, the governing equations subjected to the corresponding boundary conditions were solved using commercial software and then the results were analyzed. A better location for the windows in each case was proposed. The ventilation purpose was served quite well even if the wind angle was changed in a moderate range from the original design. Furthermore, the velocity components, ventilation rate, surface pressure, ventilation time, and so forth in each case were investigated and compared extensively with those in other cases...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify design factors that are related to energy consumption using actual operation's data of family restaurants in a north-central region. Restaurants located in the north central region in the U. S spent larger proportion of their operating expenses on energy. Family style restaurants were selected because they have similar kitchen equipment and seating allowance. Construction document was acquired to gather size of operations and other design factors. Scatter plots and correlation analysis were used to examine relationships between design factors and energy consumption in each restaurant. Among the five family style restaurant operations in a north-central region that participated in this study, the size varied from 2810 square feet to 9138 square feet. Energy cost per cubic foot was then calculated using adjusted energy cost and total cubic footage of each restaurant. The building orientation did not show close relationship with energy consumption of restaurants. However, the proportion of south window indicated a negative relationship to the energy consumption. The findings of this study were based on 5 restaurants and thus there is a need for another study with bigger sample size to verify these findings. In addition, similar studies in different climate regions will be beneficial in testing the passive solar design theory in restaurant operations...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Conventional spiking deconvolution was applied to increase the high-f requency content of seismic data. The seismic data set was processed by CMP sorting, f ieldstatic corrections, velocity analysis, normal-moveout corrections, residual-static corrections besides corrections, residual-static corrections besides deconvolution. Before performing deconvolution, the effect of the design-window length, deconvolutionoperator length, and the location of the design window were investigated. From the analyses of the above parameters, it was shown that the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>window</b> has the greatest effect on deconvolution. When the deconvolution operator was calculated, three methods of deconvolution were tested. They are I) the deconvolution operator was calculated for every trace in every CDP gather and the operator was applied to its trace and the traces are stacked, 2) deconvolution operators are calculated for each stacked trace and applied to the stacked trace from which it was calculated, and 3) the average is deconvolution operator obtained by averaging the operators from the second method and applied the stacked traces. From the observation of the stacked sections obtained using each method, it appears the third method generated the best results. This method requires one more step than second method but the result is much better. Synthetic seismograms were generated by two methods. one used the reflection-coefficients model and the other used the impulse-response model (including multiples). These results were convolved with a Ricker wavelet to generate synthetic seismograms. The results from both methods are similar each other and they are well correlated with stacked trace...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-Various {{researchers}} for {{a number}} of years have investigated traffic data collection and analysis. Many techniques have been proposed to speed up the operations and some intelligent approaches have been developed to compensate the effects of lighting, shadows and occlusions. To achieve real-time processing, it is necessary to reduce the amount of data to be processed, so the first question is to determine the suitable location for the key regions or windows. Previously, researchers have either used full frame processing approach, which requires more computing power and thus is not practical for real-time applications, or have used window based techniques, but defining <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> was done manually, which is not practical in real-world traffic applications. In this paper, an automatic approach is described to measure the size and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> required for this purpose.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Maximum Sequential Similarity Reasoning (MSSR) algorithm based method for co-registration of 3 D TLS data and 2 D floor plans. The co-registration {{consists of two}} tasks: estimating a transformation between the two datasets and finding the vertical <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>windows</b> and doors. The method first extracts TLS line sequences and floor plan line sequences {{from a series of}} horizontal cross-section bands of the TLS points and floor plans respectively. Then each line sequence is further decomposed into column vectors defined by using local transformation invariant information between two neighbouring line segments. Based on a normalized cross-correlation based similarity score function, the proposed MSSR algorithm is then used to iteratively estimate the vertical and horizontal <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> each floor plan by finding the longest matched consecutive column vectors between floor plan line sequences and TLS line sequences. A group matching algorithm is applied to simultaneously determine final matching results across floor plans and estimate the transformation parameters between floor plans and TLS points. With real datasets, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to deal with occlusions and multiple matching problems. It also shows the potential to detect conflict between floor plan and as-built, which makes it a promising method that can find many applications in many industrial fields. 1...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the current}} {{distribution}} in a tokamak is indispensable for {{an understanding of the}} energy transport in the plasma and controlling instabilities. A diagnostic exploiting the Motional Stark Effect (MSE) has the potential to obtain this quantity. This is based on a measurement of the polarisation of the Balmer-a light emitted by neutral particles injected into tokamaks. On the tokamak TEXTOR- 94 a new MSE system is under development which exploits the full spectral information, along with its polarisation. This system consists of 30 radial channels, measuring the spectrum at two orthogonal angles. This is accomplished by inserting a Glan-Laser prism in the optical path. All the optics is housed in five camera modules and located inside the vessel to improve the radial resolution and minimise changes in polarisation due to optical elements. Fibres transfer the light by a vacuum feedthrough towards a spectrometer. The simple construction of the fibre feedthrough and its reliable operation opens the possibility to observe plasma light at all conceivable angles and positions, irrespective <b>of</b> suitable <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>windows.</b> (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.
