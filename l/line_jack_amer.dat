25|$|Supervision (line signaling) was {{supplied}} by a District circuit, {{similar to the}} plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a <b>line</b> <b>jack</b> on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and called party and, when both had gone on-hook, released the ground on the sleeve lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals for handling calls from payphones.|$|R

25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's <b>line</b> <b>jack</b> and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} draft, Burch wrote Jack as joking {{constantly}} regardless of situation, including during {{the deaths of}} his daughter and girlfriend. Feedback from creative director Paul Hellquist, Neumann, and art director Jeramy Cooke led to rewrites, as they felt Jack seemed one-dimensional and his humour quickly grew tiresome. Neumann and Burch each did a pass through Jack's dialogue after Angel's death, now rephrased as Jack's [...] "breaking point", removing {{some of the more}} silly <b>lines</b> <b>Jack</b> aimed at the player and making his dialogue angrier and darker with a [...] "vengeful streak". In doing so, it was also hoped to give Jack an arc throughout the game, growing from treating the player characters as irrelevant to hating them.|$|R
