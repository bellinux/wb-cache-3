2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the March 1830 London University Magazine titled [...] "The Inventions of William Blake, Paint and Poet", stated before discussing the poem: [...] "let us continue to <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> notes, bright both with poetry and forms divine, which demonstrate an intimate knowledge of the passions and feelings of the human breast". After quoting the poem in full, the writer claimed, [...] "If Blake had lived in Germany, by this time {{he would have had}} commentators of the highest order upon every one of his effusions; but here, so little attention is paid to works of the mind".|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, {{the museum}} mounted a third, {{significantly}} larger, exhibition {{centered on the}} novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of The Little Prince: A New York Story celebrated the story's 70th anniversary. It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. [...] "The exhibition allows us to step back to the moment of creation and witness Saint-Exupéry at work..." [...] wrote the museum's director, William Griswold. It was if visitors were able to <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.|$|E
