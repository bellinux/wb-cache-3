40|$|A {{neurogenic bladder}} model due to upper (Th 12) and lower (L 5) spinal cord {{injuries}} was performed in the rabbit. The retrograde urethral restistance (RUR) was measured and changes of RUR by bulbo-cavernosus reflex (BCR) procedure were recorded on RUR curves. The influences of intramuscular injection of bethanechol, bus copan, pherroxybenzamine (POB) and muscalm on RUR and BCR-RUR were observed. 1. RUR was 37. 0 cmH 2 O in the normal rabbits (n= 20). RUR in the upper spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (n= 12) was 42. 9 cmH 2 O, and it was 25. 0 cmH 2 O in the lower spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (n= 10). But there was no statistic significance between the three groups. 2. After injection of bethanechol, RUR elevated significantly from 25. 0 cmH 2 O to 37. 0 cmH 2 O in the lower spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> 3. After injection of buscopan, RUR decreased from 42. 9 cmH 2 O to 33. 8 cmH 2 O in the upper spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> But in the other groups, {{there was no significant}} change. 4. After injection of POB, RUR decreased from 42. 9 cmH 2 O to 20. 8 cmH 2 O only in the upper spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> 5. After injection of muscalm, RUR decreased from 42. 9 cmH 2 O to 20. 0 cmH 2 O only in the upper spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> 6. The results indicate that the influence of muscalm on RUR was most evident and the next was POB. In RUR the effect of alpha-adrenergics was more dominant than parasympathetics. 7. BCR-RUR in the normal rabbits was higher than that in the upper and lower spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> After injection of bethanechol and buscopan, BCR-RUR was reduced in the normal rabbits. In the upper spinal <b>lesion</b> <b>group,</b> BCR-RUR was raised by bethanechol, but it was reduced by POB and muscalm. No change was observed by buscopan.

40|$|The {{association}} between cigarette smoking {{and an increased}} risk of laryngeal carcinoma has been demonstrated in numerous studies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the prevalence of smoking habit in patients with different laryngeal pathologies. The prevalence of cigarette smoking was compared between patients with laryngeal tumors and those with nonmalignant laryngeal lesions. Data on all patients with indications for direct microlaryngoscopy at the Clinic for Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital Center Split, during a five-year period were analyzed. The study included 562 patients with various laryngeal pathologies, divided into three groups as follows: group 1, benign lesions; group 2, precancerous lesions; and group 3, tumors. The majority of patients (82. 92 %) had a long history of smoking. The proportion of smokers was lowest in benign <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (72. 13 %), higher in precancerous <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (81. 48 %) and highest in malignant <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (97. 14 %). There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of cigarette smoking between patients with laryngeal tumors and those with benign or precancerous lesions (p< 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neuropathological {{disorder}} {{involving the}} degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, with the subsequent {{loss of their}} terminals in the striatum. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, is a strong antioxidant and radical scavenger. Therefore, its neuroprotective effect in a model of Parkinson’s disease in rat was evaluated. Methods: For this purpose, unilateral intrastriatal 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -lesioned rats were pretreated with quercetin (20 mg/kg; i. p.) 1 hour before surgery and treated once a day for one month. Nissl-stained neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) were counted. Results: Number of Nissl-stained neurons in left side of SNC of <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> was lower relative to sham-operated group (p< 0. 005) and it was higher in quercetin-treated <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> as compared to untreated <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Brain is {{the target}} for {{different}} stressors because of its high sensitivity to stress induced degenerative conditions. A number of pathological conditions of the brain have been implicated due to free radical formation. Subcortcial structures are known to influence stress responses. Among them, the amygdala nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus has been linked in the regulation of stress responses. The present study was aimed to elucidate the comparative analysis of amygdala and paraventricular nucleus in regulating the acute and chronic stress-induced malondialdehyde level in different brain tissues. Wistar albino rats were divided into amygdala lesioned and PVN <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups.</b> Each group was further subdivided into <b>lesioned</b> control <b>group</b> and <b>lesioned</b> stress <b>group.</b> The <b>lesioned</b> stress <b>group</b> animals were subjected to acute and chronic types of swimming and immobilization stress with bilateral lesions of nucleus of amygdala and PVN. Each subgroup contained ten animals. MDA levels of cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum were estimated. Exposure to acute and chronic swimming stress in amygdala <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups</b> showed a significant (p < 0. 05; p < 0. 001) increase in the hypothalamus lipid peroxidation level {{when compared to the}} PVN <b>lesioned</b> swimming stress <b>groups.</b> Exposure to acute stressors significantly increased (p < 0. 001) the cerebellar lipid peroxidation level in the amygdala <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups</b> when compared to the PVN <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups.</b> Based on the present study, it appears that the amygdala nucleus has a prominent role in decreasing the stress induced free radical formation in brain tissues.

Fifty patients with a history of shoulder instability underwent MDCT arthrography with thin collimation scans. The raw data were transferred to a workstation and processed using multiplanar reformation (MPR) and volume rendering (VR) algorithms. All patients subsequently underwent conventional arthroscopy. The results of the two techniques were compared and their sensitivity and specificity calculated. We diagnosed eight anterosuperior labrum <b>lesions</b> (<b>group</b> 1), 32 anteroinferior labrum <b>lesions</b> (<b>group</b> 2) and two posterior labrum <b>lesions</b> (<b>group</b> 3).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the value of}} serum carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9) and carbohydrate antigen 24 - 2 (CA 24 - 2) in the diagnosis of benign and malignant biliary tract diseases. MethodsA total of 214 patients with biliary tract diseases who were hospitalized in Department of Gastroenterology and Department of General Surgery in the First Hospital Affiliated to Hebei North University from January 2012 to October 2015 were enrolled, {{and according to the}} nature of lesions, they were divided into benign <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (162 patients) and malignant <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (52 patients). The healthy people who underwent physical examination during the same period of time in the Physical Examination Center were enrolled as normal control group (40 persons). Peripheral venous blood was collected for all subjects in a fasting state, and the serum levels of total bilirubin (TBil), direct bilirubin (DBil), and indirect bilirubin (IBil) were measured. Radioimmunoassay was used to measure the serum levels of CA 19 - 9 and CA 24 - 2. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for comparison of continuous data between multiple groups, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for further comparison between any two groups; the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups; Pearson correlation analysis was also performed. ResultsCompared with the normal control group, the benign <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> and the malignant <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> showed significant increases in the serum levels of TBil and CA 19 - 9 (all P＜ 0. 01). Compared with the benign <b>lesion</b> <b>group,</b> the malignant <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> showed significant increases in the serum levels of CA 19 - 9 and CA 24 - 2 (all P＜ 0. 01). The serum levels of CA 19 - 9 and CA 24 - 2 were not associated with tumor location in cholangiocarcinoma, but they were associated with the degree of tumor differentiation(χ 2 = 6  860 and 9  010, all P＜ 0  05). The combined measurement of CA 19 - 9 and CA 24 - 2 had a sensitivity of 88. 5 % and a specificity of 82. 1 % in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma,which were significantly higher than the sensitivity and specificity of CA 19 - 9 or CA 24 - 2 measurement (all P＜ 0. 01). In the patients with benign biliary tract diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, serum CA 19 - 9 was positively correlated with serum TBil (r= 0. 634 and 0. 346, both P＜ 0. 05), and the benign <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> had a significantly greater correlation between serum CA 19 - 9 and serum TBil than the malignant <b>lesion</b> <b>group.</b> ConclusionCombined measurement of CA 19 - 9 and CA 24 - 2 has clinical significance in early diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma...|$|E

This study evaluated differences in surgical outcomes of the procedure performed either with a single connecting lesion between {{the right and left}} pulmonary vein isolations versus 2 connecting lesions (the box lesion), which isolated the entire posterior left atrium. MethodsData were collected prospectively on 137 patients who underwent the Cox maze procedure from April 2002 through September 2006. Before May 2004, the pulmonary veins were connected with a single bipolar radiofrequency ablation lesion (n = 56), whereas after this time, a box lesion was routinely performed (n = 81). The mean follow-up was 11. 8 ± 9. 6 months. ResultsThe incidence of early atrial tachyarrhythmia was significantly higher in the single connecting <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> compared with that in the box <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (71 % vs 37 %, P <. 001). The overall freedom from atrial fibrillation recurrence was significantly higher in the box <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> at 1 (87 % vs 69 %, P =. 015) and 3 (96 % vs 85 %, P =. 028) months.

40|$|Summary. Four {{groups of}} rats with bilaterallesions of {{somatosensory}} cortex {{and one of}} animals sustaining only sham operations were tested for retention of a difficult tactile discrimination. Two of the <b>lesion</b> <b>groups</b> had serial ablations, in one case with interoperative t sting, and two had one-stage lesions. Bilateral ablations of somatosensory cortex severely retarded retention in all <b>lesion</b> <b>groups</b> relative to the control group and serial and one-stage {{groups did not differ}} from each other. The sham operated rats then experienced lesions of cortex anterior and posterior to the somatosensory areas. These lesions only marginally affected retention. Somatosensory cortex then was ablated and severe performance decrements were seen. Removal of additional neocortex in animals that previously had relearned the discrimination after somatosensory cortex lesions also resulted in very poor retention. These data demonstrate he importance of the somatosen-sory cortex in mediating tactile discriminations and suggest that non-somatosen-sory cortex {{may play a role in}} recovery after somatosensory cortical esions...|$|R
40|$|Cortical malformations {{are often}} {{associated}} with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Alterations in hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated, non-specific cation (HCN) channels {{have been shown to}} contribute to malformation associated hyperexcitability. We have recently demonstrated that expression of HCN channels and Ih current amplitudes are reduced in layer (L) 5 pyramidal neurons of rats with freeze lesion induced malformations. These changes were associated with an increased EPSP temporal summation. Here, we examine the effects of HCN channel inhibition on synaptic responses in fast spiking, presumptive basket cells and accommodating, presumptive Martinotti, GABAergic interneurons in slices from freeze lesioned animals. In control animals, fast spiking cells showed small sag responses which were reduced by the HCN channel antagonist ZD 7288. Fast spiking cells in lesioned animals showed absent or reduced sag responses. The amplitude of single evoked EPSPs in fast spiking cells in the control group was not affected by HCN channel inhibition with ZD 7288. EPSP ratios during short stimulus trains at 25 Hz were not significantly different between control and <b>lesion</b> <b>groups.</b> ZD 7288 produced an increase in EPSP ratios in the control but not <b>lesion</b> <b>groups.</b> Under voltage clamp conditions, ZD 7288 did not affect EPSC ratios. In the control group, accommodating interneurons showed robust sag responses which were significantly reduced by ZD 7288.

The control animals came from two different control procedures, a surgical control sub-group (SHAM) and a group of animals that received injections of N-methyl-d-aspartic (NMDA) into the fornix (NMDA SHAM). There were no differences in the performance levels of the NMDA SHAM group compared with the surgical control group in any of the experiments conducted, so showing that the anterior thalamic lesion effects were not due to non-specific damage to the fornix by NMDA. This series of experiments demonstrated that complete lesions of the anterior thalamic region impair the ability to process allocentric information, and provide evidence for a contribution from the lateral dorsal thalamic nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Aims Although {{the concept}} of {{radiofrequency}} catheter ablation (RFCA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) was derived from maze surgery, it is unclear if linear ablation in addition to circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) reduces the recurrence rate in patients with paroxysmal AF. Therefore, we compared clinical outcomes of CPVI with additional linear ablations (Dallas lesion set) and CPVI in a prospective randomized controlled study among patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods and results This study enrolled 100 paroxysmal AF patients (male 75. 0 %, 56. 4 +/- 11. 6 years old) who underwent RFCA and {{were randomly assigned to}} the CPVI group (n = 50) or the catheter Dallas <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> (CPVI, posterior box lesion, and anterior Linear ablation, n = 50). The catheter Dallas <b>Lesion</b> <b>group</b> required longer procedure (190. 3 +/- 46. 3 vs. 161. 1 +/- 30. 3 min, P ? 0. 001) and ablation times (5345. 4 +/- 1676. 4 vs. 4027. 2 +/- 878. 0 s, P ? 0. 001) than the CPVI group. Complete bidirectional conduction block rate was 68. 0 % in the catheter Dallas <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> and 100 % in the CPVI group. Procedure-related complication rates were not significantly different between the catheter Dallas lesion (0 %) and CPVI groups (4 %, P -= 0. 157). During the 16. 3 + 4. 0 months of follow-up, the clinical recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two groups (16. 0 % in the catheter Dallas <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> vs. 12. 0 % in the CPVI group, P = 0. 564), regardless of complete bidirectional conduction block achievement after linear ablation. Conclusion Linear ablation in addition to CPVI (catheter Dallas Lesion) did not improve clinical outcomes of RFCA in paroxysmal AF patients and required longer procedure times.

30|$|The extra-frontal <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> {{performed}} worse on {{the problem}} solving task than the control group. This task demands cognitive flexibility and strategies {{to deal with the}} environmental contingence (Nyhus and Barceló 2009), and the extra-frontal <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> needed more cards to complete the task, as well as making many more perseverative errors. Thus, the test hypothesis of the study was not confirmed; rather the data confirm that extra-frontal regions involved in fronto-cortical and fronto-subcortical circuits - e.g., temporal lobe, parietal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum - are involved in EF and impulsivity, as indicated by the increase in perseverative errors in this group (Cardinal et al. 2001; Christakou et al. 2004). Persevere’s behavior in error tends to hinder the ability of the individual to achieve a goal (Homaifar et al. 2012). Our data suggest that RH extra-frontal regions play a role in EF, which is generally associated with circuits involving frontal regions, particularly RH frontal regions.|$|E
40|$|Whisker {{deflection}} is {{an effective}} conditioned stimulus (CS) for trace eyeblink conditioning that {{has been shown to}} induce a learning-specific expansion of whisker-related cortical barrels, suggesting that memory storage for an aspect of the trace association resides in barrel cortex. To examine the role of the barrel cortex in acquisition and retrieval of trace eyeblink associations, the barrel cortex was lesioned either prior to (acquisition group) or following (retention group) trace conditioning. The acquisition <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> was unable to acquire the trace conditioned response, suggesting that the whisker barrel cortex is vital for learning trace eyeblink conditioning with whisker deflection as the CS. The retention <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> exhibited a significant reduction in expression of the previously acquired conditioned response, suggesting that an aspect of the trace association may reside in barrel cortex. These results demonstrate that the barrel cortex is important for both acquisition and retention of whisker trace eyeblink conditioning. Furthermore, these results, along with prior anatomical whisker barrel analyses suggest that the barrel cortex is a site for long-term storage of whisker trace eyeblink associations...|$|E

Rats {{which had}} {{received}} a unilateral injection of 6 -OHDA into the substantia nigra were assigned to four <b>lesion</b> <b>groups</b> according {{to the degree of}} DA depletion in the neostriatum. In these animals, behavioral changes in the open-field were investigated during the first post-operative week. Overall, this analysis showed that the animals could adequately be characterized by behavior on day 1 and day 7 after lesion. 2. On the first day after <b>lesion,</b> the <b>groups</b> with the severest DA depletions (> 80 % and 55 – 80 %) showed an ipsilateral asymmetry in turning. After one week, these groups showed a tendency to recover from this deficit; however, the group with the most strongest lesions (> 80 %) was still asymmetric. 3. In scanning behavior, in contrast to turning, all the <b>lesion</b> <b>groups</b> displayed an initial ipsilateral asymmetry. On day 7 after <b>lesion,</b> only the <b>group</b> with DA depletions of > 80 % still had an ipsilateral asymmetry. Locomotor activity and rearing were initially reduced after lesion, and showed a tendency to recover, especially in the group with the most severe DA depletions (> 80 %). There were no differences between groups neither on day 1 nor on day 7 by grooming, but this behavior increased in all the <b>lesion</b> <b>groups</b> with time. 4. The correlational analyses yielded a positive relationship between the asymmetry in turning and neostriatal DA depletion. Locomotor activity and rearing on day 1 were both negatively correlated with DA depletion. The present results show that a number of behavioral parameters obtained in the open-field are affected by unilateral lesions of the nigro-striatal DA system. The degree of deficit, its time course and relation to lesion size differs among the various behavioral measures. Some of these early behavioral changes after unilateral nigrostriatal lesion are related to DA depletion and should therefore be useful to predict lesion size. 5. Together, these data suggest that the study of such behavioral changes can provide an important tool, to investigate the compensatory mechanisms underlying striatal DA depletion and to understand preclinical states of the Parkinson's disease.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of ibotenic acid-induced lesions of the hippocampus, subiculum and hippocampus +/- subiculum upon the capacity of rats to learn and perform a series of allocentric spatial learning tasks in an open-field water maze. The lesions were made by infusing small volumes of the neurotoxin at a total of 26 (hippocampus) or 20 (subiculum) sites intended to achieve complete target cell loss but minimal extratarget damage. The regional extent and axon-sparing nature of these lesions was evaluated using both cresyl violet and Fink - Heimer stained sections. The behavioural findings indicated that both the hippocampus and subiculum lesions caused impairment to the initial postoperative acquisition of place navigation but did not prevent eventual learning to levels of performance almost as effective as those of controls. However, overtraining of the hippocampus + subiculum lesioned rats did not result in significant place learning. Qualitative observations of the paths taken to find a hidden escape platform indicated that different strategies were deployed by hippocampal and subiculum <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups.</b> Subsequent training on a delayed matching to place task revealed a deficit in all <b>lesioned</b> <b>groups</b> across a range of sample choice intervals, but the subiculum <b>lesioned</b> <b>group</b> was less impaired than the group with the hippocampal lesion. Finally, unoperated control rats given both the initial training and overtraining were later given either a hippocampal lesion or sham surgery. The hippocampal lesioned rats were impaired during a subsequent retention/relearning phase. Together, these findings suggest that total hippocampal cell loss may cause a dual deficit: a slower rate of place learning and a separate navigational impairment. The prospect of unravelling dissociable components of allocentric spatial learning is discussed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{focus on the}} role of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in learning and memory, but there is little consensus as to how the core and medial shell subregions of the NAc contribute to these processes. In the current experiments, we used spontaneous object recognition to test rats with 6 -hydroxydopamine lesions targeted at the core or medial shell of the NAc on a familiarity discrimination task and a location discrimination task. In the object recognition variant, control animals were able to discriminate the novel object at both 24 -hr and 5 -min delay. However, in the <b>lesion</b> <b>groups,</b> performance was systematically related to dopamine (DA) levels in the core but not the shell. In the location recognition task, sham-operated animals readily detected the object displacement at test. In the <b>lesion</b> <b>groups,</b> performance impairment was systematically related to DA levels in the shell but not the core. These results suggest that dopamine function within distinct subregions of the NAc plays dissociable roles in the modulation of memory for objects and place...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [43]- 48) The neglect {{syndrome is}} a complex and devastating disorder characterized by spatial and attentional deficits, lack of affect, and unresponsiveness {{to the side of}} space opposite a brain lesion. A rodent model of neglect has been developed in order to examine the neural mechanisms underlying neglect. Unilateral destruction of the medial agranular cortex (AGm), which projects into the dorsocentral and dorsolateral striatum, produces severe neglect. A number of studies have found changes in striatum that are correlated with behavioral recovery from neglect. Physiological studies have indicated that neglect induced by AGm destruction is correlated with reductions of metabolic activity in the dorsolateral quadrant of striatum, which includes the dorsal central striatum. Further, spontaneous recovery is associated with normalization of metabolic activity in the dorsal central striatum. In addition, asymmetries in striatal immediate early gene expression have been correlated with neglect induced by AGm destruction. The present study directly tested these correlational findings by examining the behavioral effects of unilateral destruction of the dorsocentral striatum. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the importance of the dorsocentral striatum in the system for directed attention in the rat. Three experimental groups were used: a dorsocentral striatum NMDA <b>lesion</b> <b>group,</b> a ventral lateral striatum NMDA <b>lesion</b> <b>group,</b> and a dorsocentral striatum vehicle group. Subjects were tested for neglect 2 days post-lesion and three times per week for the following three weeks. The results showed that the dorsocentral striatum <b>lesion</b> <b>group</b> demonstrated more severe neglect than the ventral lateral striatum lesion and saline control groups. The results of the present study suggest that the dorsocentral striatum is an important component of a corticosubcortical network involved in neglect and directed attention. M. A.

We evaluated 15 patients (6 men and 9 women, mean age 47 +/- 17 years) with imaging-detected adrenal tumors. Patient population was {{divided into two groups}} {{on the basis of the}} nature of adrenal <b>lesions.</b> <b>Group</b> 1 consisted of patients with benign adrenal lesions (n = 10). Group 2 consisted of patients with malignant adrenal lesions (n = 5). Pathology examinations were obtained in 13 cases: 7 pheochromocytomas, 2 adenomas, 2 cysts, 1 carcinoma, and 1 fibro-histiocytoma. One patient had a proven diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer associated with the presence of a right adrenal mass. The last patient had a clinical diagnosis of Werner syndrome associated with the presence of a large left adrenal mass. All patients underwent scientigraphic studies using radiolabeled SAs, of which indium- 111 (In- 111) pentetreotide was used in 11 cases and technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) -labeled peptides (P- 587 or P- 829) were used in the remaining four cases. No significant labeled SAs uptake was observed in the majority (8 of 10, 80 %) of the benign adrenal <b>lesions</b> (<b>Group</b> 1); however, increased uptake was found in two benign pheochromocytomas. Conversely, significant labeled SAs uptake was observed in the majority (4 of 5, 80 %) of the malignant adrenal <b>lesions</b> (<b>Group</b> 2); however, the last lesion (carcinoma) did not show abnormal uptake. Results of this study show that the majority of benign adrenal tumors do not concentrate radiolabeled SAs; conversely, the majority of malignant adrenal lesions show significant SAs uptake, suggesting the presence of somatostatin receptors. This finding may allow the use of somatostatin as a treatment agent in malignant adrenal tumors. Thus, the main role of labeled SAs in adrenal imaging consists of lesion characterization rather than tumor detection and localizatio...|$|R

Twenty-one horses suffering from gastrointestinal disorders were used in the experiment; 7 horses with experimentally induced endotoxemia and intestinal ischaemia, and 14 horses suffering from naturally occurring colic syndrome. Tissue samples of lungs, liver, heart, brain, cerebellum and hoof laminar tissue were collected for histopathological and oxidative stress evaluation using nitrotyrosine and superoxide dismutase (SOD 2) immunostaining. The horses were divided into two groups: the non-oxidative <b>lesions</b> <b>group</b> (NOLG), with 7 horses showing weak immunostaining in lungs, liver and kidney, and the oxidative <b>lesions</b> <b>group</b> (OLG), with 14 horses showing immunostaining indicating systemic oxidative stress in multiple organs. The horses from OLG showed increase of laminar lesions and SOD 2 immunostaining in multiple organs when compared to the horses from the NOLG. No differences were found ln regard to laminar immunostaining by nitrotyrosine and SOD 2 between experimental groups. It was concluded that systemic oxidative stress can {{be associated}} with the development of laminar lesions, and that the laminar tissue does not respond to oxidative stress with increase of SOD as occurs in other organs...|$|R
