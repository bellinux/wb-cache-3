5|$|After {{leaving the}} D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional American Basketball League (ABL), with no {{indication}} that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A <b>local</b> <b>broker</b> filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.|$|E

50|$|In 1905, the East Waterford Lumber Company {{erected a}} sawmill, a double stave mill, and a lath mill on the {{southwest}} edge of East Waterford. The company owned timber lands in Kansas Valley and Horse Valley, south and east of the town, and chartered its own logging railroad, the East Waterford and Kansas Valley Railroad, to bring timber to the company's mills. The company's railroad, built with the used rails and equipment of the Perry Lumber Company, was constructed to the same gauge as the Tuscarora Valley, to which it connected. The sawmill, with a capacity of 30,000 board feet per day, was relatively small when compared to its contemporaries elsewhere in Pennsylvania. However, it was sufficient for the East Waterford operation, which shipped over the Tuscarora Valley until 1908. At that time, the logging railroad and facility were sold, dismantled, and shipped to the Midlothian, Maryland operation of the Juniata Lumber Company (a co-owner {{of which was the}} <b>local</b> <b>broker</b> H.C.

5000|$|All {{securities}} traded through DTC {{are in fact}} held, {{in electronic}} form, on the books of various intermediaries between the ultimate owner, e.g. a retail investor, and the DTC participants. For example, Mr. Smith may hold 100 shares of Coca-Cola, Inc. in his brokerage account at <b>local</b> <b>broker</b> Jones & Co. brokers. In turn, Jones & Co. may hold 1000 shares of Coca-Cola on behalf of Mr. Smith and nine other customers. These 1000 shares are held by Jones & Co. in an account with Goldman Sachs, a DTC participant, or in an account at another DTC participant. Goldman Sachs in turn may hold millions of Coca-Cola shares on its books on behalf of hundreds of brokers similar to Jones & Co. Each day, the DTC participants settle their accounts with the other DTC participants and adjust the number of shares held on their books {{for the benefit of}} customers like Jones & Co. Ownership of securities in this fashion is called beneficial ownership. Each intermediary holds on behalf of someone beneath him in the chain. The ultimate owner is called the beneficial owner. This is also referred to as owning in [...] "Street name".|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Total {{ordering}} is a messaging guarantee increasingly {{required of}} content-based pub/sub systems, which are traditionally focused on performance. The main challenge is the uniform ordering of streams of publications from multiple publishers within an overlay broker network {{to be delivered}} to multiple subscribers. Our solution integrates total ordering into the pub/sub logic instead of offloading it as an external service. We show that our solution is fully distributed and relies only on <b>local</b> <b>broker</b> knowledge and overlay links. We can identify and isolate specific publications and subscribers where synchronization is required: the overhead is therefore contained to the affected subscribers. Our solution remains safe under the presence of failure, where we show total order to be impossible to maintain. Our experiments demonstrate that our solution scales {{with the number of}} subscriptions and has limited overhead for the non-conflicting cases. A holistic comparison with group communication systems is offered to evaluate their relative scalability. I...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInter-grid is a {{composition}} of small interconnected grid domains; {{each has its}} own <b>local</b> <b>broker.</b> The main challenge is to devise appropriate job scheduling policies that can satisfy goals such as global load balancing together with maintaining the local policies of the different domains. Existing inter-grid methodologies are based on either centralised meta-scheduling or decentralised scheduling which carried is out by local brokers, but without proper coordination. Both are suitable interconnecting grid domains, but breaks down when the number of domains become large. Earlier we proposed Slick, a scalable resource discovery and job scheduling technique for broker based interconnected grid domains, where inter-grid scheduling decisions are handled by gateway schedulers installed on the local brokers. This paper presents a decentralised scheduling technique for the Slick architecture, where cross-grid scheduling decisions are made using a fuzzy-logic based algorithm. The proposed technique is tested through simulating its implementation on 512 interconnected Condor pools. Compared to existing techniques, our results show that the proposed technique is better at maintaining the overall throughput and load balancing with increasing number of interconnected grids...|$|E
40|$|Brokering is an {{essential}} element of service-oriented architectures and utility resource sharing. Brokers act as intermediaries that match client needs with provider services by aggregating information about multiple providers and client requests. In these systems, broker architectures facilitate efficient and effective service management by distributing services to their “highest and best use”. Brokers must create pairings in a way that accommodates system requirements of flexible and extensible management to achieve scalability and autonomy. This project explores broker architectures in the context of two economic, service-oriented architectures: Cereus and Tuscany. These research systems are currently under development at Duke and HP Labs, respectively. In this proposal we will explore alternatives for broker architectures, such as the distribution of brokers, the mode of client interaction, and the incentives for brokers to participate in and help maintain a sustainable system. One crucial aspect of our broker architectures is that brokers organize into a mesh to share system information. Services and resources flow through this mesh according to <b>local</b> <b>broker</b> policies, ultimately resulting in global service management. We propose future work to explore the benefits brokers provide to the clients and providers in service-oriented systems, as well as investigate how different design decisions in the broker architecture affect service and resource allocation outcomes. Most significantly, we plan to examine how broker allocation policies affect the stability and agility of service control and the effectiveness of the broker mesh to match system supply and demand. ...|$|E
