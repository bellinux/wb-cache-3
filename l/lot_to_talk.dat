[...] Walker further emphasized in another review for MTV that the tour expanded on Gaga's characteristic [...] "fan-to-artist" [...] connections and theatrics she had developed with the Born This Way Ball. Adam Carlson from Billboard praised the show saying that it turned the [...] "spectacle" [...] into a [...] "surprise". He complimented the choreography and the constant costume changes, explaining that [...] "talking about [...] performances is more fun than listening to them, but don't take that as an insult.

Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse".

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

50|$|There were 139 {{competitors}} for {{the second}} event. The inaugural race received little media attention, but this changed in 1984 with James Daniels from the 3ZM radio station in Christchurch competing in the event.

Climbing up the Deception River, the weather deteriorated. Competitors who were slower faced ever higher water levels and could not undertake the many river crossings by themselves, but had to wait for others to link arms. The temperature at Goat Pass was 4 degrees Celsius. Despite the conditions, John Howard finished the first day 10 minutes faster than the 1983 winner's time; Howard had missed the event the previous year as he wanted to save himself for a major triathlon a week later in the United States (which, due to an administrative bungle, he could not get to).|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{using new}} {{expressions}} and words is another linguistic factor which appeared progressive for low-anxious students and debilitating for the highly anxious ones. The teacher or peers’ negative judgment {{can be one}} of the affective factors which may heighten learners’ anxiety. Thus, having good relations with other students in the class mitigates negative judgments and contributes to decreasing learners’ anxiety. Besides, pedagogical contextual factors and tools used for learning affect learners’ anxiety. Teachers’ negative reaction to the learners’ mistakes make them feel embarrassed that they prefer not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in the class. The level of learners’ self-confidence influences their level of anxiety since learners with low self-confidence feel anxious <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> In contrast, confident learners are eager to speak and they learn from their mistakes. EFL learners’ anxiety might be impressed by their self-perception of their English language. Besides, the background knowledge of students, and lack of topical knowledge affected their anxiety as familiarity with the topics of conversations decreases their anxiety. At the time of speaking, they have a <b>lot</b> of ideas <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about in their mind in their native languages, but they have no idea how to put them; thus, they abstain <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> This study suggested that cognitive, linguistic, and affective factors are important in the moment-by-moment rise and fall of learners’ anxiety.|$|R
