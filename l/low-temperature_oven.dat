5000|$|A <b>low-temperature</b> <b>oven,</b> 95 °C to 160 °C (200 °F to 325 °F), is {{best when}} cooking with large cuts of meat, turkey and whole chickens. This is not {{technically}} roasting temperature, {{but it is}} called slow-roasting. The benefit of slow-roasting an item is less moisture loss and a more tender product. More of the collagen that makes meat tough is dissolved in slow cooking. At true roasting temperatures, 200 °C (400 °F) or more, the water inside the muscle is lost at a high rate.|$|E
30|$|To achieve urea modification, {{a mixture}} of RH and urea in a ratio of 1 : 2 by mass was exposed to {{microwave}} irradiation (2450  MHz) for a total period of 12  min (Farooq et al. 2010). The jelly like slurry substance obtained was boiled in water for half an hour, filtered while hot and further washed with hot water to remove unreacted urea. The residue was dried in a <b>low-temperature</b> <b>oven</b> and, thereafter, stored in an airtight container.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{friability}} is {{a physical}} property that provides valuable information for minimizing energy consumption during soil tillage and for preparing the edaphic medium for plant development. Its quantitative determination is generally carried out with aggregates obtained from soil blocks taken at fixed depths of profiles without considering the superficial horizons of the soil. The objective of the {{this study was to}} determine the effect of aggregate size and superficial horizon differentiation on the friability index (FI) of some soils cultivated with sugar cane in the Geographic Valley of the Cauca River (Colombia), using univariate (CVu) and multivariate (CVm) coefficients of variation. The FI was evaluated using a compression test with four aggregate-size ranges taken from the Ap and A 1 superficial horizons of 182 sampling sites located on 18 sugar cane farms. Of the five types of studied soils (Inceptisols, Mollisols, Vertisols, Alfisols and Ultisols), 7, 280 aggregates were collected that were air dried and subsequently dried in a <b>low-temperature</b> <b>oven</b> before determining the tensile strength (TS), which was in turn used to calculate the FI using the coefficient of variation method. This study found that the FI varied with the aggregate size and the soil depth (first two horizons). Only three of the four size ranges initially selected were relevant. The CVm proved to be very useful for the selection of a more relevant value from the confidence interval of the TS from the CVu method for friability and established that the lower limit value (FIi) of the TS CVu was the FI value that was closest to the multivariate measurement...|$|E
50|$|In {{factories}} in the 2010s, large jerky ovens are built using insulated panels. Inside these <b>low-temperature</b> drying <b>ovens</b> are many heater elements and fans. The ovens have exhaust ports to remove the moisture-laden air. The combination of fast-moving air and low heat dries the meat to the desired moisture content within a few hours. The raw, marinated jerky strips are placed on racks of nylon-coated metal screens which have been sprayed with a light vegetable oil to allow the meat to be removed easily. The screen trays are placed closely in layers on rolling carts which are then put in the drying oven.|$|R
40|$|Friability is a {{property}} {{related to the}} brittle fracture of soil aggregates and therefore considered {{as a key to}} the physical quality of soils and the consumption of energy during farming. This paper contains the preliminary results of research that aimed to quantitatively determine the friability index (FI) and its relationship with other soil properties; in particular, this research focused on the relationship between the FI and the clay content and organic carbon percentage (OC) of soils having a different dominance in the fine fraction (1 : 1 and 2 : 1 clay) that were cultivated with sugar cane in the southwest region of Colombia. The FI was determined by the compressive strength method using aggregates with diameters between 9. 5 mm and 19 mm taken from the surface horizon, which were air air-dried and then dried at a <b>low-temperature</b> in the <b>oven.</b> The type clay content and OC content were determined in these samples. 98. 6 % of the studied samples, had FI values between 0. 24 and 0. 80, thus, classifying them as friable (especially those having a 1 : 1 type clay dominance) and very friable (especially those having a 2 : 1 type clay dominance), suggesting a structural condition of low to moderate energy requirements for farming, low greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and a reduced risk of damage on the physical quality if a suitable soil moisture content exists during the tilling. This study found correlations between the texture, OC, and FI of the soils, indicating that the two first properties affected the friability. However, this effect depended on the clay dominance type...|$|R
