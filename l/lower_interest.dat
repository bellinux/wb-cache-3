5|$|The {{government}} took majority {{control of the}} company after the election of its new board on 10 November 2009. In January 2010, when accumulated losses already exceeded NT$70billion, THSRC signed a government-guaranteed refinancing deal in which eight government-dominated banks provided NT$382billion at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates and longer maturity. The government also approved the company's new variable depreciation charge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, {{there could be}} a strong {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates after FairTax passage.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates than was historically {{the case when}} denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

5|$|The state faced a $400million revenue {{shortfall}} when Jones took office. Shortly after his election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to streamline state government. Among the enacted recommendations were refinancing state bonds at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates, cutting the state workforce by 2,000 employees (mostly through attrition), and spurring local economic growth through tax incentives. By {{the end of}} Jones' term, the state enjoyed a $300million budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden. THSRC signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of 8 domestic banks led by Bank of Taiwan in January, 2010; and utilized the new loan {{to pay off the}} previous syndicated loan which with higher interest. As of 30 June 2011, the long-term debts totaling NT$385 billion include NT$26 billion corporate bonds and NT$359 billion bank loans. In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the newly signed refinancing debts carried <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates and longer tenors up to 22 years. The Company’s financial burden is therefore largely reduced.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rate.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, {{stimulus}} {{refers to}} attempts to use monetary or fiscal policy (or stabilization policy in general) {{to stimulate the}} economy. Stimulus can also refer to monetary policies like <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> rates and quantitative easing.|$|R
5000|$|Banks: Banks can tend {{to change}} the {{interest}} rate to either slow down or speed up economy growth. This involves either raising interest rates to slow the economy down, or <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> rates to promote economic growth.|$|R
25|$|Countries that {{abandoned}} the gold standard, allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their Balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates {{and act as}} lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} {{districts are}} used to provide local government services (mostly zoning, building inspection, etc.) to unincorporated areas, sub-regional services (e.g. street bridge over a border) between two or more members, regional parks, and regional services (e.g. funding the regional hospital district) required for the entire area. Also, {{as a collection of}} municipalities they are able to borrow funds for capital projects at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates.|$|E
25|$|The second {{criticism}} is that savings represent loanable funds, particularly at banks, assuming the savings are held at banks, rather than currency itself being held ("stashed under one's mattress"). Thus {{an accumulation of}} savings yields an increase in potential lending, which will <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates and stimulate borrowing. So a decline in consumer spending is offset {{by an increase in}} lending, and subsequent investment and spending.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the central}} bank has <b>lowered</b> nominal <b>interest</b> rates to zero, {{it can no longer}} further stimulate demand by <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> rates. This is the famous {{liquidity}} trap. When deflation takes hold, it requires [...] "special arrangements" [...] to lend money at a zero nominal rate of interest (which could still be a very high real rate of interest, due to the negative inflation rate) in order to artificially increase the money supply.|$|R

50|$|During Fox's presidency, the Mexican Stock Exchange reached {{record highs}} {{throughout}} his term. The record highs {{were caused by}} a better economic outlook throughout his term, larger foreign currency reserves, and a better debt rating that <b>lowered</b> <b>interest</b> rates.|$|R
25|$|Advocates of BAPCPA {{claimed that}} its passage would reduce losses to {{creditors}} such as credit card companies, {{and that those}} creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers {{in the form of}} <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Critics assert that these claims turned out to be false, observing that although credit card company losses decreased after passage of the Act, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.|$|E
25|$|The issuers of the {{obligations}} or securities may be companies, special purpose entities, {{state or local}} governments, non-profit organizations, or sovereign nations. A credit rating facilitates the trading of securities on a secondary market. It affects the interest rate that a security pays out, with higher ratings leading to <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Individual consumers are rated for creditworthiness not by credit rating agencies but by credit bureaus (also called consumer reporting agencies or credit reference agencies), which issue credit scores.|$|E
25|$|Effects on the {{quantity}} of reserves that banks used to make loans influence the economy. Policy actions that add reserves to the banking system encourage lending at <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates thus stimulating growth in money, credit, and the economy. Policy actions that absorb reserves work in the opposite direction. The Fed's task is to supply enough reserves to support an adequate amount of money and credit, avoiding the excesses that result in inflation and the shortages that stifle economic growth.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the global economic recession in 2008, Israel's central bank governor, Stanley Fischer, <b>lowered</b> <b>interest</b> rates to an all-time low of 0.5%. That resulted in prices rising very fast in 2009, after rising steadily in the preceding decade.|$|R
2500|$|Ben Bernanke {{warned of}} the risks of such {{imbalances}} in 2005, arguing that a [...] "savings glut" [...] in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits, artificially <b>lowering</b> <b>interest</b> rates and creating asset bubbles.|$|R
50|$|When {{home prices}} went down, the Federal Reserve kept its loose {{monetary}} policy and <b>lowered</b> <b>interest</b> rates; {{the attempt to}} slow price declines in one asset class, e.g. real estate, may well have caused prices in other asset classes to rise, e.g. commodities.|$|R
25|$|These {{gains were}} {{not just a matter}} of renewed access on {{favorable}} terms to the Iberian market, or greater efficiency. Equally important were other commercial advantages the Dutch had over their competitors, like fundamentally <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and the productivity and profitably of the Dutch textile industry (due to technological innovations). The combination of these factors enticed Iberian wool exporters to opt for the Dutch market, and allowed Dutch merchants to prefinance Spanish dyestuff exports (like they also prefinanced Baltic grain exports and French wine exports).|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} {{was the primary}} transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Under the {{gold standard}}'s price–specie flow mechanism, countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).|$|E

The company also provided a $1,000 rebate or a <b>lower</b> <b>interest</b> rate for customers whose homes qualified as energy efficient. In 2007, Bank of America partnered with Brighter Planet to offer an eco-friendly credit card, and later a debit card, which help build renewable energy projects with each purchase.
