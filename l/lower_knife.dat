40|$|Abstract. Asymmetric plunge cutting {{by using}} grooved knife edge plate was {{proposed}} for advanced die cutting of a polycarbonate (PC) sheet. By varying the tip angle αU and the tip thickness wU of knife {{edge in the}} counter plate, and combining a standard steel cutting rule of 42 ° center bevel blade, a cutting load response of PC sheet was investigated and also that deformation was observed by a CCD camera. Through this works, the followings were found: 1) there were two deformation modes of sheared profile. 2) The tip thickness wU was a primary factor, compared to the tip angle of αU. 3) The equivalent wedge angle effect was revealed {{with respect to the}} upper/lower angles α and αU, while the PC sheet was bent up by the <b>lower</b> <b>knife</b> indentation...|$|E

Purpose. The aim of {{the article}} is an {{estimation}} by the method of complete elements of parameters of process of cutting of wire by knives: effort, to distribution of tensions in the cutting edges of knives. Design/methodology/approach. For {{the design of the}} system a bedknife is a wire - a movable knife was attracted programmatic package of Deform- 2 d. Dependence of effort of cutting of wire is considered by knives from moving of overhead knife. Findings. It is set that this dependence takes character, similar to the holing process of opening at more subzero values of cutting efforts. The marked coincidence of distribution of tensions is in overhead and <b>lower</b> <b>knives</b> with character of their wear that validifies and rightness of select calculation charts results of numeral design. Conducted comparison of results of numeral design of process of cutting of wire by knives with fractography researches of wear of overhead movable and lower bedknife. Originality/value. The work is devoted to defining the distribution of stresses in the blades cutting edge for cutting wire, analysis of the stress-strain state of the cutting edges of knives. This knowledge is needed to develop methods for improving the stability of cutting edges. ????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ??????: ??????, ????????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????. ??? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ??? - ????????? - ????????? ??? ??? ????????? ??????????? ?????

40|$|O objetivo do trabalho avaliar algumas alternativas para redução da sujidade nas toras de eucalipto sem casca, advindos do campo, para indústria de celulose, sem perda de produtividade nas atividades de colheita com o Harvester. Foram aplicados cinco tratamentos: alteração no ângulo dos crivos dos rolos do cabeçote; aplicação de estrias no dorso do cabeçote; redução do raio das facas inferiores do cabeçote; aplicação de chapa metálica no dorso {{exterior}} das facas superiores do cabeçote (defletor) e processamento da madeira na frente do Harvester, ou seja, longe da pilha (alteração de processo). Todos os tratamentos reduziram a sujidade, exceto a redução do raio das facas inferiores. O mais eficiente foi a alteração no processo. Porém, neste tratamento houve uma perda de 6, 8 % na produtividade. Quando analisada, a aplicação das estrias no dorso do cabeçote foi considerada a mais eficiente, pois reduziu a sujidade (- 21 %) e aumentou a produtividade (+ 3, 8 %). Quando analisado financeiramente a colheita e o transporte, seria mais viável transportar a sujidade do que trabalhar com menor produtividade na colheita. The aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate some alternatives for reducing dirt on eucalyptus logs without bark, coming from the field to the pulp industry, without loss of productivity in harvesting activities with the Harvester. Five treatments were applied: change in angle of the screens scrolls head; application of stretch marks on the back of the head; reduction of the radius of the lower head knives; applying the sheet metal back on the outside of the upper knife cylinder head (deflector), and processing the wood in front of the harvester, ie away from the stack (modification process). All treatments reduced the soil except the reduction of the radius of the <b>lower</b> <b>knives.</b> The most effective was the change in the process. However, in this treatment, a loss of 6. 8 % yield. When analyzed, the application of stretch marks on the back of the head was considered the most efficient because it reduced the dirt (- 21 %) and increased productivity (+ 3. 8 %). When analyzed financially harvesting and transportation, would be more feasible to transport the dirt than working with lower productivity in the harvest...|$|R
5000|$|One year later, Loomis is {{assigned}} to Jamie at the Haddonfield Children's Clinic. Aware that Michael is still alive, and discovering that Jamie is telepathically linked with him, Loomis constantly pressures her to inform him of Michael's whereabouts, but Jamie is too traumatized to tell him. When Michael returns, the police and Loomis set a trap for Myers at his house, involving the young niece {{to sit at the}} dressing table in Judith Myers's old bedroom. After the police receive calls linking Myers to be somewhere else, they all leave, leaving Loomis to say another famous line, [...] "Now you'll come, won't you, Michael?" [...] Michael arrives, and Loomis tries to reason with him, proposing that he fight his rage and redeem himself through a positive relationship with Jamie. Loomis' words seem to work at first, as Michael calmly listens to him and <b>lowers</b> his <b>knife,</b> but when Loomis reaches to take away Michael's knife, he slashes him across the abdomen and throws him through the banister in a frenzy. When Loomis awakens, he appears to turn on Jamie, grabbing her and shouting for Michael to take her, only to lure Michael into a trap; Loomis drops a metal link net over Michael, shoots him with a tranquilizer gun, and then violently beats him unconscious with a wooden plank.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is quenched, hardening only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the <b>lower</b> hardness. The <b>knife</b> is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched, flame hardening creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.|$|R
40|$|A unique {{laboratory}} device, the Laboratory Shear, {{has been}} designed and built to simulate and examine the shear angle cutting process, which is the predominant method used in many cutting operations. The device is capable of force and velocity measurements of the shear angle cutting process with the abilities to vary cutting speed, knife preload, and blade geometry. The dimensions of the device are such that mobility to and from conditioning rooms in the laboratory environment are not limited. Assembly and disassembly ease as well as automatic versus manual operation options were incorporated for greater experimental flexibility. The device {{has the ability to}} evaluate products at a shear velocity of 200 inches per second, which equates to nearly 1000 feet per minute on a conventional slitter with 10 shear angle. The force measurement capability is 10 pounds, which is sufficient to handle the majority of Kodak films. Knife preload can be adjusted to provide preloads from 2 lbs to 12 lbs, in increments of 2 lbs. Debug of the Lab Shear Device was conducted and included knife sharpness measurement as well as calibration of the load cell and velocity transducer. The upper (moving) knife was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0002 inch and the <b>lower</b> (stationary) <b>knife</b> was found to have a cutting tip radius of approximately 0. 0001 inch. Both knives could be considered as 2 ̆ 2 medium dull 2 ̆ 2 based on the Kodak standard for slitting knife sharpness (X 3 ̆c 0. 0001 inch = sharp, X 3 ̆e 0. 0005 inch = dull). Edges for both knives appeared smooth and defect free as viewed with SEM. Load cell and velocity transducer calibration resulted in less than 10...|$|R
