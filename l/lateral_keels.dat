5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or <b>lateral</b> <b>keels</b> (ridges).|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent <b>lateral</b> <b>keels.</b> A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E
25|$|The two Squaliolus {{species are}} the only sharks that have a spine on the first dorsal fin, but not the second. The spine is usually exposed in males and covered by skin in females. The tiny first dorsal fin {{originates}} about over the rear tip of the pectoral fin. The second dorsal fin is long and low, and originates over the front half of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are short with rounded margins, and the pelvic fins are long and low. The anal fin is absent. The caudal peduncle is thin and bears slight <b>lateral</b> <b>keels.</b> Males have shorter abdomens and longer caudal peduncles than females. The caudal fin is broad and triangular, with nearly symmetrical upper and lower lobes and a prominent notch in the trailing margin of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are flattened and not toothed or elevated on stalks. This species is dark brown to black in color, becoming light towards the fin margins. Its underside is covered by light-producing photophores.|$|E

2500|$|The {{basking shark}} (Cetorhinus maximus) {{is the second}} largest living fish, after the whale shark, and one of three plankton-eating sharks along with the whale shark and megamouth shark.

500|$|Fast and energetic, the {{porbeagle}} can {{be found}} singly or in groups. Its fusiform body, narrow caudal peduncle with <b>lateral</b> <b>keels,</b> and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, billfishes, and several other groups of active fishes. It and the salmon shark are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style: they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but {{at the cost of}} maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic [...] "red muscle" [...] along each side, which can contract independently of the regular [...] "white muscle" [...] at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} (Lamna nasus) is {{a species}} of mackerel shark in the family Lamnidae, distributed widely {{in the cold and}} temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. In the North Pacific, its ecological equivalent is the closely related salmon shark (L.ditropis). The porbeagle typically reaches [...] in length and a weight of North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow base of the tail. It has large pectoral and first dorsal fins, tiny pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins, and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of <b>lateral</b> <b>keels</b> on its tail.|$|E

50|$|The body is dorsoventrally {{slightly}} {{depressed and}} appears moderately to markedly stout. The tail is short, and prehensile, tapering abruptly behind the vent.

The ventral scales have <b>lateral</b> <b>keels,</b> numbering 140-144 in males and 142-148 in females. The subcaudals are without keels: males have 33-36, females 29-31.|$|E
5000|$|Fast-swimming sharks of open waters, {{such as the}} {{mackerel}} sharks, have crescent-shaped tails with {{upper and}} lower lobes of almost equal size. The high aspect ratio of the tail serves to enhance swimming power and efficiency. In these species, there are usually also <b>lateral</b> <b>keels</b> on the caudal peduncle. The whale shark and basking shark also have this type of tail, although they are generally more sedate animals than the other examples.|$|E

50|$|The {{shortfin mako}} shark is {{cylindrical}} in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and {{the area around the}} mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the {{shortfin mako shark}}, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one <b>lateral</b> <b>keel</b> on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the makos from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus Lamna.|$|R
5000|$|Members of {{the order}} Polydesmida are also known as [...] "flat-backed millipedes", because on most species, each body segment has wide <b>lateral</b> <b>keels</b> known as paranota. These keels are {{produced}} by the posterior half (metazonite) of each body ring behind the collum. Polydesmids have no eyes, and vary in length from 3 to 130 mm. Including the telson, adults have 19 or 20 rings, while juveniles may have from 7 to 19 rings. Mature males have {{a single pair of}} gonopods consisting of the modified forward leg pair of the 7th segment. [...] Many of the larger species show bright coloration patterns which warn predators of their toxic secretions.|$|E
50|$|Orthomorpha coarctata (alternately {{known as}} Asiomorpha coarctata) {{is a widely}} {{introduced}} species of Polydesmidan millipede of the family Paradoxosomatidae.
