5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{period or}} the builder, King Offa of Mercia, {{who died in}} 796 AD.|$|E
5|$|Very <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Glover's pika's behavior, ecology, and reproduction. It is a generalist herbivore, and {{is known}} to {{construct}} haypiles.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{not known}} in the fossil record on Madagascar until the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Consequently, <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur clade, which comprises the endemic primate population of the island.|$|E

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> diets {{of other}} species of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached Vaquita showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing {{is known about the}} diet of the spectacled porpoise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of A.viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In general, ferns {{are less}} {{susceptible}} to herbivory than flowering plants due {{to higher levels of}} toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or disease.|$|E
5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage. Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of the storm.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{life and}} career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, {{he appears to have}} been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} bodies of {{irregular}} shape. Their geometric albedos generally vary between 3 and 10%. The average value is 0.056±0.003 for the objects larger than 57km, and 0.121±0.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25km. The asteroid 4709 Ennomos {{has the highest}} albedo (0.18) of all known Jupiter trojans. <b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> masses, chemical composition, rotation or other physical properties of the Jupiter trojans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{behaviour}} of the Cuban macaw and its extinct Caribbean relatives. Gundlach {{reported that}} it vocalised loudly like its Central American relatives and that it lived in pairs or families. Its speech imitation abilities were reportedly inferior {{to those of other}} parrots. Nothing is known about its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species {{is more likely}} to be found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the cinema from its initial years to the 1980s. In 1959, to promote the showing of The Big Hunt, a live {{elephant}} appeared outside the cinema. At some point after this, the Picture House briefly closed and became a bingo hall before reopening as a cinema again roughly two years later.|$|E

5|$|<b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Somari was {{developed}} by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's origins; it is theorized to have been based upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES. The title has caught the attention of contemporary video game journalists, who have commented upon its accurate recreation of the original game.|$|E
5|$|Triton's south {{polar region}} is covered by a highly {{reflective}} cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. <b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> north pole because {{it was on the}} night side during the Voyager 2 encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar ice cap.|$|E

5|$|Very <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds {{because they are}} used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very <b>little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. <b>Little</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
