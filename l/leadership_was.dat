5|$|A {{collective}} <b>leadership</b> <b>was</b> founded {{immediately after}} Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E

Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.|$|E

Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments.

Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.|$|E

40|$|Most {{leadership}} theories {{assume that}} <b>leadership</b> <b>is</b> {{a quality of}} leaders (e. g., trait theory), or a response to environments (e. g., situational theory), {{or a combination of}} both (e. g., contingency theory).

However, after years of research there is no agreed definition of what <b>leadership</b> <b>is</b> or any universal agreement about who might be regarded a leader.

40|$|<b>Leadership</b> <b>is</b> often assumed, intuitively, {{to be an}} {{important}} driver of sustainable development. To understand how <b>leadership</b> <b>is</b> conceptualised and analysed in the environmental sciences and to discover what this research says about leadership outcomes, we conducted a review of environmental leadership research over the last ten years. We find that much of the environmental leadership literature we reviewed focuses on a few key individuals and desirable leadership competencies. It also reports that <b>leadership</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most important}} of a number of factors contributing to effective management. Only a sub-set of the literature highlights interacting sources of leadership, disaggregates leadership outcomes or evaluates leadership processes in detail. We argue that the literature on environmental <b>leadership</b> <b>is</b> highly normative. <b>Leadership</b> <b>is</b> typically depicted as an unequivocal good and its importance is often asserted rather than tested.

5|$|In 1947, President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, {{which created}} the Federal Loyalty Program.

5|$|The ACLU <b>leadership</b> <b>was</b> {{divided over}} whether or not to defend pro-Nazi speech in the United States; pro-labor {{elements}} within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.|$|E

A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, {{communist}} Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijević, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb-inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's <b>leadership</b> <b>was</b> not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijević was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat.|$|E

Instead, he could ensure proficiency in battle only by teaching his men to master their aircraft and AI. He was constantly in touch with scientists and tracked new developments. He also took up new crews in the Beaufighter to generate confidence in the machine. Night pilots had to learn to fly on instruments alone, in adverse weather conditions and for sustained periods.

5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party <b>leadership</b> <b>was</b> frequently strained.

He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E
