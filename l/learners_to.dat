25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} how assessing interactions in a distance course impact the quality of instruction, student leaning, and satisfaction with the course. This study, further describes how interactions can be enhanced with certain technologies. The population for this research was both undergraduate and graduate students of the college of Agriculture and Natural Resources in National Chung-Hsing University (NCHU), in Taiwan. There are twelve departments under the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources including eleven departments and one graduate institute. Data was collected from students at NCHU (Taiwan) by using Qualtrics (an online survey platform) through the Internet. All data of this research collected via Internet and used SPSS 20. 0 to analysis data results. It is an anonymous survey that participants just receive the survey web address from email or academic platforms of each department. There is no any identification information for each participant. According to the findings, there are some relationships between transactional distance theory, technology, and online education. The results of the regression model point out that the <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the course content interaction is a significant predictor for satisfaction toward online classes. <b>Learner</b> <b>to</b> the course content interaction and <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the instructor interaction are significant predictors for quality toward online classes. <b>Learner</b> <b>to</b> the course technology interaction and <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the instructor interaction are significant predictors for learning toward online classes. <b>Learner</b> <b>to</b> the course content interaction and <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the instructor interaction are significant predictors of enhanced interactions in online classes. However, there is no interaction effect in <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> leaner interaction to enhance the satisfaction, quality, and learning. From the above data, the <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the instructor interaction and the <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the course content interaction are two important factors that influence learners? satisfaction, quality, and learning of online courses. More participants involving in this research recommended increasing the reliability and the diversity of opinions. Besides, using the same instrument for diverse populations such as differences of culture, background, and majors may find more relationships in interactions and technologies in online education. Also, do more researches for enhancing the interaction between <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> <b>learner</b> and <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> the course technology. It is important to find more effective technologies and media for instructors <b>to</b> enhance <b>learners?</b> satisfaction, quality, and learning of online education...|$|R

Face to face didactic in a formal classroom setting is not enough to stimulate and motivate learning. Thus, institutions of higher learning are investing in technology mediated learning environments to cater to students born in the digital age. With this in mind, a blended learning course was introduced to culinary students learning basic French in a local university. This study uses a questionnaire as a tool to investigate students’ level of satisfaction in a blended environment. The research focuses on four independent variables: <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> content interaction (LC), <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> instructor interaction (LI), <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> <b>learner</b> interaction (LL) and <b>learner</b> <b>to</b> technology interaction (LT).

A good example is the plural -s, which is always preceded by a vowel {{to prevent the occurrence}} of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final -s becomes -es.|$|E

25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} the facilitator in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become an essential part of the interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} the learner or <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> arrive at {{his or her}} version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by the learner {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of the learner throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that the learner creates, discovers and attains in the learning process (Wertsch 1997).|$|E
25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the course content, a hypertext document that allowed the <b>learners</b> <b>to</b> access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While {{further research is needed}} to determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E
