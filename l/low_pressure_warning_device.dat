40|$|The {{commercial}} {{availability of}} lightweight high pressure compressed air vessels {{has resulted in}} a lightweight firefighter's breathing apparatus. The improved apparatus, and details of its design and development are described. The apparatus includes a compact harness assembly, a backplate mounted pressure reducer assembly, a lightweight bubble-type facemask with a mask mounted demand breathing regulator. Incorporated in the breathing regulator is exhalation valve, a purge valve and a whistle-type <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> that sounds only during inhalation. The pressure reducer assembly includes two pressure reducers, an automatic transfer valve and a signaling <b>device</b> for the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning.</b> Twenty systems were fabricated, tested, refined through an alternating development and test sequence, and extensively examined in a field evaluation program. Photographs of the apparatus are included...|$|R

Captain Basuki asked First Officer Eri to check their landing configuration. After the check, the crew decided to continue its landing attempt. Captain Basuki then decided to fly the aircraft slightly below the glide slope.|$|R

50|$|All of this {{technology}} came {{at a very high}} price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a <b>low</b> suspension <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console.

50|$|The Yuba City bus {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} May 21, 1976 in Martinez, California. A 1950 Crown bus operated by Student Transportation Lines, Inc. had been chartered {{to carry the}} Yuba City High School a cappella choir from Yuba City to Miramonte High School in Orinda for a friendship day involving the choirs of the two schools. The accident occurred at 10:55 a.m., as the driver took the Marina Vista (exit 56) off-ramp from I-680 southbound from the Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The driver was unfamiliar with this bus, and mistakenly thought the <b>low</b> air <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> (for the air brakes) was a warning of <b>low</b> engine oil <b>pressure.</b> The driver left the freeway at the aforementioned off ramp, and the brakes failed {{due to lack of}} air pressure. The bus struck and mounted the bridge rail and left the elevated roadway, falling 21.6 feet. It landed upside down and crushed the roof {{to the bottom of the}} bus windows. Out of 52 passengers on board, twenty-eight students and an adult adviser were killed. All of the surviving passengers were injured, most critically. The driver survived the crash but was seriously hurt.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety technologies into complex socio-technical systems requires an integrated and {{holistic approach to}} HF and engineering, considering the effects of failures not only within system boundaries, but also at the interfaces with other systems and humans. Level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The design and failure modes of level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractConstruction workers {{suffer the}} most {{electrocution}}s among all industries. Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.

For the prevention of equipment related accidents, a low cost <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> has been developed using IC CD 4033. Warning device for the worker is envisaged by using elastic conductive cuffs around the wrist of the worker.
