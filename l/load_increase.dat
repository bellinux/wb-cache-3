30|$|The created {{fracture}} {{length is}} directly related to the gel <b>loading.</b> <b>Increasing</b> the gel <b>loading</b> <b>increases</b> the apparent viscosity of the fracturing fluid (which in turn reduces leakoff) and also increases the net pressure (which in turn increases the fracture length).|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} {{sampling}} robots increases {{but the number}} of field parameters is kept unchanged. As the number of sampling robots increases, the computational and communication <b>load</b> <b>increases</b> almost linearly in the case of both the federated decentralized and distributed filters, whereas for the completely decentralized filter, this <b>load</b> <b>increases</b> quadratically. Figures 9 and 10, respectively, show that the computational and communication <b>loads</b> <b>increase</b> when the number of robots used increases from 4 to 20 for all 4 types of filter structures.|$|R
50|$|An information-processing {{perspective}} of organizations also highlights {{the important role}} of communication. This perspective suggests that organizations gather information from their environment, process this information, and then act on it. As environmental complexity, turbulence, and information <b>load</b> <b>increase,</b> organizational communication increases. The organization's effectiveness in processing information becomes paramount when the business environment is complex and wrought with rapid change.|$|E

50|$|This is an {{approach}} to scaling where changes are made to the minimum size, maximum size, or desired capacity of the autoscaling group at specific times of day. Scheduled scaling is useful, for instance, {{if there is a}} known traffic <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> or decrease at specific times of the day, but the change is too sudden for autoscaling to respond fast enough. AWS autoscaling groups support scheduled scaling.|$|E

50|$|For counters, Gray coding gives minimum {{switching}} activity, {{and thus}} is suitable for low-power designs. Gray encoding suits best when state change are sequential. In arbitrary state changing, FSM Gray code fails for low-power designs. For such FSM, one-hot encoding guarantees switching of two bits for every state change. But since the number of state variables needed {{is equal to the}} number of states, as states increase, one-hot encoding becomes an impractical solution, mainly because with an increased number of inputs and outputs to the circuit, complexity and capacitive <b>load</b> <b>increase.</b> Binary coding is worst for low power since the maximum Hamming distance is equal to the number of state variables.|$|E
50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak lift loading, with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak lift <b>load</b> <b>increase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each factor {{has more}} or less of an effect {{depending}} on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition for creep. The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading {{is dominated by the}} effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.|$|E

30|$|In Figures 11 and 12, {{the average}} waiting times of MMDA (CLFRF), MMDA (MCBF), and EDCA <b>increase</b> when traffic <b>load</b> <b>increases,</b> because MP suffers more contentions to {{transmit}} data when packet arrival rate increases. For MMDA (CLFRF) and MMDA (MCBF), MP needs {{to wait until}} the next mesh DTIM interval, if it cannot complete MMDA four-way-handshaking before the end of CP. Therefore, MMDA (CLFRF) and MMDA (MCBF) need to wait for several mesh DTIM intervals to transmit data packets when traffic <b>load</b> <b>increases,</b> which significantly make the average waiting time increase. Figures 13 and 14 show the packet drop ratio also increases, because packets will be dropped for time out or reached the retransmission limit when traffic <b>load</b> <b>increases.</b>|$|R

50|$|Eventually, all {{glycogen}} is exhausted, and {{the muscle}} cell enters another semi-stable state. During this transition, up-regulation of the citric acid cycle due to abundance of pyruvate is reversed, and {{a substantial part}} of the ATP pool is necessarily discharged down to AMP, which allows the citric acid cycle to be sped up by some other mechanism (perhaps by the allosteric mechanism that reacts to the lower concentration of ATP, or by amplification of the residual AMPD activity by the bloated AMP pool), until ATP production is balanced with ATP consumption. AMP conversion to adenosine, excretion to the blood (as AMP and its various metabolites), further conversion to uric acid and excretion to urine becomes significant for some time, until all AMP is eliminated from the muscle cell. The muscle movements become noticeably less precise. Breathing slows down. It becomes hard to rapidly increase the load on a muscle, as in McArdle's disease, and such a rapid <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> will dump even more purines into blood and urine (looking like translucent or rust-colored sharp shiny crystals and being highly irritating). The same situation would occur if blood flow to muscle cells becomes insufficient (except that somewhat less AMP is spilled over, and somewhat more of it is metabolized inside the muscle cell). On the other hand, there will be no lasting muscle pain from lactate, and continuous aerobic activity is possible. Oxidation of odd-numbered saturated fatty acids may provide another mechanism, although very gradual, to up-regulate citric acid cycle during exercise.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild cam lobe with little lift and a normal cam lobe with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild cam lobe, forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal cam lobe. This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and <b>load</b> <b>increase,</b> both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a sliding pin, just like with the original VTEC. This sliding pin connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] cam lobe has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stress-controlled <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> and {{constant}} amplitude tests {{have been carried}} out in a temperature range of- 60 °C < T < 20 °C at the aluminium alloy AlMg 4. 5 Mn (EN AW- 5083). Therefore a recently developed climate chamber which operates with liquid nitrogen was mounted on a servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine to realize the required low temperatures. Beside conventional mechanical hysteresis measurements, electrical resistance and temperature measurements are used to characterize the fatigue behavior. Furthermore, with these methods, the endurance limit was successfully estimated in a <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> test. Woehler curves were determined with constant amplitude tests at different temperatures. The conventionally determined endurance limit corresponds with the value from the <b>load</b> <b>increase</b> test...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Carbon {{black and}} {{activated}} carbon were produced from bamboo (Gigantochloa scortechinii) using pyrolysis (at 900 C) and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) chemical activation (at 700 C) {{and used as}} a filler in polyester composites. The composites were prepared at 10, 20, 30, and 40 % filler loading. The effects of water absorption, water content, and density of composites were determined. Results showed that water content and water absorption slightly <b>increased</b> as filler <b>loading</b> <b>increased,</b> while density value decreased as filler <b>loading</b> <b>increased.</b> Tensile, flexural and impact tests were performed at different filler loading. The results indicated that tensile and flexural strength, elongation at break, toughness and impact properties decreased as filler <b>loading</b> <b>increased.</b> However, the tensile and flexural modulus exhibited the reverse phenomenon. The filler-matrix bonding from impact fracture was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
