After moving to North Carolina, her father, L'Fatihah Mateen, established the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center in Greensboro and served as its prayer leader (he died in 1997). In 2005 Syidah Mateen, not realizing {{that the lack of}} a Qur'an for oaths at the courthouse might be mandated by law, joined with other Muslim-American's at the Al-Ummil Ummat Islamic Center [...] "to donate copies of the Qur'an to Guilford County's two courthouses". The Center's imam, Charles Abdullah [...] "working through a judicial assistant, was prepared to hand over the Qurans", but two Guilford judges declined to accept the texts, saying [...] "an oath on the Qur'an is not a <b>legal</b> <b>oath</b> under state law".|$|E

25|$|He had a {{dream of}} his own death {{and his mother had}} the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this {{depressed}} him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear <b>legal</b> <b>oaths,</b> which could make them a threat later in life.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of the Second Empire in 1867, liberal presidents Benito Juárez and his {{successor}} Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada began implementing the anti-clerical measures of the constitution. Lerdo went further, extending the laws of the Reform to formalize: separation of Church and State; civil marriage as the only valid manner for State recognition; prohibitions of religious corporations to acquire real estate; elimination from <b>legal</b> <b>oaths</b> any religious element, but only a declaration to tell the truth; and the elimination of monastic vows as legally binding. Further prohibitions on the Church in 1874 included: the exclusion of religion in public institutions; restriction of religious acts to church precincts; banning of religious garb in public except within churches; and prohibition of the ringing of church bells except to summon parishioners.|$|R
5000|$|References to the Monarchy {{are commonplace}} {{in public life}} in the Cook Islands. There are {{references}} to the Crown in <b>legal</b> documents, <b>Oaths</b> of office taken by the Queen's Representative, Members of Parliament and Judges of the High Court, and prescriptions in the Constitution require allegiance to be sworn to the reigning Sovereign as the Head of State of the Cook Islands.|$|R
50|$|Iniuriosus {{denied any}} {{involvement}} in the murder. He swore a <b>legal</b> <b>oath</b> to that effect. The family of Armentarius demanded that Childebert II (r. 575-595) should decide on the case. Iniuriosus visited the royal court, presumably at Metz, for his hearing. He waited three days for his accusers to appear. Since Armentarius' relatives never appeared at court, the case was dismissed. Iniuriosus returned home with no further incident.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{religious}} groups have {{objected to the}} taking of oaths, most notably the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Anabaptist groups, like Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites and Schwarzenau Brethren. This is principally based on , the Antithesis of the Law. Here, Christ is written to say [...] "I say to you: 'Swear not at all'". James the Just stated in , [...] "Above all, my brothers, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your [...] "Yes" [...] be yes, and your [...] "No," [...] no, or you will be condemned." [...] Beyond this scriptural authority, Quakers place importance on being truthful at all times, so the testimony opposing oaths springs from a view that [...] "taking <b>legal</b> <b>oaths</b> implies a double standard of truthfulness" [...] suggesting that truthfulness in legal contexts is somehow more important than truthfulness in non-legal contexts and that truthfulness in those other contexts is therefore somehow less important.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the news}} of his final victory, {{at the battle of}} Munda, reached Rome, the Parilia, the games commemorating the {{founding}} of the city, were to be held the next day; they were rededicated to Caesar, as if he were founder. Statues were set up to his Liberty, and to Caesar himself, as [...] "unconquered god." [...] He was accorded a house at public expense which was built like a temple; his image was paraded with those of the gods; his portrait was put on the coins (the first time a living man had appeared on Roman coinage). Early in 44 BC, he was called parens patriae (father of the fatherland); <b>legal</b> <b>oaths</b> were taken by his Genius; his birthday was made a public festival; the month Quinctilis was renamed July, in his honor (as June was named for Juno). At last a special priest, a flamen, was ordained for him; the first was to be Marc Antony, Caesar's adjutant, then consul – an honor which once officially adopted would rank Caesar not only as divine, but as a divinity honoured equally with Quirinus, Jupiter, and Mars. In Cicero's hostile account, the living Caesar's honours in Rome were already and unambiguously those of a full-blown god (deus).|$|R
50|$|By 1790, the Jewish {{population}} of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% {{of the provincial}} population. They were highly segregated and subject to long-standing antisemitic regulations. They maintained their own customs, Yiddish language, and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis. Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in villages. They concentrated in trade, services, and especially in money lending. They financed {{about a third of}} the mortgages in Alsace. Official tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation in 1791. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a one-year moratorium on all debts owed to Jews. In the 1830-1870 era most Jews moved to the cities, where they integrated and acculturated, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and in 1846 a special <b>legal</b> <b>oath</b> for Jews was discontinued. Antisemitic local riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. The merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence.|$|E
50|$|Determined {{to avoid}} {{teaching}} as a long-term career option, Kendall applied for a license to practice law in Kentucky. On October 12, 1814, he traveled to the state capital of Frankfort to present himself for examination before the Kentucky Court of Appeals. He asked Major William Barry (whom he had traveled with {{part of the way}} from Pennsylvania to Kentucky) to introduce him to the judges, but Barry did not appear. He then asked a Frankfort lawyer, Robert Wickliffe, to introduce him, but Wickliffe could not be found. Kendall introduced himself to the judges, and spent about an hour that night under examination. He was further examined in the morning. Kendall made so many errors (many of them in response to simple questions) that he feared he would not obtain the law license. But Barry and Wickliffe both appeared at midday and spoke privately with the judge examiners, and Kendall was granted his license that afternoon. He swore the <b>legal</b> <b>oath</b> on March 21, 1815. Kendall quit his employment with the Clays on April 29, 1814.|$|E

Judge Albright stated flatly “An oath on the Quran is not a lawful oath under our law.” He maintained that the statute means the Bible and that if that is to be changed {{it is up to the}} North Carolina Legislature, [...] "It's gotten way out there: They've got everything from the Book of Mormon to the Book of Wicca on the list.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the research {{plan for the}} preparation of a searchable electronic repository of the earliest extant <b>legal</b> <b>oaths</b> from medieval Poland drawing on the expertise in historical corpus-building developed {{for the history of}} English. The oaths survive in the overwhelmingly Latin land books from the period between 1386 and 1446 for six localities Greater Poland, in which the land courts operated: Poznań, Kościan, Pyzdry, Gniezno, Konin and Kalisz. A diplomatic edition of the oaths was published in five volumes by Polish historical linguists (Kowalewicz & Kuraszkiewicz 1959 – 1966). The edition is the only comprehensive resource of considerable scope (over 6300 oaths from the years 1386 – 1446) {{for the study of the}} earliest attestations of the Polish language beyond glosses. Recognising some limitations, but most of all its unparalleled coverage of the coexistence of Latin and the vernacular, the ROThA project embarks on transforming the edition into an open up-to-date digital resource. We thus aim to facilitate research into the history of Polish and Latin as well as of the legal system and the related social and linguistic issues of the period. The authors gratefully acknowledge the Polish National Science Centre grant (NCN 2014 / 13 /B/HS 2 / 00644) which facilitated research presented in the paper...|$|R

60|$|Again, Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal {{piling up}} of words, which, however ludicrously {{displayed}} in his case, was, I must say, {{not at all}} peculiar to him. I have observed it, {{in the course of}} my life, in numbers of men. It seems to me to be a general rule. In the taking of <b>legal</b> <b>oaths,</b> for instance, deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession, for the expression of one idea; as, that they utterly detest, abominate, and abjure, or so forth; and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle. We talk about the tyranny of words, but we like to tyrannize over them too; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds well. As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so, the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration, if there be but a great parade of them. And as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries, or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters, so I think I could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties, and will get into many greater, from maintaining too large a retinue of words.|$|R
25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in <b>legal</b> testimony under <b>oath,</b> but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Oath of a Freeman" [...] was a {{loyalty oath}} drawn {{up in the}} early 17th century, to be taken by freemen of the Plymouth Colony, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; a freeman was any {{established}} member of a colony who was not under <b>legal</b> restraint. The <b>Oath</b> was a vow to defend the Commonwealth, and not to conspire to overthrow the government. It was first written in 1631, and revised in 1634. Original copies survive only in a handwritten copy from 1634 and in a later printed version from 1647. Stephen Daye made a broadside printing of the document in 1639, but it is now lost.|$|R
500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes. On {{the criminal}} law side, they supported reducing {{the use of the}} death penalty, although [...] "wilful murderers" [...] were still to be executed, and the abduction of a child under 16 was to be considered a capital crime. They also suggested allowing prisoners access to lawyers in any case where the prosecution was permitted representation and allowing witnesses for the defence to give evidence under <b>oath.</b> <b>Legal</b> aid was also considered, although the rejection of a case where legal aid was given would result in the defendant being sent to a workhouse for a month and whipped. The abolition of peine forte et dure as a way to avoid the forfeiture of land was also proposed.|$|R
