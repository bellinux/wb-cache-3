5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own <b>levelling</b> mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. <b>Levelling</b> the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, <b>levelling</b> could be carried out on the ground and then left alone.

The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour.

50|$|Critical care {{nurses in}} Australia {{do not need}} to have extra {{training}} than regular RNs do unless they have completed a postgraduate qualification. Therefore, their salaries are usually similar. Pay <b>levels</b> in nursing are bases on the position/level and experience. The average salary are approximately $55,617 for <b>level</b> 1.1, $57,841 for <b>level</b> 1.2, $60,155 for <b>level</b> 1.3, $62,561 for <b>level</b> 1.4, $65,063 for <b>level</b> 1.5, $67,666 for <b>level</b> 1.6, $70,373 for <b>level</b> 1.7, $73,187 for <b>level</b> 1.8, $75,488 for <b>level</b> 2.1, $77,028 for <b>level</b> 2.2, $78,600 for <b>level</b> 2.3 and $80,204 for <b>level</b> 2.4.

5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic. This group's structures were built using a different method {{from those in the}} Central Group, and were made out of compacted clay without stone construction or facing. The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow the contours of the natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial <b>levelling.</b> In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a <b>levelling</b> and bonding force between the two.|$|E
5|$|The club spent £1,400 {{appointing}} {{designers to}} oversee the excavation and <b>levelling</b> of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest {{part of the new}} ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures.|$|E

For example, <b>levels</b> 1-1 to 1-4 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 4-1 to 4-4, but <b>level</b> 4-5 is added. <b>Levels</b> 4-1 to 4-5 are repeated as <b>levels</b> 7-1 to 7-5, but <b>level</b> 7-6 is added.

5|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} is fairly well understood by historians. The {{patron of the}} aqueduct– a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself– would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for <b>levelling,</b> {{and a set of}} measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} level up their Warden {{character}} by earning experience points through completing quests and defeating enemies. Each time the player levels up, they receive three points {{to spend on}} the character's six attributes. Strength inflicts more damage, dexterity helps evade attacks more often, willpower increases stamina, magic increases spell damage or magic defense, cunning improves combat tactics, and constitution helps withstand attacks. Special skills, which are divided into four different aspects for each class, and specialization options, which offer class-specific skills, can also be unlocked by <b>levelling</b> up.|$|E
5|$|On Midway Atoll, {{collisions}} between Laysan albatross {{and aircraft}} {{have resulted in}} human and bird deaths as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations. Studies {{were made in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds, the <b>levelling</b> and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts and the destruction of annual nesting sites. Tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed 3000 birds in flight collisions during 1964–1965 before the towers were taken down. Closure of Naval Air Facility Midway in 1993 eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft. Recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths, though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to poison birds by ingestion. Albatross plumes were popular in the early 20th century. In 1909 alone over 300,000 albatrosses were killed on Midway Island and Laysan Island for their plumes.|$|E
50|$|These <b>levels</b> are {{classified}} as <b>Level</b> 1, <b>Level</b> 2 or <b>Level</b> 3.

5|$|Ronny Deila's first {{competitive}} {{match in}} charge of Celtic was a Champions League qualifying tie away against KR Reykjavik on 15 July 2014, which ended in a 1–0 win with midfielder Callum McGregor scoring the decisive goal on 84 minutes. Celtic eased to a 4–0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given a reprieve when {{it was discovered that}} Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszynski coming on as a substitute in the last four minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game a 3–0 to Celtic, <b>levelling</b> the aggregate score at 4–4 and seeing the Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2–1 on aggregate to drop down to the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with <b>levelling</b> data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century, <b>levelling</b> off after the famine of 1595, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century. Calculations based on Hearth Tax returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously effected by the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.|$|E
