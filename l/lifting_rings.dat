40|$|The {{recovery}} and conservation of historic aircraft, particularly from submarine environments {{in places like}} Micronesia, is fraught with complexities both political and technical. It is easy to underestimate these difficulties, with catastrophic results. Work currently underway by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, the United States Navy, and other partners on a rare dive bomber in Jaluit Lagoon, Republic of the Marshall Islands, exemplifies these difficul-ties and means toward their resolution. The waters of Micronesia are littered with air-craft wrecks, part of the detritus of World War II. Although many are fragmented {{as a result of}} the way they crashed, the damage they sus-tained in combat before crashing, or post-crash movement on the bottom, erosion in the surf, ^or exposure to an oxidizing environment, some are still relatively intact. These intact wrecks are especially attractive to divers, and they are tempting targets for recovery by mu-seums and collectors. It is easy, if one does not the matter too much consideration, to think that recovering an airplane from the bottom of a lagoon ought to be pretty easy. Make sure it’s detached from the bottom, float a barge over it with a crane, hook the crane to the <b>lifting</b> <b>rings</b> that many aircraft have, or to slings that you work in underneath to cradle the wings and fuselage, and lift away.

40|$|During {{fiscal year}} 1999, {{a total of}} nine 18 -inch {{diameter}} test canisters were fabricated at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to represent the standardized Department of Energy (DOE) Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) canister design. Various &# 34;worst case&# 34; internal loadings were incorporated. Seven of the test canisters were 15 -foot long and weighed approximately 6000 pounds, while two were 10 -foot long and weighed 3000 and 3800 pounds. Seven of the test canisters were dropped from thirty feet onto an essentially unyielding flat surface {{and one of the}} test canisters was dropped from 40 -inches onto a 6 -inch diameter puncture post. The final test canister was dropped from 24 inches onto a 2 -inch thick vertically oriented steel plate, and then tipped over to impact another 2 -inch thick vertically oriented steel plate. This last test was attempting to represent a canister dropping onto another larger container such as a repository disposal container. All drop testing was performed at Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). The nine test canisters experienced varying degrees of damage to their skirts, <b>lifting</b> <b>rings,</b> and pressure boundary components (heads and main body). However, all of the canisters were shown to have maintained their pressure boundary (through pressure testing), and the four worst damaged canisters were also shown to be leaktight (via helium leak testing performed at the INEEL). Pre-drop and post-drop test canister finite element modeling was performed at the INEEL in support of the canister drop test program. All model evaluations were performed using the ABAQUS/Explicit software. The finite element models representing the test canisters accurately (though at times, slightly conservatively) predicted the actual test canister responses during the defined drop events. This paper will discuss highlights of the drop testing program and will give detailed comparisons of analysis versus actual test results...|$|E

40|$|The National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP), {{operating}} from the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), developed the standardized Department of Energy (DOE) {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) canister. This canister {{is designed to be}} loaded with DOE SNF (including other radioactive materials) and then be used during interim storage, during transportation to the nation’s repository, and for final disposal at the repository without having to be reopened. The canister has been fully designed and has completed significant testing that clearly demonstrates that it can safely achieve its intended design goals. During 1999, nine 457 -mm diameter test canisters were fabricated at the INEEL to represent the standardized DOE SNF canister design. Various &# 34;worst case&# 34; internals were incorporated. Seven of the test canisters were 4. 57 m long and weighed approximately 2721 kg, while two were 3. 00 m long and weighed approximately 1360 kg and 1725 kg. Seven of the test canisters were dropped from 9 m onto an essentially unyielding flat surface and one of the test canisters was dropped from 1 m onto a 15 -cm diameter puncture post. The final test canister was dropped from 61 cm onto a 50. 8 mm thick vertically oriented steel plate, and then fell over to impact another 50. 8 mm thick vertically oriented steel plate. This last test represented a canister dropping onto another larger container such as a repository disposal container or waste package. The 1999 drop testing was performed at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The nine test canisters experienced varying degrees of damage to their skirts, <b>lifting</b> <b>rings,</b> and pressure boundary components (heads and main body). However, all of the canisters were shown to have maintained their pressure boundary (through pressure testing). Four heavily damaged canisters were also shown to be leaktight via helium leak testing. Pre- and post-drop finite element (FE) analyses were also performed. The results clearly indicated that accurate predictions of canister responses to the drop tests were achieved. The results achieved for the standardized canister can also be applicable to other well-constructed containers (canisters, casks, cans, vessels, etc.) subjected to similar loads. Properly designed containers can maintain a containment system after being subjected to dynamically induced high strains and FE computer analyses can accurately predict the resulting responses...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document the structural adequacy of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) in two separate normal configurations for the 40 -year interim period in the storage tubes at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). The two configurations apply when the lower MCO is arranged with (1) just a shield plug mechanical closure or (2) with the canister cover welded over the shield plug. Multiple analyses have been conducted to show the MCO design is adequate for drop events involving a lower, passive MCO being struck by an overhead drop load MCO both in vertical position. Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with cover cap. This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage. The force between the two MCOs created by a drop event far exceed that resulting from stacking two loaded MCOs. The stacking load condition is not a structural concern and is, therefore, acceptable for the design duration of 40 years of storage. Both mechanical and welded cap models have the <b>lifting</b> <b>ring</b> and associated flat plate for the top unit to rest on and, therefore, easily fit together. Both designs were analyzed for the top unit to be dropped onto the lower unit. The mechanical seal unit only has high localized stress.

Both designs will still be adequate for leakage and pressure during passive storage and are acceptable for the design duration of 40 years...|$|R

40|$|Elliptic curves over number {{fields with}} CM {{can be used}} to design non-isogenous {{elliptic}} cryptosystems over finite fields efficiently. The existing algorithm to build such CM curves, so-called the CM field algorithm, is based on analytic expansion of modular functions, costing computations of O(2 5 h= 2 h 21 = 4) where h is the class number of the endomorphism ring of the CM curve. Thus it is effective only in the small class number cases. This paper presents polynomial time algorithms in h to build CM elliptic curves over number fields.
