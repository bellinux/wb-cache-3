However, building ex vivo ERG apparatus requires substantial amount of time, resources and expertise. Here we adapted a commercial in vivo ERG system for transretinal ERG recordings from rod and cone photoreceptors and compared rod and cone signaling between ex vivo and in vivo environments. We found that the rod and cone a- and b-waves recorded with the transretinal ERG adapter and a standard in vivo ERG system are comparable to those obtained from live anesthetized animals. However, ex vivo responses are somewhat slower and their oscillatory potentials are suppressed as compared to those recorded in vivo. We found that rod amplification constant (A) was comparable between ex vivo and in vivo conditions, ∼ 10 – 30 s− 2 depending on the choice of response normalization. We estimate that the A in cones is between 3 and 6 s− 2 in ex vivo conditions and by assuming equal A in vivo we arrive to <b>light</b> <b>funnelling</b> factor of 3 for cones in the mouse retina.

They are stronger, resist stress easier, and form their own support elements. Also, the low-temperature formation of the spicules, as compared to the high temperature stretching process of commercial fibre optics, allows for the addition of impurities which improve the refractive index. In addition, these spicules have built-in lenses in the ends which gather and focus light in dark conditions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} application of ultrafast spectroscopy to the investigation of pigment-protein complexes (PPCs) involved in energy transfer and energy dissipation in photosynthetic organisms. PPCs are {{the building blocks of}} all photosynthetic organisms, and within individual pigment-protein complexes, energy transfer dynamics occur over fast timescales and broad spectral regions. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the capability of photosynthetic organisms to absorb <b>light</b> energy, <b>funnel</b> this energy to a location for charge separation, and perform charge separation with subsequent conversion into chemical energy. All of these functions need to be performed efficiently under different light conditions. This chapter also includes a discussion of the different light harvesting strategies that various photosynthetic organisms have evolved. Lastly, this chapter discusses {{the application of}} ultrafast spectroscopy as an excellent tool to study the dynamics of PPCs. The three experimental techniques used in this dissertation are introduced in this chapter. Chapters 2 and 3 present the application of two ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, two dimensional electronic spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy, to the investigation of the structure-function relationship of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. Chapter 2 is an investigation of the photophysics of the two forms of the Orange Carotenoid Protein, involved in excess energy dissipation in cyanobacteria. Ultrafast spectroscopy allows us to understand how a conformational change that modifies pigment-protein interactions is able to generate a different biological function. Chapter 3 presents degenerate and non-degenerate two dimensional electronic spectroscopy experiments to investigate the energy transfer dynamics and couplings in the bacterial reaction center, which is the location of charge separation. Chapter 4 investigates a PPC involved in excess energy dissipation in green algae, LhcSR. Fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy is used to investigate the excited state properties of LhcSR, which plays a role as light harvester, pH sensor and quencher in algae. The results allow us to identify two conformations, a light harvesting one and a quenching one. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the energy transfer pathways involved in quenching in the two different conformations. Finally, Chapter 5 presents conclusions and extensions to future work, in order to improve our understanding of the energy transfer dynamics in natural photosynthetic systems...|$|R

Nature has also developed in plants and photosynthetic bacteria several examples of photonic nanostructures which guide light over small distances and harvest light energy, using resonance energy transfer (RET).

Recent progress in the application, creation and manipulation of individual or small groups of molecules are opening new perspectives for further developments in this field.

Although the definitions of nanotechnology are diverse, it is commonly admitted that this new domain of Science draws ideas and concepts from disciplines including engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and computer science. The central dogma of the "bottom up" version of nanotechnology is the notion of self-assembly, which is the spontaneous assembly of materials into predetermined ordered structures or complexes.

For their resident endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, {{primarily from the}} genus Symbiodinium spp., this represents a photic environment that varies ~ 15 fold in intensity and also differs in spectral composition. We examined photosynthesis in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata in shallow (3 m) and mesophotic settings (65 m) in the northern Red Sea. Symbiodinium spp. in corals originating from the mesophotic environment consistently performed below their photosynthetic compensation point and also exhibited distinct light harvesting antenna organization. In addition, the non-photochemical quenching activity of Symbiodinium spp. from mesophotic corals was shown to be considerably lower than those found in shallow corals, showing they have fewer defenses to high-light settings. Over a period of almost four years, we extensively utilized closed circuit Trimix rebreather diving to perform the study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that shallow corals (3 m) transplanted to a deep reef environment (65 m) maintained their initial Symbiodinium spp. community (clade A), rather than taking on deep low-light clades (clade C), demonstrating that shallow S. pistillata acclimate to low-light mesophotic environments while maintaining their shallow photosynthetic traits. Mesophotic corals exhibited static depth-related chlorophyll content per cell, a decrease in PSI activity and enhanced sigmoidal fluorescence rise kinetics. The sigmoidal fluorescence rise kinetics we observed in mesophotic corals {{is an indication of}} energy transfer between photosynthetic units.
