5000|$|In December 2007, a <b>local</b> <b>DA</b> councillor, Frank Martin, {{allegedly}} encouraged local {{families to}} occupy newly built N2 Gateway houses in Delft in the Western Cape. After over 1,000 backyarders {{from the area}} occupied the houses, a high profile political fight between ANC and DA leaders ensued, each accusing the other of racism, playing party politics, and using the poor for their own gain. The ANC along {{with a number of}} civil society organisations such as the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers accused the DA of either instigating or tacitly approving of Martin's role in the invasions. [...] Judge Van Zyl of the Cape Town High Court ruled to evict residents and also faulted Frank Martin for instigating the occupation. Criminal charges against Martin were later dropped. On 18 February 2009, a City of Cape Town disciplinary committee found Martin guilty of encouraging people to invade homes at Delft and was suspended for one month. A further political spat ensued after February 2008 between the DA and the Delft-Symphony Anti-Eviction Campaign, which accused the DA of favouring its party supporters. In response, Zille denied this, and pointed out that the City of Cape Town had responded to the crisis by providing comprehensive services to the Delft evictees.|$|E

Most image watermarking resynchronization schemes in litera-ture can survive individual global DAs (e. g., rotation, scaling, translation, and other affine transforms), but few are resilient to challenging cropping and <b>local</b> <b>DAs.</b> The main reason is that robust features for watermark synchronization are only globally invariable rather than locally invariable. In this paper, we present a blind image watermarking resynchronization scheme against local transform attacks. First, we propose a new feature transform named local daisy feature transform (LDFT), which is not only globally but also locally invariable. Then, the binary space parti-tioning (BSP) tree is used to partition the geometrically invariant LDFT space. In the BSP tree, the location of each pixel is fixed under global transform, local transform, and cropping. Lastly, the watermarking sequence is embedded bit by bit into each leaf node of the BSP tree by using the logarithmic quantization index modu-lation watermarking embedding method.

Os dados foram obtidos por meio de Inquérito de Morbidade Referida, constituído por perguntas relacionadas ao atleta, modalidade e referentes ao tipo, mecanismo e <b>local</b> <b>da</b> lesão. A análise entre variáveis antropométricas e presença de lesão foi realizada pelo teste t de Student ou pelo teste não paramétrico de Mann Whitney. Para relação entre as especificidades e o tipo, mecanismo e <b>local</b> <b>da</b> lesão, utilizou-se o teste de Goodman. Resultados significantes foram obtidos entre os atletas lesionados com mais idade e anos de treinamento.

O diagnóstico das complicações foi clínico e baseado nos sinais e sintomas. Avaliou-se 196 pacientes do sexo feminino e 54 do sexo masculino, com idades variando entre 25 e 79 anos, no Hospital Militar de Buenos Aires. Foram tratados com laser de diodo de alta potência de 810 nm de longitude de onda mediante um sistema de fibras óticas semi-rígidas de quartzo de 400 e 600 µm e ponta de contato plana em modo cirúrgico contínuo. Para análise estatística, foram calculadas as percentagens. RESULTADOS: Lesões tipo queimadura foram observadas em 3, 2 %, hiperpigmentação em 9, 6 %, fibrose no <b>local</b> <b>da</b> safena por mais de 6 meses em 5, 6 % e neurite do nervo safeno em 4, 8 %. CONCLUSÃO: Conclui-se que o tratamento com laser endovascular de varizes de membros inferiores não é desprovido de intercorrências e que os fatores que levaram a essas complicações devem ser identificados e reavaliados. OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study is to report the complications seen in the endovascular laser treatment of varicose veins of the lower limbs. METHODS: From June 1999 to December 2002, 250 patients submitted to the endovascular treatment of varicose veins of the lower limbs using lasers and suffering from complications, such as skin burns, saphenous neuritis, hyperpigmentation and fibrosis along the course of the saphenous vein, were assessed. The diagnosis of the complications was made clinically based on the signs and symptoms evidenced. Of the 250 patients, aged 25 - 79 years, treated in the Hospital Militar de Buenos Aires, 196 were female and 54 were male. High power 810 nm wavelength laser diodes were applied using semi-rigid 400 and 600 -micron fiber-optic quartz systems in continuous contact with the skin. Percentages were used for statistical analysis. MRESULTS: Burn-type injuries were observed in 3. 2 % of cases, hyperpigmentation in 9. 6 %, fibrosis along the course of the saphenous vein over at least 6 months in 5. 6 % and saphenous neuritis in 4. 8 %.
