5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the <b>laser</b> a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in <b>laser</b> design, so LLNL began a <b>laser</b> development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the <b>laser</b> teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from thermonuclear bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the <b>laser</b> team were now able to deliver.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely <b>laser</b> beam welding and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes {{that have become}} quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. <b>Laser</b> beam welding employs a highly focused <b>laser</b> beam, while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both <b>laser</b> beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, <b>laser</b> cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered <b>laser</b> action in xenon, and later found that the <b>laser</b> gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer <b>laser</b> used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The <b>laser</b> data from <b>laser</b> range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional <b>laser</b> data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from <b>laser</b> data can be used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E

It employed a lidar sensor and (unlike the <b>laser</b> ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior) was able to activate brakes for deceleration. However, because of <b>laser</b> technology limitations, it would deactivate in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|LLNL {{had begun}} {{exploring}} different {{solutions to the}} <b>laser</b> problem while the system was first being described. In 1996 they built a small testbed system known as the Mercury <b>laser</b> that replaced the flashtubes with <b>laser</b> diodes.|$|E

40|$|Temperature-dependent {{intrinsic}} modulation {{response of}} InAs/InAlGaAs quantum-dash <b>lasers</b> was investigated by using pulse optical injection modulation {{to minimize the}} effects of parasitics and self-heating. Compared to typical quantum-well <b>lasers,</b> the quantum-dash <b>lasers</b> {{were found to have}} comparable differential gain but approximately twice the gain compression factor, probably due to carrier heating by free-carrier absorption, as opposed to stimulated transition. Therefore, the narrower modulation bandwidth of the quantum-dash <b>lasers</b> than that of quantum-well <b>lasers</b> was attributed to their higher gain compression factor. In addition, as expected, quantum-dash <b>lasers</b> with relatively long and uniform dashes exhibit higher temperature stability than quantum-well <b>lasers.</b> However, the <b>lasers</b> with relatively short and nonuniform dashes exhibit stronger temperature dependence, probably due to their higher surface-to-volume ratio and nonuniform dash sizes. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
