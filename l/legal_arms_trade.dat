40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War has {{increased}} {{the relative importance of}} economic causes and consequences of arms transfers. Unfortunately, there is surprisingly little theoretical and empirical development of the economics of <b>arms</b> <b>trade,</b> making it a sub-field of defense economics ripe for foundational contributions. We offer some preliminary steps in this direction by applying simple international trade models to the <b>arms</b> <b>trade.</b> Fields other than economics have made major contributions to our understanding of arms transfers. We review the sub-literature on arms transfers and foreign policy leverage as well as the sub-literature on the relationship between <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> and war. The central problem of the <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> literature, for both economists and geopolitical scientists, is how to go beyond the proliferation of (albeit useful) policy position articles, to a more solid base of theoretical and empirical models. A new theoretical synthesis of economics and geopolitics would represent a major breakthrough, but the development of the economics of <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> must move beyond its incipient stages for this synthesis to occur. Ultimately, it would be desirable to see theoretical and empirical work on the <b>arms</b> <b>trade,</b> narrow the range of outcomes which are regarded as plausible. ...|$|R

The study provides an overview of the <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> and its human cost as well as the powers, functions and practices of the United Nations Security Council. It argues that the unregulated global <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> is a threat to international peace and security and therefore calls on the Security Council to determine it as such.

We proceed in two steps. First, we measure the extent of missing <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> on the basis of official trade statistics. We construct a measure of the gap in <b>arms</b> <b>trade</b> based on the discrepancy between the value of arms exports reported by the exporting country and the value of arms imports recorded by the importing country. Second, we uncover the link between refugee movements and missing <b>arms</b> <b>trade.</b> Refugee flows, by reducing the ability of the receiving country to patrol its borders and its customs, are found to be correlated with arms smuggling across the border into the importing country.
