5|$|After game 5, Fischer hinted to <b>Lombardy</b> about a {{surprise}} {{he had in}} store for game 6.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{reference}} {{is part of}} a polemic against the moral decay of Florence, <b>Lombardy,</b> and the Italian Peninsula as a whole; Dante, through his characters, chastises German King Albert I for neglecting his responsibilities towards Italy ("you who are negligent"), and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in <b>Lombardy.</b> History records the name of the family Montague as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the Capulets as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in <b>Lombardy</b> as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona. Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving ("One lot already grieving") because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.|$|E
5|$|Mario Balotelli {{was born}} in Palermo, Sicily {{as the son of}} Ghanaian immigrants. The family moved to Bagnolo Mella in the {{province}} of Brescia, <b>Lombardy,</b> when he was two.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 2015 the American biographical film Pawn Sacrifice was released, {{starring}} Tobey Maguire as Fischer, Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, Lily Rabe as Joan Fischer, and Peter Sarsgaard as William <b>Lombardy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Il Lombardia (also {{known as}} the Giro di Lombardia or the Tour of <b>Lombardy)</b> was a one-day cycling classic that took place around Lake Como in <b>Lombardy</b> in {{northern}} Italy on 4 October 2015. It was the 109th edition of the Il Lombardia one-day cycling race and was the final cycling monument of the 2015 season, {{as well as being}} the final race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The race was organised by RCS Sport, who also organise the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|Charles demanded {{not only}} the {{surrender}} of <b>Lombardy,</b> but also of Burgundy and Provence, forcing Francis to argue that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of Parlement, which would not be forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, <b>Lombardy,</b> Veneto, Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Apulia, and Calabria, {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|Spassky's {{seconds for}} the match were Efim Geller, Nikolai Krogius and Iivo Nei. Fischer's second was William <b>Lombardy.</b> His entourage also {{included}} lawyer Paul Marshall, who {{would play a}} significant role in the events surrounding the match, and USCF representative Fred Cramer. The match referee was Lothar Schmid.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Mazzini {{was born}} into a working-class family in Busto Arsizio, <b>Lombardy.</b> The family moved to work in Cremona in her childhood. She listened to American rock and roll and jazz records and was a {{frequent}} visitor at the Santa Tecla and the Taverna Messicana clubs of Milan, both known for promoting rock and roll. After finishing high school in 1958, she attended college where she majored in accounting.|$|E
5|$|Astana raced a light {{schedule}} in the fall, with {{the pinnacle of}} their season having come at the Tour de France. The team sent squads to the Clásica de San Sebastián, Vattenfall Cyclassics, the GP Ouest-France, the Giro dell'Emilia, the GP Beghelli, the Giro del Piemonte, and the Giro di Lombardia. Their best results from this crop of races came from Alexander Vinokourov, who finished seventh in <b>Lombardy</b> and fifth in the Giro dell'Emilia.|$|E
5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and <b>Lombardy.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Lombardy</b> {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 Italian Grand Prix (formally the LXXI Gran Premio Campari d'Italia) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 2000 at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza near Monza, <b>Lombardy,</b> Italy. It was {{the fourteenth}} {{race of the}} 2000 Formula One season and the 71st Italian Grand Prix. The 53-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after {{starting}} from pole position. Mika Häkkinen finished second in a McLaren car with Ralf Schumacher third for the Williams team.|$|E
5|$|The Interzonal tournament {{was held}} in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified {{to play in this}} event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, Benko (and the reserve <b>Lombardy)</b> gave up his spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|This victory {{contributed to}} a general Allied {{breakthrough}} in the area, and by 19 April, the 6th Division's armour was moving towards <b>Lombardy</b> and Venetia {{as part of the}} Fifth Army's vanguard. American and Polish troops entered Bologna on 21 April. The South Africans and Rhodesians advanced north-west towards the Panaro river. The Special Service Battalion's Rhodesian squadron, moving forward alongside the Cape Town Highlanders, and the Rhodesians of Prince Alfred's Guard took part in numerous engagements with the retreating German rearguard, and suffered several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|In July 1956, Fischer won the U.S. Junior Chess Championship, scoring 8½/10 at Philadelphia {{to become}} the youngest-ever Junior Champion at age 13. At the 1956 U.S. Open Chess Championship in Oklahoma City, he scored 8½/12 to tie for 4–8th places, with Arthur Bisguier winning. In the first Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal 1956, he scored 7/10 to tie for 8–12th places, with Larry Evans winning. In November, Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington, D.C., tying for second with William <b>Lombardy,</b> Nicholas Rossolimo, and Arthur Feuerstein, with Hans Berliner taking first by a half-point.|$|E
5|$|Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, {{a former}} {{high-ranking}} {{officer in the}} army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, began his work in 1796– a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth. At that time he went to Paris, and later, Milan, where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland. Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of <b>Lombardy.</b> This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian held out, making {{another attempt}} to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into {{negotiations}} with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to {{the remainder of the}} Imperial possessions in <b>Lombardy</b> (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return to the status quo of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521–26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.|$|E
5|$|The European {{powers were}} locked in {{internal}} conflicts: e.g. the war in <b>Lombardy.</b> Skanderbeg believed {{that the threat of}} Mehmed launching his withheld European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice to prepare for a new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice withheld an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti-Ottoman coalition to halt any future Turkish expansions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William <b>Lombardy.</b> His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of <b>Lombardy.</b> Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{coronation}} {{took place}} on 2 December 1804. Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony: a golden laurel wreath recalling the Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown. Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings. For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath. Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David. Napoleon was also crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of <b>Lombardy,</b> at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from amongst his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Marengo was {{the victory}} that sealed {{the success of}} Bonaparte's Italian {{campaign}} of 1800 and is best understood {{in the context of}} that campaign. By a daring crossing of the Alps with his Army of the Reserve (officially commanded by Louis Alexandre Berthier) in mid-May 1800 almost before the passes were open, Bonaparte (who crossed on a mule) had threatened Melas's lines of communications in northern Italy. The French army then seized Milan on 2 June, followed by Pavia, Piacenza and Stradella, <b>Lombardy,</b> cutting the main Austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the Po river. Bonaparte hoped that Melas's preoccupation with the Siege of Genoa, held by General André Masséna, would prevent the Austrians from responding to his offensive. However, Genoa surrendered on 4 June, freeing a large number of Austrians for operations against the French.|$|E
5|$|White was {{initially}} {{enrolled at the}} <b>Lombardy</b> Street Public School. After completing his grammar schooling, he matriculated at the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in 1853. Founded by the Society of Friends (Quakers), the ICY emphasized high moral standards for its students and offered a classical study of Latin, Greek, and trigonometry. While enrolled, White expressed an acute awareness of black society and psychological concepts in essays he presented. On May 24, 1855, he addressed Governor James Pollock at a special reception for the institute, touching {{on the issue of}} African American citizenship. The same year, White was elected secretary of the Banneker Institute, a student instructional society that convened weekly to have scholarly discussions. White was his class's lone graduate from the ICY on May 6, 1857; he earned praise for his popularity among classmates and professors alike.|$|E
5|$|Metternich {{continued}} {{negotiations with}} the French envoy Caulaincourt through early to mid March 1814, when victory at the Laon put the Coalition back on the offensive. By this time Metternich was tiring of trying to hold the Coalition together, and even the British-engineered Treaty of Chaumont did not help. In {{the absence of the}} Prussians and Russians the Coalition agreed to the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty. Francis rejected a final plea from Napoleon that he abdicate in favour of his wife, and Paris fell on 30 March. Military manoeuvres had forced Metternich westward to Dijon on 24 March and now, after deliberate delay, he left for the French capital on 7 April. On 10 April he found a city at peace and, much to his annoyance, largely in the control of Tsar Alexander. The Austrians disliked the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau that Russia had imposed on Napoleon in their absence, but Metternich was reluctant to oppose them and on 11 April signed the treaty. Thereafter he focused on safeguarding Austrian interests in the forthcoming peace; asserting Austria's influence in Germany over that of Prussia; and undoing Russian ascendancy. For these reasons he ensured that the Italian provinces of <b>Lombardy</b> and Venetia, lost to French client states in 1805, were duly re-annexed.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Solferino (Franco-Austrian War) in 1859, the House of Savoy's Piedmont-Sardinia {{sided with}} the French Emperor Napoleon III against the Austrian Empire. Following Austria's defeat, <b>Lombardy</b> was ceded to France, who {{transferred}} <b>Lombardy</b> to Piedmont-Sardinia in return for Nice and Savoy.|$|E
25|$|Mantua, {{although}} a constituent province of <b>Lombardy,</b> still remained under the Austrian Empire along with Venetia. In 1866, Prussia-led North German Confederation {{sided with the}} newly established, Piedmont-led Kingdom of Italy against the Austrian Empire. The quick defeat of Austria led to its withdrawal of the Kingdom of Venetia (including the capital city, Venice). Mantua reconnected with the region of <b>Lombardy</b> and was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E

25|$|Milan is {{the capital}} of the eponymous {{administrative}} province and of <b>Lombardy,</b> one of the twenty regions of Italy. While the Province of Milan has a population of 3,195,211, making it the second most populated province of Italy after Rome, <b>Lombardy</b> {{is by far the most}} populated region of Italy, with more than ten million inhabitants, almost one sixth of the national total. The seat of the regional government is Palazzo Lombardia that, standing at , is the second tallest building in Milan.|$|E
25|$|Valentino {{was born}} in Voghera, in the {{province}} of Pavia, <b>Lombardy,</b> Italy. He became interested in fashion while in primary school in his native Voghera, <b>Lombardy,</b> northern Italy, when he apprenticed under his aunt Rosa and local designer Ernestina Salvadeo, an aunt of noted artist Aldo Giorgini. Valentino then moved to Paris to pursue this interest {{with the help of his}} mother Teresa de Biaggi and his father Mauro Garavani. There he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne.|$|E

25|$|While Rome is Italy's {{political}} capital, Milan is the country's {{industrial and}} financial heart. With a 2010 GDP estimated at €132.5 billion, {{the province of}} Milan generates approximately 9% of the national GDP; while {{the economy of the}} <b>Lombardy</b> region generates approximately 20% of Italy's GDP (or an estimated €325 billion in 2010, roughly the size of Belgium). The province of Milan is home to about 45% of businesses in the <b>Lombardy</b> region and more than 8 percent of all businesses in Italy, including three Fortune 500 companies.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Mantua became Italian Capital of Culture. In 2017, Mantua {{will also}} be European Capital of Gastronomy, {{included}} in the Eastern <b>Lombardy</b> District (together with the cities of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona).|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{research}} at the University of California-Davis and Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige found Nebbiolo {{to be related to}} Piedmont by way of two aromatic grape varieties — the Freisa grape of Piedmont and the French Rhone variety Viognier. This research would further suggest a parent-offspring relationship between Nebbiolo and several Italian grapes including Freisa, Bubbierasco, Nebbiolo Rosé, and Vespolina of the Piedmont region, and the <b>Lombardy</b> grapes Negrara and Rossola nera. Additional DNA analysis also suggest a parent-offspring relationship with the <b>Lombardy</b> grape Brugnola, previously thought to be only a synonym for the Emilia-Romagna grape Fortana.|$|E
