40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{exploitation}} of pelagic sharks by European fisheries. Fisheries for basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) and porbeagle (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> were well established in northern areas (e. g. off Norway) in the early 20 th century. Although targeted fisheries for basking shark have now ceased, porbeagle is still taken in locally important directed fisheries in the Celtic Sea. Tuna and billfish fisheries, which expanded in recent decades, harvest shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), blue shark (Prionace glauca), {{and a variety of other}} pelagic sharks, with some of these fisheries targeting sharks at certain times/areas. Prior to the late 1990 s, most European nations reported catches as “sharks not elsewhere identified”, and only in recent years has species-specific data become available. There is currently little biological sampling of commercial pelagic shark catches by fisheries laboratories, although there are some tag and release programmes for sharks. In recent years, the ICES Working Group on Elasmobranch Fishes has begun to collate available data on landings and from other data sources, and a brief overview of progress to date is given.

40|$|Abstract Age {{estimation}} is {{an issue}} for the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, because of dis-agreement on vertebral band-pair deposition periodicity. In the 1950 s– 1960 s, thermonuclear testing released large amounts of radiocarbon into the atmosphere, which diffused into the ocean through gas exchange. This influx created a time-specific marker {{that can be used}} in age val-idation. Annual band-pair deposition in the por-beagle, <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus,</b> was validated in a previous study and indicated preliminary annual deposi-tion in the shortfin mako, using four samples from one vertebra. In the present study, age estimates from 54 shortfin mako vertebrae collected in 1950 – 1984 ranged 1 – 31 years. Ageing error be-tween readers was consistent, with 76 % of the estimates ranging within 2 years.

40|$|Growth {{parameters}} {{were estimated}} for porbeagle shark (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> {{in the northwest}} Atlantic Ocean {{on the basis of}} vertebral annuli.

Males and females grew at similar rates until the size of male sexual maturity, after which the relative growth of the males declined. The growth rate of the females declined in a similar manner at the onset of maturity. Growth curves were consistent with those derived from tag/recapture analyses (GROTAG) of 76 recaptured fish, and with length-frequency methods using measurements from 13, 589 individuals. Von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (combined sexes) were: L ¥ = 289. 4 cm fork length, K = 0. 07 and t 0 =- 6. 06.

40|$|Reproductive organs from 393 {{male and}} 382 female {{porbeagles}} (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus),</b> {{caught in the}} western North Atlantic Ocean, were examined to determine size at maturity and reproductive cycle. Males ranged in size from 86 to 246 cm fork length (FL) and females ranged from 94 to 288 cm FL. Maturity in males was best described by an inflection in the relationship of clasper length to fork length when combined with clasper calcification. Males matured between 162 and 185 cm FL and 50 % were mature at 174 cm FL. In females, all reproductive organ measurements related to body length showed a strong inflection around the size of maturity.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of rostral morphology of extant mackerel sharks (Lamniformes, Lamnidae) is presented. Based on computed tomography (CT) scans of fresh specimens, 3 D reconstructions, dried museum chondrocrania and the available literature, detailed morphological descriptions of the rostral cartilages are provided for the type species of all three extant lamnid genera, namely Carcharodon carcharias (Linnaeus, 1758), Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1810 and <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus</b> (Bonnaterre, 1788), and {{compared with those of}} I. paucus Guitart Manday, 1966 and L. ditropis Hubbs & Follett, 1947. Despite intraspecific variation, the rostral cartilages of all extant lamnids present significant differences that allow genusand species-level identification, which is especially of use to identify fossil rostral nodes of these particular taxa. The main differences were found to be in overall calcification of the rostrum (Lamna > Isurus > Carcharodon), general configuration of the rostral open space, position of the base of the lateral rostral cartilages, (non-) abutting lateral cartilages, (absent) rostral keels and shape of the rostral node.

40|$|A {{variety of}} data types are {{available}} {{for the assessment of}} the Northwest Atlantic porbeagle shark (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> population. I describe an age- and sex-structured population dynamics model that fits to catch-at-length data and catch-per-unit-effort data from the fishery. This model provides an ideal environment for the exploration of the available data as it links the data via a dynamic model. This allows one to look for inconsistencies among data types and may provide insights into both population and fleet dynamics. A model of this general type could also be used in the formal assessment of the stock and has the advantage that by including much of available data into the estimation procedure, it may overcome some confounding from estimating key parameters outside of the model. A number of possible disadvantages of this approach are also discussed. Given the low fecundity of porbeagle sharks it is possible to derive spawner recruitment parameters from biological data, thus overcoming a common problem associated with forward projection models. I show how it is also possible to integrate mark-recapture data into the assessment model to improve the estimation of both annual and age-specific fishing mortalities.

40|$|Despite their notoriety {{and role}} as apex predators, the {{longevity}} of large pelagic sharks such as the porbeagle (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is unknown. Vertebral growth bands provide an accurate indicator of age in young porbeagle, but age validation has never been reported for any large shark species {{past the age of}} sexual maturity. Here, we report the first application of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation method for longlived sharks based on date-specific incorporation of radiocarbon into vertebral growth bands. Our results indicate that porbeagle vertebrae recorded and preserved a bomb radiocarbon pulse in growth bands formed during the 1960 s. Through comparison of radiocarbon assays in young, known-age porbeagle collected in the 1960 s with the corresponding growth bands in old porbeagle collected later, we confirm the validity of porbeagle vertebral growth band counts as accurate annual age indicators to an age of at least 26 years. The radiocarbon signatures of porbeagle vertebral growth bands appear to be temporally and metabolically stable and derived mainly from the radiocarbon content of their prey. Preliminary radiocarbon assays of shortfin mako vertebrae suggest that current methods for determining shortfin mako age are incorrect...|$|E
40|$|The Porbeagle Shark (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> is a {{remarkable}} fast, large shark that has adapted to cold waters in {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere through heat exchangers that keep its body warmer than surrounding waters. Its extensive range includes the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, South Pacific, South Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Like other sharks, it is part of an ancient lineage stretching back more than 200 million years. Its evolutionary fine-tuning hasn’t protected it, however, from a literal feeding frenzy – by humans on sharks. The Porbeagle has suffered staggering declines as a result of fishing. In the Northeast Atlantic, European fishing fleets decimated this shark’s populations within a few decades, starting in the 1930 s. But what happened in the Northwest Atlantic was the eyeopener. Norwegian fishing vessels then turned their sights to the west in 1961. Within just six years the Porbeagle Shark stock in the Northwest Atlantic was destroyed. After the stock started to rebound a few decades later, the Canadians thought they would try their luck, focusing on Porbeagle starting in the 1990 s.

In addition, the fossil rostral nodes have been compared in detail with Recent material of both the porbeagle, <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus</b> (Bonnaterre, 1788) and the salmon shark, Lamna ditropis Hubbs and Follet, 1947.

These partially preserved rostra are likely to have belonged to extinct taxa within the families Lamnidae or Otodontidae, both of which have been documented from the Yorktown Formation on the basis of isolated teeth of at least three species, Cosmopolitodus hastalis (Agassiz, 1838), Megaselachus megalodon (Agassiz, 1835) and Parotodus benedenii (Le Hon, 1871) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{domestic}} fishery for pelagic sharks {{has been}} developing in Atlantic Canada since 1990. Landings consist primarily of three species, porbeagle (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus),</b> shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and blue (Prionace glauca) sharks. A small but increasing quantity is landed as unspecified sharks. Porbeagle sharks are caught primarily in a directed longline fishery while shortfin makos are caught primarily as by-catch in the swordfish longline fishery. Small quantities of all three species are landed as by-catch in other fisheries. Although blue sharks are a significant by-catch in the swordfish and tuna longline fisheries, landings come primarily from a developing directed longline fishery. This developing fishery has been limited by market. Landings in 1994 totalled 1545 t of porbeagle, 157 t of shortfin mako, 113 t of blue, and 107 t of unspecified sharks. Fisheries regulations were amended in 1994 to permit the management of this fishery. A management plan, announced in July 1994, established precautionary catch levels, {{a limited number of}} exploratory licenses, gear restrictions, a prohibition on ‘finning ’ and submission of logbooks.

Shark fins usually enter international trade with their skin still intact and can be identified using morphological characters or standard DNA-barcoding approaches. Once they reach Asia and are traded in this region the skin is removed and they are treated with chemicals that eliminate many key diagnostic characters and degrade their DNA ("processed fins"). Here, we present a validated mini-barcode assay based on partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I gene that can reliably identify the processed fins of seven of the eight CITES listed shark species.

40|$|The {{porbeagle}} (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> {{is a large}} fast-swimming pelagic shark {{found at}} high latitudes in both hemi-spheres. To examine the influence of temperature on porbeagle distribution, {{a detailed analysis of}} the rela-tionship between catch rate, temperature, depth and location was carried out based on 420 temperature profiles taken during commercial fishing operations. More than half of the porbeagle were caught at tem-peratures of 5 – 10 C (at the depth of the hook); the mean temperature at gear of 7. 4 C differed very little among seasons. Most of the spring fishing took place near fronts, although the affinity with fronts was not evident in the fall. Temperature at depth was a sig-nificant modifier of catch rate when included in a generalized linear model controlling for the effects of location, fishing vessel, month and year. However, sea surface temperature was a poor predictor of catch rate. The similarity between environmental and catch-weighted cumulative distribution functions confirmed suggestions that fishers sought out the most appropri-ate temperature range in which to set their gear. As porbeagle are among the most cold tolerant of pelagic shark species, we suggest that they have evolved to take advantage of their thermoregulating capability by allowing them to seek out and feed on abundant coldwater prey in the absence of non-thermoregulat-ing competitors. Key words: catch rate, cumulative distribution function, distribution, migratio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —A virgin {{population}} of porbeagles <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus</b> {{in the northwest}} Atlantic Ocean supported annual catches of up to 9, 000 metric tons (mt) in the early 1960 s before the fishery collapsed in 1967. Low and apparently sustainable catches of about 350 mt in the 1970 s and 1980 s allowed the stock to partially rebuild before a new fishery arose in the early 1990 s. The response of the population to this renewed fishing pressure has been unclear until now. However, a new population dynamics analysis suggests that population abundance has once again declined. On the basis of more than 140, 000 length measurements, an extensive catch rate index, a confirmed growth model, and a catch-at-age matrix, it appears that at least 90 % of the sexually mature population has been lost as fishing mortality has increased. Independent measures of fishing mortality (F) based on Petersen analysis of tag-recaptures, Paloheimo Zs, and a population model all suggest that fishing mortality was about 0. 20 in 2000. Biological reference points based on life table analysis indicate that fishing at F 0. 1 5 0. 18 will result in population collapse, that F 5 0. 08 corresponds to zero population growth, and that fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield is about 0. 04.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1889 Van Beneden {{described}} a new tetraphyllid cestode, Dinobothrium septaria, {{for which he}} erected a new genus. It was peculiar in having a rather small body with a very large scolex, the largest of all tapeworm holdfasts. Since then {{a small number of}} other species of Dinobothrium have been described (for two of them new genera were proposed, viz. Gastrolecithus Yamaguti, 1952 and Reesium Euzet, 1955). They have only been found in large sharks, both in preying and in plankton feeding species. Mola (1907) was the first investigator who found such a tapeworm in the Basking Shark, Cetorhinus maximus (Gunnerus). Euzet (1955) has tried to elucidate the remarkable and confused history of these animals. He recognized three genera and only three species, viz. Dinobothrium septaria van Beneden from <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus</b> (Bonnaterre), Gastrolecithus planus (Linton) and Reesium paciferum (Sproston) both from Cetorhinus maximus (Gunnerus). Some incidental finds from other sharks have a doubtful status. The most remarkable fact is that these three species with similar scolices were placed in three different families: Dinobothrium septaria in the family Phyllobothriidae, Reesium paciferum in the family Prosobothriidae, while Euzet proposed a new family, Gastrolecithidae, for Gastrolecithus planus. However, it is the opinion of the present author that this view will not generally be accepted. It is improbable that the characteristic scolices would have evolved in three families. In the present paper Gastrolecithus planus is recorded from Cetorhinus maximus captured in the North Sea near the Dutch coast. Gastrolecithus planus (Linton, 1922...|$|E

The largest global stocks of this low productivity shark have experienced historical extent of declines to < 30 % of historic baseline as a result of unsustainable target and bycatch fisheries driven largely or partly by international trade demand for its high value meat. These stocks are now under management in some EEZs, but the greatest continuing threat to this species is the unsustainable harvesting elsewhere that supplies international trade in meat and fins. Annex 2 a B: It is known, or can {{be inferred}} or projected, that regulation of trade in the species is required to ensure that the harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued harvesting or other influences. Based on past fisheries ' development to meet international trade demand, including shifting of effort from Northeast to Northwest Atlantic stocks, and a rapid recent rate of decline in catch per unit effort data for some southern stocks, it can be projected that other southern hemisphere populations for which stock assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} and management of sharks on a species-specific basis is a pressing need because of the escalating demand for shark fins and the recognition that individual shark species respond differently to exploitation. Difficulties with the identification of many commonly fished sharks and their body parts {{has resulted in a}} global dearth of catch and trade information, making reliable assessment of exploitation effects and conservation needs for individual species nearly impossible. We developed and tested a highly streamlined molecular genetic approach based on species-specific, polymerase-chain-reaction primers in an eight-primer multiplex format to discriminate simultaneously between body parts from six shark species common in worldwide pelagic fisheries. The species-specific primers are based on DNA sequence differences among species in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus. The primers and multiplex format accurately and sensitively distinguished samples from each of three lamnid (Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, and <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus)</b> and three carcharhinid (Prionace glauca,Carcharhinus obscurus, and Carcharhinus falciformis) species from all but one other shark species encountered in the North Atlantic fishery. Furthermore, the three lamnid primers were robust enough in their discriminatory power to be useful for species diagnosis on a global scale. Preliminary testing of dried fins from Asian and Mediterranean commercial markets suggests that our genetic approach will be useful for determining the species of origin of detached fins, thus allowing the monitoring of trade in shark fins for conservation assessment. Our approach will also facilitate detection of products from protected and other at-risk shark species and may prove useful as a model for development of the high-throughput, genetic, species-diagnosis methods typically required in {{conservation and}} management contexts...|$|E
40|$|Many sharks {{have life}} history {{characteristics}} (e. g., slow growth, late age at maturity, low fecundity, and long gestation periods) that make their populations vulnerable to collapse due to overfishing. The porbeagle (<b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus),</b> bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), and smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena), are all commercially exploited. The population genetic structure {{of these species}} was assessed based on globally distributed sample sets using mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequences and/or nuclear markers. Complex patterns of evolutionary and demographic history were inferred using coalescent and statistical moment-based methods. All four species showed statistically significant genetic partitioning on large scales, i. e., between hemispheres (L. nasus mtCR φST = 0. 8273) or oceanic basins (C. leucas nuclear FST = 0. 1564; S. mokarran mtCR φST = 0. 8745, nuclear FST = 0. 1113; S. zygaena mtCR φST = 0. 8159, nuclear FST = 0. 0495). Furthermore, S. zygaena mtCR sequences indicated statistically significant matrilineal genetic structuring within oceanic basins, but no intrabasin structure was detected with nuclear microsatellites. S. mokarran showed statistically significant genetic structure between oceanic basins with both nuclear and mitochondrial data, albeit with some {{differences between the two}} marker types in fine scale patterns involving northern Indian Ocean samples. A microsatellite assessment of C. leucas demonstrated no population structuring within the Atlantic or Indo-Pacific, with the exception that samples from Fiji were differentiated from the remaining Indo- Pacific Ocean locations. In contrast, the L. nasus mitochondrial and nuclear ITS 2 sequences revealed strong northern vs. southern hemispheric population differentiation, but no differentiation within these hemispheres. These geographic patterns of genetic structure were used to determine the source of fins obtained from the international fin trade and to develop forensic tools for conservation...|$|E
40|$|Many {{vertebrates}} have an ocular skeleton {{composed of}} cartilage and/or bone situated within the sclera of the eye. In {{this study we}} investigated whether modern and fossil sharks have an ocular skeleton, and whether it is conserved in morphology. We describe the scleral skeletal elements of three species of modern sharks and compare them {{to those found in}} fossil sharks from the Cleveland Shale (360 Mya). We also compare the elements to contemporaneous arthrodires from the same deposit. Surprisingly, the morphology of the skeletal support of the eye was found to differ significantly between modern and fossil sharks. All three modern shark species examined (spiny dogfish shark Squalus acanthias, porbeagle shark <b>Lamna</b> <b>nasus</b> and blue shark Prionace glauca) have a continuous skeletal element that encapsulates much of the eyeball; however, the tissue composition is different in each species. Histological and morphological examination revealed scleral cartilage with distinct tesserae in parts of the sclera of the porbeagle and blue shark, and more diffuse calcification in the dogfish. Strengthening of the scleral cartilage by means of tesserae has not been reported previously in the shark eye. In striking contrast, the ocular skeleton of fossil sharks comprises a series of individual elements that are arranged in a ring, similar to the arrangement in modern and fossil reptiles. Fossil arthrodires also have a multi-unit sclerotic ring but these are composed of fewer elements than in fossil sharks. The morphology of these elements has implications for the behaviour and visual capabilities of sharks that lived during the Devonian Period. This {{is the first time that}} such a dramatic variation in the morphology of scleral skeletal elements has been observed in a single lineage (Chondrichthyes), making this lineage important for broadening our understanding of the evolution of these elements within jawed vertebrates...|$|E
