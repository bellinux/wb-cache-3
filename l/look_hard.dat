500|$|Simonsohn urged {{researchers}} to <b>look</b> <b>hard</b> for confounding variables in field data analysis. An {{example of a}} confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters [...] "Den" [...] compared to with [...] "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, {{and more likely to}} be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more [...] "Den" [...] dentists than [...] "Wal" [...] than implicit egotism.Using both a different data set (TwitterandGoogle+accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} edit of {{the music}} video begins with a message to those fans that sent in their videos; [...] "Thank you {{to all those who}} chose to share their stories with the world." [...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you <b>look</b> <b>hard</b> enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of me about my race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the sofa, with tears in her eyes, as they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E
2500|$|George W. Bush won the 2000 U.S. presidential election, and Truesdale {{signaled}} {{that he would}} resign his seat on the Board in order to permit Bush to appoint his own chairperson. [...] But there was concern that if Truesdale stepped down right away, the Board would lack a quorum {{until such time as}} the Senate confirmed Bush's new appointees. Subsequently, Truesdale delayed his resignation from the NLRB. As Bush's nominee for chair, Peter Hurtgen, was confirmed on May 15, 2001, but Truesdale remained on the Board to help the agency maintain its quorum. As his tenure as chair came to a close, Truesdale publicly urged Hurtgen and future NLRB chairs to <b>look</b> <b>hard</b> at existing precedent to ensure Board decisions met the needs of the modern workplace and to continue to keep the backlog of cases low.|$|E

60|$|The {{bell was}} {{answered}} by Louisa--Louisa <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at Mrs. Lecount. The luncheon {{was brought up}} by the house-maid--the house-maid <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at Mrs. Lecount. When luncheon was over, the table was cleared by the cook--the cook <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at Mrs. Lecount. The three servants were plainly suspicious that something extraordinary {{was going on in}} the house. It was hardly possible to doubt that they had arranged to share among themselves the three opportunities which the service of the table afforded them of entering the room.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at {{the captain}}, {{and the captain}} <b>looked</b> <b>hard</b> at the stranger, the obscurity rendering a pretty close scrutiny necessary, to enable either to distinguish features.

60|$|Like his opulent fellow-traveler, he too had his canine {{follower}} and retainer--and one {{suited to}} his different fortunes--one of the civilest, most unoffending little {{dogs in the}} world. Unlike the lordly mastiff, he seemed to think he had no right on board of the steamboat; if you did but <b>look</b> <b>hard</b> at him, he would throw himself upon his back, and lift up his legs, as if imploring mercy.|$|E
