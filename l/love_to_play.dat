5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months after}} Chilton's death, Hummel {{died of cancer}} on July 19, 2010. Asked about the band's plans {{after the death of}} Chilton and Hummel, Stephens told Billboard, [...] "It's music we all really <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> and we <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it together, so we're trying {{to figure out a way}} forward where we can keep doing it." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview, Stephens said that the May 2010 tribute {{performance}} would be the group's final show as Big Star, although not his last show with Auer and Stringfellow, stating, [...] "I can't see us going out as Big Star... But I would hate to compound the loss of Alex by saying,'That's it' for Ken and Jon, too. I can't imagine not playing with them. There's so much fun—but an emotional bond there too." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the finale}} aired, Pinkner stated in an {{interview}} that [...] "one of the things we <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with is the notion of choice versus fate/synchronicity. Clearly, what Peter did {{at the end of that}} episode is that he fundamentally changed the future. Our team is [...] on a separate path. It is unlikely that we’ll get to that specific outcome in 2026. But are events like what happened in Detroit inevitable in any version of the future? TBD." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, McCoy said {{he would}} stay at Texas for his senior year instead of leaving for the 2009 NFL Draft. McCoy was quoted as saying, [...] "I'm going to play here for four years. I've been blessed {{to be able to}} play here. Not very many people get to [...] here for four years, so what an opportunity. And if the NFL is there for me, then I hope that I'll get to keep playing, because I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this game. Hopefully, it will work out." ...|$|E
500|$|Horowitz {{stated that}} {{everyone}} they initially wanted {{cast in the}} series accepted their offered role after being sent a script. Ginnifer Goodwin was cast as Snow White, who appreciated {{that she would be}} playing a strong character that was fleshed out for the audience. The actress had just completed her work on the series Big Love, and was looking for a new project; she turned to television after film scripts failed to interest her. Having said previously in interviews that she would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Snow White, Goodwin called her acceptance of the role [...] "a no-brainer." [...] Both Kitsis and Horowitz are self-described big fans of Big Love, and wrote the part of Snow White with Goodwin in mind.|$|E
500|$|Fanning {{worked with}} {{producer}} Tchad Blake and {{was funded by}} record label Dew Process. Sessions for the album began in February 2005 when Fanning and several other musicians recorded tracks at Blake's Brisbane studio. Four of these—"Not Finished Just Yet", [...] "Believe", [...] "Wash Me Clean", and [...] "Hope & Validation"—appeared on the album after being mixed by Blake. The other tracks were recorded and mixed at Real World Studios near Bath, England. In Bath, Fanning worked with musicians including Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood. While writing Fanning listened to music of guitarists Lightning Hopkins, Tom Petty, and singer-songwriter Gillian Welch, who all influenced his work. [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> guitar like that, but I simply don't have the skill to do it", said Fanning of Hopkins' work.|$|E

500|$|In 1986, Ponting said: [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for Australia [...] I {{look up to}} David Boon because he's {{from here}} [...]" [...] During Tasmanian Sheffield Shield matches at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground (NTCA Ground), Ponting served as a {{scoreboard}} assistant, thereby surrounding himself with first-class and international cricketers. After leaving school {{at the end of}} year 10 as a 16-year-old in 1990, he began work as a groundsman at Scotch Oakburn College, a private school in Launceston. In 1991, the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association sponsored Ponting so that he could attend a fortnight's training at the Australian Institute of Sport's Cricket Academy in Adelaide. The two weeks turned into a full two-year scholarship as he was acclaimed to be the best 17-year-old batsman Academy coach Rod Marsh had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Cissé's {{performances}} made Panathinaikos fans love him. He had {{stated that}} after making the double in Greece he would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{again in the}} Champions League with Panathinaikos {{and looking for a}} successful season also in Greece. On 30 October 2010, he scored two goals (one penalty) in the Derby of the eternal enemies against arch-rivals Olympiacos in a 2–1 home win. At the MVP award ceremony for the 8th fixture, Cissé said [...] "I am not only a player of Panathinaikos, but I am also a fan." [...] In the new season, he has already scored 18 goals in 20 matches in the Greek League and one goal in the Greek Cup. He was also the team captain of Panathinaikos and the most valuable player of the club.|$|E

He was made a life member of the Melbourne Football Club during 2008. White was delisted from Melbourne following the 2008 season, but has stated that he hopes to play on for one or two more seasons at another AFL club: [...] "From a personal point of view, I still feel like I've got some time left." [...] His preference would have been to continue at Melbourne, saying, [...] "I love the club and would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on" [...] but that he [...] "totally understands" [...] his delisting. Dean Bailey spoke highly of White's leadership at Melbourne, saying that White will leave a lasting legacy at the club.|$|E

500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career-high 34 passes for 322 yards. [...] "Joe {{was the kind of}} guy you'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> your whole career with," [...] said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. [...] "He was older when we got him, but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard." [...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36.|$|E

In February 2014, Arundhati said she [...] "would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a role like Sridevi’s in Moondram Pirai". Sridevi's performance in the film was included in The Times of Indias 2015 list, [...] "Sridevi: 5 times the actress bowled us with her performance". Although no print of Moondram Pirai has survived, the film is still available on home video. Balki mentioned in an April 2016 interview with Indo-Asian News Service, that Moondram Pirai [...] "tremendously influenced" [...] him as a filmmaker. Writer K. V.

500|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver {{continued}} the enormous success of its predecessors, beginning {{the formation of}} Pokémon into a multi-billion dollar franchise. As of April 2000 roughly 6.5 million copies of the games had been sold in Japan. Silver {{proved to be the}} slightly more popular version, edging out Gold by approximately 100,000 copies. By the first week of their release in the U.S.A. the games had eclipsed Pokémon Yellow's previous record sales of a little over 600,000 copies; selling a combined total of 1.4 million copies to become the fastest selling games ever. The commercial success was expected, as Peter Main, the executive {{vice president of sales and}} marketing, stated [...] "There's no question about it; kids <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Pokemon. So far in 2000 the best-selling game in America for any home console is Pokemon Stadium for [...] Nintendo 64, and the best-selling game for any handheld video game system is Pokemon [...] Yellow for Game Boy Color, but Pokemon [...] Gold and Silver will eclipse even those impressive sales totals. We project sales of 10 million units total of these two games in less than six months time". By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units sold.|$|E
500|$|Reimer was {{selected}} by the Red Deer Rebels in the fifth round of the 2003 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft, with a pick that originally belonged to the Spokane Chiefs. The team drafted Reimer largely on the word of a single scout, Carter Sears. [...] After Reimer performed poorly during his first training camp with the club, Rebels head coach Brent Sutter wanted to release him, but Sears was persistent in his support for Reimer. Reimer made the club in his third attempt after having been cut the previous two seasons. [...] His first season in the WHL was a poor one for the Rebels. [...] Reimer played 34 games, recording only 7 wins. [...] Reimer broke his hand late in the season, an injury which cost {{him a chance to}} play for Team Canada at the 2006 IIHF World U18 Championships. [...] Reimer {{was selected}} by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the fourth round (99th overall) of the 2006 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft. [...] John Ferguson, Jr., the Maple Leafs general manager at the time, remembers Reimer as an unfinished product needing time to develop, being [...] "somewhat raw". [...] At the time of the draft, Reimer was preparing for his high school graduation, and did not attend the event in Vancouver, British Columbia. [...] He said, [...] "I made a decision not to pay a lot of attention because I was reluctant to get my hopes too high." [...] His agent, Ray Petkau, called with the news about being drafted and later brought him his Maple Leafs jersey and hat that draftees receive. [...] Prior to the draft, Reimer had mentioned {{that he would like to}} be drafted by the Los Angeles Kings, saying [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> hockey in all that sunshine." ...|$|E
500|$|Auburn University {{running back}} Bo Jackson was {{selected}} with the Buccaneers' first overall {{pick in the}} draft, but refused to sign with them. Jackson was angry with the Buccaneers after accepting a private jet ride to attend a team workout caused him to lose his eligibility to play baseball at Auburn. Although NCAA rules allow a professional athlete to compete collegiately in a different sport, stricter Southeastern Conference rules disqualify a professional athlete from competing in any college sports. Jackson accused the Buccaneers of sabotaging his college baseball career, although Phil Krueger insisted that the SEC had advised them that the flight was allowable, {{and that it was}} Jackson himself who had insisted on using a private flight. Jackson had been rated as the best running back prospect to come out of college since O.J. Simpson 17 years earlier. Jackson was said to have ridiculed Tampa Bay's offensive line, and shortly before the baseball draft to have told two teams that {{he had no intention of}} playing football. Most teams did not believe him, but the Kansas City Royals, although they were unsure enough that they waited until the fourth round of the Major League Baseball Draft to select him. [...] Jackson vowed never to play football again and accepted an offer from the Royals worth much less than what the Buccaneers offered. The Buccaneers turned down several impressive trade offers for Jackson, including the San Francisco 49ers' offer of Ronnie Lott, Wendell Tyler, and first- and second-round draft picks. Jackson's statements about not playing football were contradictory, as he alternated between stating he didn't want to play at all and between saying he didn't want to play for a terrible team and organization like Tampa Bay. In his book, Jackson recalls a meeting with Al Davis where he said he liked Davis and told the Raider boss he would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for them, and that the Raiders made offers for the #1 pick to Tampa Bay that were spurned.|$|E

He later landed the role of Horatio Hornblower in Hornblower, the Meridian production of the C. S. Forester novels (1998–2003), shown on ITV1 and A. He has said: [...] "It was quite something for an unknown actor to get the lead. So I will always be grateful to Hornblower. ...
