This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales {{on the underside of the}} body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line crosswise.|$|E

And the flame was pretty hot, I can assure you. It induced in him a fierce inward restlessness both of activity and desire. Too fine in face, with a <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> in his chestnut hair, spare, long-limbed, with an eager glint in his steely eyes and quick, brusque movements, he made me think sometimes of a flashing sword-blade perpetually leaping out of the scabbard. It was only when he was near the girl, when he had her there to look at, that this peculiarly tense attitude {{was replaced by a}} grave devout watchfulness of her slightest movements and utterances. Her cool, resolute, capable, good-humoured self-possession seemed to steady his heart. Was it the magic of her face, of her voice, of her glances which calmed him so? Yet these were the very things one must believe which had set his imagination ablaze--if love begins in imagination. But I am no man to discuss such mysteries, and it strikes me that we have neglected poor old Nelson inflating his cheeks in a state of worry on the back verandah.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} frequency is not normally heard on acoustic guitars, classical guitars and other stringed instruments with {{one end of}} the strings anchored on a soundboard bridge which has a low profile, holding the strings close to the soundboard surface. In these cases, the lateral string vibration has no discernable effect on the bridge; instead, the bridge is excited by changes in string tension, which are twice the <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> frequency. On these instruments, listeners hear the first harmonic as the lowest note.

In the same fashion as compression driver phase plugs, the intent is to minimize higher-frequency wave interference near the driver. In this case, [...] "high frequency" [...] is relative to the intended bandpass; for example, a 12 in cone woofer might be expected to reproduce 550 Hz energy near the top of its intended range, however, the wavelength of 550 Hz is approximately twice the diameter of the woofer, so wave energy at that frequency traveling laterally {{from one side to the}} other will be out of phase and will cancel. With a phase plug in the center, such <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> energy bounces off of the obstruction and is reflected outward toward the listener. Phase plugs for woofer cones are typically solid plugs positioned over the woofer's central dust cap, or in the center of the woofer, replacing the dust cap.|$|E

Investigation of the {{influence}} of the spanwise and streamwise arrangement of the rectangular heaters on 3 -D structures, occurring at the film surface, is the main objective of the present work. Three-dimensional time-dependant mathematical model for calculation of gas-liquid interface deformations and evolution of temperature fields was developed. Our numerical investigations have shown that interaction, imposition and mutual influence of the 3 D structures (bumps, <b>lateral</b> <b>waves.)</b> takes place. In the case of streamwise arrangement of the heaters film rupture is most likely on the second heater.

40|$|In open channels, the {{transition}} from supercritical to subcritical flows is called a hydraulic jump. For low upstream Froude numbers, free-surface undulations develop downstream of the jump. Such a hydraulic jump is called an undular jump. More than 70 new experiments on undular hydraulic jumps were performed in a rectangular channel in which the upstream flows were fully developed turbulent shear flows. The experimental data include free-surface profiles, velocity distributions, pressure distributions and local head profiles upstream and downstream of undular jumps. Visual and photographic observations indicate five types of undular jumps. One of the main flow characteristics {{is the presence of}} <b>lateral</b> shock <b>waves</b> for Froude numbers larger than 1. 2. The analysis of the data shows that the energy dissipation occurs by the propagation of a train of stationary <b>waves,</b> <b>lateral</b> shock <b>waves</b> and a breaking mechanism at the first wave crest.

40|$|To respond {{appropriately}} {{to communication}} signals, animals {{must have the}} ability to decipher signal meaning. At a basic level, interpreting the difference between territorial and courtship signals can be vital for the survival and reproduction of social animals. Male and female fiddler crabs communicate with claw-waving displays, but the function of these waves remains uncertain. Species differ in the context in which they wave: Some wave during courtship, some during territorial defence and some during both. In this paper, we provide evidence that males of an Australian species of fiddler crab, Uca perplexa, use two different types of claw <b>waving</b> display, <b>lateral</b> and vertical. <b>Lateral</b> <b>waves</b> are employed solely in a courtship context, whilst vertical waves are employed during courtship as well as territorial interactions. Using video recordings, we show that <b>lateral</b> <b>waves</b> were produced spontaneously (broadcast), and their frequency increased only in the presence of female wanderers. Vertical waves were not broadcast but were elicited by male wanderers during agonistic interactions and female wanderers during close range courtship. Male resident U. perplexa were able to discriminate the sex of wandering crabs on the mudflat at distances of 32 cm. During all resident–wanderer interactions, residents attempted to maintain a position directly between the wanderer and the home burrow and orient themselves to face females and to present the major claw towards males.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} {{in detail the}} {{electromagnetic}} field excited by a horizontal electric dipole {{in the presence of}} a four-layered region, which consists of a perfect conductor, the two dielectric layers, and air above. From the derivations and analysis, it is seen that the electromagnetic field includes four wave modes: Direct wave, ideal reflected wave, trapped surface wave, and <b>lateral</b> <b>wave.</b> The wave numbers of the trapped surface wave, which are determined by the residues of the poles, are between the wave number k 0 in the air and k 2 in the lower dielectric layer. The lateral waves with the wave number being k 0 are determined by the integrations along the branch cuts. It should be pointed out that both the trapped surface wave and <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> can be separated into the electric-type terms and magnetic-type terms. Analysis and computations show that the trapped surface waves play major roles at large propagation distance when both the dipole point and the observation point are on or close to the air-dielectric boundary. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{reflection}} coefficient of GPR waves encountering embedded thin layers is commonly estimated using a plane wave, far field approximation. But when the thin layer {{is situated in}} the near field of the antenna, the spherical nature of the waves and the possible propagation of a <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> into the layer may have a strong influence on the measured reflected amplitude. In this work, we studied through 2 D FDTD simulations {{the behavior of a}} radar wave interacting with thin layers of different thicknesses. The snapshots and radargrams showed a large influence of the layer thickness on the wave propagation. For the very thin layers, the evanescent wave plays a major role and the plane wave approximation gives a good estimation of the {{reflection coefficient}}. For thicker layers, the specific inclination of each multiple reflection has to be taken into account, as well as the <b>lateral</b> <b>wave</b> propagation. On the basis of these observations, we determined which analytical method should be used for the analytical prediction of the reflection coefficient, {{as a function of the}} layer thickness.
