However, {{if there is a}} reason to speed project delivery, Fast-Track can be used with any project delivery strategy, such as CM at Risk and Agency CM (see Construction management), design-build, bridging and integrated project delivery. Even the traditional design-bid-build process can use Fast-Track concepts by bidding separate general construction contracts for phases of the work. However, many owners choose experienced project teams and consider the rewards to be well worth the risks. One source states that Fast-Track is used on 40 percent of building projects.|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{two-part tariff}} price structure (consisting of a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>price</b> and a linear marginal price) for drinking water in Germany {{does not reflect}} the cost structure reported in the literature. Recovering marginal costs from a sample of 251 German counties, we see that there are positive price–cost margins, while lump-sum prices are too low. A price-structure readjustment along welfare-economic principles (marginal cost pricing; <b>lump-sum</b> <b>price</b> ensures cost recovery) would increase the mean consumer surplus by 0. 037 % of the local GDP or € 2. 129 million per county, assuming a share of 15 % variable costs in total costs. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and applies {{a method}} of moments to {{estimate}} dynamic decision models with corner solutions. The method extends previous results by Hotz and Miller (1993) and Pakes (1994), and it allows for unobserved state variables affecting both the continuous choice (interior solution) and the discrete choice (interior solution / corner solution). The method is applied to estimate a model of price and inventory decisions using data of individual goods from a supermarket chain. The estimation shows that lump-sum ordering costs and <b>lump-sum</b> <b>price</b> adjustment costs are significant, but ordering costs are quantitatively more important. Numerical solutions of the model show that, in that context, the interaction between price and inventory decisions can explain the high frequency of nominal price reductions observed in the data.

40|$|Financial {{services}} are often provided to consumers {{over an extended}} period of time. In pricing these services, financial services marketers have the ability to charge lump-sum amounts in advance, of the time period during which the service will be provided, or to divide their prices into a sequence of payments extended over the length of the service agreement. Consumer perceptions of the offer and their subsequent expectations regarding service quality may be affected by the marketer 2 ̆ 7 s choice of divided or <b>lump-sum</b> <b>pricing.</b> Service quality expectations may be further affected by the reputation of the financial services provider and the risk associated with the financial transaction. The goal of this article is to explore the perceptual effects of divided versus <b>lump-sum</b> <b>pricing,</b> and potential interactions that may exist with company reputation and financial service risk. Using an experimental design, the results indicate that divided pricing has varying effects on consumer expectations of service quality, depending on firm reputation and the underlying risk associated with the financial service. The article concludes with a discussion of the findings and implications for practitioners and researchers...|$|R
40|$|The current <b>lump-sum</b> <b>pricing</b> of auto {{insurance}} is inefficient and inequitable. Drivers who {{are similar in}} other respects—age, gender, location, driving safety record—pay nearly the same premiums if they drive five thousand or fifty thousand miles a year. Just as an all-you-can-eat restaurant encourages more eating, all-you-can-drive insurance pricing encourages more driving. That means more accidents, congestion, carbon emissions, local pollution, and dependence on oil. This pricing system is inequitable because low-mileage drivers subsidize insurance costs for high-mileage drivers, and low-income people drive fewer miles on average. A better approach is simple and obvious: pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) {{auto insurance}}. With PAYD, insurance premiums would be priced per mile driven. All other risk factors will still be taken into account, so a high-risk driver would pay a greater per-mile premium than a low-risk driver. With insurance costs that vary with miles driven, people {{would be able to}} save money by reducing their driving, and this incentive would lead to fewer driving-related harms. PAYD would also be more equitable because it would eliminate the cross-subsidization of insurance costs from lowmileage to high-mileage drivers. Given these potential benefits, there has been increased interest in California recently i...|$|R
40|$|It is by {{now well}} known that the {{presence}} of small lump sum costs of adjusting prices can lead to nominal price rigidity. However, the argument of adjustment costs could equally well be applied to quantities, thereby leading to rigid quantities. This paper examines the importance of adjustment costs on both prices and quantities in a dynamic monopoly model, where the firm has to decide whether it uses price or quantity or both as the adjustment mechanism to shocks which can be permanent or temporary. It is shown that there is more downward rigidity than upward, and that this asymmetry is enhanced when the quantity adjustment costs consist of linear adjustment costs on top of the <b>lump-sum.</b> Furthermore, <b>prices</b> seem to bear a relatively larger proportion of the adjustment burden when the shock is 'large', and vice versa for quantities when the shock is 'small'. Finally, the firm may be rationed even when adjustment is carried out. Adjustment costs, price rigidity, rationing...|$|R
40|$|Construction Management (CM) is {{becoming}} the delivery method of choice for constructing complicated projects. Previously, the most common method to employ was the General Contracting method, where the contractor and designer were two independent entities and the project was awarded based on a competitive bid and a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>price.</b> Research has shown that a Construction Manager not only understands the professional knowledge required for a project but also bridges {{the gap between the}} contractor and designer and promotes cooperation between the two. This delivery method can decrease the project duration, provide flexibility, value engineering and decrease the total cost of the project while satisfying the owner's needs. Therefore, it is key to examine the different types of Construction Management (Agency CM or CM At-Risk) as well as to understand the role that a Construction Manager plays in this delivery method. The application of Construction Management {{in the construction of the}} Lamar Towers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia is also examined to exemplify the benefits that the method is providing. The interaction between the different parties and issues that the teams have to face on a daily basis are studied in this thesis. A risk/reward analysis is also presented. Finally, suggestions are brought forward to improve the different aspects of this specific delivery method. by Ronald Elie Kassouf. Thesis (M. Eng.)

We also present a framework for the negotiation of the joint-venture contract itself in each of the stages, including royalties, transfer <b>pricing,</b> <b>lump-sum</b> fees, or equity shares that stand for intangible assets brought in.

40|$|The low-bid method, {{typically}} used for competitive bidding in the United States, {{may result in}} a contract with a firm that submits either accidentally or deliberately an unrealistically low-bid price. Such an occurrence hurts both the owner and the contractor by promoting disputes, increased costs, and schedule delays. To address this problem, other countries have adopted bidding methods based on the average of the bids submitted. One such approach is the below-average method where the winning bid is closest to but below the average of all bids. A competitive bidding model for the below-average-bid method is presented and its merits relative to the average-bid method and the low-bid method are explored. The below-average-bid process is investigated analytically and through Monte Carlo simulation. The results of bidding models for the below-average, the average, and the low-bid methods are presented in four easy-to-use nomograms which allow contractors to determine the optimal <b>lump-sum</b> bid <b>price</b> for each method without the need for complicated analysis. A comparison of the three methods provides information and insights to help owners with the difficult choice of a suitable bidding method for the project at handPublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{increasing}} project complexity, constraints on programme schedule and limited budget, {{there exists a}} strong call for changes in contracting procedures in construction. Both the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and Target Cost Contracting (TCC) approaches with a gain-share/pain-share arrangement have been advocated to achieve better value for money and more satisfactory project performance. This paper aims to review the prevailing practices of GMP/TCC in general, and explore the motives and benefits of implementing the GMP/TCC scheme {{in comparison with the}} traditional fixed <b>price</b> <b>lump-sum</b> contract in particular. The research study is based on a comprehensive literature review and an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey for evaluating the relative importance of motives and benefits associated with GMP/TCC in Hong Kong. The survey data collected from 45 valid completed questionnaires were analysed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and one-way ANOVA test. The perceived benefits were measured and ranked from the perspectives of the client, contractor and consultant for cross-comparison. The survey findings indicated that the three most common motives of clients behind their decision of adopting GMP/TCC include: (1) to generate an incentive for contractor to achieve cost saving; (2) to develop better working relationship within the project team; and (3) to tap in contractor's expertise in design and innovation. The top three perceived benefits of applying GMP/TCC were found to be: (1) early settlement of final project account; (2) improved partners' working relationship under a partnering arrangement; and (3) capability of integrating contractor's expertise in building designs and innovations prior to construction. The research results are particularly essential in assisting key project stakeholders to realise the potential benefits derived from the use of GMP/TCC contracts and in generating more useful insights into alternative integrated contracting strategies for the construction industry, so as to drive for excellence in overall project performance. postprin...|$|R
