5|$|To {{cater to}} the heavy leisure traffic {{at the end of}} the 19th century, Cromer Beach had a large station {{building}} in a half-timbered style, and a large goods yard. The station originally included a bar, which was closed in 1966. Following the introduction of conductor-guard working, the ticket facilities were no longer needed and the building fell into disuse; it was renovated and reopened as a public house in 1998. A <b>large</b> <b>supermarket</b> was built on the site of the goods yards in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and proposals {{have been particularly}} controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and residential building on one block—which {{was not in the}} original plan and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal. The decision to allow a <b>large</b> <b>supermarket</b> branch to be built {{in the middle of the}} development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the film}} is set in the real-life city of Ueda. Ueda was chosen as the primary setting {{of the film}} because it is located in a {{territory}} formerly governed by the prominent Sanada clan, upon which the Jinnouchi family is based. Ueda is also close to Hosoda's birthplace in Toyama. Hosoda's inspiration for the name of the social network OZ came from a <b>large</b> <b>supermarket</b> that he once visited while still working for Toei Animation at the time. Although noting similarities between OZ and Second Life, Hosoda also cited the Japanese social networking website mixi as a primary influence because of his experiences. For the color and design of OZ, he cited Nintendo games as inspiration. The design aesthetic was compared by some reviewers to the appearance of OZ. Hosoda said that he admires the artwork of Takashi Murakami, but designed the social network as a [...] "clean, uncluttered look." [...] During production, Hosoda visited his then-fiancé's house in Ueda, and experienced the history of her family's life. Hosoda cited his influence of using a family as the basis of the film from his marriage and from attending several film festivals.|$|E

During the late 1990s, the UFW persuaded several <b>large</b> <b>supermarket</b> chains to sign a pledge in support of improved wages and working conditions for strawberry pickers.

2500|$|A public {{exhibition}} for {{the development}} (initially dubbed [...] "Sutton North Central" [...] but in later reports referred to as [...] "The Old Gasworks") was held in autumn 2012.

2500|$|In {{the event}} of a {{decision}} to re-open the section, the main obstacles that would {{stand in the way of}} the line following its original course would be the developments which have taken place along the line since its closure. At Forest Row, a fire station, community centre and other industrial units have been built on the site, the Grange Road station has been flattened and redeveloped with housing and shops. The East Grinstead A22 bypass, named [...] "Beeching Way" [...] after Dr Beeching, has taken one mile of the trackbed and the East Grinstead High Level station has been demolished. The M23 motorway cuts across the trackbed at Rowfant. At Three Bridges a Panel Signal Box is built on the site of the old junction with the Brighton Main Line. In Tunbridge Wells, although the original West station remains (now an American style restaurant), a <b>large</b> <b>supermarket,</b> petrol station and home improvement store now sit on the site of the old goods yard.
