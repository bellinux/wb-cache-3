25|$|Capitalization of answer letters is {{conventionally}} ignored; {{crossword puzzles}} are typically filled in, and their answer sheets are almost universally published, in all caps, {{except in the}} rare cases of ambigrams. This ensures a proper name can have its initial capital <b>letter</b> <b>checked</b> with a non-capitalizable letter in the intersecting clue. Diacritical markings in foreign loanwords (or foreign-language words appearing in English-language puzzles) are ignored for similar reasons.|$|R
50|$|Some {{papers have}} {{additional}} grid rules. In The Times, for example, all words {{have at least}} half the <b>letters</b> <b>checked,</b> and although words can have two unchecked squares in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word. The grid shown here breaks one Times grid rule: the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15. The Independent allows setters to use their own grid designs.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 ANR {{introduced}} a new computerised rollingstock tracking system, with the carriages awarded <b>check</b> <b>letters</b> following the first four letters of their names as the class; for example Yanni was officially known as YANN, with <b>check</b> <b>letter</b> K generated by the algorithm.|$|R

6000|$|She {{watched with}} {{peculiar}} interest one stratum: the old ladies, the white-haired, fair-handed women of fifty and sixty and even seventy, spinsters and widows, for whom life {{was nothing but}} a desk and a job of petty pickings--mailing circulars or assorting <b>letters</b> or <b>checking</b> up lists.

2500|$|In {{the hands}} of any but the most skilled constructors, the {{constraints}} of the American-style grid (in which every <b>letter</b> is <b>checked)</b> usually require a fair number of answers not to be dictionary words.

5000|$|The Creditor Reference is an {{alphanumeric}} string, up to 25 characters long, {{with the letters}} [...] "RF" [...] at the beginning. After the <b>letters</b> are two <b>check</b> digits, which confirm that the reference will be entered correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Jejeebhoy {{was known}} by the {{nickname}} [...] "Mr. Bottlewalla".

50|$|On 1 April 1864, {{the stamp}} was issued with the plate number {{engraved}} in the design, {{in the left}} and right side lace work. At this time, the stars in the top corners were also replaced with the same <b>check</b> <b>letters</b> as used in the lower corners, but in reverse order.|$|R
5000|$|Since January 2013, {{the format}} uses a letter after the current check character. This has the {{advantage}} that all current PPS numbers remain valid. The <b>letter</b> after the <b>check</b> character would have a weighting of nine. The letter value would be assigned {{the same as the}} check character's. A=1, B=2 ... W=0.|$|R
50|$|To ensure {{enforcement}} of these decisions, Monsignor Umberto Benigni organized, through his personal contacts with theologians, an unofficial group of censors who would report to him those {{thought to be}} teaching condemned doctrine. This group was called the Sodalitium Pianum, i.e. Fellowship of Pius (X), which in France was known as La Sapini√®re. It never had more than fifty members, but its frequently overzealous and clandestine methods, including opening and photographing private <b>letters,</b> and <b>checking</b> out {{the records of the}} local bookshop to see who was buying what, hindered rather than helped the Church's combat against Modernism.|$|R
2500|$|In cryptics, as {{fewer of}} the <b>letters</b> are {{typically}} <b>checked</b> and {{as there is}} usually no theme, grid construction is far easier, and the constructor focuses instead on {{the difficult task of}} creating clues that contain a straight definition, a cryptic definition, and a [...] "surface" [...] meaning (each clue must parse as a phrase).|$|R

500|$|There {{was also}} a letter of {{introduction}} for Martin from his putative commanding officer, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Chief of Combined Operations, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet and Allied naval commander in the Mediterranean. Martin was {{referred to in the}} letter as an amphibious warfare expert on loan until [...] "the assault is over". The document included a clumsy joke about sardines, which Montagu inserted {{in the hope that the}} Germans would see it as a reference to a planned invasion of Sardinia. A single black eyelash was placed within the <b>letter</b> to <b>check</b> if the Germans or Spanish had opened it.|$|R
5000|$|Cummins works {{mainly with}} printed matter, such as newspapers, <b>letters,</b> and <b>checks.</b> While {{initially}} {{she focused on}} everyday ephemera (self-described [...] "dumpster diving" [...] in Brooklyn), her later work turns to institutional collections, working to get readers to question their assumptions {{about the nature of}} historical authority, focusing on historical events such as the¬†Salem Witch Trials or disasters like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. This work focuses¬†particularly on [...] "social issues like women‚Äôs rights, race relations, human oppression and torture, poverty, identity, and mental illness," [...] and Cummins hopes to [...] "snare" [...] viewers by showing them familiar images before surprising them with new information.|$|R

5000|$|The {{results are}} added together, and divided by 23. The {{remainder}} (modulus 23) indicate the check character {{position in the}} alphabet. In the example above, 121 divided by 23 leaves a remainder of 6, and [...] "F" [...] is the sixth character in the alphabet. The correct PPS number is therefore 1234567FA. Where the remainder is zero, the <b>check</b> <b>letter</b> is W.|$|R
500|$|On November 21, the {{prosecution}} introduced the <b>letters,</b> telegrams, and <b>checks</b> into evidence. On November 22, Harland testified that Burton had stated: [...] "I {{am not going}} to do anything inconsistent with my duty as a Senator." [...] Mahaney testified to the in-person payment and the destruction of the letters at Burton's request on March 22, 1902. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton represented Rialto before him.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} a mad impulse seized me to cast away all restraint, to pour out the unspoken words that danced like imps in my brain, {{to make her}} understand, {{whatever}} the cost, my feelings towards her.

25|$|Since his {{beginnings}} as a geologist, George Poulett Scrope {{fostered a}} number of friendly relationships with some well-known natural philosophers. On his voyage and during the years since, Charles Darwin sent some <b>letters</b> to Scrope, <b>checking</b> certain geological observations and calculations he made, and made other general geology and scientific (in our modern terms) queries. These documents are mentioned by numerous sources, but were unavailable for review by this researcher.|$|R
2500|$|Crossword grids such {{as those}} {{appearing}} in most North American newspapers and magazines feature solid areas of white squares. Every <b>letter</b> is <b>checked</b> (i.e. is part of both an [...] "across" [...] word and a [...] "down" [...] word) and usually each answer must contain at least three letters. In such puzzles shaded squares are typically limited to about one-sixth of the total. Crossword grids elsewhere, such as in Britain, South Africa, India and Australia, have a lattice-like structure, with {{a higher percentage of}} shaded squares (around 25%), leaving about half the letters in an answer unchecked. For example, if the top row has an answer running all the way across, there will often be no across answers in the second row.|$|R
5000|$|Iiris {{finds out}} she is pregnant, but doesn't tell her family. She writes {{a letter to}} Aarne, {{thinking}} {{he might want to}} help raise the child. She goes to his workplace, hands him the letter, and leaves. Soon thereafter, Iiris receives a letter from Aarne that simply says, [...] "Get rid of the brat." [...] The letter also includes a check for 10,000 marks. Iiris becomes distraught and goes outside, leaving the <b>letter</b> and <b>check</b> on the table, where her mother finds them. While wandering around upset, Iiris is hit by a car and she has a miscarriage. Her stepfather visits Iiris in the hospital and tells her she must move out of the apartment, because she has disappointed her mother.|$|R
