The paper contains calculations and input data which are necessary for making a model that would predict <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> life cycle costs and determine the optimum period of durability. The suggested model might be used for working out life cycle costs of a new vehicle type for which the costs have not been determined yet. This model can also be applied when comparing several types of <b>motor</b> <b>land</b> <b>vehicles</b> of the same category during purchase. It is advisable to use the model mainly during tenders, since life cycle costs are one of the major criterion when selecting a supplier. The model enables us to calculate not only life cycle costs, but also vehicle amortization which depends upon mileage and age of a vehicle. All cumulative values might be transformed into unit values related to the mileage...|$|R
40|$|To meet {{several of}} her {{developmental}} requirements Kerala requires sufficient tax revenue mobilisation. This paper {{is an attempt to}} empirically estimate the effort taken by Kerala in mobilising tax revenues in relation to its taxable capacity during two different phases of the state’s economic growth trajectory: 1970 - 71 to 1999 - 00 and 2000 - 01 to 2012 - 13. Whereas the first period has experienced stagnant to moderate economic growth, the second period saw rapid economic progress. The findings of the paper reveal that though Kerala was able to improve the tax effort with respect to <b>land</b> revenue, <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> tax and passengers and goods tax, state excise duty and own tax revenue during the period of accelerated economic growth in the case sales tax, which contributes the lion’s share of the tax revenue, the state’s tax effort lowered significantly. Also, the state has earned lowest ranking based on the tax effort for many taxes when compared to other comparable states. On the whole, the findings of the study calls for policy measures aimed at improving Kerala’s tax effort on par with higher ranked states...|$|R

The progress does not only bring positive impact, but also negative impact for instance the rising of crime number i. e. <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery. The aims of this research are 1) mapping <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery data as the distribution map and identifying <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot base on distrbution map; and 2) studying the correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with physical environment phenomena, i. e. land use type and settlement pattern. The research method consists of two parts; they are <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis and the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery and physical environment analysis. <b>Motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis is using distribution data, which analyzes the distribution into <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with nearest neighbor tehnique. Contingency coefficient and frequency distribution analysis is {{used to analyze the}} correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot and physical environment. Contingency coefficient is used to study the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot polygon with physical environment condition, whereas frequency distribution is used to study the distribution of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery in the hot spot with physical environment condition. Physical environment which consists of land use type, housing density, house regularity pattern, and the average of building size, are obtained from interpretation of black and white panchromatic aerial photograph year 2000, in the scale 1 : 20. 000. the most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot is found on the settlement area, 68, 3 % from 378 <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cases in the hot spot.
