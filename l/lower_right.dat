5|$|The {{diagonal}} {{positioning of}} the metalloids represents {{an exception to the}} observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect can be seen in other diagonal similarities between some elements and their <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.|$|E
5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine.

5|$|Solutions to Apollonius' problem {{generally}} {{occur in}} pairs; for each solution circle, {{there is a}} conjugate solution circle (Figure6). One solution circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa. For example, in Figure6, one solution circle (pink, upper left) encloses two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate solution (also pink, <b>lower</b> <b>right)</b> encloses that third given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate solution circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E

5000|$|Also {{known as}} a foot stomp, this attack sees a wrestler stamp his foot on any part of a fallen opponent.

In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico.

A <b>right</b> <b>lower</b> lobectomy was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without complications. The gross specimen showed a massive cavitation with multiloculated cysts of varying size, consistent with CCAM, along with noticeable granulomatous inflammation.

5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E

As a launch promotion, Nintendo Europe also produced seven 24-carat gold plated Game Boy Advance SP consoles, with six given away to people who found a golden ticket inside their Triforce SP package, and a seventh as a magazine promotion.

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} in the <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance {{back at the}} viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

5|$|John McFall {{was born}} on 25 April 1981 in Frimley, Surrey, in England. Between 1994 and 1997 he {{attended}} school at Millfield in Street, Somerset, where as a teenager he was a runner and hockey player. In August 2000 while on a gap-year trip to Ko Samui, Thailand, after his A-levels, {{he was involved in}} a serious motorcycle accident. While riding a moped, he went round a corner too quickly and skidded. He put out his leg to stop the motorcycle from falling over, and smashed his knee. The motorcycle then fell on him, resulting in the chain severing major blood vessels in his leg. He was flown to a hospital in Bangkok, but as he had damaged his <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> leg too severely, it had to be amputated above the knee after three days. Upon returning to the UK, he spent about seven weeks undergoing rehabilitation at Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, London.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at <b>lower</b> <b>right)</b> by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space.

The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E

[...] On the Peplos Kore, there are bore holes in the <b>lowered</b> <b>right</b> arm and the bent left arm which suggest she held a bow and arrows or a shield and helmet.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} the position of sigmoid colon in children and discuss its clinical significance. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one contrast enema studies were retrospectively evaluated and the position of sigmoid colon categorized as below: Left <b>lower</b> quadrant, <b>right</b> <b>lower</b> quadrant, midline, and indeterminate. Results: The position of sigmoid colon in the <b>right</b> <b>lower</b> quadrant, left lower quadrant, midline, and indeterminate was 32 (35. 16 %), 33 (36. 26 %), 12 (13. 19 %), and 14 (15. 38 %), respectively. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in mean age (P = 0. 87) or gender prevalence (P = 0. 49) for different positions of the sigmoid colon. Conclusion: The sigmoid colon occupies the <b>right</b> <b>lower</b> quadrant in a large number of children.

40|$|Summary: Neurohormonal overactivation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in pulmonary hypertension (PH). In this context, renal denervation, which aims to inhibit the neurohormonal systems, may be a promising adjunct therapy in PH. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated in 2 experimental models of PH that renal denervation delayed disease progression, reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling, <b>lowered</b> <b>right</b> ventricular afterload, and decreased right ventricular diastolic stiffness, most likely by suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
