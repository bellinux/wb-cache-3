One third of patients with multisystem LCH are infants. In children with monosystem LCH we observed complete clinical response to first-line therapy. At the same time, complete response to polychemotherapy is observed only in 30 % of children with multisystem LCH. Prognosis of the disease depends on the initial affection of risk organs (bone marrow, liver, lungs, spleen), their dysfunction and the child’s age at the time of diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Multinucleated giant cell-containing tumors and pseudotumors of bone {{represent}} a heterogeneous group of benign and malignant lesions. Differential diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in instances of limited sampling. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the contribution of the P 63 in the positive and differential diagnosis of giant cell tumor of bone. Methods This study includes 48 giant cell-containing tumors and pseudotumors of bone. P 63 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Data analysis was performed using Epi-info software and SPSS software package (version 17). Results Immunohistochemical analysis showed a P 63 nuclear expression in all giant cell tumors of bone, in 50 % of osteoid osteomas, 40 % of aneurysmal bone cysts, 37. 5 % of osteoblastomas, 33. 3 % of chondromyxoide fibromas, 25 % of non ossifiant fibromas and 8. 3 % of osteosarcomas. Only one case of chondroblastoma was included in this series and expressed p 63. No P 63 immunoreactivity was detected in any of the cases of central giant <b>cell</b> granulomas or <b>langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> <b>histiocytosis.</b> The sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of P 63 immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of giant cell tumor of bone were 100 %. The specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 74. 42 % and 59. 26 % respectively. Conclusions This study found not only that GCTOB expresses the P 63 but it also shows that this protein may serve as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis between two morphologically similar lesions particularly in instances of limited sampling. Indeed, P 63 expression seems to differentiate between giant cell tumor of bone and central giant cell granuloma since the latter does not express P 63. Other benign and malignant giant cell-containing lesions express P 63, decreasing its specificity as a diagnostic marker, but a strong staining was seen, except a case of chondroblastoma, only in giant cell tumor of bone. Clinical and radiological confrontation remains essential for an accurate diagnosis. Virtual slides The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: [URL]. </p...|$|R

LCH is classified by its involvement of either a single organ system (SS-LCH) or multiple organ systems (MS-LCH) [1]. The latter form is frequent in children younger than 2 years, whereas SS-LCH is more common in children older than 2 years [2, 3]. This rare disease affects 4 – 9 children per million each year [4 - 6]. The liver, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) are considered high-risk organs for LCH [7, 8]. Therefore, LCH is also classified as involving at least one high-risk organ [LCH-risk organ (RO) (+) ] or a no high-risk organ [LCH-RO (−) ] [7]. Though most patients with LCH-RO (+) de-velop MS-LCH, some patients with the involvement of only one high-risk organ have a milder case, with symp-toms similar to those observed in SS-LCH [9, 10].
