40|$|A drift {{collection}} calorimeter {{having a}} combined radiator and field shaping structure made of lead glass tubing is described. With {{the aid of}} the EGS Monte Carlo code we show that such a device, when pressurized to 10 atmospheres, will give a resolution of a/E = 9. 6 %/E 1 j 2 provided that the shower is contained at a 99 % <b>level.</b> <b>Track</b> <b>length</b> restriction and Landau sampling have been included in the EGS simulation. In addition, leading particle biasing and weighting techniques have been employed {{for the first time with}} EGS, with an increase in efficiency of about 100 to 300 for 10 GeV shower containment calculations...|$|E

40|$|During {{the postwar}} period, many {{countries}} have de-tracked their secondary schools, {{based on the}} view that early tracking was unfair. What are the e ¢ ciency costs, if any, of de-tracking schools? To answer this question, we develop a two skills- two jobs model with a frictional labour market, where new school graduates need to actively search for their best match. We com-pute optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> and the output gain/loss associated to the gap between actual and optimal <b>tracking</b> <b>length.</b> Using a sample of 18 countries, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that: a) actual <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> is often longer than optimal, which might call for some e ¢ cient de-tracking; b) the output loss of having a <b>tracking</b> <b>length</b> longer or shorter than optimal is sizeable, and close to 2 percent of total net output...|$|R

40|$|We report {{photoelectron}} <b>track</b> <b>length</b> distributions between 3 and 8 keV in gas {{mixtures of}} Ne+CO 2 +CH 3 NO 2 (260 : 80 : 10 Torr) and CO 2 +CH 3 NO 2 (197. 5 : 15 Torr). The measurements were made using a negative ion time projection chamber (NITPC) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). We report the first quantitative analysis of photoelectron <b>track</b> <b>length</b> distributions in a gas. The distribution of <b>track</b> <b>lengths</b> {{at a given}} energy is best fit by a lognormal distribution. A powerlaw distribution of the form, f(E) =a(E/Eo) n, is found to fit the relationship between mean <b>track</b> <b>length</b> and energy. We find n= 1. 29 +/- 0. 07 for Ne+CO 2 +CH 3 NO 2 and n= 1. 20 +/- 0. 09 for CO 2 +CH 3 NO 2. Understanding the distribution of photoelectron <b>track</b> <b>lengths</b> in proportional counter gases is important for optimizing the pixel size and {{the dimensions of the}} active region in electron-drift time projection chambers (TPCs) and NITPC X-ray polarimeters.

40|$|Abstract: We present 24 new apatite fission track (AFT) {{ages and}} 18 <b>track</b> <b>length</b> {{measurements}} from the Baikal region, SE Siberia. Most samples have AFT ages between 140 and 100 Ma, with relatively high mean <b>track</b> <b>lengths</b> (c. 13. 2 fLm). The relationship between AFT ages, elevation and mean <b>track</b> <b>lengths</b> {{indicate that the}} samples record rapid cooling during the Early Cretaceous (140 - 120 Ma), as also shown by thermal history inversion of <b>track</b> <b>length</b> distributions. Cooling took place during a Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous orogenic phase, related to closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk ocean and reflected in the exhumation of metamorphic core complexes followed by thrusting and reverse faulting, basin inversion and large vertical motions. The variation in AFT ages throughout the study area can be partly explained by differences in geothermal structure but differential denudation also played a role. Minimum amounts of Early Cretaceous denudation are estimated at 2 - 3 km...|$|R
