Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and <b>little</b> <b>swift.</b> Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E

50|$|<b>Little</b> <b>swifts</b> {{spend most}} of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on {{vertical}} cliffs or walls. <b>Little</b> <b>swifts</b> are readily identified by their small size. Their wingspan is 33 cm compared to the 42 cm of common swift. They are black except for a white rump, the white extending on to the flanks. They have a short square tail. The flight is fluttering like a house martin.|$|R

50|$|<b>Little</b> <b>swifts</b> {{build their}} nests in hole in {{buildings}} or sometimes on cliffs, laying 1-4 eggs. A swift {{will return to}} the same site year after year, rebuilding its nest when necessary. A species of bedbug Cimex hemipterus has been recorded from its nest in India.|$|R
60|$|He {{borrowed}} materials, and {{had written}} a long letter to her before the Calypso put in at Algiers. The <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> tartane had forestalled her; and every one was on the watch, when Estelle, who had been treated like a little princess on board, was brought in the long-boat with all her party to the quay. Though it was at daybreak, not only the European inhabitants, but Turks, Arabs, Moors, and Jews thronged the wharf in welcome; and there were jubilant cries as all the five captives could be seen seated in the boat {{in the light of}} the rising sun.|$|E
6000|$|His mother's embrace, {{with its}} frail energy, and the {{pressure}} of her soft, dry lips, filled Felix always with remorse. Why could he not give the simple and direct expression to his feeling that she gave to hers? He watched those lips transferred to Nedda, heard her say: [...] "Oh, my darling, how lovely to see you! Do you know this for midge-bites?" [...] A hand, diving deep into a pocket, returned with a little silver-coated stick having a bluish end. Felix saw it rise and hover about Nedda's forehead, and descend with two <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> dabs. [...] "It takes them away at once." ...|$|E
60|$|Appleby stood silent a moment. He knew Tony’s {{unstable}} nature well, {{and that}} his passion for Violet Wayne, which was almost reverential, might yet lift him to a higher level. It was also evident that in desiring to make amends Tony was wise, and Appleby felt a curious sympathy {{for the man who}} clung so desperately to his last hope of vindicating himself in her eyes. That Tony’s motive was, as he had admitted, largely selfish, and his contrition by no means of the highest order, did not trouble him. It was his part to help and not censure him, and with a <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> movement he laid his hand upon his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with <b>little</b> <b>swifts,</b> which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|R
50|$|<b>Little</b> <b>swifts</b> breed around {{habitation}} and cliffs {{from southern}} Spain, Africa northeastwards through southern Pakistan and India and Sri Lanka. Unlike the more northerly common swift, many birds are resident, but some populations are migratory, and winter further south than their breeding areas. They wander widely on migration, and {{are seen as}} rare vagrants in much of Europe and Asia.|$|R
50|$|This species appropriates {{the nests}} of <b>little</b> <b>swifts</b> and those {{swallows}} which build retort-shaped nests. In Europe and north Africa, this usually means the red-rumped swallow, but {{south of the}} Sahara other species like wire-tailed swallow are also parasitised. The original owners of the nests are driven away, or the white-rumps settle in the nest and refuse to move. Once occupied, the nest is lined with feathers and saliva, {{and one or two}} eggs are laid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, you {{can remain}} here,' said the Emperor. 'Light the lamps, Constant, {{and have the}} {{carriages}} ready in half-an-hour. Look over this draft of {{a letter to the}} Emperor of Austria, and let me have your observations upon it, Talleyrand. De Meneval, there is a lengthy report here as to the new dockyard at Brest. Extract what is essential from it, and leave it upon my desk at five o'clock to-morrow morning. Berthier, I will have the whole army into the boats at seven. We will see if they can embark within three hours. Monsieur de Laval, you will wait here until we start for Pont de Briques.' So with a crisp order to each of us, he walked with <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> steps across the room, and I saw his square green back and white legs framed for an instant in the doorway. There was the flutter of a pink skirt beyond, and then the curtains closed behind him.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there were}} many, many things besides the lovely clothes {{to make him}} {{contented}} and happy. First, the beautiful woman of the hills who loved and cherished him and made him call her by the sweet name of [...] "mother" [...] so many times every day that he well nigh forgot she was not his real mother. Then there was the great stony hill-side on which he now lived for a playground, where he could wander all day among the rocks, overgrown with creepers and strange sweet-smelling flowers {{he had never seen}} on the plain below. The birds and butterflies he saw there were different from those he had always seen; so were the snakes which he often found sleepily coiled up on the rocks, and the <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> lizards. Even the water looked strange and more beautiful than the water in the plain, for here it gushed out of the living rock, sparkling like crystal in the sun, and was always cold when he dipped his hands in it even on the hottest days. Perhaps the most wonderful thing was the immense distance he could see, when he looked away from the hillside across the plain and saw the great dark forest where he had been, and the earth stretching far, far away beyond.|$|E
60|$|Swift {{explains}} his whimsical title by {{the custom of}} mariners in throwing out a tub to a whale, in order to occupy the monster's attention and divert it from an attack upon the ship,--which only proves how <b>little</b> <b>Swift</b> knew of whales or sailors. But let that pass. His book is a tub thrown out to the enemies of Church and State to keep them occupied from further attacks or criticism; and {{the substance of the}} argument is that all churches, and indeed all religion and science and statesmanship, are arrant hypocrisy. The best known part of the book is the allegory of the old man who died and left a coat (which is Christian Truth) to each of his three sons, Peter, Martin, and Jack, with minute directions for its care and use. These three names stand for Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists; {{and the way in which}} the sons evade their father's will and change the fashion of their garment is part of the bitter satire upon all religious sects. Though it professes to defend the Anglican Church, that institution fares perhaps worse than the others; for nothing is left to her but a thin cloak of custom under which to hide her alleged hypocrisy.|$|E

50|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and rock martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Rock martins often share their nesting sites with <b>little</b> <b>swifts,</b> which sometimes forcibly take over the martin's nests. In 1975, {{one of the first}} findings of the tick Argas (A.) africolumbae was in a nest of Ptyonoprogne f. fusciventris in Kenya, at that time the martin was described under its synonym Ptyonoprogne fuligula rufigula (Fischer & Reichenow).|$|R
60|$|Then with a <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> move of her {{shoulders}} she shook off the fancies, {{and fell to}} considering the task which it seemed was laid before her. She had made a friend of Bernard Appleby and that meant much with her; while ever since she had heard Miss Clavier’s story the desire to right him had been growing stronger, but she had unpleasant misgivings. She felt the responsibility of breaking the smooth course of other lives almost too great for her, and wondered vaguely whether if she declared the truth in that sheltered land where nothing that was startling or indecorous ever seemed to happen anybody would believe her. She might even have kept silent had Violet Wayne been different, but Nettie already entertained an affection that was largely respectful for her, and determined that if she married Tony Palliser she should at least do so knowing {{what kind of man}} he was. Once more, however, her resolution almost failed her, and she glanced at the great glittering angel in the west window with a sense of her presumption in venturing to meddle with the great scheme of destiny. Still, Nettie was daring, and turning suddenly she looked down into the stone face again.|$|E
60|$|One {{of these}} July evenings Lennan remembered beyond all others. He had come, {{after a hard}} day's work, out from his studio into the {{courtyard}} garden to smoke a cigarette and feel the sun on his cheek before it sank behind the wall. A piano-organ far away was grinding out a waltz; and on an hydrangea tub, under the drawing-room window, he sat down to listen. Nothing was visible from there, save just the square patch of a quite blue sky, and one soft plume of smoke from his own kitchen chimney; nothing audible save that tune, and the never-ending street murmur. Twice birds flew across--starlings. It was very peaceful, and his thoughts went floating like the smoke of his cigarette, to meet who-knew-what other thoughts--for thoughts, no doubt, had <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> lives of their own; desired, found their mates, and, lightly blending, sent forth offspring. Why not? All things were possible in this wonder-house of a world. Even that waltz tune, floating away, would find some melody to wed, and twine with, and produce a fresh chord that might float in turn to catch the hum of a gnat or fly, and breed again. Queer--how everything sought to entwine with something else! On one of the pinkish blooms of the hydrangea he noted a bee--of all things, in this hidden-away garden of tiles and gravel and plants in tubs! The little furry, lonely thing was drowsily clinging there, {{as if it had}} forgotten what it had come for--seduced, maybe, like himself, from labour by these last rays of the sun. Its wings, close-furled, were glistening; its eyes seemed closed. And the piano-organ played on, a tune of yearning, waiting, yearning....|$|E
6000|$|For in fact, it is {{reasonably}} asked, What vital interest has England in any cause now deciding itself in foreign parts? Once {{there was a}} Papistry and Protestantism, important as life eternal and death eternal; more lately there was an interest of Civil Order and Horrors of the French Revolution, important at least as rent-roll and preservation of the game; but now what is there? No cause in which any god or man of this British Nation can be thought to be concerned. Sham-kingship, now recognized and even self-recognized everywhere to be sham, wrestles and struggles with mere ballot-box Anarchy: not a pleasant spectacle to British minds. Both parties in the wrestle professing earnest wishes of peace to us, what have we {{to do with it}} except answer earnestly, [...] "Peace, yes certainly," [...] and mind our affairs elsewhere. The British Nation has no concern with that indispensable sorrowful and shameful wrestle now going on everywhere in foreign parts. The British Nation already, by self-experience centuries old, understands all that; was lucky enough to transact the greater part of that, in noble ancient ages, while the wrestle had not yet become a shameful one, but on both sides of it there was wisdom, virtue, heroic nobleness fruitful to all time,--thrice-lucky British Nation! The British Nation, I say, has nothing to learn there; has now quite another set of lessons to learn, far ahead {{of what is going on}} there. Sad example there, of what the issue is, and how inevitable and how imminent, might admonish the British Nation to be speedy with its new lessons; to bestir itself, as men in peril of conflagration do, with the neighboring houses all on fire! To obtain, for its own very pressing behoof, if by possibility it could, some real Captaincy instead of an imaginary one: to remove resolutely, and replace by a better sort, its own peculiar species of teaching and guiding histrios of various name, who here too are numerous exceedingly, and much in need of gentle removal, while the play is still good, and the comedy has not yet become tragic; and to be a <b>little</b> <b>swift</b> about it withal; and so to escape the otherwise inevitable evil day! This Britain might learn: but she does not need a protocolling establishment, with much [...] "having the honor to be," [...] to teach it her.|$|E
