This double approach is necessary because Global Im-balances are due to the conjunction of financial and real phenomena: the increase in the price of commodities, the accumulation of foreign reserves by the Asian central banks, the <b>limited</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of the OPEC countries, the insufficient development of the Asian financial system and the perception of better returns in the US. The second objective is to model the global saving glut hypothesis and to show its implications. We start with a model which consists of three identical countries and then we replicate the current pattern of global imbalances in introducing three asymmetries: a fixed exchange rate between Asia and the United States, a <b>limited</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> in Asia and endogenous propen-sity to spend in the United States. In order to avoid the recession linked to the increase of their propensity to import, the United States increase their propensity to spend. This adjustment has a cost: (i) the Global Imbalances grow quickly with an increase of current account imbalances and net foreign assets in both the US and Asia; (ii) the euro area supports an appreciation of its exchange rate which put it in a long depression...|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to model these dynamics in a standard queue-resource simulation framework. In a standard queue-resource model, there is no concept of <b>limited</b> delay <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> For instance, in a factory setting, a part moving from one work station to another may wait for one minute or one week before receiving service. The number of parts waiting for service (queue size) may be explicitly limited, but the wait time per part is not. An airplanes ability to absorb delay while airborne is limited and costly. Because of this, the {{air traffic control system}} anticipates and manages excessive demand for scarce shared resources, such as arrival runways or busy airspace, so that the delay necessary for buffering can be spread out over a larger distance, or taken on the ground before departure. It {{is difficult}} to model these important dynamics in a standard queue-resource simulation framework, which does not account for <b>limited</b> delay <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> The modeling methodology presented here captures these dynamics by employing a large number of independent threads of execution to monitor and enforce a large number of relatively simple mathematical relationships. These relationships calculate feasible time windows for each portion of each flight. The model was implemented in the SLX simulation language. The speed and scalability of SLX are essential to the approach, which would otherwise be impractical.

40|$|Fructose is a hexose sugar that {{is being}} {{increasingly}} consumed in its monosaccharide form. Patients who exhibit fructose malabsorption can present with gastrointestinal symptoms that include chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, with no clearly established gastrointestinal mechanism for fructose malabsorption, patient analysis by the proxy of a breath hydrogen test (BHT) is controversial. The major transporter for fructose in intestinal epithelial cells {{is thought to be}} the facilitative transporter GLUT 5. Consistent with a facilitative transport system, we show here by analysis of past studies on healthy adults that there is a significant relationship between fructose malabsorption and fructose dose (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 001). Thus there is a dose-dependent and <b>limited</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> even in healthy individuals. Changes in fructose malabsorption with age have been observed in human infants, and this may parallel the developmental regulation of GLUT 5 expression. Moreover, a GLUT 5 knockout mouse has displayed the hallmarks associated with profound fructose malabsorption. Fructose malabsorption appears to be partially modulated by the amount of glucose ingested. Although solvent drag and passive diffusion have been proposed to explain the effect of glucose on fructose malabsorption, this could possibly be a result of the facilitative transporter GLUT 2. GLUT 5 and GLUT 2 mRNA {{have been shown to be}} rapidly upregulated by the presence of fructose and GLUT 2 mRNA is also upregulated by glucose, but in humans the distribution and role of GLUT 2 in the brush border membrane are yet to be definitively decided. Understanding the relative roles of these transporters in humans will be crucial for establishing a mechanistic basis for fructose malabsorption in gastrointestinal patients. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} {{relationship}} between float (the tradeable shares of an asset) and stock price bubbles. Investors trade a stock that initially has a limited float because of insider lock-up restrictions but the tradeable shares of which increase over time as these restrictions expire. A speculative bubble arises because investors, with heterogeneous beliefs due to overconfidence and facing short-sales constraints, anticipate the option to resell the stock to buyers with even higher valuations. With <b>limited</b> risk <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> this resale option depends on float as investors anticipate the change in asset supply over time and speculate over the degree of insider selling. Our model yields implications consistent with the behavior of internet stock prices during the late nineties, such as the bubble, share turnover and volatility decreasing with float and stock prices tending to drop on the lock-up expiration date though it is known to all in advance. ∗We thank the National Science Foundation for financial support.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{general equilibrium model}} to analyze the link between liquidity and financial fragility. Financial fragility {{is defined as the}} co-existence of two self-fulfilling expectation equilibria on the wholesale financial market. The "good time " equilibrium is characterized by high leverage, large balance sheets, and high credit risk taking in the banking sector. The "crisis time" equilibrium is associated with deleveraging, the collapse in trade, and liquidity hoarding. These twoequilibriadonotalwaysco-exist: the wholesale financial market only becomes fragile when the liquidity available exceeds a certain threshold that is a function of productivity in the real sector. The economy is thus shown to have a <b>limited</b> liquidity <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> As an important side product, the model shows how international capital flows and global imbalances fragilize the financial system. It also discusses the micro- and macro- prudential effects of regulatory capital requirements: although a rise in capital requirements reduces risk taking at the bank level, it has no incidence on financial fragility at the aggregate level. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{general equilibrium model}} to analyze the link between financial imbalances and financial crises. The model features an interbank market subject to frictions and where two equilibria may (co-) exist. The normal times equilibrium {{is characterized by a}} deep market with highly leveraged banks. The crisis times equilibrium is characterized by bank deleveraging, a market run, and a liquidity trap. Crises occur when there is too much liquidity (savings) in the economy with respect to the number of (safe) investment opportunities. In effect, the economy is shown to have a <b>limited</b> liquidity <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> which depends 2 ̆ 014 inter alia 2 ̆ 014 on the productivity of the real sector, the ultimate borrower. I extend the model in order to analyze the effects of financial integration of an emerging and a developed country. I find results in line with the recent literature on global imbalances. Financial integration permits a more efficient allocation of savings worldwide in normal times. It also implies a current account deficit for the developed country. The current account deficit makes financial crises more likely when it exceeds the liquidity <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of the developed country. Thus, under some conditions 2 ̆ 014 which this paper spells out 2 ̆ 014 financial integration of emerging countries may increase the fragility of the international financial system.

40|$|After the European Union {{enlarged}} to {{the east}} in 2004, a sense of enlargement fatigue has pervaded the Union, and there {{would seem to be}} concerted resistance towards further enlargement. This sense of fatigue is encompassed by the new buzz word in EU discourse; <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> Yet the concept has remained an unclear one, and there have been subsequent calls for a clarification of the term. Following from this, the aim of this thesis is to explain and understand, define and clarify the resurgence of the term <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> At the core of the concept, it is argued, lie strong concerns over the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the EU, which in turn have shaped the sense of fatigue and leading to the emergence of the term <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> As such, the methodology employed is that of a qualitative case study. The nature of the investigation is threefold. Firstly, a historical analysis of European enlargement is offered, suggesting that the problem of <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> came to the fore only after the prospect of the Eastern enlargement of 2004.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of {{elevated}} temperatures on the compressive strength stress-strain relationship (stiffness) and energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> (toughness) of concretes are presented. High-performance concretes (HPCs) were prepared in three series, with different cementitious material constitutions using plain ordinary Portland cement (PC), with and without metakaolin (MK) and silica fume (SF) separate replacements. Each series comprised a concrete mix, prepared without any fibers, and concrete mixes reinforced with either or both steel fibers and polypropylene (PP) fibers. The results showed that after exposure to 600 and 800 °C, the concrete mixes retained, respectively, 45 % and 23 % of their compressive strength, on average. The results also show that after the concrete was exposed to the elevated temperatures, the loss of stiffness was much quicker than the loss in compressive strength, but the loss of energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> was relatively slower. A 20 % replacement of the cement by MK resulted in a higher compressive strength but a lower specific toughness, {{as compared with the}} concrete prepared with 10 % replacement of cement by SF. The MK concrete also showed quicker losses in the compressive strength, elastic modulus and energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> after exposure to the elevated temperatures. Steel fibers approximately doubled the energy <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> of the unheated concrete. They were effective in minimizing the degradation of compressive strength for the concrete after exposure to the elevated temperatures.
