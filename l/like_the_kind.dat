5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

[...] Gary Graff of the same publication wrote that [...] "Stefani's Madonna reverence remains intact" [...] on the song, with The Washington Post [...] J.

Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic also thought that the song [...] "recalls a 'Crazy for You'-era Madonna", also noting that it is [...] "pure Stefani—and understandably, [...] far superior to any of her attempts at mimicking other artists." [...] Norman Mayers of Prefix Magazine wrote that the song [...] "soar thanks to Stefani's girlish vocals and brilliant hook that reference iconic moments from Madonna and Tears for Fears." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator called it [...] "a breezy yet emotive '80s-ballad that highlights her tender vocals."

Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for." [...] She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] was the right episode for them {{to come back to the}} series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam [...] "jarring in and of itself". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of argument that two real people would have."

Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the federal income tax, the law has contained two nonrecognition provisions that have undergone relatively little change: <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> rule and <b>the</b> involuntary conversion rule. Commentators have questioned the policy grounds for <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> rule in general, and for some of its particular features, such as the exchange requirement. Congress and its staffers have also noted the complexity caused by certain aspects of the rule and have enacted or proposed remedial changes in this regard. The involuntary conversion rule also contributes to the complexity of the tax system given the fact-intensive analysis that it requires. Perhaps more fundamentally, the two nonrecognition rules generally use different standards for determining eligible replacement property, an apparent inconsistency that occasionally catches the attention of both Congress and commentators. This article seeks to improve <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> and involuntary conversion rules, that is, make the provisions more rational and less complex, by analyzing them in light of the fundamental tax policies of efficiency, equity, and administrability. The product of this effort is a simpler, more rational and more unified approach for granting nonrecognition treatment to voluntary and involuntary dispositions of property. The article 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations include (i) the use of <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> standard to determine eligible replacement property under both <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> and involuntary conversion rules, along with narrowing <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> standard for real property by employing a categorization approach modeled on the real property classifications used for depreciation purposes; (ii) the use of an express rollover mechanism under <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> rule; and (iii) the use of a single, rather than bifurcated, period for replacing assets under <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>kind</b> rule...|$|R

500|$|TV Squad writer Jay Black {{praised the}} main plot, and wrote, [...] "I was delighted that {{the trip to}} the Prince Family Paper Company became a test of Michael's morals rather than the usual {{exercise}} in his stupidity." [...] Black said Dwight's attempts to get Michael to give up the client list were among the best set of scenes for the season. However, Black said the Hilary Swank subplot suffered in comparison, and felt like a vain attempt to find something for the supporting cast to do. The A.V. Club writer Nathan Rabin was disappointed with [...] "Prince Family Paper", calling it overly dependent on throwaway gags and describing it as [...] "about as inconsequential as The Office gets". Rabin complimented the opening gag with Jim and Dwight, but said it [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of gag the show has pulled off dozens, if not hundreds of times, before". Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly said it was not one of the strongest Office episodes, and that the script took a particularly mean tone with the Prince Family Paper subplot. But Wheat said it included some enjoyable moments, like Jim's prank against Dwight in the opening scene. Will Leitch of New York magazine was very critical of the episode, especially the Hilary Swank subplot, which he said [...] "sounded like a conversation B. J. Novak had with himself at a party and submitted as a backup script". Leitch also pointed out the episode {{had nothing to do with}} the show's ongoing plotlines: [...] "It's the definition of filler. Which would have been fine, had it been funnier." [...] "Prince Family Paper" [...] was voted the lowest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally, where the episode was rated 6.98 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
