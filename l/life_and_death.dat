5|$|Though the {{traditional}} biblical {{date for the}} narrative of Joseph’s <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death</b> places him in Egypt {{in the middle of}} the Twelfth Dynasty, roughly comparable to the Hyksos invasion of Egypt, contemporary scholarship no longer accepts such a remote dating. The figure of Joseph itself is often taken to be a ‘personification of a tribe’, rather than an historic person.|$|E

A supporting tour followed, during which they played the album in its entirety; response to this was mixed.|$|E

5|$|Several {{historians have}} {{attempted}} to establish the dates of Kanhopatra's <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>death.</b> One estimate places her life circa 1428 CE by relating her to a Bahamani king of Bidar who {{is often associated with}} the Kanhopatra story—although in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named. Pawar estimates that she died in 1480. Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply say that she lived in the 15th century—or in rare instances, the 13th or 16th century. According to Zelliot, she was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela (14th century) and Namadeva (c.1270-c.1350).|$|E
