40|$|This study {{presents}} a quantitative policy impact analysis of alternative policy and macroeconomic assumptions {{in the agricultural}} farming sector. Three scenarios are considered: direct payment scenario, macroeconomic environment scenario and WTO scenario. We apply the CAPRI-Farm model, an extension of CAPRI which disaggregates the standard Nuts 2 regional resolution of the supply models in CAPRI further to farm type models, capturing farm heterogeneity in terms of farm specialization and farm size across all EU regions and MS. The advantage of the CAPRI-Farm model compared to other similar models is that it represents comprehensively all major farm types in the EU and it links farm level behaviour with output and input market price responses. The direct payment scenario assumes equalisation of decoupled payments - a regional flat-rate scheme - at the Nuts 1, MS and EU levels. According to simulation results, the value of re-distributed payments vary strongly between the three flat-rate systems. The value of payments reallocated between farms in the EU increases from 9 % (3. 7 billion Eur) of the total CAP budget in the Nuts 1 scenario to 19 % (8. 2 billion Eur) in the EU flat-rate scenario. Particularly negatively affected are large- and medium-sized farms and dairies, mixed crops and livestock, general field and mixed cropping, olives, cereals and oilseeds and permanent crops. Small farms {{tend to be less}} affected. However, sheep, goats and grazing, the residual farm category and mixed livestock farms realise higher premiums and incomes. The study shows relatively minor allocative market responses and thus small price effects for all three scenarios. The WTO scenario aims to quantify the impact of trade liberalization on farming sector. More precisely, the scenario considers the impact of the proposal made by the chair of the WTO's agriculture negotiations, Ambassador Crawford Falconer. The simulation results show that tariff reduction increases consumer welfare in the EU by 8. 5 billion Eur, whereas agricultural income decreases by 6. 8 billion Eur (- 3 %), mainly driven by <b>losses</b> <b>realised</b> in the animal sector. The analyses show sizable impacts on farm income for different farm types. Generally, farm types specialised in livestock production lose the most. The largest negative income effects were observed for cattle, dairying, rearing and fattening, dairy, mixed crops and livestock; and sheep and goat farms. The macroeconomic environment scenario simulates the farm-level effects of a hypothetical economic recovery scenario that may lead to higher GDP growth and higher oil prices. Two shocks are assumed: an increase in the crude oil price by 50 % and an annual world GDP growth rate increase by 1 % relative to the baseline level. The results indicate that a higher GDP growth causes stronger price and market effects than does the increase in the oil price. With the oil price shock, farmers are affected by two opposing effects: an increase in production costs and an increase in revenues. In most cases, increasing costs dominate such that the overall farm income declines. The effect of higher GDP on income across farm types is generally positive due to the rising demand for agricultural products, which generates an increase in the prices of agricultural commodities. Farmers react to the new macro environment with adjustments of their production leading to an increase in arable land and intensification of crop and animal production activities. Further, a tendency to substitute grassland for arable land can be observed. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E

Over {{the last few years}} the ASA determined KM as a priority to assist with reducing knowledge <b>loss,</b> <b>realising</b> information assets and reducing work duplication by attempting to implement IKM tools and strategies. This research employed a pragmatic viewpoint, using a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods to check reliability, to ensure validity while undertaking the task of implementing the IKM tools. Using a case study strategy and action research was justified, as to be pragmatic the researcher needed to understand the extent of the problem within a specified context. The research discussed in this thesis, provides a new framework for implementing KM tools; focusing on the NSO category, which the case study organisation falls into. The literature agrees enlisting influential members onto the project is vital for success; however, the findings suggested that success was not only tied to this buy-in alone, but also to the organisation s ability to retain these members {{for the duration of the}} project. The research proposed the use of a newly developed tool within the new framework, as an approach to reduce the time it takes to undertake traditional social network analysis of the organisation, as it became clear that there was a need for a method of producing updated results of the SNA, which would span the length of long projects within organisations with significantly high staff turn-over rates. Privacy was given as a factor to consider the in literature; however, the findings from this study indicated that a majority of the participants were comfortable with the system.

The concept of secondary controlled hydraulic motors with variable displacement offers reduction in flow consumption without pressure losses and decreases {{the complexity of the}} valve block design. Instead of controlling flow of the hydraulic motor with valves, torque is adjusted to the load by varying displacement. An electronic control circuit allows flexible digital control concepts e. g. load independent speed control, pressure maintaining function-ality, smooth start-up sequences and continuous positioning of the mechanical transmission system. This paper introduces the concept of today’s Power Control Units, the principle and mathematical model of secondary controlled hydraulic motors and the cascade control loop structure.

40|$|Coupled {{resonator}} arrays {{have been}} shown to exhibit interesting many- body physics including Mott and Fractional Hall states of photons. One of the main differences between these photonic quantum simulators and their cold atoms coun- terparts is in the dissipative nature of their photonic excitations. The natural equi- librium state is where there are no photons left in the cavity. Pumping the system with external drives is therefore necessary to compensate for the <b>losses</b> and <b>realise</b> non-trivial states. The external driving here can easily be tuned to be incoherent, coherent or fully quantum, opening the road for exploration of many body regimes beyond the reach of other approaches. In this chapter, we review some of the physics arising in driven dissipative coupled resonator arrays including photon fermionisa- tion, crystallisation, as well as photonic quantum Hall physics out of equilibrium. We start by briefly describing possible experimental candidates to realise coupled resonator arrays along with the two theoretical models that capture their physics, the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians.

The first application is to predict loss given default for secured loans, in particular retail mortgages. This is an asymmetric process since where the security (such as a property) value exceeds the loan balance the banks cannot retain the profit, whereas when the security does not cover the value of the defaulting loan then the bank realises a loss. In the light of this asymmetry it becomes apparent that estimating the low tail of the house value is much more relevant for estimating likely losses than estimates of the average value where in most cases no <b>loss</b> is <b>realised.</b> In our application quantile regression is used to estimate the distribution of property values realised on repossession that is then used to calculate loss given default estimates. An illustration is given for a mortgage portfolio from a European mortgage lender. A second application is to revenue modelling. While credit issuing organisations have access to large databases, they also build models to assess the likely effects of new strategies for which, by definition, there is no existing data. Certain strategies are aimed at increasing the revenue stream or decreasing the risk in specific market segments. Using a simple artificial revenue model, quantile regression is applied to elucidate the details of subsets of accounts, such as the least profitable, as predicted from their covariates.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power system amongst other things, to suppress overvoltages in the network during network switching, auto reclosing of transmission lines and under low loading condition of the network. Traditionally, shunt reactors of fixed type have been used and these have been permanently connected to the system. This research work investigated the feasibility of replacing the fixed shunt line reactors with a reactor, whose parameters are automatically varied depending on the system reactive power requirements, in a mature power system overlaid with high voltage lines to improve amongst, other things voltage stability. However, in a mature system overlaid with parallel higher voltage lines, power tend to flow on the matured system rather than higher voltage system as predetermined by various impedances of the power system. It is therefore desirable that loading of higher voltage lines be increased because of their higher power transfer capability and fact that higher voltage networks generate capacitive power which is substantially more than for each line at the original voltage. However, replacing {{a large number of}} fixed line reactors, at low loadings of higher voltage lines, even when system collapse is averted by increasing the number of reactors inserted into the system, overvoltage problems may still be an issue, until a certain number of must-run reactors, operating at full reactance, are put into service. If too much inductive reactance is removed from the system when the loading levels are extremely low, the power system will collapse. Therefore, there was no economic benefit in replacing all the fixed shunt line reactors with controllable type when the loading was still relatively low. Thus, the majority of the converted reactors were operating in their full rating as there was still more reactive power to be absorbed. However, when the power was diverted to flow on the higher voltage system through the use of series compensation of the higher voltage system, there was a possibility of making some fixed shunt line reactors on the higher voltage network controllable. This also allowed more power to be transferred in the higher voltage system thus improving its utilisation. Also, a positive impact on active system <b>losses</b> was <b>realised...</b>|$|R

40|$|Local loss {{recovery}} for reliable multicast can provide significant performance improvement {{in terms of}} loss recovery latency, bandwidth consumption and network throughput. Active reliable multicast (ARM) is a novel loss recovery scheme for large-scale reliable multicast. In ARM, local <b>loss</b> recovery is <b>realised</b> by retrieving repairs at near active routers. In practice, active resources are limited and active resources allocation strategies are required for optimising performance {{in terms of the}} loss recovery and/or network bandwidth consumption. An active router may need to support the local loss {{recovery for}} multiple multicast sessions simultaneously. How to partition efficiently the cache resource to these sessions is crucial to the performance of local loss recovery. In the paper, the authors propose a cache partitioning method called 'layered greedy cache partitioning' to deal with this dilemma. For this method, the active routers are first grouped into different layers according to the tree topologies and the design begins from the lowest layer. The cache partitioning of an upper layer can be performed separately by making use of relevant design information of the lower layer. An optimisation for cache partitioning at each layer can then be conducted and a 'local' optimal solution can be achieved. On a global scale, however, the solution is only suboptimal. The performance of using the proposed cache partitioning method is compared with that using uniform cache partitioning and proportional partitioning. A significant performance improvement is found. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

While these systems have gained traction over the last 10 years there is significant {{evidence to suggest that}} most organisations have not moved beyond traditional and transactional systems that automate existing HR processes, and that the promise of more sophisticated analytics with strategic value has not materialised. This paper follows three large organisations, using an interpretive case study approach, and investigates how they selected, designed and implemented updated HR systems. Our findings suggest that when a system is designed to engage with the complexity of people management, organisations experience additional challenges from those identified in other functional or integrated IS implementations, Thus the HR system typically becomes stalled at an impasse making it difficult to move beyond the automation - transactional phase to the more strategic transformational phase. By taking a social constructivist perspective we posit that there are four main challenges for management to consider when implementing an HRIS: (1) maintaining both HR and organisational attention in a function that is often attributed limited salience;(2) addressing the complexities associated with people management particularly across global and multi-functional businesses; (3) meeting the challenges associated with the creation and application of relevant HR metrics; (4) and managing user acceptance when there is typically a perceived and <b>realised</b> <b>loss</b> of functionality experienced when people management processes become automated...|$|R
40|$|The capital {{adequacy}} regulation which came into force on 1 January 2008 for the Hungarian banking sector, {{in line with}} the Basel II directives and generally applied in the European Union, brought the novelty of distinct management of operational risk. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel and systems or from external events, which, similarly to financial risk, may result in substantial losses. The regulation allows for various methods of calculating the capital requirement. Financial institutions may opt for simpler approaches based on income indicators, or for more complex ones based on actual measures of risk. Based on the past oneyear period, it appears that the Hungarian banking system’s operational risk capital charge is significant compared to the total capital charge, with the operational risk capital charge for 2009 Q 1 amounting to HUF 120 billion, equivalent to nearly 8 % of the total capital requirements. The reported <b>realised</b> <b>losses</b> are lower than the capital requirement (approximately HUF 13 billion in 2008), but the capital charge must provide a buffer in extreme, unexpected situations, and conclusions on extreme values cannot be drawn based merely on one year of observation, therefore this discrepancy could be completely justified. Regarding institutions’ choice of approach, it can be established that larger institutions prefer more complex methods in both foreign and Hungarian practice. This {{is due to the fact}} that the introduction of more advanced approaches comes with a higher fixed cost, which larger institutions can absorb more easily over the short term, and moreover, they can take better advantage of the benefits offered. Overall, the conscious management of operational risk and application of more developed methods aimed at managing such risks can contribute to the stability of the financial system. operational risk, Basel II, capital requirements, CRD, Hungarian banking sector. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{this study}} aimed to assess nurses' {{practice}} and {{perception of their}} knowledge, responsibility and documentation in relation to enteral nutrition in the critically ill and to explore nurses' attitudes towards establishing evidence-based practice and teamwork in three health care sectors in Jordan. Background: poor nursing adherence to evidence-based guidelines has negative consequences leading to higher mortality rates, delayed recovery and longer length of stay. Evidence-based practice and team working {{is the key to}} minimising complications and discrepancies between nurses. Design and methods: mixed-methods strategies were employed. A cluster randomised sample recruited 253 ICU nurse for the survey. Fourteen nurses were selected purposively for the interviews and fifty five patients were involved in bedside observations. Both statistical and thematic analysis findings were integrated and discussed together. Results: Nurses revealed a tendency to undertake nutritional care despite the recognition clinical nutrition is a secondary role. In terms of nursing processes, nurses showed greater levels of knowledge and responsibility for ‘preventing complications' and ‘evaluation' more than ‘assessment' and ‘identifying goals'. However, female nurses scored higher in taking responsibility for ‘assessment' and ‘planning' than male nurses. The internet and clinical experience were the most effective sources of knowledge along with university education and colleagues. Nurses showed inconsistency in assessment tasks such as controlling gastric residual volume and confirming tube placements. Diarrhoea was the most frequent complication followed by abdominal pain, vomiting, tube dislodgment, weight <b>loss.</b> However, nurses <b>realised</b> that the incidences of complications is less likely when applying such evidence-based protocol for enteral nutrition. Multidisciplinary team work was introduced as a source of evidence-based practice and establishing a nutritional team contributes to a greater nursing involvement in decision making. Poor cooperation and interaction within the team prohibits standardized care and increases the imparity in nursing practice. Conclusion: increased nursing awareness of nutritional assessment through providing training programs and surveillance of clinical performance is necessary. Management should be concerned with offering an accessible source of knowledge, the required equipment and documentation systems. Enhancing collaboration between health care providers and offering appropriate counselling should also be emphasized. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In most {{breeding}} programmes breeders use phenotypic data obtained in breeding trials to rank {{the performance of}} the parents or progeny on pre-selected performance criteria. Through this ranking the best candidates are identified and selected for breeding or production purposes. Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP), is an efficient selection method to use, combining information into a single index. Unbalanced or messy data is frequently found in tree breeding trial data. Trial individuals are related and a degree of correlation is expected between individuals over sites, which can lead to collinearity in the data which may lead to instability in certain selection models. A high degree of collinearity may cause problems and adversely affect the prediction of the breeding values in a BLUP selection index. Simulation studies have highlighted that instability is a concern and needs to be investigated in experimental data. The occurrence of instability, relating to collinearity, in BLUP of tree breeding data and possible methods to deal with it were investigated in this study. Case study data from 39 forestry breeding trials (three generations) of Eucalyptus grandis and 20 trials of Pinus patula (two generations) were used. A series of BLUP predictions (rankings) using three selection traits and 10 economic weighting sets were made. Backward and forward prediction models with three different matrix inversion techniques (singular value decomposition, Gaussian elimination - partial and full pivoting) and an adapted ridge regression technique were used in calculating BLUP indices. A Delphi and Clipper version of the same BLUP programme which run with different computational numerical precision were used and compared. Predicted breeding values (forward prediction) were determined in the F 1 and F 2 E. grandis trials and F 1 P. patula trials and realised breeding performance (backward prediction) was determined in the F 2 and F 3 E. grandis trials and F 2 P. patula trials. The accuracy (correlation between the predicted breeding values and realised breeding performance) was estimated in order to assess the efficiency of the predictions and evaluate the different matrix inversion methods. The magnitude of the accuracy (correlations) was found to mostly be of acceptable magnitude when compared to the heritability of the compound weighted trait in the F 1 F 2 E. grandis scenarios. Realised genetic gains were also calculated for each method used. Instability was observed in both E. grandis and P. patula breeding data in the study, and this may cause a significant <b>loss</b> in <b>realised</b> genetic gains. Instability can be identified by examining the matrix calculated from the product of the phenotypic covariance matrix with its inverse, for deviations from the expected identity pattern. Results {{of this study indicate that}} it may not always be optimal to use a higher numerical precision programme when there is collinearity in the data and instability in the matrix calculations. In some cases, where there is a large amount of collinearity, the use of a higher precision programme for BLUP calculations can significantly increase or decrease the accuracy of the rankings. The different matrix inversion techniques particularly SVD and adapted ridge regression did not perform much better than the full pivoting technique. The study found that it is beneficial to use the full pivoting Gaussian elimination matrix inversion technique in preference to the partial pivoting Gaussian elimination matrix inversion technique for both high and lower numerical precision programmes.
