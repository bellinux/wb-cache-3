5|$|In 2006, Schiff {{sponsored}} eliminating {{a cap on}} taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered {{some local}} taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> competition in the local taxicab business. The City Council passed the cap lift, {{and the number of}} Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, which can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors. Thus, the China Western Development policy aimed to attract foreign investment. This was {{to be done by}} creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. The creation of a new economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> rates of progress.|$|E

[...] The effectiveness of chain transfer involving solvent molecules depends on the amount of solvent present (more solvent <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> probability of transfer), the strength of the bond involved in the abstraction step (weaker bond <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> probability of transfer), and the stability of the solvent radical that is formed (<b>greater</b> stability <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> probability of transfer). Halogens, except fluorine, are easily transferred.|$|R

5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in glass fiber, {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{had raised}} $1.7 {{million by the}} time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, and hoped that this might <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> generosity. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Kent Hughes broke Olympic {{tradition}} in two significant ways. He decided to charge for television and newsreel {{footage of the}} Games where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, {{as a symbol of}} world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, it is {{not clear}} whether direct results of PCE lead to {{behavioral}} problems, or whether environmental factors are at fault. For example, children who have caregiver instability may have more behavioral problems as a result, or it may be that behavioral problems manifested by PCE children <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> turnover in caregivers. Other factors that make studying PCE difficult include unwillingness of mothers to tell the truth about drug history, uncertainty of dosages of street drugs and high rates of attrition (loss of participants) from studies.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, {{strategic}} alliances {{aimed at}} building {{economies of scale}} and scope. The involved enterprises tried to consolidate their positions in their respective sectors. During this time the number of strategic alliances increased dramatically.

25|$|The nursing {{shortage}} {{affects the}} developing countries that supply nurses through recruitment to work abroad in wealthier countries. For example, to accommodate perceived nursing shortage in the United States, American hospital recruit nurses from overseas, especially the Philippines and Africa. This, in turn, can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> nursing shortages in their home countries. In response, in 2010 the WHO's World Health Assembly adopted the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, a policy framework for all countries for the ethical international recruitment of nurses and other health professionals.|$|E
25|$|Congress has alternated between {{periods of}} {{constructive}} cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship. The period after the Civil War {{was marked by}} partisanship {{as is the case}} today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible. Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.|$|E
25|$|Locke {{suggested}} {{several reasons}} why goals are motivating: they direct attention, lead to task persistence {{and the development}} of task strategies for accomplishing the goal. In order for a goal to be motivating, the employee or work group must first accept the goal. While difficult goals can be more motivating, a goal still needs to appear achievable, which in turn will <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> goal acceptance. The person or group should have the necessary skills and resources to achieve the goal, or goal acceptance could be negatively impacted. Specific goals that set a performance expectation are more motivating than those that are vague. Similarly, more proximal goals have greater motivation impact than those that are very long range or distal goals.|$|E

25|$|From the 1980s onward, {{the major}} league game has changed {{dramatically}} {{from a combination of}} effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes {{in the way that the}} game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like steroids tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.|$|E
25|$|Mazda {{is still}} {{continuing}} development of next-generation of Wankel engines. The company is researching engine laser ignition, which eliminates conventional spark plugs, direct fuel injection, and sparkless HCCI ignition. These <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> rotor eccentricity (equating to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine), with improved elasticity and low revolutions-per-minute torque. Research by T. Kohno proved that installing a glow-plug in the combustion chamber improved part load and low {{revolutions per minute}} fuel economy by 7%. These innovations promise to improve fuel consumption and emissions. To improve fuel efficiency further, Mazda is looking at using the Wankel as a range-extender in series-hybrid cars, announcing a prototype, the Mazda2 EV, for press evaluation in November 2013. This configuration improves fuel efficiency and emissions. As a further advantage, running a Wankel engine at a constant speed gives greater engine life. Keeping to a near constant, or narrow band, of revolutions eliminates, or vastly reduces, many of the disadvantages of the Wankel engine.|$|E
25|$|Temperature affects {{almost all}} aspects of {{respiration}} processes. Temperature will increase respiration exponentially to a maximum, at which point respiration will decrease to zero when enzymatic activity is interrupted. Root respiration increases exponentially with temperature in its low range when the respiration rate is limited mostly by the TCA cycle. At higher temperatures the transport of sugars and the products of metabolism become the limiting factor. At temperatures over 35 degrees Celsius, root respiration begins to shut down completely. Microorganisms are divided into three temperature groups; cryophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles. Cryophiles function optimally at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius, mesophiles function best at temperatures between 20 and 40 degrees Celsius and thermophiles function optimally at over 40 degrees Celsius. In natural soils many different cohorts, or groups of microorganisms exist. These cohorts will all function best at different conditions so respiration may occur over a very broad range. Temperature increases <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> rates of soil respiration until high values retard microbial function, {{this is the same}} pattern that is seen with soil moisture levels.|$|E
