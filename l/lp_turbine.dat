500|$|The double-expansion engines {{consist of}} a {{high-pressure}} (HP) turbine and a low-pressure (<b>LP)</b> <b>turbine.</b> The steam is first passed through the HP turbine which turns at up to 2,100 [...] rpm. The steam, largely depleted at this point, is then passed through a large conduit to the <b>LP</b> <b>turbine.</b> By the time it reaches the <b>LP</b> <b>turbine,</b> it has no more than 50 psi (300 kPa) of pressure left. The <b>LP</b> <b>turbine</b> increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the <b>LP</b> <b>turbine,</b> the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3 [...] liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship's potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and {{all but one of}} the toilets on the Iowa class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the HP turbine, can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through reduction gearing that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship. [...] The Iowas were to be outfitted with four screws: the outer pair consisting of two four-bladed propellers roughly [...] in diameter and the inboard screws that have five blades and are roughly [...] in diameter. The propeller designs were adopted after earlier testing had determined that propeller cavitation caused a drop in efficiency at speeds over [...] [...] The two inner shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the flow of water to the propellers and improve the structural strength of the stern.

500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (<b>LP)</b> <b>turbine</b> feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the <b>LP</b> <b>turbine,</b> which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy.

40|$|The {{combined}} cycle power plant is a non-linear closed loop system, {{which consists of}} the gas turbine (GT), heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), high pressure (HP) and low pressure (<b>LP)</b> steam <b>turbines.</b> The gas <b>turbine</b> and HP, <b>LP</b> steam <b>turbines</b> operate concurrently to generate power. Through the fuel combustion process taking place inside the combustion chamber, the gas turbine is driven, after which the exhaust gas of the combustion flows into the HRSG to generate superheated steam to be used for driving the HP and <b>LP</b> steam <b>turbines.</b> The steam turbine in a {{combined cycle}} power plant {{is similar to that of}} a steam turbine in a conventional steam plant. The major difference is in the control philosophy of the turbine. In a combined cycle system, the steam turbine can be operated in two different modes; sliding pressure or fixed steam inlet pressure control. In practice, a combination of these operation modes is commonly used for {{combined cycle power plant}}s, depending on the level of power output required. During sliding pressure control, the throttling or control valves are fully open. The steam pressure is a function of the steam mass flow entering the steam turbine. When operating near the base load, most of the steam turbines of combined cycle plants operate on sliding pressure mode. In this thesis, the cause for fluctuation of the HP steam turbine governor after it gets fully opened (governor hunting), is investigated. A dynamic model is developed to represent this status of the steam turbine mainly based on the sliding pressure control mode. Being the components that cause major influence, only the HRSG's HP section, HP governor and HP, <b>LP</b> <b>turbines</b> are used for modeling. This component level modeling is done using the realistic plant operating data. The solutions are simulated using C programming with derived plant data. Whenever plant data is not available, approximated data is being used with reasonable assumptions. When compared the simulation results with the corresponding plant data, it is seen that they are in good agreement. This indicates that the developed models for the components could be used to represent the combined cycle power plant's high pressure section, when operating on sliding pressure control mode...|$|R

5000|$|Leonidas, {{together}} with , {{was one of}} two experimental destroyers ordered in 1912 from Parsons to be fitted with fully geared turbines. Gearing meant that the turbine itself could run at higher speeds than the propeller, which improved efficiency. Two previous experimental destroyers, [...] and [...] had been ordered in 1911 which used gearing for the high pressure (HP) turbines but not for the low pressure (LP) ones. Sufficiently robust gearboxes were at that time experimental and were only just being produced by Parsons who had developed innovative gear cutting equipment. Ships propellers rotated at a maximum speed of 380 rpm, while the <b>LP</b> <b>turbines</b> ran at 1800 rpm and the HP at 3000 rpm. It was anticipated that the additional gearing would produce an overall 10% increase in efficiency, ranging from 9% at full power to 26% at low power, since turbines are more efficient at higher speeds and performance particularly suffered when the engines were running slowly. Comparative tests indicated the savings equated to the ships being able to remain on patrol at cruising speeds for an extra two days as compared to a ship using partially geared turbines. Cost of the ships increased because of providing gearboxes, but this was partly offset against a reduction in the total necessary power from the turbine to achieve a given speed, meaning that smaller and cheaper turbines could be used. Other ships of the class built without LP gearing required 24,500 shp compared to 22,500 shp for this design.|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} study {{aimed at}} improving the understanding of rotating instability in the <b>LP</b> steam <b>turbine</b> last stage working under low flow rate conditions is described in this thesis. A numerical simulation framework has been developed to investigate into the instability flow field. Two <b>LP</b> model <b>turbine</b> stages are studied under various flow rate conditions. By using the 2 D simulations as reference and comparing the results {{to those of the}} 3 D simulations, the basic physical mechanism of rotating instability is analysed. The pressure ratio characteristics across the rotor row tip are found to be crucial to the inception of rotating instability. The captured instability demonstrates a 2 D mechanism based on the circumferential variation of unsteady separation flow in the rotor row. The 3 D tip clearance flow is found not a necessary cause of the instability onset. Several influential parameters on the instability flow are also investigated by a set of detailed studies on different turbine configurations. The results show that the instability flow pattern and characteristics can be altered by the gap distance between the stator and rotor row, the rotor blading and the stator row stagger angle. Some flow control approaches are proposed based on the observations, which may also serve as design reference. The tip region 3 D vortex flow upstream to the rotor row is also captured by the simulations under low flow rate conditions. Its appearance is found to be able to suppress the inception of rotating instability by disrupting the interaction between the rotor separation flow and the incoming flow. Finally, some recommendations for further work are proposed. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R
