The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May, where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for the SS.|$|E

Two days later, Jones {{was hired as a}} land surveyor for the Crown. Jones' first assignments were working as a chain bearer for various teams surveying the Niagara region.|$|E
5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation.</b> When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E

The two quickly become friends, with Garnett's admiration for Esquire's ambition and Esquire's respect for Garnett's success driving the relationship. Esquire sees an opportunity to obtain the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> that would bring about his acceptance to his primary college choice. When Esquire goes to Garnett's house {{to pick up the}} letter, he meets his daughter Erin, who, to his surprise, turns out to be New-New, whose real name is Erin. Erin says that she will reveal where Esquire is really from (something he lied to her father about) if he tells Rashad about her.|$|E
5|$|Luna, repenting for his blunder {{during the}} end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, then {{prepared}} himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} insight into Sorabji's life {{comes from his}} correspondence with Peter Warlock, which began in 1913. At least {{partly as a result}} of Warlock's influence, Sorabji began to focus on composition and music criticism. In those letters he showed great interest in interacting with the world of musicians—an attitude that changed dramatically in later years. The {{first significant}} instance of such interaction took place in November 1919. Sorabji had sent several of his scores, including that of his First Piano Sonata, to Ernest Newman, who paid them no attention. Sorabji then played the piece to Ferruccio Busoni, who expressed some reservations about the work, but gave him a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation,</b> which helped Sorabji get it published.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1927, Messiaen joined Dupré's organ course. Dupré later wrote that Messiaen, having never seen an organ console, sat quietly for an hour while Dupré {{explained}} and demonstrated the instrument, and then came back a week later to play Johann Sebastian Bach's Fantasia in C minor to an impressive standard. From 1929, Messiaen regularly deputised at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, for the organist Charles Quef, who was ill at the time. The post became vacant in 1931 when Quef died, and Dupré, Charles Tournemire and Widor among others supported Messiaen's candidacy. His formal application included a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> from Widor. The appointment was confirmed in 1931, and he remained the organist at the church for more than sixty years. He also assumed a post at the Schola Cantorum de Paris in the early 1930s. In 1932, he composed the Apparition de l'église éternelle for organ.|$|E
5|$|Meksi {{was born}} in 1770 in Labovë, a village near Gjirokastër, and pursued {{secondary}} studies in Ioannina, then an important Ottoman provincial center (now in Greece). His first employment was as a folk physician {{to the court of}} Ali Pasha, the Albanian ruler of the Pashalik of Yanina, a position he held until 1803. Armed with a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> from Ali Pasha, Meksi was admitted to the University of Naples in Italy, where he studied medicine under Dr. Nicola Acuto and practiced in a hospital administered by the parish of San Giovanni a Carbonara. After completing his studies in 1808, Meksi returned to Yanina and once again served in Ali Pasha's court, this time as one of his four physicians. His colleagues were Dr. Metaxa, (degree in medicine from the University of Paris), Dr. Saqeralliu (degree in medicine from the University of Vienna), and Dr. Loukas Vagias, (brother of Thanasis Vagias, with a degree in medicine from Leipzig University).|$|E
5|$|Rashad (T.I.) is a teen {{living in}} Atlanta, Georgia with his Uncle, George (Mykelti Williamson) {{and his little}} brother Ant (Evan Ross). He and his brother were raised by their uncle George since their parents {{died in a car}} accident, and they work with him as part of his {{custodial}} company. When not working or finishing his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E

5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with hopes and dreams, but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
5|$|With Rashad narrating the film's final scene, Teddy {{opens his}} own {{business}} concerning the production of gold teeth, as Big Gipp makes a cameo appearance in his shop, Brooklyn finds {{a job at a}} Krystal restaurant, while Esquire receives a mysterious <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> (presumably from Garnett) and is able to attend his college. The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot more because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a good woman to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E
