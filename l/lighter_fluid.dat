5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid</b> instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged.

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid</b> into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was {{reinforced}} by a British Mission under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton; later arrivals included Niels Bohr and his son Aage Bohr, and Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution {{to the understanding of}} the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This instability at the interface between two fluids of different densities occurs when the <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid</b> is pushing the heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the neutron initiators, and the design of the atomic bomb itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.|$|E

This is followed by a nonlinear regime with bubbles appearing {{in the case of a}} <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> penetrating a heavy fluid, and with spikes appearing in the case of a heavy <b>fluid</b> penetrating a <b>light</b> <b>fluid.</b> A chaotic regime eventually is reached and the two fluids mix.

5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table on the floor next to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid.</b> Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

Lopes was also battling alcoholism at the time. She had been a heavy drinker since the age of fifteen. After another fight between the couple {{in the early morning hours}} of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison's newly purchased shoes into a bathtub, doused them with <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid,</b> and lit them on fire.

25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed from the closet, the smell of {{decomposition}} still lingered in the apartment. Knorr became concerned that the smell and physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings out of the home and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid</b> on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor from the closet to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to keep a low profile. In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Shortly after Robert, Jr.'s arrest, Knorr left Las Vegas and relocated to Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007 AAA decided to create a single top {{championship}} when they introduced the AAA Mega Championship. The tournament saw Cibernético defeat Mr. Niebla in the first round, only for him to lose to his fellow Hell Brother Chessman in the second round. On the same night that El Mesias became the first ever AAA Mega Champion Cibernético, Charly Manson and El Zorro defeated La Secta de Mesias in a Domo de la Muerte match {{that served as the}} main event of the 2007 Verano de Escandalo. As a result of their loss Espiritu had his hair shaved off. Cibernético immediately targeted El Mesias' newly won title, earning a title shot at the 2007 Guerra de Titanes, in a match that also included El Zorro. During the match El Mesias and El Zorro poured <b>lighter</b> <b>fluid</b> on a table, set it on fire and then powerbombed Cibernético through the table. While the stunt was designed to look more dangerous than it actually was, Cibernético suffered serious burns to his back and shoulder when the stunt did not go as planned. AAA wrote the accident into the storyline, making it appear that El Mesias and El Zorro meant to injure Cibernético. Taking advantage of the emotional support Cibernético received during his recovery AAA decided to have Cibernético win the AAA Mega Championship on March 16, 2008 as he defeated El Mesias in the main event of the 2008 Rey de Reyes show. Cibernético would go on to gain revenge on El Zorro for his part in the injury as he successfully defended the AAA Mega Championship against El Zorro in the main event of Triplemanía XVI.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a synopsis of some recent work, still in progress, aimed at elucidating a quantitative {{explanation of the}} processes by which flow chimneys form when certain types of alloys are directionally solidified. If (for example) <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> is released at the liquid-solid "mushy " (dendrite) zone, and cooling is from below, then the intermediate fluid flow undergoes convection through the porous dendrite mass. This can lead to an "instability " of {{the form of the}} mushy zone, such that upwelling <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> flows preferentially in channels within the dendrite mass. What we seek to develop here, is a mathematical basis by which this phenomenon may be properly understood. Accordingly, a mathematical model is developed, simplified, and partially analysed, and as a result we are able to make one specific prediction concerning a criterion for the onset of convection and freckling. This prediction is equivalent to the classical Rayleigh number condition for convective instability. 1...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{instability}} of a layer {{consisting of a}} <b>lighter</b> viscous <b>fluid</b> {{on top of a}} heavier less viscous fluid is considered in the case when the heavy fluid is adiabatically stratified and the <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> contains heat sources and possesses a lower heat conductivity. A perturbation in the thickness of the upper fluid layer causes horizontal temperature variations in the lower fluid. The motions induced by thermal buoyancy can interact with the distortion of the interface {{in such a way that}} the initial perturbation is reinforced in the form of an overstable oscillation. It is proposed that this mechanism is rele-vant to the problem of timedependent flow in the Earth’s mantle. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn many {{multiphase}} systems, material interfaces can be destabilized by shocks. Small disturbances {{at these}} interfaces can grow {{in size to}} form large-scale fingers. We consider a shock propagating through a system that consists of two types of particles, of different mass, that are initially separated by an interface, but are free to mix. In the classical case of immiscible fluids, the finger of heavy fluid propagating into the <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> grows faster and becomes much thinner than the finger of <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> propagating into the heavy fluid. We show that collisions between particles of different types lead to shock focusing that causes a secondary flow that is initially similar to the fluid case. However, the particle system can exhibit completely different qualitative behavior in the nonlinear-growth phase and can give rise to the situation where the finger of heavy material is actually wider than the finger of the light material. We show that this qualitative change {{is due to a}} strong decompression that occurs in the heavy material. We also show that microscopic mixing can have an important impact on finger growth...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{magnetic}} Rayleigh-Taylor instability in three dimensions, with {{focus on the}} nonlinear structure and evolution that results from different initial field configurations. We study strong fields {{in the sense that}} the critical wavelength l_c at which perturbations along the field are stable is a large fraction of the size of the computational domain. We consider magnetic fields which are initially parallel to the interface, but have a variety of configurations, including uniform everywhere, uniform in the <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> only, and fields which change direction at the interface. Strong magnetic fields do not suppress instability, in fact by inhibiting secondary shear instabilities, they reduce mixing between the heavy and <b>light</b> <b>fluid,</b> and cause the rate of growth of bubbles and fingers to increase in comparison to hydrodynamics. Fields parallel to, but whose direction changes at, the interface produce long, isolated fingers separated by the critical wavelength l_c, which may be relevant to the morphology of the optical filaments in the Crab nebula.

In this situation, buoyancy effects are negligible, yet density variations still affect the flow by pure inertial effects through the baroclinic torque. We first re-address {{the effects of a}} finite Reynolds number on the interaction between two identical Gaussian vortices. Then, by means of direct numerical simulations, we show that vortices transporting <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> in a heavier counterpart merge from further distances than vortices in a uniform density medium. On the other hand, heavy vortices only merge from small separation distances. We measure the critical distance a/b 0 of the vortex radii to their initial separation distance. It departs from the homogeneous threshold of 0. 22 in response to increasing density contrasts between the vortices and their surroundings. An analysis of the contribution of the baroclinic vorticity to the dynamics of the flow is detailed and explains the observed behaviour. This analysis is completed by a simple model based on point vortices that mimics the flow. It is concluded that vortices carrying <b>light</b> <b>fluid</b> are more likely to generate large-scale structures than heavy ones in an inhomogeneous fluid. 1...|$|R
