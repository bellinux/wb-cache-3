40|$|Archaeologists {{and historians}} have {{discovered}} {{much about the}} Roman army in Britain. However, archaeological remains found at Roman military sites have seldom been combined with the concepts and methods of New and Processual archaeology. This combination of data and theoretical orientation is utilized in this study to produce new insights {{about the lives of}} the inhabitants of Roman military sites and their surrounding communities. A methodology was developed which used computers to analyze the wealth of archaeological data from Roman military sites in northern Britain by standardizing the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> Roman army <b>installations,</b> and entering artifacts found during excavation <b>of</b> those <b>installations</b> into a database. Inspired by the pattern recognition methodology developed by S. South, the artifacts in the database were organized into functional groups by computer scripts. The patterns within and among those functional groups varied by period of occupation and location within the Roman installations. Concepts proposed by M. B. Schiffer concerning the formation of the archaeological record were used to explain these patterns. Questions about activity areas, refuse disposal, gender and status <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> inhabitants were answered.

40|$|The 7 TeV proton beam {{from the}} LHC ring is ejected {{through a long}} {{transfer}} line to beam dump blocks, approximately 100 m downstream of the ejection septa, a series of dilution kicker magnets provide a sweeping deflection spreading the extracted beam over a 40 cm diameter area {{on the face of}} the beam dump cores. During normal operation, the quality of each dump event must be recorded and verified. The so-called “Post-Mortem” dataset will include information from the beam dumping system (logic signals, kicker pulses…) as well as from the beam diagnostics along the extraction lines. For this purpose, profile monitors in front of the dump blocks must be permanently available during machine operation. With more than 1014 protons stored in LHC, the energy deposited in the screen becomes an issue and thermal-resistant materials have to be considered. In this paper, the design of this quite unusual device is presented. The different technical options considered for the choice of the screen material are discussed first.

40|$|Obstacle {{separation}} distance (pitch) has received little systematic {{study in the}} literature. Either too large or small spacing between obstacles would lead to lesser explosion severity. Therefore, an optimum value of the pitch that would produce the highest flame acceleration and hence overpressure is needed. It was {{the aim of this}} work to investigate the influence of obstacle blockage ratio on the obstacle spacing in gas explosions. The explosion tests were performed using methane-air (10 % by vol.), in an elongated vented cylindrical vessel 162 mm internal diameter with an overall length-to-diameter, L/D of 27. 7. Double 20 - 40 % blockage ratio, BR orifice plates were used as obstacles. The spacing between the obstacles was systematically varied from 0. 5 m to 2. 75 m. The 40 % BR produced the highest explosion severity in terms of overpressure and flame speeds when compared to 30 % and 20 % BR. However, the worst case obstacle spacing was found to be shorter with increase in obstacle blockage. In general, similar profiles of overpressures and flame speeds were obtained for all the obstacle blockages. This trend was equally observed in the cold flow turbulence intensity profile generated behind a grid plate by other researchers. In planning the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> new <b>installations,</b> the worst case {{separation distance}} needs to be avoided but incorporated when assessing the risk to existing set-ups. The results clearly demonstrated that high congestion in a given layout does not necessarily imply higher explosion severity as traditionally assumed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{obstacle}} separation distance on {{the severity of}} gas explosions has received little methodical study. It was {{the aim of this}} work to investigate the influence of obstacle spacing of up to three flat-bar obstacles. The tests were performed using methane-air (10 % by vol.), in an elongated vented cylindrical vessel 162 mm internal diameter with an overall length-todiameter, L/D, of 27. 7. The obstacles had either 2 or 4 flat-bars and presenting 20 % blockage ratio to the flow path. The different number of flat-bars for the same blockage achieved a change of the obstacle scale which was also part of this investigation. The first two obstacles were kept at the established optimum spacing and only the spacing between the second and third obstacles was varied. The profiles of maximum flame speed and overpressure with separation distance were shown to agree with the cold flow turbulence profile determined in cold flows by other researchers. However, the present results showed that the maximum effect in explosions is experienced at 80 to 100 obstacle scales about 3 times further downstream than the position of maximum turbulence determined in the cold flow studies. Similar trends were observed for the flames speeds. In both cases the optimum spacing between the second and third obstacles corresponded to the same optimum spacing found for the first two obstacles demonstrating that the optimum separation distance does not change with number of obstacles. In planning the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> new <b>installations,</b> the worst case separation distance needs to be avoided but incorporated when assessing the risk to existing set-ups. The results clearly demonstrate that high congestion in a given layout does not necessarily imply higher explosion severity as traditionally assumed.

Objectives This study was conducted to determine the proper <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> whiteboard in classrooms of schools of health, and nutrition and food sciences at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS). Patients and Methods In this cross-sectional study, 140 students in schools of health, and nutrition and food sciences at SUMS were investigated. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisted of demographic and anthropometric characteristics, the numerical rating scale and body map. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software version 16 using descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney U test. Results Mean severity of discomfort in neck (2. 38 ± 0. 6) was higher than the other regions of body among the students. The results of this study revealed that the mean severity of discomfort in neck in female students (2. 43 ± 1. 01) was higher than in male ones (1. 27 ± 1. 04). Also, the results showed that the mean severity of discomfort in neck among students who were in the classrooms with window opposite of whiteboard was higher than the students in classrooms with beside window.
