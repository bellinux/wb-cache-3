40|$|Abstract: Once the Rhine {{was one of}} the {{key areas}} for the European sturgeon. In 2010, WWF the Netherlands and ARK Nature started with the <b>Rhine</b> Sturgeon <b>Project</b> in close {{cooperation}} with other organizations. Now, ARK Nature, the Royal Dutch Angling Association, Rotterdam Zoo and WWF the Netherlands would like to make the river Rhine part of the habitat of A. sturio again. A lot of work is done over the last years. The first releases of sturgeons in the Rhine in 2012 generated a lot of positive attention. We were able to inform a large audience and gained support. We concluded that one of the next best steps is a repetition of the experimental releases. It is very important to continue with the experimental releases. Not only to obtain more scientific research and results, but also to keep the attention and the focus on the project in the society and of policy makers. A long term investment leading to a formal re-introduction is the final goal. Therefore the experimental releases are accompanied by a process to gain more support for sturgeon conservation and protection in the Rhine system in the Netherlands and in Germany {{as well as in the}} coastal fishery. Support and approval from the Dutch government and the implication of the German counterparts is very important, for a long term project like this is. During this presentation we would like to present a brief overview of the work that is done last year to gain more attention for the sturgeon conservation in the Netherlands and Europe. But also we would like share our experiences off setting up a new reintroduction project for a highly protected species in Europe...|$|R

All samples were collected {{on a voluntary basis}} from nursing mothers mostly <b>living</b> in North <b>Rhine</b> Westphalia, a federal state in Germany. The samples analyzed so far show a typical pattern of PCDDs and PCDFs. Out of the 210 possible congeners, only those with 2, 3, 7, 8 -chlorine substitution were found. While OCDD normally shows the highest concentration, the levels of the other dioxin congeners decrease with decreasing number of chlorine atoms. A different pattern was found for PCDFs. Within this group 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -P 5 CDF is the most abundant congener, followed by the hexachlorodibenzofurans. The mean level of tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) was found to be of 3. 2 pg/g on a fat basis and for total PCDDs and PCDFs, calculated as I-TEq (NATO/CMMS), 29. 3 pg/g on a fat basis. The investigations of the past 2 years have revealed somewhat lower levels compared to former years. This might be an indication that the efforts undertaken to minimize dioxin emissions and to shut down known sources have already had an effect on the body burden of humans. Although mostly banned for a considerable period of time now, some lipophilic persistent pesticides such as DDT, dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) can still be found in human milk.

40|$|International audienceIn the Upper <b>Rhine</b> Graben, {{geothermal}} <b>projects</b> {{are strongly}} under development, {{particularly for the}} exploitation of fluid in the deeper part of the basin. This type of reservoirs constitutes a fractured dominated system. However, the hydraulic behaviour of the fracture network is poorly known and its knowledge constitutes an important way to better target the exploration works. Combining data from structural analysis, mineralogical analysis of fracture filling from outcrops and drilling cores and fluid geochemical analysis from deep boreholes, we propose {{a new model of}} fluid circulation in the deeper part of the Rhine Graben. The present-day fluids collected from the basement and the Buntsanstein sandstones in the deepest wells have the same originand are totally different to those from Tertiary sediments. These deep fluidshave reacted with deep sedimentary rocks at about 4 or 5 km depth before migrate through the graben and probably diluted at small proportions with meteoritic freshwaters. These fluids circulate through a fracture network constitutes by different sets linked to the tectonic history of the Rhine Graben. In the basement, the Hercynian fractures, oriented NE-SW and NW-SE, show two successive stages of fillingsshowing two fluid circulation pulses: 1) asheared/cataclased phase associated with illite and quartz, which is prior to the graben opening; 2) precipitation of dolomite in tension fractureslinked to theearly stage of the graben formation. An other main direction fracture set is present in the basement, probably reactivated, and in the Permo-Triassic sandstones with a N-S direction. On outcrops, this fracture set have no macroscopic mineralogical fillings, but in boreholes and for some large shear zone in the sandstones, a cataclasis phase associated to quartz and illite, and radial illite in tension fracture in the granite, and barite in the Buntsandstein sanstonesis present. This study suggests that the reactivation of old Hercynian structures, oriented NE-SW and NW-SE, in relation with the Tertiary tectonic history of the graben formation develops the fluid/basement interaction in deep temperature conditions. In the contrary, the N-S large structures favor recent circulation system and rather constitute a recharge drai...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to prove the feasibility of health expectancy analyses with regional administrative health statistics and to explore the utility of the calculated health expectancies in describing the health state of the population living in North Rhine-Westphalia, a Federal State of Germany. Materials and methods Administrative population and mortality data as well as health data on disability and long-term care provided by public services were used to calculate: a) the life expectancy and b) the health expectancies Severe-Disability-Free Life Expectancy (SDFLE) and Long-Term-Care-Free Life Expectancy (LTCFLE) from 1999 to 2005. Calculations were done using the Sullivan method. Results SDFLE at birth was 69. 9 years (males 66. 2 and females 73. 2 years) in 1999 and it increased to 71. 7 years (males 68. 6 and females 74. 7 years) in 2005. The proportion of the SDFLE on the total life expectancy at birth was 89. 8 % (males 88. 6 and females 90. 8 %) in 1999 and 90. 7 % (males 89. 8 and females 91. 4 %) in 2005. LTCFLE at birth was 75. 3 years (males 73. 1 and females 77. 5 years) in 1999 and it increased to 76. 6 years (males 74. 7 and females 78. 6 years) in 2005. The proportion of the LTCFLE on the total life expectancy at birth was 96. 8 % (males 97. 8 and females 96. 1 %) in 1999 and 96. 8 % (males 97. 8 and females 96. 2 %) in 2005. Discussion and conclusion Both health expectancies indicate an improvement in the quantity {{as well as in the}} quality of healthy life for the population <b>living</b> in North <b>Rhine</b> Westphalia and therefore suggest a compression of morbidity from 1999 to 2005. The findings however have several limitations in their sensitivity, since we applied dichotomous valuations to the health states. In addition, the results are restricted to comparisons over time because the morbidity concepts do not allow for comparisons with populations other than the German one. Refined calculations with other summary measures of population health and with health data on other morbidity concepts are therefore reasonable. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the Upper <b>Rhine</b> Graben, {{geothermal}} <b>projects</b> {{are strongly}} under development, {{particularly for the}} exploitation of fluid within {{the top of the}} basement. This type of reservoirs constitutes a fractured dominated system. However, the hydraulic behaviour of the fracture network is poorly known, such as connexion, main fluid flow direction, role of the fault zone versus minor fractures, the deformation types (cataclase, fault, crack [...] .). We propose two approaches to understand the fluid flow for a better geothermal exploitation in the Upper Rhine Graben. The first approach is to study the fillings of the fracture which plug partially or totally the current fluid flow. The second approach is to determine the nature of the palæo-circulations by studying fracture fillings, their textures and establish mineral sequence of fillings in relation to the tectonic phases and the geological history of the basement. And finally we compare chemistry of palæo-fluids with those of present-day fluids which flow in the deeper part of the Upper Rhine Graben. In this work, we propose a combined structural and mineralogical analysis of the fractures and their fillings based on samples collected on the EPS 1 Soultz cores and outcrops on the both flanks of the Upper Rhine Graben. These mineralogical fillings have been sampled within fractures identified by measuring their orientation and defining their relative age. Petrological study (Optical microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope noted SEM, cathodoluminescence noted CL) completed by chemical analyses (Electron Microprobe Analyses, noted EPMA) have been performed {{in order to determine the}} filling minerals and their relationships. Among filling minerals, quartz, carbonates and illite are the major ones. Different types and generations of carbonates (calcite, dolomite, ankerite, Mn-bearing carbonates and siderite) have been highlighted at the scale of the major fracture zones in the upper part of granite, using CL and EPMA. Combined mineralogical, textural and structural data allow establishing a chronology of the palæo-circulations relative to the tectonic phases and the geological history of the basement. We identify the major phases which plug the fractures and, consequently, the set of fractures which remain more permeable to the current fluid flow...|$|R
