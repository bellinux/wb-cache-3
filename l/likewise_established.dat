25|$|In 774, Charlemagne of the Franks invaded and {{conquered the}} Lombard kingdom. In {{the south of}} the peninsula, the Duchy of Benevento {{remained}} independent of Frankish dominion, however. During the period of Carolingian strength, Charlemagne's descendants governed the north of Italy in relative peace, except for the brief period of the rebellion of Bernard and the constant raids from the Slavs to the east and the Saracens to the south. Pirates harassed the Adriatic and Ligurian coasts and the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. The south was very different, as the Lombards were at the height of there power there. Warfare between Lombard and Greek, especially the Greek city-states of the Tyrrhenian, was endemic. The Greek cities fell out of the orbit of Constantinople and Byzantine possessions shrank to their smallest mark as the Lombards and the Saracens increased their predations.

He had really feared, in his behaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a danger of one's liking such a woman too much one's best safety was in waiting at least till one had the right to do so. In the light of the last few days the danger was fairly vivid; so that it was proportionately fortunate that the right was <b>likewise</b> <b>established.</b> It seemed to our friend that he had on each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter: how could he have done so more, he at all events asked himself, than in having immediately let her know that, if it was all the same to her, he preferred not to talk about anything tiresome? He had never in his life so sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark; he had never so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in addressing it to Madame de Vionnet's intelligence. It hadn't been till later that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the pleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked about; it was not till later even that he remembered how, with their new tone, they hadn't so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself. One of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this delightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone; he thought, as he lay on his back, of all the tones she might make possible if one were to try her, and at any rate of the probability that one could trust her to fit them to occasions. He had wanted her to feel that, as he was disinterested now, so she herself should be, and she had showed she felt it, and he had showed he was grateful, and it had been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time. They had had other, but irrelevant, meetings; it was quite as if, had they sooner known how much they REALLY had in common, there were quantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped. Well, they were skipping them now, even to graceful gratitude, even to handsome [...] "Don't mention it!"--and it was amazing what could still come up without reference to what had been going on between them. It might have been, on analysis, nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical glasses; but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have said to her: [...] "Don't like me, if it's a question of liking me, for anything obvious and clumsy that I've, as they call it, 'done' for you: like me--well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose. So, by the same propriety, don't be for me simply the person I've come to know through my awkward connexion with Chad--was ever anything, by the way, MORE awkward? Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and trust, just whatever I may show you it's a present pleasure to me to think you." [...] It had been a large indication to meet; but if she hadn't met it what HAD she done, and how had their time together slipped along so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his happy illusion of idleness? He could recognise on the other hand that he had probably not been without reason, in his prior, his restricted state, for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith.|$|E

We compare a foraminifer-fragmentation-based calcite dissolution proxy (Globorotalia menardii fragmentation index (MFI)) to Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Mg/Sr in several species of deep dwelling planktonic foraminifers. We conducted microfossil and geochemical analyses on the same core top samples taken at different depths on the Ontong Java Plateau to maximize the dissolution signal and minimize the temperature overprint on our data. We also compare elemental ratios from planktonic foraminifer tests to modern bottom water [CO 3] 2 - undersaturation and model-derived estimates of percent calcite dissolved in deep-sea sediments. We find clear linear decreases in Mg/Ca or Mg/Sr in G. menardii and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata with increasing (1) bottom water [CO 3] 2 - undersaturation, (2) percent calcite dissolved in sediments calculated with biogeochemical modeling, (3) MFI, and (4) percent calcite dissolved derived from MFI. These findings lend further support to MFI as a calcite dissolution proxy for deep-sea sediments. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between Sr/Ca and independent dissolution indicators. Our results suggest that Mg/Ca and Mg/Sr from deep dwelling foraminifers could potentially be used as calcite dissolution proxies in combination with independent water temperature estimates. <b>Likewise,</b> <b>establishing</b> the relationship between MFI and dissolution-induced changes in the Mg/Ca of surface-dwelling foraminifers could provide a tool to correct Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperature reconstructions for calcite dissolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Visibly pushdown automata are input-driven pushdown automata that {{recognize}} some non-regular context-free languages {{while preserving}} the nice closure and decidability properties of finite automata. Visibly pushdown automata with multiple stacks {{have been considered}} recently by La Torre, Madhusudan, and Parlato, who exploit the concept of visibility further to obtain a rich automata class that can even express properties beyond the class of context-free languages. At the same time, their automata are closed under boolean operations, have a decidable emptiness and inclusion problem, and enjoy a logical characterization {{in terms of a}} monadic second-order logic over words with an additional nesting structure. These results require a restricted version of visibly pushdown automata with multiple stacks whose behavior can be split up into a fixed number of phases. In this paper, we consider 2 -stack visibly pushdown automata (i. e., visibly pushdown automata with two stacks) in their unrestricted form. Our main results in this regard read as follows: (1) 2 -stack visibly pushdown automata are expressively equivalent to the existential fragment of monadic second-order logic. (2) Over words with multiple nestings, monadic second-order quantifier alternation forms an infinite hierarchy (unlike in the restricted framework by La Torre et al., where full monadic second-order logic is only as expressive as its existential fragment). (3) 2 -stack visibly pushdown automata are not closed under complementation. Finally, we discuss the expressive power of Büchi 2 -stack visibly pushdown automata running on infinite (nested) words. Extending the logic by an infinity quantifier, we can <b>likewise</b> <b>establish</b> equivalence to existential monadic second-order logic. 1...|$|R
