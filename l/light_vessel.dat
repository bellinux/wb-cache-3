The raid was another attempt to lure out {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet {{standing}} by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the IScouting Group at anything less than full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef <b>light</b> <b>vessel,</b> at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th.

2500|$|The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Gaarder and Gran uses {{variations in the}} concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production. [...] Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and stoppered.

[...] The other two vessels are incubated, one each in under light and darkened. [...] After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured. [...] As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration. [...] The <b>light</b> <b>vessel</b> permits both photosynthesis and respiration, so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e. oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration).
