25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just sat in his {{director}}'s chair <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as he}} took up his role, Meyszner {{immediately}} {{ran into}} difficulties with Turner, {{who was responsible for}} internal affairs and co-operation with the puppet regime. Turner was a proponent of strengthening the puppet regime and making use of all Serbs that were willing to collaborate with the occupiers. Meyszner had a diametrically opposed personal view and throughout his time in Belgrade refused to support or work with the Serb authorities, except at a purely tactical level. His dislike of Serbs was so great that he is said to have remarked, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> Serb better than a live one". Meyszner was also reported to have referred to Serbs as [...] "a people of rats" [...] (...) [...] The historian Jonathan Steinberg describes Meyszner as one of Himmler's most brutal subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Beginning at 12:58a.m. {{local time}} (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad {{resident}} Sohaib Athar sent {{a series of}} tweets starting with [...] "Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event)." [...] By 1:44a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as American special forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, [...] "I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto {{to turn off the}} lights and stay inside." [...] Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed. The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field. A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army. [...] "There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured", he said. [...] "There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> body had been dragged out of the compound." [...] Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, went out {{around the time of the}} raid and apparently included the military academy. Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout. One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout.|$|E

Soviet morning papers reported the news on February 1. Western press followed suit; Time magazine, although incorrectly reporting that [...] "there was not enough left of the crushed gondola or the three broken bodies to supply {{the story of the}} tragedy", correctly guessed the roots of the catastrophe: [...] "winter weather had contracted the balloon's gas to such a point that it fell <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> weight".|$|E
2500|$|Caylee Marie Anthony (August 9, 2005 – 2008) was {{a two-year-old}} American girl {{who lived in}} Orlando, Florida (United States), with her mother, Casey Marie Anthony (born March 19, 1986), and her {{maternal}} grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony. On July15, 2008, she was reported missing in a [...] call made by Cindy, who said {{she had not seen}} Caylee for 31 days and that Casey's car smelled <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> body had been inside it. Cindy said Casey had given varied explanations as to Caylee's whereabouts before finally telling her that she had not seen Caylee for weeks. Casey lied to detectives, telling them Caylee had been kidnapped by a nanny on June9, and that she had been trying to find her, too frightened to alert the authorities. She was charged with first-degree murder in October 2008 and pleaded not guilty.|$|E

2500|$|Korine has {{frequently}} been labeled as an enfant terrible and {{been accused of}} exploitation and self-indulgence, to which he has responded, [...] "How can an artist be expected not to be self-indulgent? That's the whole thing that's wrong with filmmaking today... To me, art is one man's voice, one idea, one point-of-view, coming from one person." [...] Korine feels {{there is no need}} to justify or explain the images he puts to the screen, in that they are simply the result of [...] "a cinema of passion and obsession." [...] "I mostly just make things to entertain myself and at the same time hope that there’s some type of audience that likes what I’m doing." [...] Korine adds, [...] "Film is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> art because of people not taking chances." [...] To Korine, the only films that matter are the auteurist works.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Romm, {{the author}} of The Hype About Hydrogen (2005), devoted two {{articles}} in 2014 to updating his critique {{of the use of}} fuel cells in cars. He stated that FCVs still had not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. [...] "It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades." [...] Most importantly, he said, [...] "FCVs aren't green" [...] because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam reforming process. He concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet [...] "either now or in the future." [...] Greentech Media's analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So did Car Throttle. Another Clean Technica writer concluded, [...] "while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage (especially seasonal storage), it looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> end when it comes to mainstream vehicles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E
