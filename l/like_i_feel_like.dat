[...] The song led to him coining his new term for , [...] "MJ-ing": [...] "song is about ballin'. It's <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> ballin’ {{has grown into a}} universal term. You know, anybody can say it. You know, a 5-year-old kid enlisted in minor league sports can say, ‘I’m ballin’.’ The CEO of a business down the street getting off of work, making choices in business left and right, getting into his car, he can say, ‘I’m ballin’.’ A college student could crush up the final exam, end up with a 4.0 GPA, graduate summa cum laude, they could say, ‘I’m ballin’.’ And that's what it's about. It's about ‘MJ’-ing." [...] The song is included in the Target Deluxe Edition as a bonus track.|$|E

500|$|Lovato says, [...] "I {{had a lot}} {{of respect}} for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where she was really amazing and wasn't trying to be sexy or {{anything}} like that." [...] About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, [...] "I just thought she was a great role model. She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything <b>like</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> she set a really great example and she was extremely talented."

5000|$|Paul T. Taylor, who portrays Pinhead in Hellraiser: Judgment, {{described}} the character as [...] "twisted and intelligent". Finding Pinhead's mannerisms and demeanor to be unique among horror icons, Taylor tried to capture {{that in his}} performance: [...] "It's about the stillness. He's already so terrifying that when he makes a move, it means something. He's very economical and when he speaks, he's so eloquent." [...] Taylor also incorporated the uncomfortable make-up and costume into his presentation of the sadomasochist, stating [...] "Pinhead’s always in agony so he <b>likes</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was in character the whole time, and I don’t mean that {{in some sort of}} artistic, lofty way. I mean I maintained the demeanor the whole time because I had to." ...|$|R
500|$|Like {{her debut}} album, Kesha worked with some {{previous}} producers and writers that {{worked with her}} on her first album, such as: Dr. Luke, Ammo, Benny Blanco and Max Martin. Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of <b>like</b> adolescence. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the parents don’t get it, but the kids get it.

5000|$|Glass {{has stated}} on This American Life {{that he is}} a staunch atheist. [...] "It's not <b>like</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I'm a Jew. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> don't have a choice about being a Jew. Your {{cultural}} heritage isn't like a suitcase you can lose at the airport. I have no choice about it. It is who I am. I can't choose that. It's a fact of me," [...] Glass begins. [...] "But even when I was 14 or 15, it didn't make that much sense to me that there was this Big Daddy who created the world and would act so crazy in the Old Testament. That we made up these stories to make ourselves feel good and explain the world seems like a much more reasonable explanation. I've tried to believe in God, but I simply don't." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to negative feedback, Young {{said in an}} interview with Billboard that, [...] "There's definitely a trick. With anything that you do, for anybody, there's always going to be somebody who loves it, somebody who hates it, somebody in the middle. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> read a stat once that was like, [...] "If you put something out, there's 5% of everyone who loves it, 5% who hates it, and 90% of people who just kind of check it out and move on." [...] So, it's definitely a trick to not dwell on the good or the bad. In terms of reading reviews online and things <b>like</b> that, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I've nailed down a super healthy approach at that stuff. So, I will definitely check it out a little bit, but the moment it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> I'm dwelling on it too much or thinking about it too much, I step back and remember at the end of the day, I've just got to do the best job that I know how to do and just be sincere and be honest, try to do the right thing. At the end of the day, people will talk and that's totally cool and I'll just keep fighting the good fight." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, {{obviously}} I {{knew that}} there might be certain expectations. I wouldn't want to call it that {{just for the sake of}} calling it that. I had to make sure that I had the right songs - and just when you think you got it, you listen and you're <b>like,</b> 'Fuck, man. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it needs this or that,' to paint the whole picture. So there's not gonna be, like, continuations of every old song on there or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe, and it's more about the nostalgia." [...] — Eminem, speaking about the album's title with Rolling Stone ...|$|R
6000|$|Once when I {{met him in}} {{the street}} in his Highland clothes, with several knives in his stocking, he said, [...] "When <b>I</b> am dressed <b>like</b> this <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a walking flame," [...] and I think that {{everything}} he did was but an attempt to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a walking flame. Yet at heart he was, I think, gentle, and perhaps even a little timid. He had some impediment in his nose that gave him {{a great deal of}} trouble, and it could have been removed had he not shrunk from the slight operation; and once when he was left in a mouse-infested flat with some live traps, he collected his captives into a large birdcage, and to avoid the necessity of their drowning, fed them there for weeks. Being a self-educated, un-scholarly, though learned man, he was bound to express the fundamental antithesis in the most crude form, and being arrogant, to prevent as far as possible that alternation between the two natures which is, it may be, necessary to sanity. When the nature turns to its spiritual opposite alone there can be no alternation, but what nature is pure enough for that.|$|R

[...] Lovato has said that John Mayer's songwriting has been a [...] "huge influence" [...] on her and that {{after the release of}} Unbroken, her musical style shifted towards hip hop and R&B.

5000|$|While both {{being married}} {{heterosexual}} men, Hank and John Green are supporters of LGBT rights. Arguing {{against those who}} say homosexuality is unnatural, Hank Green states that, [...] "the most natural {{thing in the world}} is complexity, and gender, and sexual orientation are proven over and over again to not be firm lines." [...] Hank adds, [...] "To me, there's only one argument that matters for gay marriage: That all people in our country should be seen as equals {{in the eyes of the}} law." [...] After receiving high ratings on his vlog centered on same-sex marriage, Hank stated, [...] "It's stuff <b>like</b> that where <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we're making the world a better place, and resonating with how people feel about new cultural ideas, and really being a part of the cultural evolution toward a better way of understanding each other and the world." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Egyptian Club {{operated}} {{for fifteen}} years as Portland's only bar targeted specifically to lesbians, until it began having financial troubles in 2010. In August, Davis posted an announcement online that read: The economy has taken its toll on our community and on our bar. It Is with a heavy heart that we must announce the limited future of the Egyptian Club. Without a miracle, we will be having our closing party on Oct. 9, 2010 ... Reason? We have always struggled to keep our doors open. Keeping an establishment of this type and size open requires {{an incredible amount of}} business just to pay the bills. It does not appear as if our community is able to support our efforts at this time, and we are not able to float until this is able to happen ... The miracle we are looking for is either to win the lottery, or an immediate upturn in the economy that would allow for record sales in the near future along with enough residual business to sustain us for however long our community would have us here. With the way we see businesses closing all around us, we {{think it would be a}} miracle for that to happen ... We are not looking for fundraisers, or handouts. Those would only help temporarily. We want to sell our product to people who want it. We are a business. We live by different rules than the non-profit organizations we do fundraisers for ... I can’t believe the overwhelming response to this announcement. It is so nice to know that so many of you care about the future of our business ... Unfortunately, because of the huge drop in sales, we have had to lay off some of our staff members. This was incredibly hard and involved tears on both sides. We are <b>like</b> family. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have failed them. We hope for a miracle so that these layoffs can be temporary ... During these two months prior to our closing, we are committed to bring you the best in entertainment and parties. We want to go out with a bang ... We thank all our loyal patrons that have been with us throughout the years. We love you. You have truly made this bar something special. We all know it is not the bricks and mortar that make a place a home … it’s the people. We are family. You are who we will miss the most.|$|R
