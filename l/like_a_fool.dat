25|$|The {{birth of}} Christian monasticism in {{the deserts of}} Egypt in the 3rd century, which {{initially}} operated outside the episcopal authority of the Church, would become so successful that by the 8th century it penetrated the Church and became the primary Christian practice. Monasticism {{was not the only}} new Christian movement to appear in late antiquity, although it had perhaps the greatest influence. Other movements notable for their unconventional practices include the Grazers, holy men who ate only grass and chained themselves up; the Holy Fool movement, in which acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> was considered more divine than folly; and the Stylites movement, where one practitioner lived atop a 50-foot pole for 40 years.|$|E
500|$|Katy Butler {{wrote in}} the San Francisco Bay Guardian that the TVTV style had {{improved}} since their previous work: [...] "This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting)." [...] However, she described Guru Maharaj Ji and his entourage as [...] "an easy target" [...] and wrote that [...] "anybody can look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> when a smartass wide angle lens distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don't stand a chance". [...] Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work. Bob Williams of the New York Post called the documentary a [...] "deplorable film" [...] and [...] "flat, pointless, television". [...] He wrote: [...] "The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors how it got involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hit 'Em Up" [...] {{has been}} called [...] "controversial," [...] "infamous," [...] "disturbing," [...] and [...] "brutal." [...] Shakur's insults against {{virtually}} the entire East Coast scene of rappers {{were said to be}} ferocious. The song, along with [...] "Dear Mama," [...] has been viewed as one of Shakur's songs that resonated with and was spoken of the most by young people. Some felt that [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] showcased Shakur ranting and raving <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool,</b> and J.R. Reynolds of Billboard called it horrendous, noting that Shakur revealed his true colors upon recording the song. He also {{went on to say that}} although sympathetic to the shooting, [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] had [...] "fan the flames of hatred...and affect an entire black culture's psyche"; he called the song [...] "repugnant and unacceptable." [...] Among associates of Shakur, it was called a [...] "bad-luck song." [...] Los Angeles radio director Bruce St. James called the song [...] "the be-all, end-all, curse-word, dirty-lyric, violent song of all time." [...] Game's manager has called it the best diss record. Documentary filmmaker Carl Weston believed that [...] "most people in Biggie's shoes would have wanted to at least hurt Tupac" [...] in a Spin magazine interview.|$|E

2500|$|Able {{to travel}} {{the world as a}} member of the Bolshoi, Plisetskaya changed the world of ballet by her skills and technique, setting a higher {{standard}} for ballerinas both in terms of technical brilliance and dramatic presence. Having allowed her to tour in New York, Khrushchev was immensely satisfied upon reading the reviews of her performances. “He embraced her upon her return: ‘Good girl, coming back. Not making me look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b> You didn’t let me down.’” ...|$|E

Sharon left Nick afterwards, feeling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{name is a}} {{reference}} to the promises of fake alchemists from the Middle Ages. Seixas criticizes the wishes of the middle class who supported the Brazilian Miracle on the Brazilian military dictatorship saying that the conformist and religious views, such as the euphoria of the middle class citizen, were <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool's</b> gold.|$|R

2500|$|One {{critic who}} found Nabucco revolting was Otto Nicolai, the {{composer}} {{to whom the}} libretto was first offered. A Prussian, Nicolai felt at odds with emotional Italian opera while he lived near Milan. After refusing to accept the libretto proposal from Merelli, Nicolai began work on another offer called Il Proscritto. Its disastrous premiere in March 1841 forced Nicolai to cancel his contract with Merelli and return to Vienna. From there he learned {{of the success of}} Nabucco and was enraged. [...] "Verdi's operas are really horrible," [...] he wrote. [...] "He scores <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> [...] technically he is not even professional [...] and he must have the heart of a donkey and in my view he is a pitiful, despicable composer... Nabucco is nothing but [...] "rage, invective, bloodshed and murder."" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{specials}} were {{broadcast in}} the United States on 21 October 2004. BBC America merged both parts {{into a single}} 135-minute episode entitled The Office Special. The making-of documentary How I Made the Office, previously released on the Series 1 DVD, was broadcast after the special. In a preview in The Hollywood Reporter, Cynthia Littleton highlighted the scene where Brent tells Carol that the documentary crew edited his antics {{to make him look}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> as being true to life, comparing it to the various real-life lawsuits filed by Survivor contestants against CBS. Littleton also commented positively on the scene where Gareth asks Brent to [...] "call ahead", and Brent's music video. In The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley wrote that the specials are [...] "as wickedly, painfully funny as the first two seasons and, in tiny, fleeting doses, as delicately tender".|$|E
2500|$|In the dialogues Plato is {{most celebrated}} and admired for, Socrates is {{concerned}} with human and political virtue, has a distinctive personality, and friends and enemies who [...] "travel" [...] with him from dialogue to dialogue. This {{is not to say}} that Socrates is consistent: a man who is his friend in one dialogue may be an adversary or subject of his mockery in another. For example, Socrates praises the wisdom of Euthyphro many times in the Cratylus, but makes him look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> in the Euthyphro. He disparages sophists generally, and Prodicus specifically in the Apology, whom he also slyly jabs in the Cratylus for charging the hefty fee of fifty drachmas for a course on language and grammar. However, Socrates tells Theaetetus in his namesake dialogue that he admires Prodicus and has directed many pupils to him. Socrates' ideas are also not consistent within or between or among dialogues.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} poems which show a much softer {{side to the}} Icelandic male characters. [...] One of these is in chapter 55 when King Æthelstan {{acknowledges}} the death of Egil's brother, Thorolf's, caused by the King's error in judgement. Egil thanks the king {{with a number of}} praise poems showing how considerate and generous the king is. [...] We see a very different side of Egil in chapter 56 when he declares his secret love for his future wife, in a love poem. In chapters 60-62, Egil is confronted with a situation where he must greet King Eirik, with whom he is on bad terms. King Eirik wants Egil dead and at the urging of his friend Arinbjörn, Egil composes a drápa (one of the most complicated forms of poetry) of 20 stanzas praising the king. Thanks to the poem, Egil is allowed to leave Eiríkr's court alive, since killing him would make Eiríkr look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>fool.</b> In chapter 80, Egil composes another praise poem of 25 stanzas expressing his gratitude towards his lifelong friend Arinbjörn for saving his life in his meeting with King Eiríkr. These more positive poems show us a kinder side to the typically rough and violent people of Egils saga.|$|E
