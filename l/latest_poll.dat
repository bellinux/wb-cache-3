25|$|In April 2001, 63% of Moscow {{residents}} {{had a good}} or very good view of Mayor Luzhkov. However, Luzkhov's ratings steadily declined, {{and according to the}} <b>latest</b> <b>poll</b> from October 2009, only 36% of Muscovites viewed him positively. According to a September 2010 poll, 65% of Muscovites tend to credit Luzhkov for the high quality of life in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Gallup {{found that}} from 2009 through the <b>latest</b> <b>poll</b> in March 2013, public opinion has been nearly evenly split {{on whether to}} give {{priority}} to the environment or to developing energy sources such as oil, gas, and coal. This represents a shift from poll results from 2001 through 2008, when clear pluralities of Americans wanted environmental concerns to take priority over developing fossil fuel resources. However, public opinion still heavily favors an emphasis on wind and solar energy (59 percent) over fossil fuels (31 percent).|$|E
25|$|Although not as {{overwhelmingly}} supportive as it {{was from}} the 1930s through the early 1960s, a clear majority of the American public approves of labor unions. The Gallup organization has tracked public opinion of unions since 1936, when it found that 72 percent approved of unions. The overwhelming approval declined in the late 1960s, but - except for one poll in 2009 in which the unions received a favorable rating by only 48 percent of those interviewed, majorities have always supported labor unions. The <b>latest</b> <b>poll</b> in August 2016 gave labor unions a 56 percent approval rating, versus 36 percent who disapproved of unions.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that voters use {{information}} about the <b>latest</b> <b>polls</b> when generating expectations about election outcomes. Even though many respondents to the 2002 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study can recall the <b>latest</b> <b>polls</b> accurately to within a few seats, voters' recollections are imperfect. Using a two-stage least squares regression analysis, we find that partisan wishful thinking inflates the number of seats the respondent thinks the party received in the <b>latest</b> <b>polls,</b> indirectly increasing the number of seats the respondent predicts the party will win on election day. These partisan biases also exert a separate, direct effect on predictions. These biased expectations were not mitigated by increased levels of political knowledge. We conclude that wishful thinking among Dutch voters has a strong cognitive component based on biased recall of information...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to the debate over which team deserved {{to be recognized as}} the nation's best, the Associated Press decided to hold a post-bowl poll. The AP reported on the rationale for the special poll this way: [...] "The Associated Press is polling sports editors of its member papers throughout the country to help settle the argument as to which is the better football team [...] Michigan or Notre Dame. The AP's final poll of the top ten teams, released December 8 {{at the conclusion of the}} regulation season, resulted in Notre Dame winning first place with 1,410 points. Michigan was second with 1,289... Returns so far received indicate that voting in this <b>latest</b> <b>poll</b> is likely to be the heaviest ever recorded." [...] Another AP report indicated the special poll was [...] "conducted by popular demand" [...] to answer [...] "the burning sports question of the day" [...] and to do so [...] "at the ballot box." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>latest</b> <b>poll</b> in Finland {{about the}} question, 36 percent of Finns {{supported}} {{the return of}} ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper Karjala and the research institute MC-Info Oy on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by Helsingin Sanomat and Suomen Gallup, determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return. In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed. A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing. A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by ProKarelia for asking leading questions, such as, [...] "Do you support the return of Karelia, even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia?" [...] 5% of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances (2.1% of all replies).|$|E
2500|$|UFOs {{constitute}} a widespread international cultural {{phenomenon of the}} last 60 years. Gallup Polls rank UFOs {{near the top of}} lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House. A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed that the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that <b>latest</b> <b>poll,</b> 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life. In the film Yellow Submarine, Ringo states that the yellow submarine that is following him [...] "must be one of them unidentified flying cupcakes." ...|$|E
