40|$|Supervisory signals {{have the}} {{potential}} to make low-dimensional data representations, like those learned by mixture and topic models, more interpretable and useful. We propose a framework for training latent variable models that explicitly balances two goals: recovery of faithful generative explanations of high-dimensional data, and accurate prediction of associated semantic labels. Existing approaches fail to achieve these goals due to an incomplete treatment of a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is always predicting labels from data, not data from labels. Our prediction-constrained objective for training generative models coherently integrates loss-based supervisory signals while enabling effective semi-supervised learning from partially labeled data. We derive learning algorithms for semi-supervised mixture and topic models using stochastic gradient descent with automatic differentiation. We demonstrate improved prediction quality compared to several previous supervised topic models, achieving predictions competitive with high-dimensional <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> on text <b>sentiment</b> analysis and electronic health records tasks while simultaneously learning interpretable topics...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new semi-supervised {{sentiment}} classification method by exploiting {{a large number}} of unlabeled instances to conduct sentiment classification for Web consumer reviews. In the proposed method every consumer review has two views: subjective view and objective view.

This work is trying to combine two kinds of views to carry out sentiment classification. The method is based on the co-training framework which needs three basic <b>sentiment</b> <b>classifiers</b> to iteratively get the final <b>sentiment</b> <b>classifier.</b> In the proposed method, the first <b>sentiment</b> <b>classifier</b> is constructed using the common unigram features coming from consumer reviews.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Logistic</b> <b>regression</b> is an {{important}} technique for analyzing and predicting data with categorical attributes. In this paper, we consider supporting online analytical processing (OLAP) of <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis for multi-dimensional data in a data cube where it is expensive {{in time and space}} to build <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models for each cell from the raw data. We propose a novel scheme to compress the data {{in such a way that}} we can reconstruct <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models to answer any OLAP query without accessing the raw data. Based on a first-order approximation to the maximum likelihood estimating equations, we develop a compression scheme that compresses each base cell into a small compressed data block with essential information to support the aggregation of <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models. Aggregation formulae for deriving high-level <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> models from lower level component cells are given. We prove that the compression is asymptotically lossless in the sense that the aggregated estimator deviates from the true model by an error that is bounded and approaches to zero when the data size increases. The results show that the proposed compression and aggregation scheme can make feasible OLAP of <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> in a data cube. Further, it supports realtime <b>logistic</b> <b>regression</b> analysis of stream data which can only be scanned once and cannot be permanently retained. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our method can dramatically save time and space costs with almost no degradation of the modelling accuracy.
