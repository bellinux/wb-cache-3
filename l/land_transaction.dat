25|$|Although his father's older half-brother, {{the poet}} Thomas Randolph, {{attended}} Westminster School and Cambridge University, {{he did so}} largely on scholarship {{and there is no}} record of any other members of William's family having attended either public school or university. At some point in the late 1650s or 1660s, his parents moved to Dublin, where they both died, his mother around 1669 and his father in 1671, so William may well have spent the bulk of his formative years in Ireland. It is also known that William's uncle, Henry Randolph (1623-?), in 1669 traveled to Britain from Virginia, to which place he had emigrated around 1642. Henry probably encouraged his nephew at that time to return with him to the Chesapeake. In any case, William Randolph was in the colony by 12 February 1672 when he appears in the record as witness to a <b>land</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E
500|$|The local {{connections}} al-Hajj Muhammad {{established as}} a grain merchant would [...] become beneficial in his later recruitment efforts. The web of the al-Barqawi's tribal loyalties proved resourceful, providing him with fighting men and provisions. During the 1930s, al-Hajj Muhammad set up base {{in the vicinity of}} Bal'a, near Tulkarm, and began recruiting and training fighters from the area, including former Ottoman soldiers who brought additional expertise in combat and firearms. Under his command, this group of men would launch minor raids against Jewish settlements and British security personnel. One of the main targets were the orange orchards of newly established Jewish settlements in the Wadi al-Hawarith area west of Tulkarm. These places had mostly been built on the lands of absentee landlords and their peasant tenants had been evicted. Al-Hajj Muhammad had a criminal record with the Mandatory authorities. According to Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath, his alleged crime was committing fraud in a <b>land</b> <b>transaction</b> with a Jewish buyer. However, author and anthropologist Ted Swedenburg wrote Porath's claim was never mentioned by other sources that discussed al-Hajj Muhammad.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in {{relation}} to intended land use change from a micro-scale perspective. A better understanding of <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> is important for understanding and influencing how land is used. The aim is to explore how the different aspects and their interrelations influence landowner behaviour during <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> initiated by the government. The study draws on 42 explorative interviews with land purchasers, land policy experts, planning professionals and local farmers. The study shows that uncertainty, and feelings of justice are pivotal aspects during <b>land</b> <b>transactions.</b> Moreover, <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> are co-evolving with the planning process. Landowners exhibit strategic behaviour based on their personal situation and their expectations on uncertain aspects. The strategies are strongly interrelated with the evolution of land use change. Land use changes are both input on which actors base their strategies, {{as well as the}} outcome of those strategies. The aspects found in this study were strongly interrelated and changed over time. Some aspects were context dependent, while others are expected to influence <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in general. In this light, the strength of a successful planner is twofold: on the one hand a planner needs to be a good communicator; on the other hand a planner should {{be able to deal with}} uncertainty and expectations during plan processes...|$|R

[...] The European purchase of lands from indigenous populations dates back to the legendary Dutch purchase of Manhattan in 1626, [...] "the most famous <b>land</b> <b>transaction</b> of all." [...] More than any other state, New York disregarded the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 and the Nonintercourse Acts of 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, 1802, and 1834, purchasing the majority of the state directly from the Iroquois nations without federal involvement or ratification.|$|E

As the Los Angeles Suburban Homes company, they laid out plans for the towns of Van Nuys, Marion (now Reseda) and Owensmouth (now Canoga Park, West Hills, and Winnetka), a system of highways, and eventual incorporation into the city of Los Angeles. In the [...] "Sale of the Century" [...] in November 1910 they sold the remaining livestock and non-land assets of the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company at auction. The Los Angeles Times called the auction [...] "the beginning of a new empire and a new era in the Southland".|$|E
2500|$|The {{details of}} the early {{dealings}} with indigenous peoples by the Dutch New Netherland settlements are not known with certainty. [...] The first recorded <b>land</b> <b>transaction</b> is reported by a letter from Peter Schagen, the deputy of the Dutch West India Company, on November 5, 1626, claiming: [...] "They have purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indians {{for the value of}} 60 guilders; 'tis 11,000 morgens in size." [...] Many secondary sources simply report this value as $24; of course: United States Dollars (and the United States) did not exist in 1626; 60 guilders likely represented the estimated value of trade goods; the historical exchange rate calculation used to reach this figure is not known (if in fact it is the source of any such calculation). [...] By comparison, the value of the goods on the ship bearing the letter back to the Netherlands was 45,000 guilders. [...] Sixty guilders in 1626, converted and adjusted for inflation, would be $888 in 2001 U.S. dollars. If invested at a 6% interest rate, the sum would have been enough to buy back Manhattan at current realty values (as of 1947).|$|E

40|$|A {{good deal}} of {{research}} has highlighted the surge and development of rural land sales and tenancy contracts in West Africa. However, the commoditization of land, especially through sales, {{does not appear to}} be obvious, as <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> appear to be a major source of tenure insecurity and land conflicts. This issue is linked with the broader issue of identification and recognition of both the land rights that are being transferred and people holding them. This article deals with tensions and conflicts in <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in Côte d'Ivoire and discusses how these transactions might be secured in a context where most transactions occur outside the legal framework. The 1998 Law aims to organise a rapid transition towards private property rights through a nationwide certification and titling program. Due to the socio-political situation, it was only in 2010 that the first certificates were issued and even independently of current political turmoil, there are grounds for doubting the effective implementation of the law. The objective of this article is to consider the issue of securing <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in the pre-certification/titling context, drawing from the author's intensive field research on <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in Côte d'Ivoire. A first section describes the main types of rural <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in Côte d'Ivoire. The second section outlines the sources of tensions and conflicts arising from these transactions. The third section assesses the practices that have emerged spontaneously in rural areas to secure transactions. The fourth section considers the needs and conditions for a public intervention regarding the security of <b>land</b> <b>transactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa {{has led to}} the {{proliferation}} of peri-urban settlements close to cities. Residents who have local tribal as well as migrant backgrounds in these spaces often take land {{matters into their own hands}} leading to diverse <b>land</b> <b>transactions.</b> This paper is based on field research on Domboshava, a peri-urban communal area located 20 km northeast of Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. In this peri-urban communal area, <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> are shifting from customary inheritance in the tribal line to individualized <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> such as direct land sales and renting – prompting the local authority (Goromonzi Rural District Council) to propose rezoning as a solution to increased <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> in in this peri-urban communal area. This strategy has however become part of the problem as <b>land</b> <b>transactions</b> proliferated ahead of the implementation of the rezoning strategy. Forty-one local residents, as well as a number of key informants such as Traditional Leaders and local government officials were sampled for the study. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through structured interviews, review of pertinent documents, as well as observation. I used Hirschman (1970) ’s voice, exit, and loyalty model to reveal the reactions of community residents to the local authority’s rezoning strategy (as a solution to proliferation of <b>land</b> <b>transactions),</b> as well as to demonstrate the community residents’ criticism or disregard of, or compliance with this strategy. My findings reveal that when community residents find themselves stuck within planning strategies they perceive as dysfunctional, they react differently to their situation. Often, this compounds the problems. Appropriate planning strategies that address the challenges in Domboshava are sorely needed.
