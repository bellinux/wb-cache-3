40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{wisdom about}} {{the rise of}} modern products <b>liability</b> law is framed by a debate which took place {{more than a generation}} ago. George Priest argued that modern American products <b>liability</b> law was born as enterprise <b>liability</b> incarnate and consequently ran amok in a nightmare of unlimited <b>liability.</b> Gary Schwartz countered that product <b>liability</b> law strict in name but fault-based in fact. Strict products <b>liability</b> was a revolution in rhetoric alone. To this day, these positions dominate our understanding of products <b>liability</b> law in its formative moment. We are long overdue for a fresh look. This paper argues that Priest was right to argue that modern American product <b>liability</b> law exploded when it was crystallized as a form of enterprise <b>liability</b> in § 402 A of the Second Restatement of Torts. But he loses the thread of the narrative when he claims that strict products <b>liability</b> self-destructed because enterprise <b>liability</b> is inherently limitless Enterprise <b>liability</b> is <b>liability</b> for the characteristic risks of an activity and it is as preoccupied with identifying those risks of activities as fault <b>liability</b> is preoccupied with determining {{the presence or absence of}} fault. Professor Schwartz, for his part, is right that conceptions of balancing, duties of care, and comparative fault all find their ways into product <b>liability</b> law in its formative period. But Schwartz’s identification of products <b>liability</b> with negligence is fundamentally mistaken. In products <b>liability’s</b> formative moment these elements of negligence law were deliberately refashioned to construct a form of <b>liability</b> more strict than ordinary negligence <b>liability.</b> This paper proceeds as follows. Part I briefly traces the long common law pre-history of modern product <b>liability</b> law as it passes through four phases: freedom of contract, negligence <b>liability,</b> warranty <b>liability</b> and strict enterprise <b>liability.</b> Part II explains the idea of enterprise <b>liability</b> as a distinctive conception of tort <b>liability,</b> focused on activities not actions and finding its fullest incarnation in strict <b>liability.</b> Part III explains the <b>liability</b> rules that constituted products <b>liability</b> as enterprise <b>liability</b> with a particular eye to showing how they articulated a distinctive regime consciously designed to be more stringent than ordinary negligence <b>liability.</b> Part IV takes stock of the Priest and Schwartz theses in light of the regime described in Part III. Very briefly, Part IV also suggests why enterprise <b>liability</b> should be considered a valid alternative to negligence <b>liability</b> in the emerging world of autonomous vehicles...|$|R

The <b>liability</b> regime governing geologic carbon storage will shape the technology’s cost-effectiveness and overall attractiveness. We classify {{potential sources of}} <b>liability</b> into operational, in situ, and climate <b>liability.</b> As a first step, we explore in situ <b>liability</b> in the United States. After summarizing legal standards of <b>liability</b> including negligence, breach of implied warranty, strict <b>liability,</b> and product <b>liability,</b> we discuss how <b>liability</b> may be addressed {{at the level of}} the federal government, state government, industry, and the firm. Finally, we address the implications of judicial treatment of <b>liability</b> for carbon storage, including the apportionment of <b>liability</b> and the adequacy of current regulations...|$|R
40|$|Contractual <b>liability</b> proponents {{claim that}} states can best reform {{malpractice}} <b>liability</b> by allowing patients to contract over, and out of, <b>liability.</b> Proponents assert that informed patients {{would be better}} off if allowed to contract over <b>liability</b> than they would if states reformed malpractice <b>liability</b> directly because informed patients would contract for the rules that maximize their welfare. Proponents also claim states reforming malpractice <b>liability</b> could only benefit patients by including a right to contract out of <b>liability.</b> This article demonstrates that these claims are incorrect. Proponents’ faith in informed contracting rests on the incorrect premise that patients obtain the same net benefit from <b>liability</b> imposed by contract as from malpractice <b>liability</b> imposed by the state. Patients who benefit from the deterrence that malpractice <b>liability</b> provides are worse off if required to contract over <b>liability</b> because contractual <b>liability</b> is a fundamentally different, less beneficial, form of <b>liability.</b> Contractual <b>liability</b> is less beneficial and more costly than state-imposed malpractice <b>liability</b> because it is plagued by four inefficiencies: Collective goods, time inconsistency, adverse selection, and network externality problems. Thus, far from expanding choices, the move to contractual <b>liability</b> could hurt patients by forcing them into a form of <b>liability</b> that is both less valuable and more expensive, thereby creating inefficient, welfare-reducing, incentives to waive the right to impose <b>liability</b> by contract for patients who would have benefited from state-imposed <b>liability.</b> This conclusion holds whether patients negotiate <b>liability</b> contracts directly with individual physicians or accept standard form contracts governing malpractice <b>liability</b> offered by their health insurers...|$|R
50|$|In law, strict <b>liability</b> is a {{standard}} for <b>liability</b> which may exist in either a criminal or civil context. A rule specifying strict <b>liability</b> makes a person legally responsible for the damage and loss caused by his/her acts and omissions regardless of culpability (including fault in criminal law terms, typically the presence of mens rea). Under strict <b>liability,</b> there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention. Strict <b>liability</b> is prominent in tort law (especially product <b>liability),</b> corporations law, and criminal law. For analysis of {{the pros and cons}} of strict <b>liability</b> as applied to product <b>liability,</b> the most important strict <b>liability</b> regime, see product <b>liability.</b>|$|R

This chapter reviews six areas of commentary on vicarious and corporate civil <b>liability.</b> It begins by formulating the standard case for vicarious <b>liability</b> {{based on the}} likely insolvency of the firm’s culpable agents {{in the face of}} massive <b>liability</b> for business torts. Next, it addresses cost considerations that militate against imposing vicarious <b>liability</b> on the corporation in some circumstances, and the relationship between corporate <b>liability</b> the structure of <b>liability</b> imposed on corporate agents. Two additional sections of the article review alternatives to traditional vicarious <b>liability</b> regimes, including alternative <b>liability</b> rules for corporate principals (notably a negligence rule) and alternative targets for <b>liability</b> besides the firm (notably top corporate managers). Finally, the chapter reviews recent literature on the distinction between corporate civil and criminal <b>liability.</b> It concludes that the case made out thus for distinguishing between these too forms of corporate <b>liability</b> is weak...|$|R

40|$|Market-share <b>liability</b> {{has been}} one of the most {{controversial}} doctrines in tort law, with a strong plurality of courts rejecting the doctrine on the ground that it radically departs from the fundamental principle of causation. Courts that have adopted this <b>liability</b> rule, though, believe they are adhering to the principle of causation. In the first case to adopt market-share <b>liability,</b> the California Supreme Court claimed that the <b>liability</b> rule is grounded upon an extension of alternative <b>liability,</b> a doctrine that has been accepted by virtually all jurisdictions. The court never adequately explained how alternative <b>liability</b> can be modified to yield market-share <b>liability,</b> and the only explanation provided by torts scholars involves redefining the tort right to permit compensation for tortious risk, conditional upon the occurrence of injury, rather than for the injury itself. However, courts do not conceptualize the tort right in these terms, for otherwise the doctrine of market-share <b>liability</b> would be uncontroversial. As this Article shows, market-share <b>liability</b> can be derived from alternative <b>liability</b> in a manner that neither redefines the tort right nor departs from the principle of causation. Alternative <b>liability</b> permits the plaintiff to prove causation against the group of defendants. This characterization of the causal rule has been recognized by some torts scholars, but has never been justified. The Article shows that evidential grouping is a defensible principle implicit in numerous cases involving analogous causal problems, including the asbestos cases. Evidential grouping not only explains the doctrine of alternative <b>liability,</b> it shows how a modification of that <b>liability</b> rule yields market-share <b>liability</b> largely for reasons given by the California Supreme Court. This conceptualization of alternative <b>liability</b> and market-share <b>liability</b> also explains the otherwise puzzling <b>liability</b> rule adopted by courts in the asbestos cases. Due to this doctrinal unity, the widespread acceptance of alternative <b>liability</b> should make market-share <b>liability</b> more widely acceptable...|$|R
