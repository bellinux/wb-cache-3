50|$|The {{profitable}} eastern spice {{trade was}} cornered by the Portuguese in the 16th century. In 1498, Vasco da Gama's pioneering voyage reached India by sea, opening the first European direct {{trade in the}} Indian Ocean. Up to this point, spice imports to Europe had been brought overland through India and Arabia, based on mixed <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes</b> through the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and caravans, and then across the Mediterranean by the Venetians for distribution in Western Europe, which had a virtual monopoly on these valuable commodities. By establishing these trade routes, Portugal undercut the Venetian trade with its abundance of middlemen.|$|R
50|$|The {{voyage of}} Vasco da Gama around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade, politics, {{and society in}} the Indian Ocean world.

Vasco da Gama having visited Mombasa in 1498, was then {{successful}} in reaching India and this permitted the Portuguese to trade with the Far East directly by sea, thus challenging older trading networks of mixed <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes,</b> such as the spice trade routes that used the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and caravans to reach the eastern Mediterranean.|$|R

The incense land trade from South Arabia to the Mediterranean flourished between roughly the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century CE.|$|R
50|$|Much {{speculation}} has {{surrounded the}} engineering feats required to build Stonehenge. Assuming the bluestones were brought from Wales by hand, and not transported by glaciers as Aubrey Burl has claimed, various methods of moving them relying only on timber and rope have been suggested. In a 2001 exercise in experimental archaeology, an {{attempt was made}} to transport a large stone along a <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>route</b> from Wales to Stonehenge. Volunteers pulled it for some miles (with great difficulty) on a wooden sledge over land, using modern roads and low-friction netting to assist sliding, but it became clear {{that it would have been}} incredibly difficult for even the most organized of tribal groups to have pulled large numbers of stones across the densely wooded, rough and boggy terrain of West Wales.|$|R
40|$|Seaports are {{fundamental}} infrastructures {{for the development}} of commercial relations between the hinterland and the foreland, within the context of maritime economy. A possible way to establish this importance is to evaluate how the seaport policies (local, regional or central management and investments) were responsible for the trade of merchandise between <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes</b> and vice-versa. This issue may be all the more significant if we consider the case of the seaport of Aveiro, located on the Northwest coast of Portugal, subject to diverse localization proposals and finally built far from urban areas (town with a port, which is different from a town within a port). This leads us to reflect on the port management policies from the late 18 th century to the early 19 th century that could be considered suitable for its construction and consolidatio...|$|R
500|$|Roskilde, which {{developed}} as {{the hub of}} the Viking <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> trade <b>routes</b> over a thousand years ago, is one of Denmark's oldest cities. From the 11th century until 1443, it was the capital of Denmark. By the Middle Ages, with the support of kings and bishops, it had {{become one of the most}} important centres in Scandinavia. The Saxo Grammaticus and other early sources associate the name Roskilde (meaning [...] "Ro's spring") with the legendary King Roar who possibly lived there in the 6th century.|$|R
25|$|The peace {{negotiations}} between the Chinese and Japanese ended unsuccessfully, {{due to a lack}} of understanding between the two sides and misrepresentation of the Koreans. The Japanese again invaded Korea in 1597; but this time all three nations were ready for war, and the Japanese were not able to advance as easily as in 1592. The Japanese tried to take Hanyang from both <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes.</b> At first the plan seemed to work well when Todo Takatora defeated Admiral Won Gyun at the Battle of Chilchonryang, but the plan was abandoned when the Korean navy under Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese fleet under Todo Takatora in the Battle of Myeongnyang with only 13 ships. The battle effectively ended the war, and in 1598 the Japanese at last withdrew from Korea after the sudden death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Battle of Noryang marked the end of the war, with the last Japanese units under Konishi Yukinaga leaving Korea.|$|R
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the crusaders allowed Kilij Arslan to {{establish}} his capital at Konya, and also proved to the Muslim world that the crusaders were not invincible, as {{they appeared to be}} during the First Crusade. The crusaders and Byzantines each blamed the other for the defeat, and neither of them were able to ensure a safe route through Anatolia now that Kilij Arslan had strengthened his position. The only open route to the Holy <b>Land</b> was the <b>sea</b> <b>route,</b> which benefitted the Italian maritime republics. The lack of a safe land route from Constantinople also benefitted the Principality of Antioch, where Tancred, ruling for his uncle Bohemond, was able to consolidate his power without Byzantine interference.|$|R
2500|$|Pope Gregory {{had responded}} to {{the call of the}} {{cardinals}} at Livorno in June 1408 with an announcement that he would hold a council, somewhere in the territory of Aquileia or the territory of Rimini. Aquileia ceased to be an attractive venue when its Patriarch announced his adherence to the Council of Pisa and sent representatives to Pisa. On 19 December 1408 Pope Gregory fixed the town of Cividale as the site of his council. [...] His council held its inaugural session on 6 June 1409, the day after he had been formally deposed by the Council of Pisa. The attendance was so embarrassingly small that he had to issue new letters of convocation on 20 June 1409, with a date of 22 July for the Second Session. He authorized his friend King Rupert (Ruprecht) to depose any prelate in his domains who refused to obey the summons to his council. He received a severe blow when the Venetians decided to support the Council of Pisa, since Venice controlled both the <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes</b> between Rimini and Cividale.|$|R

Although Sutter and Marshall originally intended to keep the find a secret, news soon broke attracting three hundred thousand hopefuls from all over North America, and even the world, to the Sacramento River in search of fortunes, kicking off the California Gold Rush. People flocked to the region by the Oregon Trail-Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Southern Emigrant Trail and various <b>land</b> and/or <b>sea</b> <b>routes</b> through the Isthmus of Panama and around southern South America by ship.

A further revelation was the tokens that are shuffled before each game and placed randomly throughout the board. None of the players know which surprise is hidden under each token. The robbers and horseshoes added to the excitement of the game.|$|R

5|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy and in Flanders, {{the rise of}} towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities {{on the shores of}} the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes</b> to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} diplomatic {{communication between the}} Byzantine Empire and the West during the last century of the empire’s life from 1354 to 1453. The first chapter deals with ambassadorial travel to the West, studying <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes,</b> the season of travel, its speed and duration and the choice of vessel for the transportation of ambassadors to western destinations. The second chapter analyses diplomatic missions to the West, examining both the embassies themselves and {{the people involved in}} them, in an effort to create the profile of the late Byzantine imperial ambassador to the West. The third chapter examines specific diplomatic practices focusing both on the different characteristics of each emperor’s reign, and on the late Palaiologan period as a whole. These three chapters are accompanied three Appendices comprised of three main databases that list the embassies of the period, the journeys of the ambassadors and the ambassadors themselves, and a series of tables and charts that further facilitate reading and comprehending the results of this study. Through my research into these aspects of late Palaiologan diplomatic practice, I aim to demonstrate that the late Palaiologoi combined traditional diplomacy and innovative methods, such as their personal involvement in embassies to the West, which reflect the dynamism of the late empire...|$|R

50|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} Kent was first {{attacked}} by Viking raiders {{in the late}} eighth century. Kent and southeast England {{would have been an}} attractive target because of its wealthy minsters, often located on exposed coastal locations. In 804, the nuns of Lyminge were granted refuge in Canterbury to escape the attackers, while in 811 Kentish forces gathered to repel a Viking army based on the Isle of Sheppey. Further recorded attacks occurred on Sheppey in 835, through Romney Marsh in 841, in Rochester in 842, Canterbury and Sandwich in 851, Thanet in 853, and across Kent in 865. Kent was also attractive for its easy access to major <b>land</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>routes.</b> By 811, it is recorded that Vikings built fortifications on the Kentish north coast, and over-wintered their armies on Thanet in 851-52 and Sheppey in 854-55. At this point, Canterbury and Rochester still had Roman walls that could have been refurbished, but they were nevertheless attacked by the Vikings; Rochester in 842, Canterbury in 851, and Rochester again in 885, when they laid siege until it was liberated by Alfred's army.The Burghal Hidage lists the construction of the Eorpenburnam fort, possibly Castle Toll.Hoards have been found, particularly around the West Kent coast, that might have been wealth hidden from the Vikings.|$|R
