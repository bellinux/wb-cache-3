Even at rest, functional brain networks dynamically reconfigure in a well-organized way to warrant an efficient communication between brain regions. However, a precise characterization of this reconfiguration at very fast time-scale (hundreds of millisecond) during rest remains elusive. In this study, we used dense electroencephalography data recorded during task-free paradigm {{to track the}} fast temporal dynamics of spontaneous brain networks. Results obtained from network-based analysis methods revealed {{the existence of a}} functional dynamic core network formed of a set of key brain regions that ensure segregation and integration functions. Brain regions within this functional core share high betweenness centrality, strength and vulnerability (high impact on the network global efficiency) and low clustering coefficient. These regions are mainly located in the cingulate and the medial frontal cortex. In particular, most of the identified hubs were found to belong to the Default Mode Network. Results also revealed that the same central regions may dynamically alternate and play the role of either provincial (<b>local)</b> or <b>connector</b> (global) hubs...|$|R

50|$|A clearer {{record of}} a stricter {{hierarchical}} order of streets appears in surviving and functioning Arabic-Islamic cities that originate in the late first millennium AD such as the Medina of Tunis, Marrakesh, Fez, and Damascus. In these cases there are four classes of streets starting with the cul-de-sac type (1.84-2.00 m wide) and moving up to the <b>local</b> (third order <b>connector),</b> then a collector that usually surrounds a residential quarter (second order connector) and, finally, to the first order connector (arterial). The latter connector usually crossed the city through its centre {{and led to the}} city gates (see drawing). These arterials were decreed to be at least wide enough for two crossing loaded animals, 3.23 to 3.5 m. This tendency for hierarchical organization of streets was so pervasive in the Arab-Islamic tradition that even cities that were laid out on a uniform grid by Greeks or Romans, were transformed by their subsequent Islamic conquerors and residents, {{as in the case of}} Damascus.|$|R
40|$|The {{blogosphere}} {{shows the}} characteristics of a power law distribution where a small set of the bloggers (influentials) get the majority of readership and the vast majority receives little traffic. Blogger recommendation algorithms aim at finding influentials for recommendation, putting bloggers with limited readership at further disadvantage. These bloggers could benefit from mutual endorsement of each other with the eventual goal of forming strong local communities with broader readership. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm to connect blogger pairs with the intent that once connected the bloggers would share a mutually influencing relationship between them. In particular, we compute bloggers’ influence profile based on how much she influences her blog friends and recommend bloggers with similar influence profiles. We characterize bloggers into four different groups: {global leaders, <b>connectors,</b> <b>local</b> leaders, isolates}. Our result shows marginal benefit for isolates and significant benefit for local leaders. Our approach can be instructive in building intelligent recommendation engine for bloggers with limited readership to build strong local communities...|$|R
40|$|Steel angles are {{extensively}} used {{to connect}} concrete floor/roof elements to the supporting beam in typical dry-assembled precast frame structures widely diffused in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world. These connections allow for relative rotation of the floor element in its vertical plane and restrains their relative displacement, avoiding possible loss of support and consequent fall of the floor element when the structure is subjected to lateral load. The diaphragm behaviour of the precast decks relies on these floor-to-beam connections. Their post-addition to unconnected floor-to-beam joints of existing buildings is a typical seismic retrofit intervention. All these applications are often made without an adequate information about the main structural parameters of the connections, due to lack of experimental or theoretical knowledge. An experimental campaign has been performed at Politecnico di Milano within the framework of the Safecast and ReLUIS research projects with the scope of characterising the mechanical behaviour of post-inserted floor-to-beam connections made with hot-rolled angles, cold-formed angles and welded sockets in the direction parallel to the floor element.

40|$|Analysis of plant-frugivore {{interactions}} {{provides a}} quantitative framework for integrating community structure and ecosystem function {{in terms of}} how the roles and attributes of individual species contribute to network structure and resilience. In this study, we used centrality metrics to rank and detect the most important species in a mutualistic network of fruit-eating birds and plants in a cloud forest in the Colombian Andes. We identified a central core of ten bird and seven plant species in a network of 135 species that perform dual roles as <b>local</b> hubs and <b>connectors.</b> The birds were mostly large forest frugivores, such as cracids, cotingas, and toucans, which consume fruits of all sizes. The plants were species of intermediate successional stages with small- to medium-sized seeds that persist in mature forest or forest borders (e. g., Miconia, Cecropia, Ficus). We found the resilience of our network depends on super-generalist species, because their elimination makes the network more prone to disassemble than random extinctions, potentially disrupting seed-dispersal processes. At our study site, extirpation of large frugivores has already been documented, and if this continues, the network might collapse despite its high diversity. Our results suggest that generalist species play critical roles in ecosystem function and should be incorporated into conservation and monitoring programs. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in network theory have {{allowed for the}} study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the <b>local</b> community, and <b>connector</b> hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifyin...|$|R
40|$|Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is an {{emerging}} research field, which uses models to specify {{some or all}} of the game elements that traditionally had been manually coded. The PhD thesis presents research in the MDGD domain, which is intended to push MDGD further towards industrialization by reducing two gaps: 1) The integration of MDGD tools and game engines, and 2) The support for a diversity of game architectures. These gaps have been identified through a literature review of existing MDGD approaches, which is also documented in the thesis. To reduce the first gap, the model-driven approach Engine Cooperative Game Modeling (ECGM) has been proposed, which uses a run-time game engine as the base for building a domain framework, and engine tools together with MDGD tools for creating game code and data. The code generator generates both game code and level data from game models, making the game models operable in the engine tools. ECGM has been evaluated through being instantiated with a Domain Specific Language (DSL), Reactive AI Language (RAIL) tools, and the commercial game engine Torque 2 D. The DSL and engine were used to develop a prototype game, whose evaluation showed that ECGM can significantly improve the productivity and enable an efficient workflow. To reduce the second gap, the game architecture framework Game Worlds Graph (GWG) has been proposed. GWG has then been used as the conceptual base for a MDGD approach supporting a diversity of game architectures. The GWG-based MDGD approach employs the Global World, <b>Local</b> World, and <b>Connector</b> Type concepts in modeling languages, adding the architectural information to the modeled game elements, with which code for different architectures can be generated. To evaluate the approach, a DSL and its tool-chain were created following the approach, and a prototype game supporting three game architectures were developed. The results of the prototyping showed that the MDGD approach and the DSL resulted in significant improvement in productivity and workflow efficiency. Apart from providing a major research contribution bridging the two gaps described above, the GWG framework itself is a valuable research contribution. The framework can be used for 1) analyzing and classifying existing game architectures, which was proven through a systematic review of 40 game architectures, 2) exploring future architectures resulting in the design of a new game architecture, and 3) aiding MDGD. The RAIL and an extended version of RAIL are also themselves valuable research contributions. The RAIL is a DSL for modeling high-level AI in action/adventure games, and the extended RAIL adds network architecture support to RAIL. Both DSLs are supported by their tool-chains including a model-editor, a semantics validator, and a code generator. These two versions of RAIL can be reused in related MDGD projects or be used as the reference DSLs...|$|R

The emphasis in this year’s programme shifted away from awareness building to building both individual and community capacity to prevent bullying. This was driven, in part, by our experience of building awareness and by an analysis of the drivers of bullying. For example, one of the most successful awareness projects last year was the stall that we ran as part of the OAP event. The stall was at the end of an alleyway that had pinned up a number quotes on A 2 laminated posters from some residents about their fear of alleyways and, generally, of walking around their community and from other residents who weren’t fearful and wanted to engage with their community. Everyone who came along the alleyway wanted to discuss what they’d read and consider how they felt about the safety of their community and what coned be done to improve it. These were richer conversations with residents about a very important aspect of bullying (being safe in the street) that we were able to have than with events like Dinner with Difference (a community discussion event) or the community feedback sessions from the in-depth interviews we did last year. What it told us is that communication with residents has to be on their turf and in a way that means they can directly engage with the issues and, hopefully, take action...|$|R
