The nonconstant components, due to skin effect, produce additional degrees of freedom and equations for the homogenized core.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} motors (PMSMs) are exceptionally promising {{thanks to}} their many advantages compared {{with other types of}} electrical machines. Indeed, PMSMs are characterized by their important torque density, light weight, high air gap flux density, high acceleration, high efficiency and strong power-to-weight ratio. A surface-mounted PMSM (SPMSM) is used in this work. The SPMSM is built using a 2 D finite element method (FEM). Cogging torque, torque ripples and back-EMF are examined during the design process in order to obtain sinusoidal back-EMF and to minimise torque ripples which are one of the major problems with PMSMs. Two procedures are used to reduce the cogging torque of SPMSM: the effect of slot opening and the influence of skewing the stator <b>laminations.</b> Cogging torque <b>factor</b> tc and the torque ripples factor tr have been calculated to compare the two configurations (open slots and closed slots). Then, the configuration with closed slots is utilised with skewing the stator laminations for different angle 0 °, 10 ° and 15 °...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{power loss}} in {{laminated}} transformer cores is always {{greater than the}} nominal loss of the electrical steel <b>laminations,</b> by a <b>factor</b> known as the building factor. This paper discussed result of an investigation towards the effect of using two different Grain-Oriented Silicon Iron (3 %SiFe) materials to the 100 kVA three phase distribution transformer. The thicknesses of the material {{that have been used}} in this research are 0. 23 mm and 0. 27 mm. The transformer core will be assembled with 60 o T-joint with 5 mm mitred corner overlap length. Power loss has been measured using no-load test with 29 layer of lamination while nominal loss measured using Epstein test frame. At the operation mode flux density, 1. 5 T, the building factor of the transformer model core material with 0. 23 mm thickness is 1. 219 while with the building factor for 0. 27 mm thickness is 1. 250. This shows that thinner transformer core lamination is better than the other one by 2. 5 % during operation mode...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} are increasingly used in aerospace, naval and high performance civil engineering {{structures such as}} aerospace, submarines, automobiles. The structural components, subjected to in-plane harmonic loads may undergo parametric resonance or dynamic stability due to certain combinations of the applied in-plane forcing parameters and natural frequency of transverse vibration. The parametric instability itself requires investigation of vibration and buckling of structures. The present study deals with free vibration, buckling and parametric resonance behavior of laminated composite plates under in-plane periodic loading under varying temperatureand moisture. In this analysis, the effects of various parameters such as number of layers, aspect ratios, side-to thickness ratios, ply orientations, static load <b>factors,</b> <b>lamination</b> angle {{and the degree of}} orthotropic are studied. A simple laminated plate model based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is developed for the free vibration, buckling and parametric instability effects of composite plates subjected to hygrothermal loading. The principal instability regions are obtained using Bolotin’s approach employing finite element method (FEM). An eight-node isoparametric quadratic element is employed in the present analysis with five degree of freedom per node. The element is modified to accommodate the laminated composite plates under hygrothermal environment, considering the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. The element stiffness matrix, geometric stiffness matrix due to residual stresses, element mass matrix, geometric stiffness matrix due to applied in-plane loads and nodal load vector of the element are derived using the principle of minimum potential energy. They are evaluated using the Gauss quadrature numerical integration technique. Reduced integration technique is applied to avoid the possible shear locking. A computer program based on FEM in MATLAB environment is developed to perform all necessary computations. The basic vibration and buckling experiments are performed on the industry driven woven fiber Glass/Epoxy specimens subjected to hygrothermal environment. The specimens were hygrothermally conditioned in a humidity cabinet where the conditions were maintained at temperatures of 300 K- 425 K and relative humidity (RH) ranging from 0 - 1. 0 % for moisture concentrations. The numerical and experimental results show that there is reduction in natural frequencies and buckling loads with increasing temperature and moisture concentration for laminates both for simply supported and clamped boundary conditions. The dynamic instability study using FEM revealed that, due to the static component of load, the instability regions tend to shift to lower frequencies. The onset of instability occurs earlier and the width of dynamic instability regions increases with rise in temperature and moisture concentration for different parameters. With increase in lamination angle, the width of the instability region becomes smaller. The onset of instability occurs later for square plates than rectangular plates with wider instability region with increase of aspect ratio. The ply orientation significantly affects the onset of instability. It is observed that the excitation frequency increases with introduction of curvatures from flat panel to doubly curved panel in hygrothermal environments. Thus the instability behaviour of laminated composite panels is influenced by increase in number of layers, aspect ratio, side to thickness ratio, increase in static and dynamic load factor, geometry, material, ply lay-up and its orientation. This can be utilized to tailor the design of laminated composite panels in hygrothermal environment...|$|R
40|$|Composites have {{increasing}} {{applications in}} aerospace, civil, automobile and marine engineering. Structural components are often subjected to in-plane periodic loads which {{may lead to}} parametric instability, due to certain combinations of the applied in-plane forcing parameters and natural frequency of transverse vibrations. This phenomenon is called parametric instability or parametric resonance and is often studied in the spectrum of natural frequency and buckling load of structures. The present study deals with free vibration, buckling and parametric instability behavior of industry driven laminated woven fiber composite plates under harmonic in-plane periodic loads. In this analysis, the effects of various parameters such as increase in number of layers, aspect ratios, side-to thickness ratios, ply-orientations, and increase in static load <b>factors,</b> <b>lamination</b> angle {{and the degree of}} orthotropic are studied. The study is experimental but also includes numerical analysis using finite element method (FEM). A simple laminated plate model based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is developed for the free vibration, buckling and parametric instability effects of composite plates subjected to in-plane loading. The principal instability regions are obtained using Bolotin’s approach employing finite element method (FEM). An eight-node isoparametric quadratic element is employed in the present analysis with five degree of freedom per node considering the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. The elastic stiffness matrix, geometric stiffness matrix and mass matrix of the element are derived using the principle of minimum potential energy. They are evaluated using the Gauss quadrature numerical integration technique. A computer program based on FEM in MATLAB environment is developed to perform all necessary computations. The composite plates of different layers with different dimension are manufactured using woven glass fiber and epoxy matrices. The experiments are performed for vibration and buckling (both static and dynamic approach) on the industry driven woven fiber Glass/Epoxy plates after tensile testing, used for characterization. Free vibration characteristics are studied using FFT analyzer, accelerometer using impact hammer excitation. The FRFs are studied to obtain a clear understanding of the vibration characteristics of the specimens. The buckling loads of specimen are found by both static and dynamic approach. Finally, parametric instability experiment is conducted and the effects of increase in static load factor on excitation frequency are studied. Dynamic instability regions (DIR) are plotted for different plate specimens, applying both static and dynamic loading numerically. The numerical and experimental result shows that the natural frequency is the least for cantilever and highest for fully clamped boundary conditions. Comparisons between experimental and FEM results are much better for the free-free and cantilever boundary conditions than other boundary conditions. The different fiber orientation angle affects the buckling load. When ply orientation is increased from 0 0 to 45 0 fiber orientation angles, then the buckling load values are observed to decrease in both experimental method and FEM. So the composite plate with [0] 8 layup shows highest buckling load and with [45 /- 45] 2 s layup had lowest buckling load. The critical/buckling loads reduce significantly depending upon the side-to-thickness ratios and aspect ratios. It is observed that with the increase of static load factor from 0 to 0. 8, the excitation frequencies decrease both numerically and experimentally. The excitation frequencies decrease with increase in lamination angle due to reduction of stiffness and strength of laminated plates. The onset of instability, the width of instability region and its strength are highly dependent on lamination angle. The greater the lamination angle the smaller is the width of instability region for this geometry and material properties. From the above studies, it can be concluded that the parametric instability behavior of woven fiber composite plates is greatly influenced by different parameters such as number of layers, aspect ratios, side-to thickness ratios, ply-orientations, increase in static load factors and dynamic load factors. So, designer has to be cautious while dealing with structures subjected to dynamic loading. This can be used to the advantage of tailoring during design of composite structures.
