50|$|A {{wet clutch}} is {{immersed}} in a cooling <b>lubricating</b> <b>fluid</b> that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In a {{household}} appliance plant, several rinse-free <b>lubricating</b> <b>fluids</b> {{have been used}} instead of neat mineral oils since 1994 : mixtures of isoparaffinic hydrocarbons with 9 to 14 carbons per molecule. As such they denature keratin, irritate and defat the skin, and remove water from it. Work gloves have been worn over plastic gloves and separate, reusable, cotton inner gloves {{have been added to}} absorb sweat since skin problems were first recognized in 1994. All 74 males (mean ± SD, 38. 8 ± 8. 0 years) who work with the fluids were interviewed and given cutaneous examinations when indicated. While 4 cases of severe dermatitis and 31 cases of mild dermatitis were identified, 28 individuals gave a history of similar problems since the use of <b>lubricating</b> <b>fluids.</b> Their symptoms were typical of primary skin irritation. The hands were the commonly affected region (63 of 63 cases: 100 %), followed by the thighs (15. 9 %) and trunk (11. 1 %). The work-related skin symptoms identified were less common in workers who immediately removed the liquid with soap and water, when it is spilled on the hands, than in those who did not, but the difference was not statistically significant (7 / 23 (30. 4 %) vs. 28 / 51 (54. 9 %), p= 0. 051 by chi-square test). Since skin contact with metalworking fluids (MWF) is often unavoidable, good personal hygiene is important in minimizing potential adverse health effects. Health education thus remains the most important preventiv...|$|R

50|$|The Latin {{anatomical}} name is tunica serosa. Serous membranes {{line and}} enclose several body cavities, known as serous cavities, where they secrete a <b>lubricating</b> <b>fluid</b> which reduces friction from muscle movement.

The serous membrane covering the heart and lining the mediastinum {{is referred to as}} the pericardium, the serous membrane lining the thoracic cavity and surrounding the lungs {{is referred to as the}} pleura, and that lining the abdominopelvic cavity and the viscera is referred to as the peritoneum.|$|E
50|$|Some designs {{require that}} only <b>lubricating</b> <b>fluid</b> be measured, because the rotors {{are exposed to}} the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they handle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often used to measure the flow of {{hydraulic}} fluids. Compared with orifice-type meters, PD meters require very little straight upstream piping since they are not sensitive to uneven flow distribution across the area of the pipe. Positive displacement flow meters can provide better relative accuracy at low flows than orifice-type flow meters. However, a positive displacement meter can be considerably heavier and more costly than non-positive-displacement types such as orifice plates, magnetic or vortex flow meters.|$|E

Piston-cylinder friction is a major contributor compared to the other contributors like thrust bearing, piston pin and crank. In the present work,the piston–cylinder interaction inside a small hermetic compressor is modeled using the Reynolds equation which is solved using finite difference method. The model provides key compressor design parameters such as minimum oil film thickness, oil pressure distribution between piston-cylinder, normal forces and friction power loss. The model is validated against data from published literature. Using the above formulation, different concepts have been studied 2 ̆ 6 compared against their friction loss characteristics.
