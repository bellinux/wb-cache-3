25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve the Litany.|$|E

2500|$|Johannes Climacus, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, {{writes the}} {{following}} cryptic line: [...] "Subjectivity is Truth". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, {{it is important to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual who he is in distinction from others. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the unique relationship between the subject and object.|$|E

We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, when you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did in this series, he was awesome.

2500|$|Confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, {{and urged}} the Chinese, {{particularly}} those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, {{he wanted to}} restore the Mandate of Heaven (...) that could unify the [...] "world" [...] ( [...] , [...] "all under Heaven") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as {{a revival of the}} ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of conservatism, but a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power {{on the basis of their}} moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social perfection, and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.|$|E

60|$|Then {{his eyes}} {{fell on the}} bed of mats in the corner, and he went up, {{and he saw the}} dreadful, mutilated, ghastly object which had been Strickland. He was dead.

60|$|But St. John made no reply. He {{lay back}} in his chair, half-seeing the others, half-hearing <b>what</b> they said. <b>He</b> was terribly tired, and the light and warmth, the {{movements}} of the hands, and the soft communicative voices soothed him; they gave him a strange sense of quiet and relief. As he sat there, motionless, this feeling of relief became a feeling of profound happiness. Without any sense of disloyalty to Terence and Rachel he ceased to think about either of them. The movements and the voices seemed to draw together from different parts of the room, and to combine themselves into a pattern before his eyes; he was content to sit silently watching the pattern build itself up, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> hardly saw.|$|R
60|$|In a dead silence, {{save for}} the low voices of the three players, the draw was made. Thirty-four {{thousand}} dollars were already in the pot, and the play possibly not half over. To the Virgin's amazement, Daylight held up his three queens, discarding his eights and calling for two cards. And this time not even she dared <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had drawn.

Presuming on that, he sent his friends away to look for caribou which they couldn't find. Recollect that they owned to being puzzled because he was a good hunter. Then he cleared out by himself, but I believe that if there was any food left in the place he carefully hid it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was his limit o' drift. We walked there an' we {{come down}} through the Gardens--there was a South-Easter blowin'--an' we {{finished}} up by the Docks.

Three days passed, and nothing happened. I was quite patient; the grand open country all round me offered lessons of inestimable value in what we call aerial perspective. On the fourth day, I was absorbed over the hardest of all hard tasks in landscape art, studying the clouds straight from Nature. The magnificent moorland silence was suddenly profaned by a man's voice, speaking (or rather croaking) behind me. 'The worst curse of human life,' the voice said, 'is the detestable necessity of taking exercise. I hate losing my time; I hate fine scenery; I hate fresh air; I hate a pony. Go on, you brute!' Being too deeply engaged with the clouds to look round, I had supposed this pretty speech to be addressed to some second person. Nothing of the sort; the croaking voice {{had a habit of}} speaking to itself. In a minute more, there came within my range of view a solitary old man, mounted on a rough pony." ...|$|E
