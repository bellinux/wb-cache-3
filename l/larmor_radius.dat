A simple model is formulated which allows to calculate the typical currents generated by this mechanism. This enables to make a judgement whether the loops in solar active regions can be heated by the proposed mechanism through associated Ohmic dissipation. It is shown that if the heating region width is of the order of a few proton <b>Larmor</b> <b>radii</b> then the heating of coronal loops could be explained under this conjecture.

This amplification {{may be due to}} plasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated particles, or cosmic rays (CRs), as they propagate ahead of the shocks. One candidate process is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004), caused by the elec-tric current of “unmagnetized ” CRs (i. e., CRs whose <b>Larmor</b> <b>radii</b> are much larger than the length scale of the CRCD modes) propagating parallel to the upstream magnetic field.

Both tangential and rotational discontinuities were identified. Tangential discontinuities were observed every day, even among Alfvenic fluctuations. In particular, on one day during which Alfvenic fluctuations were intense and persistent in a high-speed stream, tangential discontinuities (TD's) were seen throughout the day at an average rate of 0. 5 /hour; rotational discontinuities (RD's) were also observed during this day at a higher than usual rate, the ratio of TD's to RD's being approximately one. The structure of most of the current sheets was simple and ordered; i. e., the magnetic field usually changed smoothly and monotonically {{from one side of the}} current sheet to the other. The thickness distributions of the TD's and RD's with very smooth current sheets were similar.

One candidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004), caused by the electric current of large <b>Larmor</b> <b>radii</b> CRs propagating parallel to the upstream magnetic field.

Foreshocks are primarily populated by suprathermal ions that can generate foreshock disturbances-largescale (i. e., tens to thousands of thermal ion <b>Larmor</b> <b>radii),</b> transient (approximately 5 - 10 per day) structures. They have recently been found to accelerate ions to energies of several keV. Although electrons in Saturn's high Mach number (M > 40) bow shock can be accelerated to relativistic energies (nearly 1000 keV), it has hitherto been thought impossible to accelerate electrons beyond a few tens of keV at Earth's low Mach number (1 M < 20) bow shock. Here we report observations of electrons energized by foreshock disturbances to energies up to at least approximately 300 keV. Although such energetic electrons have been previously observed, their presence {{has been attributed to}} escaping magnetospheric particles or solar events. These relativistic electrons are not associated with any solar or magnetospheric activity. Further, due to their relatively small <b>Larmor</b> <b>radii</b> (compared to magnetic gradient scale lengths) and large thermal speeds (compared to shock speeds), no known shock acceleration mechanism can energize thermal electrons up to relativistic energies.
