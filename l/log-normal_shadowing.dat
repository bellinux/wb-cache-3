2500|$|Building off {{previous}} work done on an Aloha model, the coverage probability {{for the typical}} user was derived for a Poisson network. The Poisson model of a cellular network proves to be more tractable than a hexagonal model. Meanwhile, this observation could be argued {{by the fact that}} a detailed and precise derivation for the channel attenuation probability distribution function between a random node and a reference base-station for a hexagonal model was explicitly derived in; and this result could be used to tractably derive the outage probability. Furthermore, in the presence of sufficiently large log-normal shadow fading (or shadowing) and a singular power-law attenuation function, it was [...] observed [...] by simulation [...] for hexagonal networks and then later mathematically proved [...] for general stationary (including hexagonal) networks that quantities like the SINR and SIR of the typical user behave stochastically as though the underlying network were Poisson. In other words, given a [...] power-law attention function, using a Poisson cellular network model with [...] constant shadowing is equivalent (in terms of SIR, SINR, etc.) to assuming large <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> in the mathematical model with the base stations positioned according to either a deterministic or random configuration with a constant density.|$|E

In order to model a mobile attacker transmitting at 2.4 [*]GHz, we employ Rappaport's <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> model [22] to generate simulated RSS values at a set of receivers, taking into account an independently random amount of signal shadowing experienced at each receiving device. According to Rappaport, the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> model has been used extensively in experimental settings to capture radio signal propagation characteristics, in both indoor and outdoor channels, including in mobility scenarios. In our previous work, we have evaluated HPB results with both <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> simulated RSS values and RSS reports harvested from an outdoor field experiment at 2.4 [*]GHz [9]. We found that the simulated and experimental location estimation results are nearly identical, indicating that at this frequency, the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> model is an appropriate tool for generating realistic RSS values.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{an effort}} to better {{understand}} connectivity and capacity in wireless networks, the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> radio propagation model is used to capture radio irregularities and obstacles in the transmission path. Existing results indicate that lognormal shadowing results in higher connectivity and interference levels as shadowing (i. e., the radio irregularity) increases. In this paper we demonstrate that such a behavior is mainly caused by an unnatural bias of the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> radio propagation model that results in a larger transmission range as shadowing increases. To avoid this effect, we analyze connectivity and interference under <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> using a normalization that compensates for the enlarged radio transmission range. Our analysis shows that <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadowing</b> still improves the connectivity of a wireless network and even reduces interference. We explain this behavior by studying in detail what network parameters are affected by shadowing. Our results indicate that, {{when it comes to}} connectivity and interference, an analysis based on a circular transmission range leads to worst case results. I...|$|E

30|$|An ideal {{hexagonal}} cell {{is assumed}} for each site, while considering only two tiers of cells {{with respect to}} a reference cell in the center, that is, considering 19 cells in our simulation.

We consider a so-called wrap-around structure to remove such a boundary effect. This enables capturing a more accurate level of intercell interference [6, 11].

30|$|In this paper, the PDF of the SINR for the {{downlink}} {{of a cell}} {{has been}} derived in a semianalytical fashion. It models an uncoordinated deployment of BSs which is particularly useful {{for the analysis of}} femtocells in an indoor environment. A practical propagation model including <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadow</b> fading is considered in the derivation of the PDF. The PDF presented in this paper has been obtained through analysis and calculated through standard numerical methods. The comparison with Monte Carlo simulation shows a good agreement, which indicates that the semianalytical PDF obviates the need for complicated and time-consuming simulations. The results also provide some insights into the performance of the indoor femtocells with universal frequency reuse. First, significant outage can be expected for a scenario where femto BSs are densely deployed in an in-building environment. This highlights that interference avoidance and mitigation techniques are needed. The isolation offered by wall penetration loss is an attractive solution to cope with the interference. Second, the SINR can be worsened by uncoordinated transmission powers of BSs. Thus, a coordination of BSs transmission power is needed to prevent a significant decrease in SINR.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{well-known}} {{model for the}} Gaussian Cellular Multiple Access Channel originally presented by Wyner. The first extension to the model incorporates the distance-dependent path loss (maintaining a close relevance to path loss values in real world cellular systems) experienced by the users distributed in a planar cellular array. The density of base stations and hence the cell sizes are variable. In {{the context of a}} Hyper-receiver joint decoder, an expression for the information theoretic capacity is obtained assuming a large number of users in each cell. The model is further extended to incorporate the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadow</b> fading variations, ensuring that the shadowing models are fairly comparable to the free space model. Using these fair models the effect of the shadow fading standard deviation on the information theoretic capacity of the cellular system is quantified. It is observed that a higher standard deviation results in lower capacity if the mean path loss is appropriately adjusted in order to model the mean loss due to the physical obstacles causing the shadow fading. The results validate that larger cell sizes and a higher standard deviation of shadowing (with appropriately adjusted mean path loss) results in lower spectral efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} the {{performance}} of a (UMTS ↔ GSM) inter-system handover algorithm which uses two pairs of UMTS and GSM HO thresholds (Ec/Io threshold for UMTS and RSSI threshold for GSM); one pair of thresholds for making a decision to handover from UMTS to GSM and another pair of thresholds for making a decision to handover from GSM to UMTS. We have designed and implemented the algorithm based on a simulation model of a 37 -cell UMTS/GSM system consisting of an island of 7 UMTS cells surrounded by 30 GSM cells. The simulation model includes mobility of all users in the system and spatial correlation of the <b>log-normal</b> <b>shadow</b> losses in the 2. 1 GHz (for UMTS) and 900 MHz (for GSM) frequency bands. The test mobile is allowed to move along the boundary of the UMTS and GSM cells and evaluated {{the performance of}} the algorithm with the handover rate {{as a function of the}} various handover thresholds in both the networks. We show that by properly building a hysteresis between the UMTSto-GSM HO threshold pair and the GSM-to-UMTS HO threshold pair, a good compromise between call drop rate, and intra- and inter-system handover rates can be achieved. Further, we have analysed the effectiveness of the algorithm by applying time hysteresis values and also by measuring the signal parameters in compressed mode.
