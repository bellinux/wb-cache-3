5|$|Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh (6 August 1942 – 4 April 2004) was a Sierra Leonean {{physician}} and {{expert on the}} clinical treatment of <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever,</b> a viral haemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa caused by the Lassa virus. Conteh studied medicine at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and taught at Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He later returned to Sierra Leone where he joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> program at Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema, first as superintendent and then as clinical director.|$|E
5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever.</b> With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E
5|$|News of {{his death}} spread in Kenema and its environs like a bush fire in the harmattan.

Kenema was thrown into a state of shock and mourning.|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a research}} program for an anthropology of viral hemorrhagic fevers (collectively known as VHFs). It begins by reviewing {{the social science}} literature on Ebola, Marburg, and <b>Lassa</b> <b>fevers</b> and charting areas for future ethnographic attention. We theoretically elaborate the hotspot {{as a way of}} integrating analysis of the two routes of VHF infection: from animal reservoirs to humans and between humans. Drawing together recent anthropological investigations of human–animal entanglements with an ethnographic interest in the social production of space, we seek to enrich conceptualizations of viral movement by elaborating the circumstances through which viruses, humans, objects, and animals come into contact. We suggest that attention to the material proximities—between animals, humans, and objects—that constitute the hotspot opens a frontier site for critical and methodological development in medical anthropology and for future collaborations in VHF management and control...|$|R
40|$|Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>Lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (LF) in humans, a deadly disease endemic toWest Africa {{that results in}} 5, 000 to 10, 000 deaths annually. Here we present results demonstrating that {{functional}} type I and type II inter-feron (IFN) signaling is required for efficient control of LASV dissemination and clearance. Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus (family Arenaviridae), isenveloped and contains two single-stranded RNA segments of ambisense polarity encoding five proteins (1). LASV is the etiological agent of <b>Lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (LF), a severe hu-man disease that is reported in up to 100, 000 patients annually in regions where it is endemic. Mortality varies between 5 % and 10 % for hospitalized patients (3). Individuals succumbing to LASV infection generate very limited or no anti-LASV hu-moral immune response, and histological examination of LF cases has revealed minimal immune cell infiltrates and tissue damage (14). These findings {{support the notion that}} morbidity and mortality associated with LASV infection are facilitated by the failure of the host’s innate defense mechanisms to limi...|$|R

These included the agent causing the new disease hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern US, which he discovered and named. He also led efforts in Africa (Ebola, Marburg, <b>Lassa,</b> Rift Valley <b>fever),</b> Asia (Nipah virus in Malaysia), and South America (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Venezuelan equine encephalitis) to control outbreaks.|$|R
5|$|In 1979, Conteh {{began working}} with the CDC and team leader Joseph B. McCormick at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the {{hospital}} in 1980. The Sierra Leone Civil War broke out in 1991, forcing the CDC to close their program and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict {{and the spread of}} <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{use a small}} animal model, {{based on}} guinea pigs {{infected}} with a non-pathogenic Pichinde virus (PICV), to understand the virulence mechanisms of arenavirus infections in the hosts. PICV P 2 strain causes a mild febrile reaction in guinea pigs, while P 18 causes severe disease with clinical and pathological features reminiscent of <b>Lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> in humans. The envelope glycoproteins (GPC) of P 2 and P 18 viruses differ at positions 119, 140, and 164, all localized to the receptor-binding G 1 subunit. We found that lentiviral pseudotyped virions (VLPs) bearing P 18 GPC show more efficient cell entry than those with P 2 GPC, and that the E 140 residue plays {{a critical role in}} this process. Infection of guinea pigs with the recombinant viruses containing the E 140 K change demonstrated that E 140 of GPC is a necessary virulence determinant of P 18 infections, possibly by enhancing the ability of virus to enter target cells...|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} other {{mathematical}} models which analyze antibiotic resistance from different perspectives: Dasbasi and Ozturk investigated a model of bacterial resistance to multiple drugs and immune system response [9]; Ternent et al. used a model of combined antibiotic and anti-virulent treatment to monitor the population dynamics of bacteria [5]; Ibarguen-Mondragon et al. evaluated a model on bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics caused by spontaneous mutations [10]; D’Agata et al. studied a model of antibiotic resistance in hospitals [8]; Austin and Anderson investigated antibiotic resistance within patient, hospital and the community using a simple mathematical model [11]. Most of the models on bacterial resistance are compartmental models, investigating {{the course of the}} event through changes in the compartments of the model using deterministic differential equation systems. There are also some mathematical models that study fractional derivation on several phenomena like river blindness disease [12]; <b>lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> [13]; rubella disease [14]; immunegenic tumors [15] and heat transfer [16]. Since we concentrate on the random nature of the parameters of the antibiotic resistance model, we will be implementing random effects into the deterministic system rather than fractional derivation. Some modeling studies which compare stochastic and deterministic models in this regard can be given as follows: Imran et al. compared the models for analyzing Hepatitis C [17]; Lahrouz et al. used a SIRS epidemic model for comparison [18] and Bekiryazici et al. compared the results of models for Dengue disease [19].|$|R

25|$|Clinically, <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> {{infections are}} {{difficult}} to distinguish from other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola and Marburg, and from more common febrile illnesses such as malaria.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions of {{the disease}} date from the 1950s. The virus was first {{described}} in 1969 from a case {{in the town of}} Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria. <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> occurs relatively commonly in West Africa including the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ghana. There are about 300,000 to 500,000 cases which result in 5,000 deaths a year.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> (LHF) is a {{neglected}} tropical disease with {{significant impact on}} the health care system, society, and economy of Western and Central African nations where it is endemic. With a high rate of infection that may lead to morbidity and mortality, understanding how the virus interacts with the host’s immune system is of great importance for generating vaccines and therapeutics. Previous work by our group identified a soluble isoform of the Lassa virus (LASV) GP 1 (sGP 1) in vitro resulting from the expression of the glycoprotein complex (GPC) gene [1, 2]. Though no work has directly been done to demonstrate the function of this soluble isoform in arenaviral infections, evidence points to immunomodulatory effects against the host’s immune system mediated by a secreted glycoprotein component in filoviruses, another class of hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses. A significant fraction of shed glycoprotein isoforms during viral infection and biogenesis may attenuate the host’s inflammatory response, thereby enhancing viral replication and tissue damage. Such shed glycoprotein mediated effects were previously reported for Ebola virus (EBOV), a filovirus that also causes hemorrhagic fever with nearly 90 % fatality rates [3 - 5]. The identification of an analogous phenomenon in vivo could establish a new correlate of LHF infection leading to the development of sensitive diagnostics targeting the earliest molecular events of the disease. Additionally, the reversal of potentially untoward immunomodulatory functions mediated by sGP 1 coul...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{order to}} {{optimize}} net transmission success, parasites are hypothesized to evolve towards causing minimal damage to their reservoir host while obtaining high shedding rates. For many parasite species however this paradigm {{has not been}} tested, and conflicting results have been found regarding the effect of arenaviruses on their rodent host species. The rodent Mastomys natalensis is the natural reservoir host of several arenaviruses, including Lassa virus that is known to cause <b>Lassa</b> haemorrhagic <b>fever</b> in humans. Here, we examined the effect of three arenaviruses (Gairo, Morogoro and Lassa virus) on four parameters of wild-caught Mastomys natalensis: body mass, head-body length, sexual maturity and fertility. After correcting for the effect of age, we compared these parameters between arenavirus-positive (arenavirus RNA or antibody) and negative animals using data from different field studies in Guinea (Lassa virus) and Tanzania (Morogoro and Gairo viruses). Results: Although the sample sizes of our studies (1297, 749 and 259 animals respectively) were large enough to statistically detect small differences in body conditions, {{we did not observe}} any adverse effects of these viruses on Mastomys natalensis. We did find that sexual maturity was significantly positively related with Lassa virus antibody presence until a certain age, and with Gairo virus antibody presence in general. Gairo virus antibody-positive animals were also significantly heavier and larger than antibody-free animals. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that the pathogenicity of arenaviruses is not severe in M. natalensis, which is likely to be an adaptation of these viruses to optimize transmission success. They also suggest that sexual behaviour might increase the probability of M. natalensis to become infected with arenaviruses...|$|R
50|$|Later {{that decade}} while at YARU, he characterised novel arboviruses from birds in Egypt. In 1969, his {{research}} turned to outbreaks of <b>Lassa</b> and yellow <b>fever</b> in Nigeria. The following year, with Frederick A. Murphy, he discovered Duvenhage, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses, {{which were the}} first viruses shown {{to be related to}} rabies. He characterised Thottapalayam virus, later shown to be the first hantavirus, from an Indian shrew in 1971. With Murphy and others, he discovered multiple viruses related to bluetongue, including bluetongue 20 virus, the first bluetongue-like virus from Australia. In the late 1970s, with Jim Meegan, he showed that Rift Valley fever virus - previously believed to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, and mainly to infect livestock - was the cause of an epidemic in Egypt in which around 200,000 people were infected. With Allan Steer, {{he was the first to}} describe Lyme disease, a tick-borne bacterial disease, in the US. He subsequently worked on viral hemorrhagic fevers, discovering Sabiá and Guanarito viruses, the causative agents of Brazilian and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers. He also researched dengue and its vaccines.|$|R
25|$|Ribavirin, {{also known}} as tribavirin, is an {{antiviral}} medication used to treat RSV infection, hepatitis C, and viral hemorrhagic fever. For hepatitis C it is used with other medications such as simeprevir, sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a. Among the viral hemorrhagic fevers it is used for <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever,</b> Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection but not Ebola or Marburg.

25|$|At {{the time}} it was discovered, it was thought that Ebola virus is not endemic to Sierra Leone or to the West Africa region and this {{epidemic}} represents the first time the virus has been discovered there.

25|$|About 15–20% of hospitalized <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> {{patients}} will {{die from the}} illness. The overall mortality rate {{is estimated to be}} 1%, but during epidemics, mortality can climb as high as 50%. The mortality rate is greater than 80% when it occurs in pregnant women during their third trimester; fetal death also occurs in nearly all those cases. Abortion decreases the risk of death to the mother. Some survivors experience lasting effects of the disease, and can include partial or complete deafness.|$|E

LASV-encoded L polymerase is required for viral RNA replication and transcription. The functional domains of L-a large protein of 2218 amino acid residues-are largely undefined, except for the centrally located RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) motif. Recent structural and functional analyses of the N-terminal region of the L protein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is in the same Arenaviridae family as LASV, have identified an endonuclease domain that presumably cleaves the cap structures of host mRNAs in order to initiate viral transcription. Here we present a high-resolution crystal structure of the N-terminal 173 -aa region of the LASV L protein (LASV L 173) in complex with magnesium ions at 1. 72 angstrom. The structure is highly homologous to other known viral endonucleases of arena-(LCMV NL 1), orthomyxo-(influenza virus PA), and bunyaviruses (La Crosse virus NL 1). Although the catalytic residues (D 89, E 102 and K 122) are highly conserved among the known viral endonucleases, LASV L endonuclease structure shows some notable differences. Our data collected from in vitro endonuclease assays and a reporter-based LASV minigenome transcriptional assay in mammalian cells confirm structural prediction of LASV L 173 as an active endonuclease. The high-resolution structure of the LASV L endonuclease domain in complex with magnesium ions should aid the development of antivirals against lethal <b>Lassa</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever.</b> Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|New {{guidelines}} are presented {{for the initial}} management of suspected and confirmed cases of viral hemorrhagic <b>fever.</b> <b>Lassa,</b> Ebola, Marburg, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever are the only hemorrhagic fevers with documented person-to-person transmission. Health professionals caring for patients, missionaries, and Peace Corps volunteers, ail serving in Africa, would be the likeliest travelers entering the United States to {{have been exposed to}} these diseases. The communicability of these viruses in the hospital setting may differ, but the consequences of such transmission may be severe as case-fatality rates in hospital outbreaks have been high. Because these viruses have nonspecific symptoms that may resemble those of other diseases, appropriate barrier techniques designed to prevent transmission may not be implemented until late {{in the course of the}} illness. Specific isolation techniques are discussed, including the use of a mobile laboratory. E V E R Y YEAR T H E possibility exists that travelers with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) transmissible from per-son to person—Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, or Crimean-Con-go hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) —may enter the United States. Among U. S. citizens, health professionals in-volved in the care of patients in Africa might be most likely to be exposed to agents of these diseases. Serologic studies have indicated, however, that missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers serving in Africa without obvious or frequent exposure to ill persons may also be exposed.

40|$|The major outer {{membrane}} protein, MOMP, is {{the main}} protein in the outer membrane of pathogenic Campylobacter bacteria.

In our study, we expressed recombinant MOMP in Escherichia 1 coli, developed an alternative method to extract the outer membrane protein from its lipid environment and solved and characterised its crystal structure.

The hospital proved instrumental early on, detecting the first case {{in the country and}} supporting the release of a research paper on Ebola. However, the growing number of cases there led to infection and loss of Sierra Leone's hemorrhagic fever expert, Doctor Khan, and the normal functioning of the hospital was disrupted because of the danger of getting infected by the disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lassa</b> <b>fever,</b> {{also known}} as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), {{is a type of}} viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those {{infected}} by the virus do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Among those who survive about a quarter have deafness which improves over time in about half.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 it was {{discovered}} that samples of suspected <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> showed evidence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone as early as 2006. Prior to the current Zaire strain outbreak in 2014, Ebola had not really been seen in Sierra Leone, or even in West Africa among humans. It is suspected that fruit bats are natural carriers of disease, native to this region of Africa including Sierra Leone and also a popular food source for both humans and wildlife. The Gola forests in south-east Sierra Leone are a noted source of bushmeat.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Global {{travel is}} an {{efficient}} route of transmission for highly infectious pathogens {{and increases the}} chances of such pathogens moving from high disease-endemic areas to new regions. We describe the rapid and safe identification of the first imported case of Ebola virus disease in a traveler to Lagos, Nigeria, using conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a biosafety level (BSL) - 2 facility. Case presentation: On 20 July 2014, a traveler arrived from Liberia at Lagos International Airport and was admitted to a private hospital in Lagos, with clinical suspicion of Ebola virus disease. Methodology and Outcome: Blood and urine specimens were collected, transported to the Virology Unit Laboratory at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, and processed under stringent biosafety conditions for viral RNA extraction. RT-PCR was set-up to query the Ebola, <b>Lassa</b> and Dengue <b>fever</b> viruses. Amplicons for pan-filoviruses were detected as 300 bp bands on a 1. 5 % agarose gel image; there were no detectable bands for Lassa and Dengue viral RNA. Nucleotide BLAST and phylogenetic analysis of sequence data of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) gene confirmed the sequence to be Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV/Hsap/ NGA/ 2014 /LIB-NIG 01072014; Genbank: KM 251803. 1). Conclusion: Our BSL- 2 facility in Lagos, Nigeria, was able to safely detect Ebola virus disease using molecular techniques, supporting the reliability of molecular detection of highly infectious viral pathogens under stringent safety guidelines in BSL- 2 laboratories. This is a significant lesson for the many under-facilitated laboratories in resource-limited settings, as is predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa. </p...|$|R
25|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease, <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> virus, Rift Valley fever, Marburg {{virus and}} Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly {{contagious}} and deadly diseases, with the theoretical {{potential to become}} pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.|$|E
500|$|During {{the civil}} war, Conteh {{was the only}} {{clinician}} in Sierra Leone who had the skills and qualifications to manage patients with <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever.</b> In {{the absence of the}} CDC, the Lassa ward was supported by Merlin, a medical relief agency based in the UK. According to Nicholas Mellor, co-founder of Merlin, [...] "Conteh worked with Merlin to get a new laboratory built that would enable collaboration with international research centres with an interest in haemorrhagic diseases. He also worked on training and <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> awareness campaigns." [...] Conteh's <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> program [...] "provided the blueprint for many experts". In 1996, Daniel Bausch at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine began working with Conteh and the CDC on research related to <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
500|$|Conteh's {{work in the}} Lassa ward spanned 25 {{years and}} saved {{thousands}} of lives. He {{played a key role}} in helping Merlin implement a program to support the Lassa ward and fever control measures in Sierra Leone. Because of his skill and dedication, deaths due to cases of suspected <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> declined by 20%. After Conteh's death, Merlin and the peacekeepers in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) left Sierra Leone and the Lassa ward in Kenema was barely functioning. In 2004, Tulane University, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization, began monitoring <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> patients in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea through the Mano River Union <b>Lassa</b> <b>Fever</b> Network (MRU-LFN). Today, the <b>Lassa</b> <b>Fever</b> Program is fully operational at Kenema Government Hospital, and focuses on [...] "treatment, containment, prevention and research".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conteh coauthored a study {{published}} in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology comparing the efficacy and outcome of diagnosing <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> patients with the indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). According to Iruka N. Okeke, the study [...] "focused specifically on the development of a diagnostic test for Lassa fever". In 2001, Conteh travelled to London, England to attend an international conference on <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> where he presented a paper on managing the disease. Conteh returned to London in September 2003 to receive the [...] "Spirit of Merlin" [...] award for his outstanding role in [...] "saving lives and alleviating suffering".|$|E
500|$|Conteh {{now found}} himself {{in the middle of a}} war zone, {{starving}} and homeless. He wandered about for several months and finally came to Kenema where he began treating the sick in the midst of the fighting. Although he had friends overseas, and could have procured a job outside Sierra Leone, he chose to stay and help his people because [...] "they had no one to help them". Due to the war, most experts familiar with <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> had left the country, and patients suspected of having the disease began to be brought to Conteh for treatment. The Lassa team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). In Kenema, Conteh became director of the only <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> isolation ward in the world. Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front took over the town of Kenema in 1997 and 1999, but Conteh never left his post. It is thought that the rebels spared the hospital from destruction because they were afraid of catching <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever.</b> When the civil war ended in 2002, the government of Sierra Leone began the process of rebuilding the country.|$|E
500|$|Conteh {{spent his}} {{professional}} career working with patients suffering from <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever,</b> a {{viral haemorrhagic fever}} endemic to West Africa. [...] <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> was first {{brought to the attention}} of the public in 1969 during an outbreak in Nigeria. Identified in 1972, the disease is known to spread through its host, the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), and infects an estimated 300,000 people and results in 5000 deaths annually in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. In 1976, a nosocomial outbreak in the Panguma Catholic Hospital attracted attention in the United States. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established research programs in Segbwema, Kenema, and Panguma to study the disease.|$|E
500|$|The natural {{source of}} Ebola virus is {{probably}} bats. [...] Marburg viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys, and <b>Lassa</b> <b>fever</b> by rats (Mastomys natalensis). Zoonotic infections can be severe because humans often have no natural {{resistance to the}} infection {{and it is only}} when viruses become well-adapted to new host [...] that their virulence decreases. Some zoonotic infections are often [...] "dead ends", in that after the initial outbreak the rate of subsequent infections subsides because the viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person.|$|E
500|$|The Lassa ward was short-staffed, and Conteh {{would often}} draw blood from {{patients}} himself.
