40|$|We extend {{algorithms}} for arc consistency {{proposed in}} the literature {{in order to deal}} with (absorptive) semirings that are not invertible. As a consequence, these consistency algorithms can be used as a pre-processing procedure in soft Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) defined over a larger class of semirings: among other instances, for those semirings obtained as the cartesian product of any family of semirings. The main application is that the new arc consistency algorithm can be used for multi-criteria soft CSPs. To reach this objective, we first show that any semiring can be transformed into a new one where the + operator is instantiated with the <b>Least</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Divisor</b> (LCD) between the elements of the original semiring. The LCD value corresponds to the amount we can “safely move” from the binary constraint to the unary one in the arc consistency algorithm (when the × operator of the semiring is not idempotent). We then propose an arc consistency algorithm which takes advantage of this LCD operator...|$|E
40|$|In the future, mobile {{users will}} have the {{possibility}} to {{use a variety of}} wireless access networks simultaneously making the vision "Always best connected" come true. The Internet Protocol (IP) will most likely be the <b>least</b> <b>common</b> <b>divisor</b> allowing service providers to deploy services in a unified way regardless of access network type (being wired or wireless). The 3 GPP-led development of the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a promising step towards the vision. However, {{there are a number of}} obstacles along this way forward. Various deployment difficulties related to already installed base of user and infrastructure equipment and service providers protecting their old investments are the most common obstacles. In addition to those reasons, somewhat conservative regulatory authorities, short-comings in digital rights management, multiple standardization bodies proposing non-aligned solutions, as well as non-uniformed and non-optimized use of radio spectrum do not improve the speed of change. Our research is performed within the area of seamless real-time multimedia distribution in heterogeneous wireless access networks with a user-centric and end-to-end system approach. Having proposed various extensions to Mobile IP (MIP) including multihoming and port-based handling of flows, as well as solutions for global connectivity in ad hoc networks we now present a combined architecture using both MIP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for mobility management where MIP is used for TCP connections and SIP is used for UDP traffic carrying real-time multimedia streams of data.

40|$|Chapter I {{begins with}} {{a brief history of}} the topic of {{greatest}} common subgraphs. Then we provide a summaiy of the work done on some variations of greatest common subgraphs. Finally, in this chapter we present results previously obtained on greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of graphs. In Chapter II the concepts of prime graphs, prime divisors of graphs, and primeconnected graphs are presented. We show the existence of prime trees of any odd size and the existence of prime-connected trees that are not prime having any odd composite size. Then the number of prime divisors in a graph is studied. Finally, we present several results involving the existence of graphs whose size satisfies some prescribed condition and which contains a specified number of prime divisors. Chapter III presents properties of greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of graphs. Then graphs with a prescribed number of greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> or <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples are studied. In Chapter IV we study the sizes of greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of specified graphs. We find the sizes of greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of stars and that of stripes. Then the size of greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of paths and complete graphs are investigated. In particular, the size of <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of paths versus K 3 or K 4 are determined. Then we present the greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisor</b> index of a graph and we determine this parameter for several classes of graphs. iii In Chapter V greatest <b>common</b> <b>divisors</b> and <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiples of digraphs are introduced. The existence of <b>least</b> <b>common</b> mutliples of two stars is established, and the size of a <b>least</b> <b>common</b> multiple is found for several pairs of stars.
