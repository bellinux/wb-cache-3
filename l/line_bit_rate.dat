50|$|The main factor {{involved}} {{with an increase}} in the maximum segment size (MSS) is an increase in the available memory buffer size in all of the intervening persistence mechanisms along the path. The main benefit of this is the reduction of the packet rate, both at end nodes and intermediate transit nodes. As the nodes in general use reciprocating logic to handle the packets, the total number of machine cycles spent processing packet headers decreases as the average MSS of the packets increases given a certain total amount of data transmitted. This relationship becomes increasingly important as average network <b>line</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases to 10 gigabits per second, and above.|$|E
5000|$|Super jumbo frames (SJFs) are {{generally}} considered to be frames that have a payload size of over 9000 bytes. The relative scalability of network data throughput as a function of packet transfer rates is related in a complex manner [...] to payload size per packet. Generally, as <b>line</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the packet payload size should increase in direct proportion to maintain equivalent timing parameters. This however implies the covariant scaling of numerous intermediating logic circuits along the network path to accommodate the maximum frame size required. As it has been a relatively difficult, and somewhat lengthy, process to increase the path MTU of high performance national research and education networks from 1500 bytes to 9000 bytes or so, a subsequent increase, possibly to 64000 bytes for example, may take some time.|$|E

Moreover CPRI <b>line</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> dynamic reconfiguration may spare further capital expenditures by avoiding a peak traffic capacity allocation.

In this work the combined impact of encapsulating CPRI on Ethernet and of the dynamic CPRI <b>line</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> reconfiguration on delay and jitter is evaluated.

After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level.
