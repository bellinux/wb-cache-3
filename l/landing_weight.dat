25|$|Due to {{the severe}} weather {{conditions}} forecast for Hong Kong, {{the flight crew}} had prepared to divert the flight to Taipei if the situation at Hong Kong was deemed unsuitable for landing. Extra fuel was carried for this possibility, resulting in a <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> of 429,557lbs, which is 443lbs below its maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> of 430,000lbs. Based on the initial weather and wind check which was passed to the crew from Hong Kong during the flight, they believed they could land there and decided against a diversion to Taipei. However four earlier flights had carried out missed approaches at Hong Kong and five had diverted.|$|E
25|$|The PA-44-180T Turbo Seminole {{version was}} {{certified}} on November 29, 1979 and built between 1981 and 1982. It features two turbocharged 180hp (135kW) Lycoming TO-360-E1A6D engines, which offer {{a significant improvement}} in performance at high density altitude. The Turbo Seminole had its takeoff gross weight raised to 3925lb (1780kg), while the <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> remained at 3800lbs (1723kg).|$|E
25|$|The PC-24 is a {{twin-engine}} business jet, {{a larger}} jet-powered follow-on {{to the earlier}} Pilatus PC-12. It {{is considered to be}} a short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft, being designed to operate from short and rough airstrips. It incorporates an advanced wing design, with a large double-slotted flap system to achieve the necessary performance, having a stall speed of only 81 knots at the maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upgraded MD530F, {{incorporating}} a 6-bladed, fully articulated rotor blade system made of composite material, a more rugged landing skid for heavier take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>weights,</b> a fully integrated digital glass cockpit with multi-function color displays and a pilot Helmet Display and Tracking System (HDTS), which couples together a targeting FLIR and laser designator.|$|R
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000 the Learjet 31A was again revised. Takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> were increased. The {{original}} design N2 digital {{electronic engine control}} (DEEC) was replaced with an N1 DEEC, and the thrust reversers became standard equipment. The original R12 freon air conditioning system was replaced with an R134A system divided into two zones - cockpit and cabin.|$|R
50|$|Surveyor 1 {{required}} {{a total of}} about 63 hours (2.6 days) to reach the Moon, and Surveyor 5 required 65 hours (2.7 days). The launch weights (at lunar injection) of the seven Surveyors ranged from 995.2 kg to 1040 kg, and their <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> (minus fuel, jettisoned retrorocket, and radar unit) ranged from 294.3 kg to 306 kg.|$|R
25|$|On August 1, 2005, the Santa Monica City Council {{implemented}} a revised landing fee program (Resolution No. 9855) for all transient aircraft (those not {{based at the}} Santa Monica Airport) based on a uniform rate of $2.07 per 1000 pounds of Maximum Certificated Gross <b>Landing</b> <b>Weight.</b> Since the Santa Monica Airport receives no federal, state or local funding to operate, the landing fees fill the gap between other Airport revenue {{and the cost of}} operations.|$|E
25|$|The debris {{ejected from}} the {{airplane}} during the explosive decompression damaged the Number 3 and 4 engines causing visible fires in both. The crew did not get fire warnings from either engine. Engine 3 was experiencing heavy vibration, no N1 reading, and a low EGT and EPR, so the crew shut it down. At 02:20, an emergency was declared and the crew began dumping fuel to reduce the aircraft's <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b> Initially, the pilots pushed the Number 4 engine slightly, but they noticed that its N1 reading was almost zero, its EGT reading was high, and it was emitting flames, so they shut it down as well. Some of the explosively ejected debris damaged the right wing's leading edge, dented the horizontal stabilizer on that side, and damaged the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|The crew, {{after finding}} the plane controllable, decided {{to fly a}} {{racetrack}} holding pattern close to Changi airport while assessing {{the status of the}} aircraft. It took 50 minutes to complete this initial assessment. The first officer and supervising check captain (SCC) then input the plane's status to the landing distance performance application (LDPA) for a landing 50 tonnes over maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> at Changi. Based on these inputs the LDPA could not calculate a landing distance. After discussion the crew elected to remove inputs related to a wet runway, in the knowledge that the runway was dry. The LDPA then returned the information that the landing was feasible with 100 metres of runway remaining. The flight then returned to Singapore Changi Airport, landing safely after the crew extended the landing gear by a gravity drop emergency extension system, at 11:45a.m. Singapore time. As a result of the aircraft landing 35 knots faster than normal, four tyres were blown.|$|E

Statistical methods were used in the past and offered quick group weights, however, they are not capable of computing with accuracy the <b>weight</b> of unconventional <b>landing</b> gears which have special geometries and performances. In this work, <b>landing</b> gear <b>weight</b> is computed using analytical methods. The procedure established by Kraus and Wille is acquired as a baseline so as to create a program able to deal with <b>landing</b> gear <b>weight</b> calculations. This software has been designed to be as much flexible as possible, giving the user the freedom to modify many options and parameters...|$|R
5000|$|Airports, {{and more}} {{specifically}} air cargo, are a significant component of the freight system. It is estimated that in the United States in 2013, over $1.1 billion worth of goods traveled by air. [...] The top five airports in the U.S., ranked by <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> of all-cargo operations in 2014, are Memphis International Airport, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, Louisville International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Miami International Airport.|$|R
40|$|Results of {{tradeoff}} studies {{concerning the}} Mars Surface Sample Return (MSSR) mission are presented. Factors considered include: Mars mission {{opportunities in the}} 1980 - 1990 time frame; design features of the hardware systems used to return the sample; minimization of probability of back contamination; direct entry of the returning sample capsule at earth vs. orbital capture of the capsule for recovery by the shuttle; and possibility of increasing the <b>landed</b> <b>weight</b> at Mars to support MSSR mission modes involving heavier systems...|$|R
500|$|The {{ship was}} armed with sixteen [...] Bofors {{anti-aircraft}} guns, {{but these were}} later reduced to eight. At various times, its aircraft consisted of Hawker Sea Hawk and Sea Harrier (STOVL) jet fighters, Sea King Mk 42B and HAL Chetak helicopters, and Breguet Alizé Br.1050 anti-submarine aircraft. The carrier fielded between 21 and 23 aircraft of all types. Vikrants flight decks were designed to handle aircraft up to , but [...] remained the heaviest <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> of an aircraft. Larger [...] lifts were installed.|$|E
500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{aircraft}} carriers Eagle and Ark Royal, from which the Royal Navy's Phantoms were intended to operate, compared to the US Navy carriers of the period, meant that the F-4K version required significant structural changes compared to the F-4J, from which it was descended, and which performed a similar role. As well as the folding nose radome to allow for storage in the smaller hangars of the British ships, {{it had to have}} a significantly strengthened undercarriage to account for the higher <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> (British policy was to bring back unused ordnance). It had a telescopic nosewheel oleo that extended by [...] to provide an increased take-off attitude (the extension of the nosewheel put the Phantom at a 9° attitude) due to the shorter and less powerful catapults. It was also fitted with drooping ailerons, enlarged leading edge flaps and a slotted tailplane, and increased flap and leading edge blowing, all to improve the lift and handling characteristics of operation from the much smaller carriers of the Royal Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the earlier}} and later takeoff weights {{establish}} the An-225 as the world's heaviest aircraft, being {{heavier than the}} double-deck Airbus A380. It is surpassed in other size-related categories, however: Airbus claims to have improved upon the An-225's maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> by landing an A380 at [...] during tests, and the Hughes H-4 Hercules, known as the [...] "Spruce Goose", has a greater wingspan and a greater overall height. But the Spruce Goose is 20% shorter and overall lighter, due to the materials used in its construction. In addition, the H-4 only flew once, making the An-225 the largest aircraft {{in the world to}} fly multiple times.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} ships were {{commissioned}} in 1951, updated with only 4 guns but quadruple rather than triple torpedo tubes, Q gun being <b>landed</b> as <b>weight</b> compensation.|$|R
50|$|The Gulfstream V (Model GV) was {{certified}} on April 11, 1997. Compared to the Gulfstream IV, {{the engines}} are changed from Rolls-Royce Tay to Rolls-Royce BR700-710A1-10 with increased thrust, higher bypass ratio, and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). Operating ceiling is increased from 45,000 ft to 51,000 ft. It has thrust reversers and composite flight control surfaces. The horizontal tail area is 30% larger, wingspan is increased from 74.6 ft to 93.5 ft, the fuselage is lengthened by 5 foot {{forward of the}} main entry door, and by 2 foot aft of the wing. Maximum takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> are increased by 15%.|$|R
40|$|A timed {{stochastic}} coloured Petri net (CPN) {{model of}} a single runway Ls {{presented in this paper}} that is capable of analyzing the effect of the availability of taxiways on the capacity of the runway and on the timing of a given schedule. The developed CPN model is governed by elementary air traffic control (ATC) principles (one aircraft at a time on runway, arrivals priority on departures), and takes the effect of the aircraft threshold speed categories and their <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> into account. The model is realized by using the design/CPN program package. The model has been verified and validated by using runway occupancy times generated by REDIM. For planning optimal sequences a small scale window method is used...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new trailing arm {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> capacity, a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> may {{be limited}} to a weight lower than the maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> by the most restrictive of the following requirements: ...|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the landing}} weights of most light {{aircraft}} {{are determined by}} structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and not the <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b> Any increase in <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> {{to demonstrate that the}} certification requirements are still met. [...] However, after a lengthy flight, sufficient fuel may have been used, thereby bringing the aircraft back below the permitted maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
50|$|Weight and Balance:When {{the weight}} of the {{aircraft}} is at or below the allowable limit(s) for its configuration (parked, ground movement, take-off, landing, etc.) and its center of gravity is within the allowable range, and both will remain so {{for the duration of the}} flight, the aircraft is said to be within weight and balance. Different maximum weights may be defined for different situations; for example, large aircraft may have maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weights</b> that are lower than maximum take-off weights (because some weight is expected to be lost as fuel is burned during the flight). The center of gravity may change over the duration of the flight as the aircraft's weight changes due to fuel burn or by passengers moving forward or aft in the cabin.|$|R

50|$|As jets began {{flying with}} US {{airlines}} {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the FAA rule in effect at the time mandated that if the ratio between an aircraft's maximum structural takeoff weight and its maximum structural <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> was greater than 105%, the aircraft {{had to have a}} fuel dump system installed. Aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and 727 and the Douglas DC-8 had fuel dump systems. Any of those aircraft needing to return to a takeoff airport above the maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> would jettison an amount of fuel sufficient to reduce the aircraft's weight below that maximum <b>landing</b> <b>weight</b> limit, and then land.|$|E
50|$|If {{the flight}} {{has been of}} short duration, fuel {{may have to be}} jettisoned to reduce the <b>landing</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} and capabilities are described of solar electric propulsion (SEP) for performing Mars Surface Sample Return (MSSR) missions. The {{scope of the}} study emphasizes trajectory/payload analysis and the comparison of mission/system tradeoff options. The MSSR mission is examined only for the 1981 - 82 launch opportunity. Several other study constraints which bear directly on the results obtained are: (1) return samples in the range 5 - 25 kg, (2) use of lifting (offset C. G.) atmospheric entry at Mars which allows a low ratio (1. 25) of entry <b>weight</b> to <b>landed</b> <b>weight,</b> and (3) rendezvous and docking in Mars orbit. Major {{results of the study}} are presented as performance curves of earth departure mass versus sample size for a number of different mission/system options.
