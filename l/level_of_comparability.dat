Recent research by McGraw, Larsen, Kahneman and Schkade (2010) revealed that the occurrence of loss aversion relies on psychological measures and scales. Specifically, loss aversion was present only {{when there was a}} possibility for comparing losses and gains directly (employing unipolar scales) – contextual comparability. Previous studies, however, explored the variation of risky preferences as a function <b>of</b> psychological <b>comparability</b> (Stewart, Chater & Brown, 2006; Kusev, van Schaik,Ayton, Dent & Chater, 2009; Kusev & van Schaik, 2011). Experiment one was designed to test loss aversion for judgements of feelings with non-monetary and monetary, unipolar and bipolar scales. We found that the mismatch (non-comparability) between perceived decision scenario and judged decision content eliminates loss aversion. Experiment two further explored the psychological comparability hypothesis by controlling for <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> between perceived decision scenario and judged decision content.

40|$|Metrics for {{measuring}} the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> corpora or texts {{need to be developed}} and evaluated systematically. Applications based on a corpus, such as training Statistical MT systems in specialised narrow domains, require finding a reasonable balance between the size of the corpus and its consistency, with controlled and benchmarked <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> for any newly added sections. In this article we propose a method that can meta-evaluate comparability metrics by calculating monolingual comparability scores separately on the 'source' and 'target' sides of parallel corpora. The range of scores on the source side is then correlated (using Pearson's r coefficient) with the range of 'target' scores; the higher the correlation - the more reliable is the metric. The intuition is that a good metric should yield the same distance between different domains in different languages. Our method gives consistent results for the same metrics on different data sets, which indicates that it is reliable and can be used for metric comparison or for optimising settings of parametrised metrics.

40|$|International {{convergence}} of financial reporting with adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) {{by more than}} 120 countries has increasingly been recognized as an important and controversial topic. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is largely responsible for developing IFRS and the approach adopted by the IASB for developing IFRS is called ‘substance over form’. This approach requires accountants exercising their judgments in interpreting and applying IFRS. Implicit in the drive for worldwide adoption of IFRS {{is the belief that}} a single set of accounting standards will result in a greater <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> across countries, and importantly, the IASB assume that accounting standards are neutral and value free.

40|$|Gender wage {{differentials}} and discrimination are issues of primary significance {{both in terms}} of equity and efficiency. Current policy debate emphasises the importance of labour market efficiency with various HM Treasury reports highlighting productivity as the key determinant of economic growth. Consequently a deeper understanding of where the labour market allocates its scare human resource inefficiently, as a result of discrimination, is always desirable. The vast majority of the existing literature is based upon single country studies using cross-sectional data. This has led to weaknesses in our understanding of the inter-temporal processes generating changes to the wage gap, as well as the impact of national differences to relative cross-country gender differentials. Using the UK as the major focus, and other European countries for comparison, this thesis improves upon both of these. Paying particular attention to the roles played by inequality and sample selection. Blau and Kahn (1992) initially highlighted the importance of wage inequality to cross-country wage gaps. This is built upon by applying the techniques they pioneered and making use <b>of</b> the higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> and compatibility inherent within the Panel Comparability Project (PACO) and European Community Household Panel (ECHP) data sets. With the analysis revealing that the gender wage gap would be narrower in the UK if the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> inequality was reduced to those in the rest of Europe. Thus supporting the view that a compression of the overall wage distribution leads to smaller gender wage gaps. The issue of sample selection is always present when empirical work is based upon earnings functions. Since Heckman (1979) it has become the norm to correct for possible bias using his two-stage procedure. However this is generally treated as a technical exercise and rarely warrants any meaningful discussion. Unfortunately selectivity is not merely a source of potential bias it also reflects relationships that have a significant effect upon the gender wage gap, most importantly its inter-temporal path. Consequently there is a clear need for a deeper understanding of this issue. It is revealed to be important, especially in the UK, where changes to the skill <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> those employed, relative to the overall population, are shown to be crucial to the narrowing of the wage gap. With this improvement resulting from more favourable skill endowments for those women entering or re-entering paid employment. This indicates that policies addressing human capital accumulation prior to labour market entry have already been successful in narrowing the differential. However there is still evidence that women are receiving inequitable returns from their human capital, hence more effective legislation addressing {{this is a matter of}} priorit...|$|R

Design: To establish the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> {{at the food}} level, the EFCOSUM group benefited from the work already carried out within other European projects, which established a Euro Food Groups (EFG) classification system. Four food groups, ie bread, vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits (excluding fruit juice) and fish and seafood, were judged on their applicability for making food consumption data comparable across countries at the food level. Conclusions: It was concluded that the EFG system could be used but that still much work has to be done. For food consumption data to be collected in the future, the software {{that will be used}} should enable conversion of foods 'as consumed' to foods at the 'raw edible' level.

Quantitative multi-parameter mapping (MPM) was designed to provide MR parameter measures that are comparable across sites and time points, i. e., 1 mm high-resolution maps of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R 1 = 1 /T 1), effective proton density (PD(*)), magnetization transfer saturation (MT) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R 2 (*) = 1 /T 2 (*)). MPM was validated at 3 T for use in multi-center studies by scanning five volunteers at three different sites. We determined the inter-site bias, inter-site and intra-site coefficient of variation (CoV) for typical morphometric measures [i. e., gray matter (GM) probability maps used in voxel-based morphometry] and the four quantitative parameters. The inter-site bias and CoV were smaller than 3. 1 and 8 %, respectively, except for the inter-site CoV of R 2 (*) (< 20 %).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I aim to answer two questions: Are {{alternatives}} for choice ever incomparable? and, In what ways can items be compared? I {{argue that there}} is no incomparability among bearers of value and that the ways in which items can be compared are richer and more varied than commonly supposed. The two questions are closely related; in arguing against incomparability a positive picture <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> emerges. The case against incomparability is a case for a new conception <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> more capacious than has been traditionally conceived. This 'broad' conception <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> has three distinctive features: it distinguishes incomparability from non comparability, it includes the possibility <b>of</b> 'emphatic' <b>comparability,</b> or comparisons between 'higher' and 'lower' goods; and it makes logical space for a fourth generic value relation - what I shall call 'on a par' - beyond the standard trichotomy of relations of 'better than', 'worse than', and 'equally good'. Each of these features arises out of defects of certain incomparabilist arguments. Indeed, the approach to the broad conception <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> via examination <b>of</b> incomparabilist arguments makes clear that much of the intuitive pull of incomparability depends on a narrow and impoverished conception <b>of</b> <b>comparability.</b> Investigation <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> and incomparability is motivated by a proposed substantive account of practical justification according to which there can be no justified choice without the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the alternatives. The existence of widespread incomparability, then, undermines the rationality of practical life.

40|$|Purpose-The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a judgment on the comparability of financial statements prepared under IFRS and US-GAAP. We developed two research questions for evaluating comparability within Europe (IFRS) and within the US (US GAAP) and for testing whether comparability is higher or lower when the US companies are included with the European countries. Design/Methodology/Approach-The T index framework was used to summarize the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> for 13 accounting items using data from 250 companies. Findings-Empirical results are mixed. Of 13 accounting items considered, international comparability is significantly lower for 7 items and significantly higher for 4 items when the US companies are included. Furthermore, comparability amongst companies using IFRS is not consistently higher or lower than comparability amongst companies using US GAAP. Practical implications-Answers to the research questions may provide useful suggestions for IASB’s current policy direction towards global accounting standards convergence, and in particular for the IASB-FASB convergence project. The results also have implications for companies or countries considering shifting to IFRS or US GAAP. Research limitations/implications-Lack of comparability within countries, rather than between countries, suggests a need to focus on reducing options within standards rather than on differences between standards or countries. Originality value-Our empirical results show that in most cases lack of comparability may be driven by options within a standard rather than by explicit differences between standards...|$|E
