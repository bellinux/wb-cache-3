5|$|The Yankees {{felt that}} Vick had not <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to his {{potential}} during his four {{seasons with the}} team. Considering the team now had a solid outfield of Ruth, Meusel, Lewis, and Bodie, and the Yankees needed pitching; Vick became expendable. On December15, 1920, the Yankees traded Vick, Muddy Ruel, Del Pratt and Hank Thormahlen to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Wally Schang and Mike McNally.|$|E
5|$|Another of the property's buildings, {{commonly}} called the carriage house, never <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to its popular name. The building never housed any carriages; it was, in fact, built to house automobiles. The southern {{section of the}} carriage house was constructed sometime between 1908 and 1912 and features a mansard roof. The building is sheathed in stucco and presently houses a collection of antique carriages and sleighs {{as well as a}} barbed wire history museum.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 Olympics, the United States went unbeaten {{and earned}} gold medal honors, {{defeating}} the 2006 World Champion Spain {{in the final}} game. Wade led the team in scoring throughout the tournament and tallied a game-high 27 points in 27 minutes on 75% field goal shooting and added 4 steals, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in the game. For the tournament, he averaged a team-high 16 points in 18 minutes on 67% field goal shooting, 4 rebounds, 2 assists and 2.3 steals, as the United States <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to their Redeem Team moniker and captured gold medal honors {{for the first time}} since 2000.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to its obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} and second games of the season, the Cardinals <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to that expectation. At in-state rival Kentucky, Louisville earned a 31–24 victory to win the Governor's Cup. This was {{followed}} the next week by a 63–27 victory over non-conference opponent Oregon State. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, their first Big East conference game of the season—and of school history—did not go as well. At South Florida, the ninth-ranked Cardinals were outscored 45–14, {{the first time in}} 13 games Louisville's offense was held to less than 30 points.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to expectations, {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470. The game was the first time Tech had shut out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to Michael Vick that caused him to leave the game. The following week, against the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 win. This was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E

5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E
5|$|On {{her second}} voyage in early 1969, Manchester Challenge <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to her name by {{entering}} the heavily iced Montreal harbour, discharging, reloading and departing {{only two days}} late. Another thirty-seven conventional vessels were stuck at the port for a month. The quartet's ice-breaking capability often resulted them in leading a convoy of other vessels into Montreal during the winter months. The four ships of 12,039 gross tons were of the maximum size able to navigate the Manchester Ship Canal.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} various other shipwrecks in the vicinity. In 1889 the paddle steamer Mountaineer <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> {{to its name}} by clambering onto Lady's Rock, the damage to which was still visible in 1995. In 1905 the MacBrayne {{steamship}} Clydesdale hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives. The trawler MFV Solway Firth foundered south of this position in 1977.|$|E

5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to NBC's hopes, {{the series}} premiered {{with the name}} Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E
5|$|Lang became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1928. He {{presided over}} the 1930 Lambeth Conference, which gave limited church {{approval}} {{to the use of}} contraception. After denouncing the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and strongly condemning European anti-semitism, Lang later supported the appeasement policies of the British government. In May 1937 he {{presided over the}} coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. On retirement in 1942 Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth and continued to attend and speak in House of Lords debates until his death in 1945. Lang himself believed that he had not <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to his own high standards. Others have praised his qualities of industry, his efficiency and his commitment to his calling.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to the ranking {{in its first}} game of the season. On September 7, Nebraska {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, Nebraska fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season wore on, Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point earned it a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotism was Whitney Houston's stirring rendition of the National Anthem, which became {{known as one of the}} greatest renditions in Super Bowl history. The game <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to the stirring Anthem, as it went down as the most competitive Super Bowl in history. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith, and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith, to give the Bills a 12–3 lead. The Giants then ran a drive that took almost 8 minutes, and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
