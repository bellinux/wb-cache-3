5000|$|On May 15, 2017, the CRTC {{approved}} Rogers' {{application for}} Omni Regional under a provisional, three-year <b>licence</b> <b>term.</b> The commission argued that Rogers did not sufficiently {{demonstrate that the}} service would [...] "ensure a sufficient reflection of Canada's third-language communities", as its planned programming would rely primarily on those already carried by Omni Television's current broadcast stations and affiliates, it did not sufficiently represent regions of Canada that are not currently served by one (such as Atlantic and Central Canada), {{and that there were}} no significant plans for new original programming beyond newscasts. The CRTC felt that Omni Regional [...] "did not appear sustainable and would likely experience financial difficulties in the near future, even with mandatory distribution on the digital basic service". However, the CRTC did recognize that there was [...] "an exceptional need for a national, multilingual multi-ethnic programming service that can provide Canadians with news and current events programming in multiple languages from a Canadian perspective", and thus granted Rogers a provisional licence for Omni Regional. At the same time, the CRTC made a formal call for applications for a national, multicultural specialty channel that would receive must-carry status.|$|E
5000|$|Although both {{coal and}} oil {{production}} were publicly owned in the past, coal, {{oil and gas}} extraction is performed today by private corporations under government licence. The largest entities include BP, Shell, but also now joined by entirely foreign firms such as Apache, Talisman, CNR, TAQA or Cuadrilla. This means that ordinary UK company law (or US corporate law) sets the governance rights {{of oil and gas}} corporations, with board of directors invariably removable only by shareholders (typically large asset managers). The Petroleum Act 1998 section 2, rights of land ownership do not equate to rights to oil and gas (or hydrocarbons) underneath. In Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd, the Supreme Court did hold that a landowner may sue a company for trespass if it drills under its land without permission, but a majority held that damages will be nominal. This meant that a landowner in Surrey was only able to recover £1000 when a licensed oil company drilled a diagonal well 800 to 2800 feet under its property, and not the £621,180 awarded by the High Court to reflect a share of the oil profits. Similarly, under the Continental Shelf Act 1964 section 1 rights [...] "outside territorial waters with respect to the sea bed and subsoil and their natural resources" [...] are [...] "vested in Her Majesty." [...] Since 1919, the Crown has prohibited searching and boring for oil and gas without a licence. Under the Energy Act 2016, licensing is managed by the Oil and Gas Authority. Under section 8, the OGA should hand out licences so as to minimise future public expense, secure the energy supply, ensure storage of carbon dioxide, fully collaborate with the UK government, innovation, and stable regulation to encourage investment. Overshadowing this is the duty in PA 1998 sections 9A-I on the Secretary of State for ‘maximising the economic recovery of UK petroleum’. The Secretary of State may give directions to the OGA in the interests of national security, or the public in exceptional circumstances, while the OGA is nominally capable of funding itself through fees on license applicants and holders. In the process of licensing, the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive Regulations 1995 require objective, transparent and competitive criteria to be applied by OGA. Under regulation 3, the OGA should consider an applicants technical and financial capability, price, previous conduct, and refuse all applications if none are satisfactory, while regulation 5 requires that all criteria to be applied are stated in the public notice for tenders. Under PA 1998 section 4, model licence clauses are prescribed by the Secretary of State, for instance in the Petroleum Licensing (Production) (Seaward Areas) Regulations 2008. Schedule 1's model clauses give the OGA discretion over the <b>licence</b> <b>term,</b> the licensee's obligation to submit its work programme, revocation on breach of a licence, arbitration for disputes, or health and environmental safety. For onshore oil and gas extraction, and particularly hydraulic fracturing (or [...] "fracking"), there are further requirements that must be fulfilled. For fracking, these include negotiating with landowners where a drill site is situated, getting the Mineral Planning Authority's approval for exploratory wells, consent from the council under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 section 57, getting permission for disposing of hazardous waste and inordinate water use, and finally consent from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In R (Frack Free Balcombe Residents Association) v West Sussex CC the resident group in Balcombe lost an action for judicial review of their Council's planning permission for Cuadrilla Balcombe Ltd to explore the potential to frack for shale gas. Large protests had opposed any steps toward fracking. However, Gilbart J held that the council had not been wrong in refusing to consider public opposition, and took the view would have acted unlawfully if it had considered the opposition.|$|E
