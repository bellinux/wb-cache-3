25|$|The NFL in the United States equips {{players with}} RFID chips that {{measures}} speed, distance and direction traveled by each player in real-time. Currently cameras {{stay focused on}} the quarterback, however, numerous plays are happening simultaneously on the field. The RFID chip will provide new insight into these simultaneous plays. The chip triangulates the player's position within six inches and {{will be used to}} digitally broadcast replays. The RFID chip will make individual player information accessible to the public. The data will be available via the NFL 2015 app. The RFID chips are manufactured by Zebra Technologies. Zebra Technologies tested the RFID chip in 18 stadiums <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> track vector data.|$|E

Jandali states that after {{finishing}} his PhD he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). He also states that after the divorce he lost contact with Mona for a period of time: I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida. A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name thus became Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.|$|E

He said it discussed the issue of people climbing the rock, which is sacred in Aboriginal folklore, despite [...] "the prevalence of literature and signage" [...] asking people not to. Fanning compared climbing Uluru to climbing the Vatican, which he noted would be highly offensive to Catholics.|$|E

The clip of Fisher was viewed on the Internet over 10 million times.

Blaney also invokes Mike Smithson's opinion that if UKIP had acquired the minor party's overall vote share, it would have won two additional seats; Farage posited [...] "some think it cost us three." [...] In response to the incident, citing his deselection, Nattrass retorted [...] "id [...] expect me just to melt away? No, I am going down with my flag."

500|$|In 1986 the IOC {{decided to}} stagger the Summer and Winter Games. Instead of holding {{both in the}} same {{calendar}} year the committee decided to alternate them every two years, although both Games would still be held on four-year cycles. It was decided that 1992 would be the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> have both a Winter and Summer Olympic Games. [...] There were two underlying reasons for this change: first was the television lobby's desire to maximise advertising revenue as {{it was difficult to}} sell advertising time for two Games in the same year; [...] second was the IOC's desire to gain more control over the revenue generated by the Games. It was decided that staggering the Games {{would make it easier for}} corporations to sponsor individual Olympic Games, which would maximise revenue potential. The IOC sought to directly negotiate sponsorship contracts so that they had more control over the Olympic [...] "brand". The first Winter Olympics to be hosted in this new format were the 1994 Games in Lillehammer.|$|E
500|$|Several pre-release {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal gave the episode a largely positive review and noted that [...] "If you can erase last season from your mind, you'll see this ... is exactly how The Office should have carried on after Steve Carell left." [...] Furthermore, he praised the addition of Duke and Lacy, calling their performances [...] "so good you could see them become {{the centerpiece of a}} new series." [...] Verne Gay of Newsweek awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called the installment [...] "very (very) funny." [...] He was especially happy about the addition of Lacy and Duke, calling them [...] "flashbacks to a younger Jim and Dwight." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "the ninth and final season actually may offer completion" [...] of a show that has just [...] "merely offered variations on [...] tics" [...] for the past eight seasons. Bob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the episode [...] "generally funnier than [...] was last season" [...] and wrote that the episode would be a good opportunity [...] "for viewers who quit the [...] <b>last</b> <b>year</b> ... <b>to</b> come back to the show." [...] Particularly, he was excited to [...] "see the seeds of the show's end planted." ...|$|E

In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate our good time <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After all, I was a member of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E
