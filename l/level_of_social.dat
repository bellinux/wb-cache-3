5|$|Living in colonies {{results in}} a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> {{interaction}} between birds, {{which has led to}} a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved {{to the front of the}} body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.|$|E

These findings suggest that individual differences in children’s suggestibility were masked by high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> pressure in a suggestive interview. ...|$|R
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

40|$|Contrary to {{the number}} of {{research}} reporting the effects <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Activity on cognitive decline and dementia, there is not much known about the influence <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Activity on the neuropathology. Therefore, the present study will explore the association between Social Activity and brain volume and WML, and will verify the association between Social Activity and cognitive function. The data of the SMART-study is used. Three questions about the frequency <b>of</b> <b>social</b> contact <b>of</b> the participants with neighbors, family and friends formed the factor Social Activity. WML and brain volume was measured and normalized for intracranial volume. Cognition is measured with the 15 -word learning test. Linear regression analysis is used for the statistical analyses. The findings show that people with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Activity with neighbors have larger brain volume (B=. 642; 95 % CI=. 132 to 1. 151 %; p=. 014). People with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> Activity with neighbors (B=. 256; 95 % CI=. 004 to. 507 %; p=. 046) and family (B=. 270; 95 % CI=. 022 to. 519 %; p=. 033) have more WML.

500|$|A {{medium-sized}} {{market town}} in the medieval period, Birmingham grew to international prominence in the 18th century {{at the heart of}} the Midlands Enlightenment and subsequent Industrial Revolution, which saw the town at the forefront of worldwide advances in science, technology, and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society. By 1791 it was being hailed as [...] "the first manufacturing {{town in the}} world". Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. Perhaps the most important invention in British history, the industrial steam engine, was invented in Birmingham. Its resulting high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> mobility also fostered a culture of broad-based political radicalism, that under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London, and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy. From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943, Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz. The damage done to the city's infrastructure, in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners, led to extensive demolition and redevelopment in subsequent decades.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{have sought to}} combine {{regional}} and social exclusion perspectives on economic exclusion in the enlarged EU. Our analysis confirms that while the economically excluded constitute substantially larger groups in the poorer regions {{they are much more}} sharply differentiated from others in the richer regions. These results bring out the importance of being able to combine both regional and social policy perspectives within the same conceptual and measurement framework. While the economically excluded are also disadvantaged in relation to more wide ranging measures <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion no case can be made that variation in the <b>level</b> and intensity <b>of</b> economic exclusion help to account for regional differences in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion. Substantial variations across regions in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion are observed. However, the vast bulk of such variation occurs within rather than between regions. Furthermore, while the economically excluded generally report lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion, the impact of such vulnerability is actually greater in the more affluent regions. Thus regional variations in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cohesion cannot be accounted for by the differential impact of economic exclusion. In fact, in the absence of this latter variation differences in such levels would actually be greater. Thus while the economically excluded are characterised by exposure to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> exclusion and lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> cohesion, regional differences in these dimensions cannot simply be accounted for by corresponding differences in the <b>levels</b> or impact <b>of</b> economic exclusion...|$|R
