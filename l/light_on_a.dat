5|$|The only quagga to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed {{that this is an}} optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E

25|$|Sutton Hoo is {{of primary}} {{importance}} to early medieval historians because it sheds <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> period of English history {{that is on}} the margin between myth, legend, and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held senior power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E
25|$|After Zeeman {{passed the}} {{qualification}} exams in 1885, he studied {{physics at the}} University of Leiden under Kamerlingh Onnes and Hendrik Lorentz. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz's assistant. This allowed him {{to participate in a}} research programme on the Kerr effect. In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the Kerr effect, the reflection of polarized <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> magnetized surface. After obtaining his doctorate he went for half a year to Friedrich Kohlrausch's institute in Strasbourg. In 1895, after returning from Strasbourg, Zeeman became Privatdozent in mathematics and physics in Leiden. The same year he married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873–1962); they had three daughters and one son.|$|E
25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E

25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German) in Germany {{are different}} than some other level crossings throughout Europe. These crossings use yellow and red lights and a bell/alarm (some crossings do not have these though) {{to indicate that the}} crossing is active. When activating a preliminary yellow light flashes which is followed by a red light that stays lit until the train(s) have cleared the crossing. Most of these crossings usually have a lightning symbol on the crossbucks. These symbols indicate that the railway is electrified with overhead wires. Older crossings have a single red <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> square backboard with a red and white boarder. After crossing the level crossing, unless there is a speed limit sign, the speed limit is the national speed limit. That is, 50km/h for built up areas and 100km/h outside built up areas.|$|E
25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models {{and the manner in}} which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article, “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} by Hertz in 1887 {{that the}} incidence of ultra-violet <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the negative electricity {{under the influence of the}} electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.|$|E
25|$|Sea-anglers {{and others}} petitioned for the pier to be repaired, but storms on 11 January 1978 and in February 1979 caused {{progressive}} {{collapse of the}} central portion of the pier between the two Bailey bridges, and its remains were dismantled in 1980. The pier head was too solid for demolition, so it remains isolated at sea with its solar-powered navigation <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole. From 1989 the Waverley Preservation Society and Medway Queen Preservation Society have shown interest in a future rebuilding of the deep sea pier. The Association of Hotels, Business and Leisure (HBL) has been promoting the rebuilding of a deep-sea pier, and has created and costed its own design. A redevelopment plan for the pier was suggested by Cooperman Vision in 2004 and a feasibility study {{was carried out by}} the Council, but it came to nothing. In 2008 MP Roger Gale suggested that if Canterbury City Council had not refused permission for a casino in Herne Bay, that casino may have helped fund reconstruction of the pier. At the same time, Canterbury City Council was setting up the Herne Bay Pier Trust as a charitable trust to raise £12.5 million to rebuild the pier. As of February 2010, the sports centre was due to be closed in 2011, and on 22 February 2010 the £10,000 Herne Bay Pier Report was published by Canterbury City Council in association with Humberts Leisure, with the suggestion that the Herne Bay Museum and King's Hall sites be sold for redevelopment, to pay for a new build on top of the remaining pier stub. The time limit for public objections was 19 April 2010. The National Piers Society suggested in 2009 that the remaining stub of the pier was at serious risk of demolition or collapse. The sports pavilion was demolished in 2012.|$|E
