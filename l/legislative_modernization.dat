This reform moved Nebraska to the forefront on many measures of legislative capability, such as structural simplicity, open deliberative process, and level of staff assistance. Yet, the Unicameral lags behind other states on other measures of <b>legislative</b> effectiveness and <b>modernization.</b> This is illustrated by inadequate compensation for legislators, insufficient winnowing if bills prior to floor consideration, and modest restraint of interest group activity.
