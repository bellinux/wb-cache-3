30|$|Safety {{applications}} in vehicular networks have been popular research topics in recent years, such as forward collision warning, emergency braking warning and intersection collision warning systems. The basic safety message broadcast from each <b>car</b> transmits the <b>position,</b> <b>car</b> speed and car heading information. Neighbouring cars receiving this information can decide {{if there is}} any danger within the next second. However, the safety application message has positioning accuracy and time-critical problems. Accurate <b>positioning</b> of the <b>car</b> provides a more effective warning to the driver. Moreover, the reliable and efficient delivery of safety information needs to be improved when the penetration rate increases. Hence, this paper proposes a cooperative emergency braking warning system to solve the above problems. This is a system that integrates a camera sensor to construct the state of neighbourhood cars in order to solve the first problem. It then proposes to reduce the repeat and derivable information between the broadcast messages in order to solve the second problem. The proposed system has been implemented to provide a safer driving environment.|$|R
