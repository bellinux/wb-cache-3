5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people {{early enough}} to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared. Between 60–70% of Port Isabel's 500residents <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> storm, with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available.|$|E
5|$|Browns center Mike Scarry <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{season to}} become the head coach at Western Reserve. Frank Gatski took over at the {{position}} after Scarry's retirement. Don Greenwood, a halfback who featured in the team's first two seasons, retired after sustaining a serious cheekbone injury in 1947 and accepted a job as head football coach at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Browns games were televised {{for the first time}} in 1948 on 84 stations across the country. Only away games were shown in northeast Ohio; they were presented by Bob Neal and Stan Gee, who had announced Browns games on WGAR-AM radio in 1946 and 1947.|$|E

5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste of things to come. When the Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, the delegates <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} subsequently {{retreated to}} Chonan, where, {{the next night}} the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin {{as well as two}} thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it would be forced to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major defensible city <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E

5|$|Despite Autumn Games' {{support and}} desire to expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting {{to pick up where}} they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following the success of the EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo page for Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called Fighting is Magic) was also funded. With minutes <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen <b>left</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
5|$|York won for {{the first}} time in 13 matches after beating Portsmouth 3–1 at home, but were left nine points adrift of safety with three matches remaining. Fewster headed York into the lead on 30 minutes and Alessandra scored with a low shot four minutes later. Summerfield made it 3–0 three minutes after half-time with a 30-yard shot, before Portsmouth scored a {{consolation}} goal through Gareth Evans in the 55th minute. York's relegation into the National League was confirmed after a 3–0 away defeat to Accrington, marking the end of a four-year spell in the Football League. Promotion-chasing Accrington opened the scoring in the first half through Tariqe Fosu, before Josh Windass scored twice in the second half. York were beaten 4–1 by promotion-chasing Bristol Rovers in their last home match of the season, dropping to the bottom of the table as a result. Billy Bodin scored Rovers' first two goals before Jermaine Easter and Lee Mansell scored either side of McEvoy's 81st-minute goal, a close-range finish from Fewster's low cross from the <b>left.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> match, Winfield was named the 2015–16 Clubman of the Year, voted for by the club's supporters. York's last match of the season was a 1–1 away draw with Morecambe, in which they took the lead after Summerfield scored in first-half stoppage time, before the home team equalised through Jamie Devitt. This meant York's final league position in 2015–16 was bottom place, being relegated alongside 23rd-place Dagenham.|$|E

25|$|Hungary {{breached}} {{several points}} of the agreement about evacuation and transfer of territory from the beginning, particularly its commitment to prevent violent acts on territory under its administration.
