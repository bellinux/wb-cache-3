5|$|SH-132 turns {{east and}} {{overlaps}} the U.S. routes for one mile (1.6km), before splitting back {{off to the}} north. In Carrier, it briefly overlaps State Highway 45. North of Carrier, the highway crosses another railroad track, this one operated by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, before running {{to the west of}} Hillsdale. At the Garfield–Grant County line, the highway curves to the northwest before turning back to a due north heading in order to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Grant County's road grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Soyuz TM-19, {{carrying}} the EO-16 crew, was delayed {{due to the}} unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it, but the spacecraft eventually left Earth on 1 July 1994 and docked two days later. They stayed only four months to allow the Soyuz schedule to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the planned space shuttle manifest, and so Polyakov greeted a second resident crew in October, prior to the undocking of Soyuz TM-19, when the EO-17 crew arrived in Soyuz TM-20.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E

5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} where locks {{have been built}} to a round plan, with more than two exits from the lock chamber, each serving a different water level.

25|$|June 20, 1992: The {{pilot of}} a Piper J3C-65 Cub, {{registration}} number N3128M, reported trouble {{and attempted to}} return to Addison Airport soon after taking off to test a newly installed engine.

25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} {{would turn the}} potentiometer dial {{in an effort to}} get the leading edge of the target blip to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not read off the CRT, but the dial. The dial also turned a magslip, or selsyn as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E

25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots.

None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy would be different from the one described in Roots.|$|E
