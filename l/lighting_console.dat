25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of <b>lighting</b> <b>console</b> levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E

[...] From new curtains, new seating, and restoration done to the imported Stretched Oil on Canvas Portrait situated above the stage. Along with restoration to historic plaster work that adorns the walls and ceilings. A 15ft stage extension was also built.

50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} achievements of High End Systems was {{the introduction of the}} DMX-controlled media server called Catalyst in 2002. Up until that point, media servers were manually-operated systems where the media, either tape or video computer files, were switched using a push button matrix switcher or a T-handle switcher to crossfade between sources. In 2000, High End Systems introduced a digital projection system with a video projector, Orbital Mirror Head, and a DMX-controlled media server that interfaced with a <b>lighting</b> <b>console.</b> It allowed a lighting programmer to program the video switching and effects into the <b>lighting</b> <b>console</b> and play them back as part of the light show. The first such system was called Catalyst, but Catalyst evolved into the DMX-controlled media server while the Orbital Mirror Head was marketed alone.|$|E

50|$|During the {{technical}} rehearsals, the light board operator usually programs the <b>lighting</b> <b>console</b> {{with the assistance}} of the lighting designer and stage manager.

50|$|Traditionally, the {{lighting}} programmer {{has relied on}} their memory, {{the reliability of the}} lights or the services of an assistant, often called a lighting tracker, to document each position each light is used in. FocusTrack automates this process by importing the <b>lighting</b> <b>console</b> showfile (from Strand 500-series, ETC Eos-family and MA grandMA consoles) to create a list of each position (called a 'focus') used by each light in the show. The programmer can then add a written description of the purpose of each position. To precisely document the light's position on stage, the programmer can use a digital camera to take a picture of each position in turn. FocusTrack can aid in this process by controlling the <b>lighting</b> <b>console,</b> turning each light on in each position as required; it can then import the photographs to give a complete record of the work of the automated lights during the show.|$|E
