5|$|Although the tree-ring {{analysis}} of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted it. Until the early 1980s {{it was thought that}} the Philadelphia panel was the original and the Turin panel a copy, but x-ray analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. Infrared reflectography further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar to those found in the Ghent Altarpiece, thereby, according to <b>Luber,</b> tying the Turin version to van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|Arcidiacono {{was born}} on March 26, 1994 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has three older siblings, Sabrina, Nicole, Michael; and younger twin siblings, Christopher and Courtney. His parents, Joe and Patti Arcidiacono, met at Villanova University, where Joe was an {{offensive}} lineman on the football team. When he was young, his father installed a 6-foot plastic hoop in the family living room. Arcidiacono would often practice shooting jump shots and hitting layups on the small hoop before progressing to an actual basketball court. At one AAU game, Arcidiacono scored 50 points. At another, he hit eight three-pointers in a row. When he was in 7th grade at a basketball camp, Villanova coach Jay Wright said he would one day play for the Wildcats. Growing up, his favorite athletes were the 76ers' Allen Iverson and the Eagles' Brian Dawkins. In eighth grade, Arcidiacono trained with former Penn State player Ben <b>Luber.</b>|$|E

500|$|Noting the {{similarity}} of Francis's pose to the kneeling figure in the [...] "Turin-Milan Hours" [...] miniature of The Agony in the Garden, Borchert, who believes van Eyck's work as a manuscript illuminator came late in his career, concludes that both were completed after the master had died, perhaps completed {{by members of the}} workshop. Unlike Borchert, <b>Luber</b> thinks that The Agony evidences his early experiments with perspective, as he began to resolve the transition between foreground and background, by placing the fence in the mid-ground, a device found in the St Francis through the positioning of the rocks. <b>Luber</b> says the underdrawings in the miniature are similar to those in the St Francis paintings, and stylistically typical of those in van Eyck's later work, an important factor when considering attribution.|$|E
500|$|Nature {{is a key}} aspect in van Eyck's works. According to Rishel, {{elements}} of his landscapes may appear [...] "magically beautiful but [...] in fact quite oblivious to the sacred action in the foreground". Katherine <b>Luber</b> believes that open vistas and lowered horizons are a hallmark. [...] The Francis paintings seem to be early experiments with landscape; the painter places rocks in the mid-ground, solving {{the problem of how}} to transition from foreground to background; a similar resolution is found in the lower-right wing of the Ghent Altarpiece.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{perceived}} [...] "faulty proportions" [...] of the figures, Ludwig von Baldass suggested a date early in van Eyck's career, around 1425. He attributes the unusual positioning and anatomy {{to a young}} and relatively inexperienced painter, one who was still experimenting. He notes how the landscape and individual elements are similar to Hubert van Eyck's style, but that the close observation of nature reveals Jan's hand. <b>Luber</b> suggests a slightly later date of about 1430, during the period van Eyck finished the Ghent Altarpiece. She bases her supposition {{on the fact that}} van Eyck's employer Philip the Bold sent him to Portugal in the late 1420s; he would have been unavailable for a commission until his return in 1430. Furthermore, the landscape details, which correlate to van Eyck's work of the period, combined with the return from pilgrimage late in the 1420s of the Adornes brothers (who may have commissioned the two paintings), suggest a completion date of about 1430.|$|E
