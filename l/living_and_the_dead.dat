5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Shaman King {{revolves}} around Yoh Asakura, a shaman, a medium between {{the worlds of}} the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> Yoh seeks to become the Shaman King, {{the one who is}} able to contact the Great Spirit, and will gain the ability to reshape the world in any way they wish, and for this purpose he must to win the Shaman Fight, a battle held once every 500 years between competing shamans. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to befriend Ryu, Tao Ren, Horohoro, Faust VIII, Lyserg Diethel, and Joco McDonnell (known as Chocolove McDonnell).|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on original sin {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E

In Catholic theology, this union encompasses the Church Militant, the Church Triumphant, and the Church Suffering.|$|E

25|$|Belief in {{guardian}} {{spirits and}} shape shifting, or transformation between {{human and animal}} spirits were widely shared in myriad forms. The relations of soul or souls, and conceptions of the lands of the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> were complex and mutable. Vision quest journeys involving other states of consciousness were varied and widely practiced. The Duwamish had a soul recovery and journey ceremony and legends.|$|E

During {{the preparation of the}} elements, God would inform him of the spiritual state of those he commemorated, both the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> With great pastoral discernment, he would pass the information on to his parishioners, either to encourage them to pray more fervently for the souls of the deceased or to bring sinners to repentance.|$|E
25|$|For Americans {{wishing to}} bridge the gap between the earthly and spiritual worlds, spiritualism {{provided}} a means of communing with the dead. Spiritualists used mediums to communicate between the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> through a variety of different means. The most famous mediums, the Fox sisters claimed a direct link to the spirit world. Spiritualism would gain a much larger following after the heavy number of casualties during the Civil War; First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln was a believer.|$|E
60|$|Before I quit this subject, your Lordships {{will again}} {{permit me to}} reprobate the {{malicious}} insinuations by which Mr. Hastings has thought proper to slander the virtuous persons who are the authors of that system which he complains of.

25|$|The djed pillar {{was often}} used as amulets for the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was {{supposed}} to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be able to sit up. It was also painted onto coffins.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates several All Souls' Days in the year, {{but in the}} West {{only one}} such annual {{commemoration}} is celebrated. The establishment, {{at the end of}} the 10th century, of this remembrance helped focus popular imagination on the fate of the departed, and fostered a sense of solidarity between the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> Then, in the 12th century, the elaboration of the theology of penance helped create a notion of purgatory as a place to complete penances unfinished in this life.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox Church {{believes}} {{death and}} the separation of body and soul to be unnatural—a result of the Fall of Man.

There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples.

25|$|A common {{symbol of}} the holiday is the skull (in Spanish calavera), which celebrants {{represent}} in masks, called calacas (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as sugar or chocolate skulls, which are inscribed {{with the name of}} the recipient on the forehead.

25|$|According to Numbers 16-17, a Levite named Korah {{led many}} in {{challenging}} Aaron's exclusive {{claim to the}} priesthood. When the rebels were punished by being {{swallowed up by the}} earth, (Numbers 16:25-35), Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the <b>living</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).|$|E
25|$|This daily cycle {{services}} is {{conceived of as}} both the sanctification of time (chronos, the specific times during which they are celebrated), and entry into eternity (kairos).

Ancestral worship is a common practice of <b>the</b> Chinese <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Qingming Festival during the second full moon is observed by the majority.
