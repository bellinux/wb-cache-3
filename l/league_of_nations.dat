60|$|But the Supreme Court, {{whether it}} is to have the wider or the {{narrower}} scope here suggested, would be merely the central function <b>of</b> the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations.</b> Behind the decisions of the Supreme Court must lie power. And here come fresh difficulties for patriotic digestions. The armies and navies of the world must be at the disposal <b>of</b> the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations,</b> and that opens up a new large area of delegated authority. The first impulse of any power disposed to challenge the decisions of the Supreme Court will be, of course, to arm; {{and it is difficult to}} imagine how the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations</b> can exercise any practical authority unless it has power to restrain such armament. The <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations</b> must, in fact, if it is to be a working reality, have power to define and limit the military and naval and aerial equipment of every country in the world. This means something more than a restriction of state forces. It must have power and freedom to investigate the military and naval and aerial establishments of all its constituent powers. It must also have effective control over every armament industry. And armament industries are not always easy to define. Are aeroplanes, for example, armament? Its powers, I suggest, must extend even to a restraint upon the belligerent propaganda which is the natural advertisement campaign of every armament industry. It must have the right, for example, to raise the question of the proprietorship of newspapers by armament interests. Disarmament is, in fact, a necessary factor <b>of</b> any <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations,</b> and you cannot have disarmament unless you are prepared to see the powers of the council <b>of</b> the <b>League</b> extend thus far. The very existence <b>of</b> the <b>League</b> presupposes that it and it alone is to have and to exercise military force. Any other belligerency or preparation or incitement to belligerency becomes rebellion, and any other arming a threat of rebellion, in a world <b>League</b> <b>of</b> Free <b>Nations.</b>|$|R

Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> which implored the newly formed <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts.

5|$|The <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> {{began its}} session on September 16, 1920. After reports by Lithuanian {{representative}} Augustinas Voldemaras and Polish envoy Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the League adopted a resolution on September 20. It urged both states to cease hostilities and {{adhere to the}} Curzon Line. Poland was asked to respect Lithuanian neutrality if Soviet Russia agreed to do the same. A special Control Commission was to be dispatched into the conflict zone to oversee implementation of the resolution. The Lithuanian government accepted the resolution. Sapieha replied that Poland could not honor the Lithuanian neutrality or the demarcation line as Lithuania was actively collaborating with the Soviets. The Poles reserved the right of full freedom of action. The Lithuanian representative in London, Count Alfredas Tiškevičius, informed the secretariat of the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> that Sapieha's telegram {{should be regarded as}} a declaration of war; he also asked that the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations</b> take immediate intervention in order to stop new Polish aggressive acts.|$|E

5|$|The most {{controversial}} issue– {{the future of}} the city of Vilnius– was not explicitly addressed.

Soon after the mutiny, Léon Bourgeois, President of the Council of the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> expressed strong disapproval, asserting that Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the <b>League</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nations,</b> and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.|$|E

These four elements are analyzed through the imaginary encounter between the «emperor» and the «pirate».
