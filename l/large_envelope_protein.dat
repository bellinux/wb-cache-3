40|$|The entry {{mechanism}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{has not been}} defined, and this impedes development of antiviral therapies aimed at an early step in the viral life cycle. HBV infection has both host and tissue specificities. For the related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), duck carboxypeptidase D (DCPD) has been proposed as the species-specific docking receptor, while glycine decarboxylase (DGD) {{may serve as a}} tissue-specific cofactor or secondary receptor. DGD binds to several truncated versions of the viral <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> but not to the full-length protein, suggesting a need for proteolytic cleavage of the envelope protein by a furin-like proprotein convertase. In the present study, we found that transfected DCPD could confer DHBV binding to non-duck cell lines but that this was followed by rapid virus release from cells. Coexpression of furin led to DCPD cleavage and increased virus retention. Treatment of DHBV particles with endosome prepared from duck liver led to cleavage of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> and such viral preparation could generate a small amount of covalently closed circular DNA in LMH cells, a chicken hepatoma cell line resistant to DHBV infection. A furin inhibitor composed of decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone blocked endosomal cleavage of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> in vitro and suppressed DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes in vivo. These findings suggest that furin or a furin-like proprotein convertase facilitates DHBV infection by cleaving both the docking receptor and the viral <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hepadnaviruses cause {{persistent}} noncytopathic infections of hepatocytes {{in humans}} and other animals. Virus replication {{depends on the}} pool of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) molecules, which serve as transcriptional templates in the nuclei of infected cells. The size of this pool of cccDNA molecules is regulated by {{the ability of the}} <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of the virus to direct newly synthesized viral DNAs into a pathway for viral secretion and thereby inhibit their utilization for viral cccDNA synthesis. In this study, we showed that single amino acid changes in the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> could cause profound changes in cccDNA levels in transfected permissive cells or in infected cultured hepatocytes. While defects in cccDNA regulation were accompanied by a decrease of enveloped virus production in transfected cells, primary hepatocytes infected by such mutant viruses transiently produced wild-type or higher levels of enveloped virus. Moreover, high levels of cccDNA were always associated with cytopathic effects in the infected hepatocytes. The results demonstrate that the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> promotes persistent noncytopathic infection of hepatocytes by acting as an overall repressor of virus replication...|$|E
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} deletions in the hepatitis B virus pre-S 1 domain {{have been}} frequently found during persistent viral infection. In {{this study we}} have investigated the functional properties of a mutant viral genome that carries an in-frame deletion of 183 nucleotides in the pre-S 1 region. This deletion removes the promoter of the small envelope gene. Transfection into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells of a replication-competent construct containing this deletion resulted in an increase of intermediate DNA replicative forms compared to those produced by wild-type hepatitis B virus. Northern blot analysis revealed that such cells lack the 2. 1 -kb transcripts encoding the small envelope protein and that hepatitis B surface antigen was absent as well. Furthermore, nucleocapsids containing the genome with pre-S 1 deleted were not secreted, and the deleted <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> was retained with the cytoplasm and exhibited a perinuclear pattern of distribution. However, coexpression with the small envelope protein was sufficient to restore virion secretion and to change the cellular distribution of the deleted <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> In addition, the creation of point mutations that prevent the synthesis of large or small envelope proteins also inhibited viral secretion and led to increased levels of hepatitis B virus intermediate replicative forms within the cell. These studies suggest that naturally occurring viral mutants with pre-S 1 deletions involving the promoter region of the small envelope gene will generate a deleted <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the accumulation o...|$|E
40|$|Using {{recombinant}} adenoviral vectors, we expressed and {{characterized the}} large, middle, and major <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Cells {{infected with the}} recombinant adenovirus which contained the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> gene (HS 1. HP) expressed predominantly <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> and small but detectable quantities of middle (4 %) and major (6 %) <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in the cell lysate. No HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> were detected in the culture medium from HS 1. HP-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant adenovirus which contained the middle envelope gene (HS 2. HP) expressed and secreted the middle and major <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in a molar ratio of 3 : 1. Cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus which contained the major envelope gene (HS. HP) expressed and secreted major <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> The HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> secreted by cells infected with either HS 2. HP or HS. HP were assembled in 22 -nm particles, as shown by velocity sedimentation rate determination, buoyant densities, and electron microscopy. Cells coinfected with a recombinant adenovirus which contained the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> gene and with either HS 2. HP or HS. HP expressed similar quantities of the large, middle, and major <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in the cell lysates. Secretion of the major and middle <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> was inhibited more than 95 % {{by the presence of}} the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> These results suggest that differential biosynthesis, transport, and processing of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> occur during HBV infection, allowing efficient assembly and secretion of virions and hepatitis B surface antigen particles...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the <b>large</b> {{hepadnavirus}} <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (L) is its mixed transmembrane topology, resulting from partial posttranslational translocation of the pre-S domain. Using protease protection analysis, we demonstrate for duck hepatitis B virus an essential role for the small <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (S) in this process, providing the first experimental evidence for an S translocation channel. Further analysis revealed that the presumed cytoplasmic loop between TM 1 and TM 2 in the C-terminal S domain is membrane embedded and protrudes to the particle surface. These data suggest that some L molecules form a highly folded, potentially spring-loaded topology with five membrane-spanning regions and a membrane-traversing pre-S chain...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{packaging}} requires prenylation of the HDV large protein (p 27), {{as well as}} {{a direct}} protein–protein interaction between HDV proteins and hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> domains. To investigate this interaction, we have analysed the binding capacity of baculovirusexpressed delta p 24 and p 27 proteins to synthetic peptides specific for the HBV envelope. Although a higher degree of binding was observed with p 27, both p 24 and p 27 could bind HBV envelope peptides. One such peptide corresponded to residues 56 – 80 located in the cytosolic loop of the small HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> and another corresponded to 23 carboxy-terminal residues of the pre-S 1 specific to the <b>large</b> HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> Thi...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the {{prototype}} of hepatotropic DNA viruses (hepadnaviruses) infecting {{a wide range of}} human and non-human hosts. Previous studies with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) identified duck carboxypeptidase D (dCPD) as a host specific binding partner for full-length <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> and p 120 as a binding partner for several truncated versions of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> p 120 is the P protein of duck glycine decarboxylase (dGLDC) with restricted expression in DHBV infectible tissues. Several lines of evidence suggest the importance of dCPD, and especially p 120, in productive DHBV infection, although neither dCPD nor p 120 cDNA could confer susceptibility to DHBV infection in any cell line. Recently, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been identified as a binding partner for the N-terminus of HBV <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> Importantly, knock down and reconstitution experiments unequivocally demonstrated that NTCP is both necessary and sufficient for in vitro infection by HBV and hepatitis delta virus (HDV), an RNA virus using HBV envelope proteins for its transmission. What remains unclear is whether NTCP is the major HBV receptor in vivo. The fact that some HBV patients are homozygous with an NTCP mutation known to abolish its receptor function suggests the existence of NTCP-independent pathways of HBV entry. Also, NTCP very likely mediates just one step of the HBV entry process, with additional co-factors for productive HBV infection still to be discovered. NTCP offers a novel therapeutic target for the control of chronic HBV infection...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} assay {{of hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) binding to hepatocyte plasma membranes was adapted {{to show that}} leucocyte plasma membranes bind serum-derived HBV saturably, and that this binding is inhibited using synthetic peptides representative of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of HBV. Using a panel of ligand-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to opsonin receptors, it was shown that the three classes of Fc gamma R and CR 3 are not major receptors for HBV on leucocytes or hepatocytes. It was also shown that HBV does not utilize the receptor for IgA, Fc alpha R, for attachment to leucocytes, despite reported sequence homology between the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of HBV and the Fc portion of human IgA. Evidence is presented that the receptor for HBV on leucocytes may differ from the hepatocyte receptor(s), based on synthetic peptide inhibition assays of HBV binding. Furthermore, {{it was observed that}} glycosaminoglycans influence the HBV-liver and leucocyte interactions, providing evidence that HBV attachment may be a multi-stage process...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to clarify {{the roles of the}} pre-S 1 and pre-S 2 domains of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in attachment and entry into susceptible cells. Difficulties arise in that these domains contain regions involved in the nucleocapsid assembly of HBV and overlapping with the coding regions of the viral polymerase and RNA sequences required for reverse transcription. Such difficulties can be circumvented with hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which needs the HBV <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> only for infectivity. Thus, mutated HBV envelope proteins were examined for their effects on HDV infectivity. Changing the C-terminal region of pre-S 1 critical for HBV assembly allowed the envelopment of HDV and had no effect on infectivity in primary human hepatocytes. Similarly, a deletion of the 12 amino acids of a putative translocation motif (TLM) in pre-S 2 had no effect. Thus, these two regions are not necessary for HDV infectivity and, by inference, are not needed for HBV attachment and entry into susceptible cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the duck {{hepatitis}} B virus (DHBV) model to study the interference with infection by a myristoylated peptide representing an N-terminal pre-S subdomain of the <b>large</b> viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> Although lacking the {{essential part of the}} carboxypeptidase D (formerly called gp 180) receptor binding site, the peptide binds hepatocytes and subsequently blocks DHBV infection. Since its activity requires an amino acid sequence involved in host discrimination between DHBV and the related heron HBV (T. Ishikawa and D. Ganem, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 6259 - 6263, 1995), we suggest that it is related to the postulated host-discriminating cofactor of infection...|$|R
40|$|The small (S), middle (M) and <b>large</b> (L) <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> of the {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) are initially synthesized as multispanning membrane proteins of the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane. We now demonstrate that all <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> synthesized in transfected cells or in a cell-free system adopt {{more than one}} transmembrane orientation. The L protein disposes its N-terminal preS domain both to the cytoplasmic and the luminal side of the membrane. This unusual topology {{does not depend on}} interaction with the viral nucleocapsid, but is preserved in secreted empty envelope particles. Pulse-chase analysis suggests a novel process of post-translational translocation leading to the non-uniform topology. Analysis of L deletion mutants indicates that the block to co-translational translocation can be attributed to a specific sequence within preS, suggesting that translocation of L may be regulated. Additional topological heterogeneity is displayed in the S region of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> and in the S protein itself, as assayed in a cell-free system. S proteins integrated into microsomal membranes exhibit both a luminal and a cytoplasmic orientation of the internal hydrophilic region carrying the major antigenic determinants. This may explain the unusual partial glycosylation of the HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{functional}} diversity, the <b>large</b> (L) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> {{of hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) acquires a dual transmembrane topology via co-translational membrane {{integration of the}} S region and partial post-translational translocation of the preS subdomain. Because each process requires the second transmembrane segment (TM 2), we explored the action of this determinant by using protease protection analysis of mutant L proteins. We demonstrated that neither the disruption of a leucine zipper-like motif by multiple alanine substitutions nor the flanking charges of TM 2 affected the topological reorientation of L. The dispensability of both putative subunit interactionmodules argues against a link between preS post-translocation and envelope assembly. Phenotypic mixing experiments revealed that the preS and S protein domains of the related duck HBV L polypeptide failed to substitute functionally for the topogenic elements of HBV in directing the correct L topogenesis, implicating different translocation mechanisms used by the two hepadnavirus genera. Owing to {{the small size of}} their genome, viruses have evolved by retaining a maximum amount of information in a mini-mum of polypeptide sequences. As a consequence, many of the proteins or protein domains encoded by viruses are multifunctional. The <b>large</b> (L) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the prototype member of the Hepadnavi-ridae family, is an example of such multifunctionality. This protein serves in virus entry as a receptor protein and in virus assembly as a matrix-like protein and performs regula-tory functions in addition (reviewed by Bruss et al., 1996). The multifunctionality depends on a dual membrane topo-logy, a phenomenon first observed for the hepadnaviral L glycoprotein (Bruss et al., 1994; Ostapchuk et al., 1994...|$|R
40|$|The {{envelope}} of hepatitis B virus contains three related proteins, {{one of which}} is myristylated. The nonmyristylated small and middle protein are assembled into empty envelope particles which are secreted from cells, whereas the myristylated <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> is mainly found in complete virions and is not secreted {{in the absence of the}} nucleocapsid. The block to secretion can be partially overcome by mutation or deletion of the myristylation site. Creation of a myristyl attachment site in the small protein impairs the secretion of empty envelope particles but not their intracellular assembly. Myristylation may therefore play a crucial role in hepatitis B virus replication by channeling the envelope proteins into complete viral particles...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{vaccination}} {{may represent}} an interesting strategy for early life immunization. However, in some cases, {{this approach has}} been shown to induce a tolerance rather than immunity. We have compared the efficiency of neonatal DNA or protein immunization against hepadnavirus envelope protein using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model. Three-day-old ducklings were immunized with either a plasmid encoding the DHBV pre-S/S <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (L), or a recombinant preS protein, followed by sequential DNA or protein boosts at weeks 4 and 15. Our results showed that genetic immunization of duck neonates induced specific humoral response to DHBV L protein. Interestingly, an enhanced antibody response was elicited when animals received DNA priming-DNA boosting as compared to DNA priming-protein boosting...|$|E
40|$|The {{transforming}} {{gene product}} of the S 13 avian erythroblastosis virus, v-sea, {{is a member of}} the growth factor receptor class of tyrosine kinases. In the virus genome, the sea sequences are fused in frame to the virus env gene, thereby generating an abnormally <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> because of the presence of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. To determine what role these envelope sequences play in v-sea transformation, we generated a myristylated form of v-sea which contains no envelope sequences. In this report, we show that this myristylated sea-encoded protein retained the ability to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts, indicating that envelope sequences are not essential for transformation by the v-sea tyrosine kinase...|$|E
40|$|Covalently closed {{circular}} DNA (cccDNA), {{the nuclear}} form of hepatitis B virus (HBV), is synthesized by repair of the relaxed circular (RC) DNA genome. Initially, cccDNA {{is derived from}} RC DNA from the infecting virion, but additional copies of cccDNA are derived from newly synthesized RC DNA molecules in a process termed intracellular amplification. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>large</b> viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> limits the intracellular amplification of cccDNA for duck hepatitis B virus. The role of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> in regulating the amplification of cccDNA in HBV is not well characterized. The present report demonstrates regulation of synthesis of cccDNA by the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> of HBV. Ablation of expression of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> led to an increase (> 6 -fold) in the level of cccDNA. Subsequent restoration of <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> expression led to a decrease (> 50 %) in the level of cccDNA, which inversely correlated with the level of the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> We found that the expression of L protein alone or in combination with M and/or S proteins led to a decrease in cccDNA levels, indicating that L contributes to the regulation of cccDNA. Coexpression of L and M led to greater regulation than either L alone or L and S. Coexpression of all three <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> was also found to limit completion of plus-strand DNA synthesis, and the degree of this effect correlated with the level of the proteins and virion secretion...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that DNA vaccine {{is of interest}} to fight chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We used the Pekin duck infected by duck HBV (DHBV), {{closely related to the}} human virus, which is an attractive model allowing study of protective and therapeutic effectiveness of DNA vaccines against hepatitis B. Immunisation with a plasmid encoding the DHBV <b>large</b> (L) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> induced a strong, specific, highly neutralising and long-lasting anti-preS humoral response in uninfected ducks. Importantly, maternal antibodies elicited by such DNA immunisation were vertically transmitted and protected progeny against viral challenge. Therapeutic immunisation of chronic DHBV-carrier ducks with this plasmid DNA led to the dramatic and sustained decrease in viral replication and even to clearance of intrahepatic viral covalently close circular DNA (cccDNA) pool in some animals. Our recent combination therapy data showed even a more pronounced antiviral effect of DNA vaccine to DHBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> when associated with antiviral drug (lamivudine) treatment. Therefore, DNA-based vaccine appears as a promising new approach for prophylaxis and therapy of hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the three}} viral {{proteins}} {{present in the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope, both the small and large polypeptides, but not the middle polypeptide, are necessary {{for the production of}} complete viral particles. Whereas it has been established that the C-terminal extremity of the pre-S 1 region is required for HBV morphogenesis, whether the pre-S 2 region of the large surface protein plays a critical role remains questionable. In the present study, we have analyzed the role of the large-polypeptide pre-S 2 region in viral maturation and infectivity. For this purpose, mutants bearing contiguous deletions covering the entire pre-S 2 domain were generated. First, the efficient expression of all the mutant <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> was verified and their ability to substitute for the wild-type form in virion secretion was tested. We found that distinct deletions covering the domain between amino acids 114 and 163 still allowed virion production. In contrast, the polypeptide lacking the first 5 amino acids of pre-S 2 (amino acids 109 to 113) was unable to support viral secretion. This result shows that the domain of the large surface protein, required for this process, must be extended to the N-terminal extremity of pre-S 2. We then demonstrated that all the mutants competent for virion release were able to infect normal human hepatocytes in primary culture. Taken together, these results indicate that only 10 % of the large-protein pre-S 2 region at its N-terminal extremity is essential for virion export and that the remaining part, dispensable for viral secretion, is also dispensable for infectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{roles of}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) and aflatoxn and their possible mechanism of interaction in the etiopathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not understood. One {{hypothesis is that}} viral infection and associated liver injury alter expression of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes. We tested this hypothesis in an HBV-transgenic mouse model in which a synergistic interaction occurs between aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and HBV in the induction of HCC (Sell et al., Cancer Res 51 : 1278 – 1285, 1991). In this transgenic mouse lineage, overproduction of the HBV <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> results in progressive liver cell injury, inflammation, and regenerative hyperplasia. Initially, two cytochrome P 450 s of importance in AFB 1 metabolism in the mice were identified, namely Cyp 2 a- 5 and Cyp 3 a, using specific antibodies and chemical inhibitors. The expression of these P 450 isoenzymes and an α-class glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzyme, YaYa, were examined. Increased expression and altered distribution of Cyp 2 a- 5 were demonstrated, by immunohistochemical analysis, {{to be associated with}} the development of liver injury in mice and to increase with age between 1 and 12 months. Cyp 3 a expression was also increased in HBV-transgenic mice, but the increase was not as clearly related to age. GST YaYa levels were the same in HBV-transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates of all ages. These results show that expression of specific cytochrome P 450 s is altered in association with overexpression of HBV <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and liver injury in this model. This may have general relevance to human HCC, the etiology of which is associated with a diverse range of liver-damaging agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) envelope proteins bear two {{determinants of}} viral entry: a receptor-binding site (RBS) in the pre-S 1 {{domain of the}} <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> and a conformation-dependent determinant, of unknown function, in the antigenic loop (AGL) of the small, middle, and large envelope proteins. Using an in vitro infection assay consisting of susceptible HepaRG cells and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) as a surrogate of HBV, we first investigated whether subelements of the pre-S 1 determinant (amino acids 2 to 75), i. e., the N-terminal myristoyl anchor, subdomain 2 - 48 (RBS), and subdomain 49 - 75, were functionally separable. In transcomplementation experiments, coexpression of two distinct infectivity-deficient pre-S 1 mutants at the surface of HDV virions failed to restore infectivity, indicating that the myristoyl anchor, the 2 - 48 RBS, and the 49 - 75 sequence, likely cooperate in cis at viral entry. Furthermore, we showed {{that as much as}} 52 % of total pre-S 1 in the HDV envelope could bear infectivity-deficient lesions without affecting entry, indicating that a small number of pre-S 1 polypeptides—estimated at three to four per virion—is sufficient for infectivity. We next investigated the AGL activity in the small or <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> background (S- and L-AGL, respectively) and found that lesions in S-AGL were more deleterious to infectivity than in L-AGL, a difference that reflects the relative stoichiometry of the small and large envelope proteins in the viral envelope. Finally, we showed that C 147 S, an AGL infectivity-deficient substitution, exerted a dominant-negative effect on infectivity, likely reflecting an involvement of C 147 in intermolecular disulfide bonds...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a 180 -kDa cellular glycoprotein (gp 180) that binds with high affinity to duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) particles. The protein was detected by coprecipitating labeled duck hepatocyte proteins with virions or recombinant DHBV envelope proteins, using nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the virion envelope. Binding of gp 180 requires only the pre-S region of the viral <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> since recombinant fusion proteins bearing only this region efficiently coprecipitate gp 180. The DHBV-gp 180 interaction is blocked by two independent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The protein is found on both internal and surface membranes of the cell, and the species distribution of gp 180 binding activity mirrors the known host range of DHBV infection. Functional gp 180 is expressed {{in a wide variety}} of tissues in susceptible ducks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{addition}} of N-linked glycans to proteins is normally a cotranslational process that occurs during translocation of the nascent protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, {{we report on}} an exception to this rule occurring on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>large</b> L <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> that is a subject to co-plus posttranslational N-glycosylation. Results By using an improved detection system, we identified so far unrecognized, novel isoforms of L. Based on mutational analyses, the use of N-glycosylation inhibitors, and pulse-chase studies, we showed that these isoforms are due to posttranslational N-glycan addition to the asparagines 4 and 112 within the preS domain of L. While an inhibition of N-glycosylation and glycan trimming profoundly blocked virus assembly and release, the posttranslational N-glycosylation of L itself {{was found to be}} dispensable for HBV morphogenesis. Conclusion These data together with previous results implicate that the N-glycosylation requirements of virion release are due to functional inhibition of cell glycoproteins engaged by HBV. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>large</b> L <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> of the {{hepatitis}} B {{virus has}} the peculiar capacity to adopt two transmembrane topologies. The N-terminal preS domain of L initially {{remains in the}} cytosol while the S domain is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The preS region of {{about half of the}} L molecules is posttranslationally translocated to the lumenal space. We now demonstrate that the repression of cotranslational translocation of preS is conferred by a preS 1 -specific sequence. By analysis of L deletion mutants, the cytosolic anchorage determinant was mapped to amino acid sequence 70 to 94 of L. The intrinsic potential of this determinant to suppress cotranslational translocation was confirmed by transfer to the HBV middle <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> In searching for cellular factors potentially involved in this novel process, we identified the cytosolic heat shock protein Hsc 70 as a specific binding partner of L. The interaction site(s) for the chaperone was mapped to amino acids 63 to 107 of L using coimmunoprecipitation andin vitrobinding analyses. Deletion of the cytosolic anchorage determinant almost completely abolished ATP-dependent Hsc 70 binding. Therefore, interaction between Hsc 70 and L is likely to be responsible for the suppression of cotranslational translocation of the preS domain...|$|R

Following genetic immunization of breeding ducks with a DHBV L protein gene-bearing plasmid, specific and highly neutralizing antibodies were {{transferred from the}} sera of immunized ducks, via the egg yolk, to the progeny of vaccinees. Interestingly, large amounts (60 to 100 mg/egg) of high-titer and L protein-specific yolk immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin Y) accumulated in the egg yolk. These results suggest that eggs from genetically immunized avians may represent a potent source of DNA-designed antibodies specific to viral antigen. Importantly, these antibodies are vertically transmitted and protect offspring against high-titer DHBV challenge...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{explored}} in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model {{the impact of}} electroporation (EP) -mediated DNA vaccine delivery on the neutralizing humoral response to viral preS/S <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> EP enhanced the kinetics and magnitude of anti-preS response compared to the standard needle DNA injection (SI). Importantly, EP dramatically enhanced the neutralizing potency of the humoral response, since antibodies induced by low DNA dose (10 μg) were able to highly neutralize DHBV and to recognize ten antigenic regions, including four neutralization epitopes. Whereas, SI-induced antibodies by the same low DNA dose were not neutralizing and the epitope pattern was extremely narrow, since it was limited to only one epitope. Thus, EP-based delivery was able to improve the dose efficiency of DNA vaccine and to maintain a highly neutralizing, multi-specific B-cell response, suggesting {{that it may be}} an effective approach for chronic hepatitis B therapy at clinically feasible DNA dose...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} linker {{scanning}} and site-directed mutagenesis {{in an attempt}} to distinguish among the known functions of the duck hepatitis B virus <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> p 36. We found that linker-encoded amino acid substitutions in at least one region of the pre-S envelope protein p 36 produced defects in both the production of enveloped virus and the regulation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) synthesis. Most linker substitutions, typically in the 5 ' two-thirds of the pre-S region of the p 36 gene did not affect either cccDNA regulation or enveloped virus production but did destroy the infection competence of the enveloped particles produced. Single amino acid substitutions of residues 128 and 131 demonstrated a similar correlation between defects in the ability of p 36 to support enveloped virus production and to control cccDNA levels. We concluded from these studies that virus production and cccDNA regulation probably require a common activity of p 36...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{is formed}} by budding. A stretch of 22 amino acids (aa) (matrix domain, MD, R 103 – S 124) in the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> L {{is crucial for}} virion formation and probably establishes contact to the nucleocapsid. Here, we {{assess the impact of}} sequence variations at numerous individual aa positions within the MD on virion formation. We generated panels of L mutants covering all 19 possible aa for 11 positions and tested the capacity of these mutants to rescue virus production by an L-defective HBV genome. At four positions (L 112, R 113, P 117, W 122), any replacement of the wild type (WT) aa reduced virus assembly to undetectable levels. Virus production was strongly diminished by substitutions at five other positions (R 103, T 106, S 115, H 116, A 119). Only two tested positions (D 114, Q 118) tolerated several substitutions. The restricted positions may represent promising targets for the development of novel antiviral strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) particles bear a receptor-binding site {{located in}} the pre-S 1 domain of the <b>large</b> HBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> Using the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) as a surrogate of HBV, a second infectivity determinant was recently identified in the <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> antigenic loop (AGL), and its activity was shown to depend upon cysteine residues that are essential for {{the structure of the}} HBV immunodominant “a” determinant. Here, an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach was used to precisely map the AGL infectivity determinant to a set of conserved residues, which are predicted to cluster together with cysteines in the AGL disulfide bridges network. Several substitutions suppressed both infectivity and the “a” determinant, whereas others were infectivity deficient with only a partial impact on antigenicity. Interestingly, G 145 R, a substitution often arising under immune pressure selection and detrimental to the “a” determinant, had no effect on infectivity. Altogether, these findings indicate that the AGL infectivity determinant is closely related to, yet separable from, the “a” determinant. Finally, a selection of HDV entry-deficient mutations were introduced at the surface of HBV virions and shown to also abrogate infection in the HBV model. Therefore, a function can at last be assigned to the orphan “a” determinant, the first-discovered marker of HBV infection. The characterization of the AGL functions at viral entry may lead to novel approaches in the development of antivirals against HBV...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and {{woolly monkey}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (WMHBV) have natural host ranges that {{are limited to}} closely related species. The barrier for infection of primates {{seems to be at}} the adsorption and/or entry steps of the viral replication cycle, since a human hepatoma cell line is permissive for HBV and WMHBV replication following transfection of cloned DNA. We hypothesized that the HBV and WMHBV <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> contain the principal viral determinants of host range. As previously shown by using the hepatitis D virus (HDV) system, recombinant HBV-HDV particles were infectious in chimpanzee as well as human hepatocytes. We extended the HDV system to include HDV particles pseudotyped with the WMHBV envelope. In agreement with the natural host ranges of HBV and WMHBV, in vitro infections demonstrated that HBV-HDV and WM-HDV particles preferentially infected human and spider monkey cells, respectively. Previous studies have implicated the pre-S 1 region of the <b>large</b> (L) <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> in receptor binding and host range; therefore, recombinant HDV particles were pseudotyped with the hepadnaviral envelopes contain-ing chimeric L proteins with the first 40 amino acids from the pre-S 1 domain exchanged between HBV and WMHBV. Surprisingly, addition of the human amino terminus to the WMHBV L protein increased infectivity on spider monkey hepatocytes but did not increase infectivity for human hepatocytes. Based upon these data, we discuss the possibility that the L protein may be comprised of two domains that affect infectivity and tha...|$|R
40|$|To better {{define the}} {{molecules}} {{involved in the}} initial interaction between hepadnaviruses and hepatocytes, we performed binding and infectivity studies with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and cultured primary duck hepatocytes. In competition experiments with naturally occurring subviral particles containing DHBV surface proteins, these DNA-free particles were found to interfere with viral infectivity if used at sufficiently high concentrations. In direct binding saturation experiments with radiolabelled subviral particles, a biphasic titration curve containing a saturable component was obtained. Quantitative evaluation of both the binding and the infectivity data indicates that the duck hepatocyte presents about 10 (4) high-affinity binding sites for viral and subviral particles. Binding to these productive sites may be preceded by reversible virus attachment to {{a large number of}} less specific, nonsaturable primary binding sites. To identify which of the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> is responsible for hepatocyte-specific attachment, subviral particles containing only one of the two DHBV surface proteins were produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In infectivity competition experiments, only particles containing the large pre-S/S protein were found to markedly reduce the efficiency of DHBV infection, while particles containing the small S protein had only a minor effect. Similarly, physical binding of radiolabelled serum-derived subviral particles to primary duck hepatocytes was inhibited well only by the yeast-derived pre-S/S particles. Together, these results strongly support the notion that hepadnaviral infection is initiated by specific attachment of the pre-S domain of the <b>large</b> DHBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> to a limited number of hepatocellular binding sites...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the structure and fusion potential of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) envelope proteins by treating subviral particles with deforming agents known to release envelope proteins of viruses from a metastable to a fusion-active state. Exposure of DHBV particles to low pH triggered a major structural change in the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (L), resulting in exposure of trypsin sites within its S domain but without affecting the same region in the small surface protein (S) subunits. This conformational change was associated with increased hydrophobicity of the particle surface, most likely arising from surface exposure of the hydrophobic first transmembrane domain (TM 1). In the hydrophobic conformation, DHBV particles were able to bind to liposomes and intact cells, while in their absence these particles aggregated, resulting in viral inactivation. These results suggests that some L molecules are in a spring-loaded metastable state which, when released, exposes a previously hidden hydrophobic domain, a transition potentially representing the fusion-active state of the envelope...|$|E

International audienceHuman {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{infection and}} HBV-related diseases remain {{a major public}} health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S 1 domain of the <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, {{the identity of the}} receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S 1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157 - 165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND and AIMS: Studies in the murine model {{suggest that}} {{injection}} of DNA encoding hepatitis B virus structural proteins is promising for the induction {{of a specific}} immune response. We used the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model to study the protective and therapeutic effects of naked DNA immunization against hepadnaviral <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein.</b> METHODS: A pCI-preS/S plasmid expressing the DHBV large protein was used for intramuscular immunization of ducks. The humoral response was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, neutralization, and in vivo protection tests. For DNA therapy, DHBV-carrier ducks received four injections of this plasmid. Viremia was monitored for 10 months; thereafter, liver biopsies were performed. RESULTS: Immunization with pCI-preS/S plasmid induced a specific, long-lasting, neutralizing, and highly protective anti-preS humoral response in uninfected animals. After pCI-preS/S treatment, a significant and sustained decrease in serum and liver DHBV DNA was observed for carrier ducks compared with the controls. CONCLUSIONS: DNA immunization against DHBV large protein results in a potent and protective anti-preS response in the duck model. The results of long-term follow-up of DNA-treated chronically infected ducks are promising and show the usefulness of this model {{for the study of}} genetic immunization in chronic hepatitis B therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{lack of an}} {{appropriate}} in vitro infection system for the major human pathogen hepatitis B virus (HBV) has prevented a molecular understanding of the early infection events of HBV. We used the novel HBV-infectible cell line HepaRG and primary human hepatocytes to investigate the interference of infection by HBV envelope protein-derived peptides. We found that a peptide consisting of the authentically myristoylated N-terminal 47 amino acids of the pre-S 1 domain of the <b>large</b> viral <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> (L protein) specifically prevented HBV infection, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 8 nM. The replacement of myristic acid with other hydrophobic moieties resulted in changes in the inhibitory activity, most notably by {{a decrease in the}} IC 50 to picomolar concentrations for longer unbranched fatty acids. The obstruction of HepaRG cell susceptibility to HBV infection after short preincubation times with the peptides suggested that the peptides efficiently target and inactivate a receptor at the hepatocyte surface. Our data both shed light on the molecular mechanism of HBV entry into hepatocytes and provide a basis for the development of potent hepadnaviral entry inhibitors as a novel therapeutic concept for the treatment of hepatitis Β...|$|R
40|$|The <b>large</b> <b>envelope</b> (E) <b>protein</b> of flaviviruses is the viral surface {{protein that}} {{contains}} neutralizing epitopes. We have analysed the E protein of the West Nile (WN) flavivirus for neutralizing epitopes generated from linear {{segments of the}} protein; if effective, these might allow the synthesis of peptides uitable for vaccination. For this study we used the E protein and defined fragments thereof as antigens in rabbits. The sera thus obtained, containing antibodies to E protein as shown by Western blot analyses, were tested for neutralizing activity by the plaque reduction neutralization test. If the E protein used as antigen was reduced (the native E protein contains ix disulphide bridges) and denatured the resulting antibodies did not consistently demonstrate n utralizing activity. These results how that the E protein of WN virus does not contain a linear segment hat is able to induce neutralizing antibodies efficiently. Studies using denatured E protein fragments containing subsets of the intact disulphide bridges showed that the local covalent primary structure of the protein involved {{in each of the}} six bridges was also insufficient for inducing the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies.

40|$|Hepadnaviruses are DNA viruses but, as pararetroviruses, their {{morphogenesis}} initiates {{with the}} encapsidation of an RNA pregenome, and these viruses have therefore evolved mechanisms to exclude nucleocapsids that contain incompletely matured genomes {{from participating in}} budding and secretion. We provide here evidence that binding of hepadnavirus core particles from the cytosol to their target membranes is a distinct step in morphogenesis, discriminating among different populations of intracellular capsids. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and a flotation assay, we found {{about half of the}} intracellular capsids to be membrane associated due to an intrinsic membrane-binding affinity. In contrast to free cytosolic capsids, this subpopulation contained largely mature, double-stranded DNA genomes and lacked core protein hyperphosphorylation, both features characteristic for secreted virions. Against expectation, however, the selective membrane attachment observed did not require the presence of the <b>large</b> DHBV <b>envelope</b> <b>protein,</b> which has been considered to be crucial for nucleocapsid-membrane interaction. Furthermore, removal of surface-exposed phosphate residues from nonfloating capsids by itself did not suffice to confer membrane affinity and, finally, hyperphosphorylation was absent from nonenveloped nucleocapsids that were released from DHBV-transfected cells. Collectively, these observations argue for a model in which nucleocapsid maturation, involving the viral genome, capsid structure, and capsid dephosphorylation, leads to the exposure of a membrane-binding signal as a step crucial for selecting the matured nucleocapsid to be incorporated into the capsid-independent budding of virus particles...|$|R
