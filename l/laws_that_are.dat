Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains the ability to use law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> already in effect.|$|E
5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations in public life. By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

25|$|Paramus, {{along with}} the rest of Bergen County, has strict blue laws {{preventing}} stores selling non-food items from opening on Sundays. Although it started as a religious observance, it is kept on the books due to a desire of the residents of Paramus to have one day a week when traffic is tolerable in the town. This law was called into question when a BJ's Wholesale Club opened at the Routes 4/17 junction. BJ's was allowed to open on Sundays, but is only allowed to sell food and basic necessities. The store has been structured to restrict access to items that cannot be purchased on Sunday. Paramus has its own blue <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> significantly more restrictive than those in effect in other communities in Bergen County.

25|$|All tobacco {{advertising}} and sponsorship on television has been banned within the European Union since 1991 under the Television Without Frontiers Directive (1989). This ban was extended by the Tobacco Advertising Directive, which took effect in July 2005 to cover {{other forms of}} media such as the internet, print media, radio, and sports events like F1. The directive does not include advertising in cinemas and on billboards or using merchandising – or tobacco sponsorship of cultural and sporting events which are purely local, with participants coming from only one Member State as these fall outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} European Commission. However, most member states have transposed the directive with national <b>laws</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> wider in scope than the directive and cover local advertising.
