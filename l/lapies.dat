50|$|Tectonically {{the area}} of the Southern Adriatic is very active as the {{frequency}} of earthquakes indicates. As the Adriatic Plate subduces under the Dinarids, earthquakes can have devastating energy. Sometimes even tsunamis are observed. Mount Orjen is completely built of folded Cretaceous limestones which belongs to the High-Karst Zone geological unit. The High-Karst Zone has the greatest extent in the territory of Montenegro. The terrain of this geotectonic unit is mainly built up of Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous) limestones and dolomites of several kilometres of thickness. This thickness is even larger, due to the reverse faulting and overthrusting and thus repeating of carbonate series. The karst of this region is characterised by all surface occurrences and all processes characteristic for holokarst such as: karst plain, polje, uvala, sinkhole, dry-, hanging-, blind- and karstified valley, <b>lapies,</b> canyon, shaft, cave, resurgence, vrulja, estavelle and so on.The karstification of limestones and dolomites in this area is below the base level of erosion, below the sea level and is deeper than 1,000 m. The High-Karst Zone has all the prominent characteristics of fluvial erosion (deep canyons of Komarnica and Morača rivers with their tributaries), glacial erosion (on Mount Orjen), lacustrine, sea and combined erosion.|$|E

Underground river systems are found between the Lake Region (western Taurus) and Mediterranean coast. These river systems have been shifted towards the deeper parts of the limestone as the result of the progress of karstification and the vertical uplift of the Taurus Mountains (upper Tertiary, Early Quaternary). Caves formed as the result of vertical tectonic movements. These movements caused the lowering of the base level.

40|$|Suhard Mts., {{part of the}} Northern Carpathians, {{stretch over}} an area of 323 sq km, {{in the shape of}} a  northwest-oriented ridge. This massif is {{composed}} of crystalline schists  (meso- and epimetamorphic), as well as sedimentary rocks pertaining to the trans-Carpathian flysch deposits (i. e. various types of sandstone, conglomerates and marls) in the southwestern sector. Whereas this region is characterized by the occurrence {{of a wide range of}} carbonate rocks, we noted the scarcity of karst forms. Geological survey maps of the area indicate the occurrence of few folded structures; moreover, the massif is mostly part of an ample anticline whereby the axis underlies the valley of Bistrita Aurie river, accompanied by a large syncline underlying Cosna river valley (tributary of Dorna river). The prevalence of crystalline rocks within this anticlinorium results in the overall massif shape of these mountains (hence, the name), which is the foundation for the detail structural and lithological relief forms. The array of structural relief forms includes structural plateaus on sedimentary and crystalline carbonate rocks, and steep slopes in the form of both hogbacks and overthrust scarps. The lithological relief occurs primarily as a result of the contrasting chemical composition of various crystalline rocks, whereas sedimentary rocks seldom generate such forms and solely when favored by the structure, as well. Consequently, carbonate rocks are rather discrete and only stand out in the form of clints (<b>lapies)</b> and gorges, or hums. As regards the matter of denudation surfaces, which has proved rather difficult to solve, we were able to determine the presence of an erosion surface ranging from 1200 - 1300 m to 1500 - 1600 m, wherein neotectonics played a significant role by fragmenting the original surface, particularly in the northwestern sector, where its fragments descend in the shape of consecutive steps towards Rotunda saddle. Periglacial modeling of the relief resulted in a variety of forms of both erosion (scarps, ridges, hums) and accumulation (scree) located in the highest areas, particularly along the main ridge (summit) ...|$|E
40|$|Karsts in silicated and non carbonated rocks {{refer to}} morphologies {{similar to those}} found in limestones (caves, <b>lapies,</b> polje…) as being equally {{generated}} by predominantly dissolution processes. Their discovery in allegedly not very soluble rocks raises the question of existing water resources in lithologies which are rarely considered from this point of view. A rough inventory of this kind of karsts shows that they essentially develop in sandstones and quartzites. Other silicated lithologies such as granites or gneisses seem to contain only a few examples. Karsts in silicated and non carbonated rocks are found at all latitudes, though mainly in the warm and temperate climate zones of the world. Nevertheless, these conclusions may result from the lack of systematic prospecting in numerous regions of the world. Typically, most studied cavities are located in Paleozoic to Proterozoic rocks. Underground networks can stretch for several kilometers. Two types of cavities can be identified. The first one is characterized by cave entrances located in a cliff or in a raised hillside. These subhorizontal cavities end blind within the rock massif. No trace of fracturing authorizing mechanical erosion by flows, which would explain their genesis, was ever recorded. The second type of cavities is characterized by the presence of an underground stream which disappears in a siphon or in some impenetrable passages. In some cases, an important granular disintegration of the surrounding rock produces quantities of sand which seal large pre-existent voids. The latter were formed in different physico-chemical conditions than those present in the open air environment. An initial deep karstification is possible despite the surface environment. Secondary morphologies on the cave walls (alveoli, pillars of dissolution, passages with “key hole” section, ceiling bells …) enable us to partially reconstitute the genesis of these caves. It would start in a phreatic environment with the development of spots of dissolution along deep water circulations. Initially, independent cavities grow and interconnect to form embryonal karst networks. The incision of valleys and the weathering processes progressing from the surface can intersect these. Physical erosion then becomes more prominent than chemical erosion. The pre-existent forms, depending on their organization, can either be dismantled or contribute to the evolution of a complex karst network. A comprehensive study of karsts in silicated and non carbonated rocks is an opportunity {{to a better understanding of}} generally inaccessible deep karstification, including in the carbonated rocks. Moreover, the presence of these karsts and sometimes of underground rivers in regions hit by chronic droughts represents a potential of water resources disregarded today. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|THE CAMBONGO-NEGUNZA RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERNS IN ANGOLA. The hydrographical {{basin of}} River Cambongo-Negunza, {{situated}} in the coastal area of central Angola, was selected {{as an example of}} the complexity of drainage patterns in Angola. From its sources in the massifs of the Marginal Mountain (more than 2 000 m) the river flows through the stepped planed erosion surfaces to the Ocean. In its lower course the river valley presents a narrow and V-shaped cross profile cut in sedimentary rocks (Cretaceous-Quaternary). The coastal erosion surface, including the raised beaches (mean altitudes from 40 to 100 m), levelling the rocks of the Sedimentary Belt and those of the ancient crystalline massif, gradually rises towards the east until a well marked topographical limit, the base (altitude approx. 280 - 300 m) of the steep western slopes of a NNE-SSW quartzitic ridge with a dissymmetrical cross-sectional profile: the serra do Engelo (altitudes between 1 400 - 1 700 m), whose faults are peppered with thermal springs. Above the coastal surface, in the crystalline rock strip, some quartzitic hills with Inselberge characteristics rise out of the plains, leading to problems in relation to, for example, the western extension of the quartzite formations and their dismantling, and the behaviour of the same material in the complex genesis and evolution processes of the extensive regional line of N-S escarpments, against which the erosion surfaces of the coastal belt end. In the limestones near the coast, the river Cambongo-Negunza has a subterranean network of large caves and galleries surfacing near the small plain from which it flows into the ocean. Not far from the valley sinks and dolines of various sizes and <b>lapies</b> can be seen. The climatic conditions are semi-arid, with annual precipitation less than 700 mm and high evaporation rates. Vegetation is a mix of that which can be found in savanna, steppe and xerophytic habitats, with few to no trees. A vast area of outcrops of granitic and related rocks, sometimes covered by regoliths of various thicknesses, can be found between the Serra do Engelo and the massifs of the Marginal Mountain chain. The altitudes of the general levelling range between 1 100 and 1 200 m. The area is covered by forest and savannas with low trees, shrubs and tall grasses growing in rather thin and variable soils, fersialitic being among the most frequent. The average temperature is around 22 ºC and annual rainfall is about 1 400 mm. Lateritisation or bauxitisation lines and subaerean duricrust can be seen in many places. Above this surface, there are many Inselberge-type hills, isolated or in groups, mostly with square-shaped forms, linked or not to the geometrical patterns of the hydrographic networks, revealing the structural control of fractures and faults over these watercourses, whether small or large, permanent or temporary. Note that the majority of the Inselberge is not found near the escarpments of the marginal mountain chain, the eastern limit of the 1 100 - 1 200 metre-high plain, but rather quite a distance away to the west, near the Serra do Engelo quartzitic ridge. The same can be seen in the neighbouring basins of the River Cuvo-Queve to the north and to the south of the Cambongo-Negunza river basin. Fracture valleys and residual hills call for more detailed explanations, with suggestions of criteria for their study. Moreover, there has been the concern regarding how to correlate several factors relative to external dynamics (meteorisation and erosion in a broad sense) with those relative to internal dynamics (geology and tectonics) to explain the genesis and evolution of the landforms. Therefore, the study wraps up with some brief thoughts regarding a dynamic geo-chronological approach...|$|E
