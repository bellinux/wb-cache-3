5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> continuously. The <b>liquid</b> <b>soap</b> is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

40|$|Aim: A {{comparative}} study for plaque removing efficacy between toothpaste, <b>liquid</b> handwashing <b>soap,</b> and two chemical-soak denture cleansers (clinsodent denture cleansing powder and fittydent denture cleansing tablet). Materials and Methods: A total of 140 healthy complete denture patients were selected and checked for denture cleansing using toothpaste, <b>liquid</b> handwashing <b>soap,</b> and two chemical denture cleansers: Clinsodent powder and fittydent tablets. Cleansing with plain water was kept as control for twenty patients. Results: The {{data were analyzed}} using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for checking the efficacy. The KruskalâWallis test was used for comparing the plaque removing efficacies of each denture cleanser used in the study. All four denture cleansers were significantly effective in removing plaque when compared with plain water, but {{there was no significant difference}} among them. Conclusions: There was no significant difference among action of four denture cleansers used in this study. Thus we can infer that patients can use <b>liquid</b> handwashing <b>soap</b> or commercial products to overcome disadvantages of toothpastes. Recommendation from the results of this study is the use of <b>liquid</b> handwashing <b>soap</b> for cleansing after every meal and soaking of the denture in commercial denture cleanser during the night...|$|R
