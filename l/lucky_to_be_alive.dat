500|$|The {{recording}} of the album was filmed {{as part of a}} career-spanning documentary called Back and Forth, which Grohl said was essential to make audiences understand the decision to record the album in his garage. The album name, taken from a lyric in [...] "Miss the Misery", was chosen by Grohl because [...] "it seemed to resonate with me: 'OK, that's what we're here doing'", as the band always [...] "recorded each album thinking it could be our last" [...] and tried to take the most of their tenure together—"we're only here for a short time, we're <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alive,</b> lucky to be a band; I don't take any of this for granted; I don't want to spend my time looking backwards, I want to look forwards".|$|E

6000|$|Of {{our journey}} through Zululand {{there is nothing}} {{particular}} to say. We saw but few people, {{since most of the}} men had been called up to the army, and many of the kraals seemed to be deserted by the women and children who perhaps were hidden away with the cattle. Once, however, we met an impi about five thousand strong, that seemed to cover the hillside like a herd of game. It consisted of the Nodwengu and the Nokenke regiments, both of which afterwards fought at Isandhlwana. Some of their captains with a small guard came to see who we were, fine, fierce-looking men. They stared at me curiously, and with one of them, whom I knew, I had a little talk. He said that I was the last white man in Zululand and that I was <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alive,</b> for soon these, and he pointed to the hordes of warriors who were streaming past, would eat up the English to [...] "the last bone." [...] I answered that this remained to be seen, as the English were also great eaters, whereat he laughed, replying, that it was true that the white men had already taken the first bite--a very little one, from which I gathered that some small engagement had happened.|$|E

50|$|When the French ranks {{began to}} withdraw, the Scots refused <b>to</b> flee and <b>were</b> cut {{down by the}} hundreds. Over 3,000 of them fell at the {{bridgehead}} or along the riverbanks, and over 2,000 prisoners were taken, including the Earl of Buchan and {{the commander of the}} Dauphin's forces, the Comte de Vendôme. The Dauphin's forces retreated to the Loire, leaving many prisoners behind and over 6,000 dead. Buchan may well have considered himself <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>alive.</b> King Henry V of England had re-asserted the English claim of suzerainty over Scotland, and therefore executed Scots prisoners of war {{on the grounds that they}} were traitors, fighting against their own King.|$|R

50|$|With Nazi Germany already {{straining}} {{its resources}} for external war in November 1938, {{there is no}} nationwide Kristallnacht involving pogroms and burning of synagogues. Still, discrimination and persecution of Jews becomes ever more intensive and oppressive. Even Jews completely assimilated in the German culture, who thought of themselves as Germans (and as patriotic Germans) are driven beyond the pale, not allowed to join the Army even {{when they want to}} (and when they had served with distinction in the previous war) nor being allowed to use the air raid shelters when Allied bombers start arriving overhead. The conquest of Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France expose an increasing number of additional Jews to the racist brutality from which German Jews have suffered since 1933. The Jews have no clear idea how far the Nazis intend to go, but they have many reasons to feel foreboding and start assuming that they could count themselves <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> still <b>alive</b> at the war's end.|$|R

5000|$|After expounding on how <b>lucky</b> we <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alive,</b> {{and urging}} {{us not to}} waste the {{precious}} time that we have, Dawkins brings up the usefulness of science in aiding {{our understanding of the}} universe. He mentions the reply that Michael Faraday gave to Sir Robert Peel when asked about the use of science. Faraday's response was [...] "What is the use of a baby?" [...] Dawkins explains that Faraday <b>was</b> either referring <b>to</b> the vast potential of a baby, or to the idea that there must <b>be</b> something more <b>to</b> life than growing up, working, getting old, and dying. There must <b>be</b> a point <b>to</b> it all; Perhaps science can uncover the answers to our biggest questions.|$|R
5000|$|Once on the island, Unca Eliza, realizing {{she is a}} {{castaway}} grieves, {{then quickly}} devotes herself to God realizing how <b>lucky</b> she <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alive.</b> Unca Eliza finds an abandoned hermitage shortly after, which she takes as her shelter. Inside, she finds a manuscript of the previous occupant telling her how to survive as they have. The manuscript implies the occupant may soon be dead. She beings settling into her new lifestyle. She learns how to fend for herself and begrudgingly eats some goats and roots. After several weeks of this, she realizes the gravity of her situation and is much distressed, and comes down with a debilitating fever. Once she recovers, she consults the manuscript for more information, and learns that there is life on the island after all. She decides to explore her new habitation and understands the hermitage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a religious temple of the sun, which contains numerous mummies. Upon returning from her explorations, she is startled {{by the presence of}} the hermit, who she thought was no longer on the island. The hermit dies overnight, and Unca Eliza makes more explorations and discovers an underground passageway leading to an idol of worship. While she is there she discovers that she can climb inside [...] "the oracle" [...] and it allows her voice <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard for a great distance. A tempest brews outside, trapping her in the passageway. Afterward, the temple is visited by a group of Indians, as the manuscript predicted, and Unca Eliza hides in the secret passageway. While she is in there, she resolves to convert the Indians to Christianity ("from their idolatry") and develops a plan to hide within the body of the idol and to speak to the Indians when they arrive for their worship on the following year. An earthquake ensues during her practicing of the plan, and upon its conclusion, she discovers it has destroyed her abode. When the Indians arrive for their worship, she converses with the high-priest from within the idol, instructing the Indians in Christian principles.'''''' ...|$|R
