25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone {{but the reason}} for that is a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

To provide a deeper story, the team brought aboard novelist Joshua Ortega as to incorporate more personal drama within the sci-fi setting. Steve Jablonsky provided the music for the game. Epic Games also considered making the game easier after complaints about Gears of War.

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a <b>little</b> <b>harder.</b> You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E
500|$|... "We Can't Stop" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who appreciated its overall production but were negative towards its lyrical content.

[...] Sam Lansky from Idolator noted that stands apart from other songs recently played on mainstream radio, adding that it [...] "just feels strange, and kind of wonderful", while the Los Angeles Times Mikael Woods labeled it [...] "the calmest, most clear-eyed rebel yell since Janet Jackson's [...] "Control." [...] Sean Daly of the Tampa Bay Times and Wall Street Journal staff both appreciated the catchy melody, while Lyndsey Parker from Yahoo!

500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim from critics.

A writer for PAPER hailed the track as [...] " [...] first 2013 party jam", adding that the song [...] "will jolt you awake this Wednesday morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave [...] "BBD" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing [...] "With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we’re really calling trap-rave now, huh, plus some masterfully timed quiet-loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper’s usual immaculately stylish beat selection".|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} few {{contemporaneous}} accounts, the Toledo Blade {{wrote that}} the Penn players, knowing that Schulz was [...] "the power in the Michigan game", focused their energy on wearing him down. [...] There were two Penn players who [...] "did nothing but look after Schultz". [...] And they did more than look: [...] "In every scrimmage, he was bumped as hard as the rules allowed, and maybe a <b>little</b> <b>harder,</b> when nobody was looking.... Every time Schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of Penn men digging headfirst into his stomach. [...] They would elbow him, jam him with the straight arm, and if he went to the ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in the wind. [...] Pretty soon Schultz began to show it.... He limped along pitifully. [...] He couldn't run. [...] His strength was almost gone. [...] When he did tackle, his groan of pain could almost be heard in the stands". [...] But the fans continued to urge Schulz with yells of [...] "G-r-r-r-r-rah, Schultz!"

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly favorable, calling it [...] "the only show with any sense of mystery." [...] John Teti of The A.V.

[...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the two assault {{companies}} came ashore, a small {{spotter plane}} on an observation mission flew overhead, dropping grenades {{in lieu of}} the promised air support from the 5th Air Force. According to U.S. Marine Corps historians, Hough and Shaw, citing Lieutenant Colonel Isamu Murayama's Southeast Area Operations Record, this impromptu air support was later described by the defenders as heavy. As the initial force pushed inland, several small scale clashes occurred, but the landing was largely unopposed. A beachhead was established about [...] inland and patrols were sent out– on the right Company 'A' quickly met its objective, but on the left Company 'B' found the going a <b>little</b> <b>harder</b> due to swampy ground, which forced them to outflank it around the foothills of Lower Mount Worri where they encountered a small group of Japanese. To sea, the follow on waves were controlled by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Amory, in his own vessel, acting to ensure that the beach was not swamped by too many landing craft {{at the same time to}} ensure an orderly disembarkation as the 2nd Battalion followed up the 1st, moving through the beachhead towards Bitokara Mission. Nevertheless, the coral reefs slowed the boats coming in, forcing them to sail in single file, while the confines of landing beach made unloading slow and the requirement to manpack all equipment also added to the delays. Artillery landing on the water's edge suffered heavily from the Japanese mortars firing on the beach, while the medical staff on the beach also suffered heavily.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{revealed}} {{plans for}} Daniel's [...] "good-natured" [...] personality {{to change as}} {{he turned away from}} his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career-driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: [...] "I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance for a long time now. It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've got to take more risks, be more ruthless and push a <b>little</b> <b>harder.</b> It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character." [...] Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel [...] "more status" [...] within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would still be there. Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he would not like to see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be [...] "strong-willed and street smart" [...] like him.|$|E
