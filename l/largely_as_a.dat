5|$|<b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} the {{influence}} of humans in sheep breeding, ewes often produce multiple lambs. This increase in the lamb births, both in number and birth weight, may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival, requiring the intervention of shepherds.|$|E
5|$|By the 1780s, {{the brewery}} {{probably}} had an annual output of around 1,500 barrels, {{similar to the}} rival breweries of Benjamin Wilson and Michael Bass. Throughout the eighteenth century, Worthington sales were mostly of porter, directed towards the Baltic market, which was transported via narrowboat through the River Trent to the Port of Hull. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of this trade, {{by the time of}} Worthington's death in 1800, Worthington & Co. ranked among the largest of the provincial breweries.|$|E

5|$|Howard Staunton (1810– 22 June 1874) was an English chess master who is {{generally}} regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his 1843 victory over Saint-Amant. He promoted a chess set of clearly distinguishable pieces of standardised shape—the Staunton pattern promulgated by Nathaniel Cook—that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the first international chess tournament in 1851, which made England the world's leading chess centre and caused Adolf Anderssen to be recognised as the world's strongest player.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In mid May 2016, {{it became}} known that Reso had been {{released}} from his talent contract. On the June 22, 2016 Talk is Jericho podcast focusing on the Chris Benoit tragedy, Jericho mentioned Christian {{as an example of}} modern wrestlers who had to retire as the WWE would no longer give them medical clearances due to concussion related injuries. This was <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of the Benoit incident, as well as better knowledge of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other concussion related risks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{days of the}} trial, Quisling's health suffered, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result {{of the number of}} medical tests to which he was subjected, and his defence faltered. The prosecution's {{powerful}} final speech placed responsibility for the Final Solution being carried out in Norway at the feet of Quisling, using the testimony of German officials. The prosecutor Annæus Schjødt called for the death penalty, using laws introduced by the government-in-exile in October 1941 and January 1942.|$|E
5|$|<b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} {{lobbying}} by Children's Healthcare is a Legal Duty, the government eliminated the HEW regulation in 1983, but 39 states, Guam and the District of Columbia still had religious exemptions in their civil codes on {{child abuse and}} neglect as of February 2015. Forty-eight US states allowed religious exemptions for compulsory vaccination as of June 2015. In Australia the church was the only group with a religious exemption for vaccination as of April 2015; the government said that it planned to remove it.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{population of}} brown and Peruvian pelicans {{is estimated at}} 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The National Audubon Society estimates the global population of the brown pelican at 300,000. Numbers of brown pelican plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.|$|E

5|$|This cyclone {{brought a}} devastating storm surge {{of up to}} 10metres (33ft) high to the Ganges Delta. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of this surge somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000people lost their lives, making this storm the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone ever recorded {{and one of the}} deadliest natural disasters of modern times. The total damage from the storm exceeded $85million (1970 USD, $480million 2008USD) and much of the agricultural and fishing capacity of the region was wiped out. In total some 3.6million people suffered direct effects from this cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{played for}} Trinidad {{in the next}} Inter-Colonial Tournament, in British Guiana in 1922. Although in two games he scored only 45 runs and took four wickets, {{commentators}} considered his fielding in the covers to be exceptional, and he retained {{his place in the}} team <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fielder. Although Trinidad lost to Barbados in the final, the Barbados captain Harold Austin, who was also captain of the West Indies team, was impressed by Constantine. Mainly on the strength of his fielding, Austin secured Constantine's selection for the 1923 West Indian tour of England; it was a surprising choice, as there were other candidates who appeared to have stronger claims. By this time Constantine was working for Llewellyn Roberts, a larger solicitors' practice which paid better. As his new employer's longer working hours restricted Constantine's cricket practice, when he was selected for the West Indies tour he resigned his position.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|Edward was crowned at age {{fourteen}} {{after his}} father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. This started {{what became known as}} the Hundred Years' War. Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years were marked by international failure and domestic strife, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his inactivity and poor health.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this period, through a process of conquest, {{consolidation}} and treaty, the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east, to almost its modern borders. For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant, with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh, Stirling and Perth, before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century. <b>Largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of Viking raids from about 800, Iona declined as a religious centre. Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld, it was St. Andrews on the east coast, close to the heartland of Pictish settlement, that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of the}} new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E

5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} land surveyor, Boydell apprenticed {{himself to}} William Henry Toms, an artist he admired, and learned engraving. He {{established}} his own business in 1746 and published his first book of engravings around the same time. Boydell did not think much of his own artistic efforts and eventually started buying the works of others, becoming a print dealer {{as well as an}} artist. He became a successful importer of French prints during the 1750s but was frustrated by their refusal to trade prints in kind. To spark reciprocal trade, he commissioned William Wollett's spectacular engraving of Richard Wilson's The Destruction of the Children of Niobe, which revolutionised the print trade. Ten years later, <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of Boydell's initiative, the trade imbalance had shifted, and he was named a fellow of the Royal Society for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe gained {{nationwide}} {{attention for}} the first time in 1911. As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 upset of Harvard, a top ranked team in those early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship <b>largely</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of his efforts – he scored 25 touchdowns and 198points during the season, according to CNN's Greg Botelho. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points. Thorpe rushed 191 times for 1,869 yards, according to Boda; the figures do not include statistics from 2 of Carlisle's 14 games in 1912 because full records are not available.|$|E
