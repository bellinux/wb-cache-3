5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors and <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> and 55% preferring a majority of <b>lay</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Felix was associated with Irish missionary activity in Francia, which was centred in Burgundy and was particularly associated with Columbanus and Luxeuil Abbey. Columbanus had arrived in Francia in about 590, after leaving Bangor along with twelve companions and going into voluntary exile. Upon Columbanus's arrival, he was encouraged to stay, and in about 592 settled at Annegay, but was then forced to find an alternative site for a monastery at Luxeuil, when <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> and the sick continually sought the counsel of himself and his fellow monks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and <b>lay</b> <b>people.</b> He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|In Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree {{known as}} the Apostolic {{constitution}} Ut Sit, Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by Ut Sit and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the Church's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolence is an {{overriding}} theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> as well.|$|E

5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact.

Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most <b>lay</b> <b>people,</b> industry, popular meteorology, and government.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The present paper investigates on <b>lay</b> <b>people's</b> beliefs {{regarding}} {{cancer risk}} factors' and their correlates, especially people's socioeconomic status (SES), {{as they may}} heavily contribute to social health inequalities. Methods: We used data from the 2010 Baromètre Cancer, a national representative telephone survey conducted in France (N= 3359, age 15 – 75, participation rate 52 %). Results: Respondents differentiate behavioral factors (smoking, drinking, unprotected sun exposure, etc.), environmental risk factors (air pollution, chemicals in food, etc.) and psychosocial risk factors (stress, painful experiences, etc.) for cancer. Those with a higher SES {{were more likely to}} emphasize behavioral and psychosocial factors, while those with an intermediate SES were more likely to do so for environmental ones. Perceived financial vulnerability was associated to higher perceptions for both environmental and psychosocial factors. After adjustment on socio-demographic background and SES, respondents who emphasized behavioral risk factors were less prone to endorse fatalistic attitudes (considering that nothing can be done to avoid cancer), while those who emphasized environmental risk factors were more prone to do so, and were also more frequently daily smokers. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>lay</b> <b>people's</b> beliefs regarding cancer risk factors are shaped by their conceptions regarding one's body and health, and especially their health locus of control, as the tendency to either emphasize behavioral or environmental factors was correlated to fatalistic attitudes. Prevention campaigns designed to tackle <b>lay</b> <b>people's</b> perceptions regarding cancer risk factors should not consider they simply reflect ignorance or misinformation, as they are embedded in social and cultural contexts...|$|R

5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's {{closest friend}} and {{colleague}} and pastor of St. Peterskirche, publicly called {{for the removal of}} statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and iconoclastic activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the mass and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the <b>lay</b> <b>people</b> of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E
5|$|Now the Visitation {{allowed for}} an {{inventory}} of what the monasteries possessed, and the visiting commissioners claimed to have uncovered sexual immorality and financial impropriety amongst the monks and nuns, which became the ostensible justification for their suppression. The Church owned between one-fifth and one-third {{of the land in}} all England; Cromwell realised that he could bind the gentry and nobility to Royal Supremacy by selling to them the huge amount of Church lands, and that any reversion to pre-Royal Supremacy would entail upsetting many of the powerful people in the realm. For these various reasons the Dissolution of the Monasteries began in 1536 with the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act, affecting smaller houses—those valued at less than £200 a year. Henry used the revenue to help build coastal defences (see Device Forts) against expected invasion, and all the land was given to the Crown or sold to the aristocracy. Whereas the royal supremacy had raised few eyebrows, the attack on abbeys and priories affected <b>lay</b> <b>people.</b> Mobs attacked those sent to break up monastic buildings. Suppression commissioners were attacked by local people in several places. In Northern England there were a series of uprisings by Roman Catholics against the dissolutions in late 1536 and early 1537.|$|E
40|$|This paper clarifies and repositions some of {{the controversies}} {{generated}} by Burawoy’s defense of public sociology and {{his vision of the}} mutually stimulating relationship between the different forms of sociology. Before arguing if, why, and how, sociology should or could be more “public,” it is useful to reflect upon what we think we, as sociologists, know that “lay people” do not. This paper thus explores the public sociology debate’s epistemological core, the issue of the relationship between sociologists’ and nonsociologists’ knowledge of the social world. Four positions regarding the status of sociologists’ knowledge versus <b>lay</b> <b>people’s</b> knowledge are explored: superiority (sociologists’ knowledge of the social world is more accurate, objective, and reflexive than <b>lay</b> <b>people’s</b> knowledge, thanks to science’s methods and norms); homology (explicit lay theories about the social world often parallel social scientists’ theories); complementarity (<b>lay</b> <b>people’s</b> and social scientists’ knowledge complement one another; the former’s local, embedded knowledge is essential to the latter’s general, disembedded knowledge); and circularity (sociologists’ knowledge continuously infuses commonsensical knowledge, and scientific knowledge about the social world is itself rooted in common sense knowledge; each form of knowledge feeds the other). For each of these positions, implications are drawn regarding the terms, possibilities, and conditions of a dialogue between sociologists and their publics, especially if we take the circularity thesis seriously. Conclusions point to the accountability we face towards the people we study, and to the idea that sociology is always performative, a point that has, to some extent, been obscured by Burawoy’s distinctions between professional, critical, policy, and public sociologies...|$|R

40|$|Using Functional Measurement (Anderson, 2008), Frileux, Lelièvre, Muñoz Sastre, Mullet, and Sorum (2003) {{examined}} the joint impact of several key factors on <b>lay</b> <b>people's</b> judgments of {{the acceptability of}} physicians' interventions to end patients' lives. The level of acceptability was high, and the information integration rule that best described the participants' judgments was Acceptability = Patient's Request + Patient's Age + Residual Suffering + Incurability. Critics suggested, however, that acceptability was high because the ethical problem was framed in terms of acceptability (Murphy, 2007). Presenting participants with acceptability scales may have caused the life-ending procedure to be represented in participants' mind as basically "acceptable". By contrast, presenting participants with unacceptability scales might cause the procedure to be represented as basically "unacceptable". In the present study, therefore, we directly compared <b>lay</b> <b>people's</b> judgments of the acceptability of life-ending procedures under two opposite conditions - an acceptability condition, and an unacceptability condition. The life-ending procedure did not appear as more acceptable to participants responding in terms of acceptability than to those responding in terms of unacceptability.
