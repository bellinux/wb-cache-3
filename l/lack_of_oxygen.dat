5|$|The {{relative}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> in {{the early}} ocean resulted in a scarcity in dissolved molybdenum. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.|$|E
5|$|Thermal inertia and the {{transfer}} of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the night and day sides, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, {{but because of the}} high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even if the heat, pressure, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> were not a problem.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> bound <b>oxygen</b> in Hb Bassett homozygotes {{leads to}} the {{clinical}} outcome of cyanosis (they are cyanotic) (Abdulmalik et al., 2004).|$|R
30|$|Other {{investigators}} have also observed low SpO 2 readings among patients, who received midazolam sedation, {{and this has}} been attributed to hypoventilation or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> supplemental <b>oxygen</b> administration (Inan et al. 2003), which is not the case in this study.|$|R
50|$|Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR), {{also known}} as fetal growth restriction (FGR) or intrauterine growth retardation, refers to poor growth of a fetus while in the mother's womb during pregnancy. The causes can be many, but most often involve poor maternal nutrition or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> adequate <b>oxygen</b> supply to the fetus.|$|R
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen,</b> suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of firedamp, a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; firedamp rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of firedamp is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of firedamp contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{need for}} {{glycolysis}} and glucose uptake for ATP pro-duction is observed in tumor cells, particularly in cells <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> supply. Because glucose is transported from blood to tumor, glucose molecules must be delivered across glucose transporters of the vascular endothelium and tumor cells. Here {{we found that}} glioma suffered from hypoxic insults can secrete factor(s) to regulate glucose transporter expression in brain endothelium. It was found that conditioned medium from rat C 6 glioma cells under hypoxia up-regulated glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT 1) expression in rat brain endothelial cells, whereas conditioned medium from C 6 cells under normoxia caused no significant effect. We further investigated whether the observed potentiating effect was caused by vascular en-dothelial growth factor (VEGF) production from C 6 cells, be...|$|R

2500|$|The {{results of}} the second autopsy were {{announced}} by the State Attorney, Marc Ober, on May 6. Dr. Adams said that Anderson's death was caused by suffocation due to actions of the guards.

[...] The video shows guards holding the capsules in Anderson's face repeatedly.|$|R
25|$|A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> or {{chemical}} {{changes in the}} lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops {{the flow of blood}} and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.|$|E
25|$|Some horticulturalists {{and users}} of {{hydroponics}} advocate {{the use of}} weak hydrogen peroxide solution in watering solutions. Its spontaneous decomposition releases oxygen that enhances a plant's root development and helps to treat root rot (cellular root death due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen)</b> {{and a variety of}} other pests.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication is an {{increase}} in chemical nutrients, typically compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus, in an ecosystem.

30|$|Pyrolysis, like gasification, is an {{advanced}} thermal treatment that converts a material into a syngas but at lower temperatures {{and in the}} absence <b>of</b> <b>oxygen.</b> It is always also the first step in combustion and gasification processes where it is followed by total or partial oxidation of the primary products [4, 5]. Despite the calorific value of a gas derived from pyrolysis being higher than that of gasification, the volume of gas produced is usually much lower due to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> carrier [6 – 8].|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of immune enhancement, anti-fatigue and anoxia {{tolerance}} on mice of four kinds of dodder seeds in Shandong Province. Methods: Water extracts and alcohol extracts of the four kinds of dodder seeds were administered to mice. The phagocytosis of coelio-macrophage, the weight changes of the immune organs, the survival time to swimming and <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> were observed. Results: The four kinds of dodder seeds in Shandong Province could enhance the phagocytosis of macrophage of mice and increase the weights of thymus and spleen of the immature mice. They could prolong the survival time of mice swimming and lacking oxygen. Cuscuta chinensis Lam. and C. australis R. Br. had better effects {{than the other two}} kinds,and the water extracts had better effects than alcohol extracts. Conclusion: The four kinds of dodder seeds in Shandong Province have {{the effects of}} immune enhancement, anti-fatigue and anoxia tolerance.

50|$|Respiratory arrest, {{which results}} in a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an <b>oxygen</b> supply to the brain, is the most evident and lethal effect of anatoxin-a. Injections of mice, rats, birds, dogs, and calves with lethal doses of anatoxin-a have {{demonstrated}} that death is preceded by a sequence of muscle fasciculations, decreased movement, collapse, exaggerated abdominal breathing, cyanosis and convulsions. In mice, anatoxin-a also seriously impacted blood pressure and heart rate, and caused severe acidosis.|$|R
50|$|Three-way {{catalytic}} converters can store oxygen from the exhaust gas stream, usually when the air-fuel ratio goes lean. When sufficient oxygen {{is not available}} from the exhaust stream, the stored oxygen is released and consumed (see cerium(IV) oxide). A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient <b>oxygen</b> occurs either when oxygen derived from NOx reduction is unavailable or when certain maneuvers such as hard acceleration enrich the mixture beyond {{the ability of the}} converter to supply oxygen.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{supply is}} {{necessary}} for today's form of life on Earth. Molecular oxygen is a terminal electron acceptor in mitochondrial respiratory chain and enables the efficient production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> decreases energy production and can endanger the processes maintaining homeostasis. Therefore the compensatory mechanisms were developed by which cells respond to hypoxia. The master regulator of cellular responses is the hypoxia inducible transcription factor, HIF. In general HIF- 1 isoform supports glucose availability and glycolysis; also attenuates energy-consuming processes and thus reduces energy loss. HIF- 2 isoform stimulates antioxidant mechanisms {{to reduce the amount}} <b>of</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species which could cause cellular damage. At the same time, both of isoforms contribute to increasing the supply <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> by activating erythropoiesis and angiogenesis in the affected area. HIFs provide these changes either directly, by using their target genes, or by interactions with other transcription factors and signaling pathways...|$|R
25|$|Arterial {{embolism}} {{can lead}} to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> and nutrients (ischemia) of the downstream tissue. The tissue can become irreversibly damaged, {{a process known as}} necrosis. This can affect any organ; for instance, arterial embolism of the brain is one of the cause of stroke.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large amount of}} {{casualties}} was that when the walls began to fall down, the heavy roofs would collapse, leaving few air pockets in them. The dust and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> contributed to the suffocation of survivors. The Iranian government promised to prosecute anyone who violated building regulations, even setting up a special unit to deal with the issue.|$|E
25|$|Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and {{pathogen}} attack can induce ethylene {{formation in}} plants. In flooding, roots suffer from <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen,</b> or anoxia, {{which leads to}} the synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes nastic movements (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.|$|E
50|$|In the {{combustion}} reaction, oxygen reacts with the fuel, {{and the point}} where exactly all oxygen is consumed and all fuel burned {{is defined as the}} stoichiometric point. With more oxygen (overstoichiometric combustion), some of it stays unreacted. Likewise, if {{the combustion}} is incomplete due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient <b>oxygen,</b> fuel remains unreacted. (Unreacted fuel may also remain because of slow combustion or insufficient mixing <b>of</b> fuel and <b>oxygen</b> - this is not due to stoichiometry). Different hydrocarbon fuels have different contents of carbon, hydrogen and other elements, thus their stoichiometry varies.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a volume}} {{protected}} by hypoxic air, a normobaric hypoxic atmosphere is continuously retained: hypoxic {{means that the}} partial pressure <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> is lower than at the sea level, normobaric means that the barometric pressure {{is equal to the}} barometric pressure at the sea level. Usually 5%/10% <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> contained in the air is replaced by the same amount of nitrogen: as a consequence a hypoxic atmosphere containing around 15 Vol% <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> and 85 Vol% of nitrogen is created. In a normobaric hypoxic environment, common materials cannot ignite or burn. Thus, considering the fire triangle, a fire cannot occur because <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient <b>oxygen.</b> [...] "However, at 15% oxygen level, risk for fire still exists, and the system cannot be seen as an alternative to extinguishing systems.".|$|R
25|$|The nitrogen-rich {{compounds}} {{found in}} fertilizer runoff {{are the primary}} cause <b>of</b> serious <b>oxygen</b> depletion {{in many parts of}} oceans, especially in coastal zones, lakes and rivers. The resulting <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> greatly reduces the ability of these areas to sustain oceanic fauna. The number of oceanic dead zones near inhabited coastlines are increasing. As of 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States. If eutrophication can be reversed, it may take decades before the accumulated nitrates in groundwater can be broken down by natural processes.|$|R
