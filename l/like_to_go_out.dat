500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Since their rise to fame in 1971, Slade {{had failed}} to achieve a major {{breakthrough}} in the United States. During the period of 1972–73, the band began touring there as a step towards trying to crack the market, complete with attendant record company hype touting them the next Beatles. However, the band later revealed they felt that such hype did the band no favours. Although Slade had built up a reputation for their live performances, Slade were still far from the successes of the Beatles, which they well acknowledged. In 1975, lead vocalist Noddy Holder told Geoff Barton: [...] "So much hype, and the American public don't like that at all. They <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and see things for themselves on stage, and make their own minds up... we {{knew that it was}} impossible to live up to." ...|$|E

6000|$|Many {{years ago}} there lived an Emperor who was so fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on {{them in order to}} be beautifully dressed. He did not care about his soldiers, he did not care about the theatre; he only <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> walking <b>to</b> show off his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day; and just as they say of a king, 'He is in the council-chamber,' they always said here, 'The Emperor is in the wardrobe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said Miss Morley, [...] "you {{know your}} mamma never <b>likes</b> you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> before Church {{especially}} to the stables; you only get hot, and you make us late with waiting for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall go out to-morrow to try {{and catch}} some of {{the sons of the}} old man. They are the real culprits in the matter. If you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again, and can get off duty, well and good," [...] Captain Hodgson said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kind o' comfortable!" [...] echoed Ben, angrily. [...] "Well, I don't know {{anything}} about Chicago, but if you know of any fellers there that have got any better place than this, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> an' stay {{two or three months}} with 'em." ...|$|E

50|$|Designed by the Toronto-based Munge Leung {{interior}} design firm, Khabouth's and Harji's plan for Weslodge was attracting the Downtown Toronto urban crowd that doesn't {{spend much time}} in their condos, but rather <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> right after coming home from work. With its interior featuring imitations of taxidermy hunting trophies mounted on walls, {{in keeping with the}} Wild West and hunting themes, the restaurant's bartenders and servers wear gun holsters around their shoulders. Weslodge's kitchen is run by executive chef Stuart Cameron while its first chef du cuisine was Kanida Chey who joined from Claudio Aprile's Origin.|$|R

60|$|Down {{washed the}} rain, deep lowered the welkin; the clouds, ruddy a while ago, had now, through all their blackness, turned deadly pale, {{as if in}} terror. Notwithstanding my late boast about not fearing a shower, I hardly <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> under this waterspout. Then the gleams of {{lightning}} were very fierce, the thunder crashed very near; this storm had gathered immediately above Villette; {{it seemed to have}} burst at the zenith; it rushed down prone; the forked, slant bolts pierced athwart vertical torrents; red zigzags interlaced a descent blanched as white metal: and all broke from a sky heavily black in its swollen abundance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain, I'm {{ordered to}} the front to-night, {{to do a little}} reconnoitring," [...] said the major of the first battalion. [...] "I thought perhaps you would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with me.

6000|$|... "Not from Mrs. Stringham--no." [...] He failed again however {{to develop}} this--for which her {{forbearance}} from another question gave him occasion. From whom then had he heard? He might at last, confronted with her, {{really have been}} gaining time; and as if to show that she respected this impulse she made her enquiry different. [...] "Should you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to her--to Mrs. Stringham?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I {{do quite}} some lumbering during the season. I have a {{firm in the}} city that sends up there every year for all the stuff I cut. At this time of year. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> hunting. It's the one sport that I {{thoroughly}} enjoy. And I reckon you boys enjoy it, too, or you wouldn't be out with your guns." ...|$|E

On the weekends, Alt <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> alone or with a friend to ski cross-country or climb the peaks near Camp Hale; his field notes on three of these climbs were published in [...] "Appalachia," [...] {{the journal of the}} Appalachian Mountain Club, Summer/Fall 2014.

6000|$|Among Hilary's guests was Charles Bellingham, a {{bachelor}} of pronounced baldness, who said {{he would come to}} meet Hilary's belated Englishman, in quality of bear-leader to his cousin-in-law, old Bromfield Corey, a society veteran of that period when even the swell in Boston must be an intellectual man. He was not only old, but an invalid, and he seldom left town in summer, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner whenever he was asked. Bellingham came to the rescue of the national repute in his own fashion. [...] "I can't account for your not locking up your spoons, Hilary, when you invited me, unless you knew where you could steal some more." ...|$|R
50|$|Nicholson <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{onto the}} moors and breathe {{in the air}} {{to get away from the}} smoke of Bradford.

On the way he visited several 'places' and by the time he came to the {{stepping}} stones (known locally as the Hippings) across the River Aire at Saltaire, he was quite drunk. He slipped and fell into the water and was carried down the river for a short distance. He managed to haul himself out of the river, but he died on the riverbank. His body was taken to the Bay Horse Inn at Baildon and he was buried in Bingley All Saints Graveyard on the 18 April 1843.|$|R
6000|$|... "None of {{you take}} me seriously. You simply let me hang around. And you think I'm a grind. I'm not. I like to read, that's all.

I was happy out here by myself on the Mound, where every prospect pleases, and--'n' now here I am again, envying you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gosh," [...] Babbitt wailed to his wife, as {{they walked}} home from the Fogartys' bridge-party, [...] "it gets me how Rone and that fellow can be so poky. They sit there night after night, {{whenever}} he isn't working, and they don't know there's any fun in the world. All talk and discussion--Lord!

6000|$|... "No, sir. I {{have never}} known her ill, yet. She has been {{worrying}} herself a great deal. She has waited so long, {{because she did not}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> until she could take me with her. She has no friends in England with whom she could leave me. She looks a good deal better, now, than she did a month ago. I think, directly she settled to come out, and had something to do, she became better." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{escaping}} from the railroad police after stowing {{away on a}} train, the Stooges befriend a champion wrestler named Ivan Bustoff (Harrison Greene). His trainers, {{who are part of}} the mob, have a large bet placed on Bustoff to win the big match. But Bustoff <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> drinking, and after a wild night out with the boys ending in Bustoff downing a mixture made of [...] "a little bit of tequila, vodka and cognac", he passes out drunk. The mobsters hire/force the Stooges to become Bustoff's managers and get him to the ring sober. In the locker room at the arena, the boys are trying to wake Bustoff up, but end up knocking him out with dumb bells and causing the locker to fall on him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did at first, not at last," [...] said Lionel. [...] "Besides, <b>liking</b> a man <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{shooting}} with is not {{the same}} as <b>liking</b> him <b>to</b> marry one's sister." ...|$|R
