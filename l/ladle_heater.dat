40|$|The Advanced Technology Ladle Preheater {{program is}} a joint {{industry}} and gas utility funded project. The Cadre Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia is the prime systems contractor, Southern California Gas Company and The Gas Research Institute are research sponsors, and Cameron Iron Works is the industrial participant for testing and demonstration. The project was initiated in May, 1979, with prototype testing of a full scale 60 ton <b>ladle</b> <b>heater</b> beginning January, 1980. This paper discusses {{the history of the}} Advanced Technology Ladle Preheater and presents a case study of the thermal efficiencies and economics of conventional ladle preheating practices versus improved ladle preheating practices...|$|E

A low wettability for molten metals is required for these purposes since wetting by molten metals leads to adhesion of solidified metals, which causes several problems. Surface structure is known to affect wettability. Thus, the present study attempts to fabricate silicon nitrides with controlled surface structures. Silicon nitrides, whose surfaces were covered with ordered hemispherical protrusions, were fabricated by the slip-casting technique. The cast bodies were sintered, and subjected to wettability tests using molten metals. For comparison, silicon nitrides with as-sintered and polished surfaces were also prepared. The surface with protrusions exhibited a lower contact angle compared to the as-sintered and polished surfaces. The contact angle depended on {{the diameter of the}} hemisphere; it was the largest at a diameter of 0. 3 mm...|$|R
