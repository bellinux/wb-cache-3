40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for calculating the diffraction efficiency kinetics of the grating recorded by two parallel circular polarized recording beams was proposed, based on Jones-matrix and photochromic two-state theory. The diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating {{was measured by}} system of four-wave coupled light path. The theoreical analysis and the experimental results show that, in the condition of adding linearly polarized auxiliary violet light, when linearly polarized reconstruction light parallel with linearly polarized auxiliary violet <b>light,</b> the <b>diffraction</b> efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is maximum; when linearly polarized reconstruction light perpendicular to linearly polarized auxiliary violet <b>light,</b> the <b>diffraction</b> efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is minimum. The angle between linearly polarized reconstruction light and linearly polarized auxiliary violet light produces a cosine modulation on the kinetics of the diffraction efficiency. It indicates that parallel circular polarization recorded grating in bacteriorhodopsin induced by polarized violet light became polarizing grating. ©, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

Results are compared to the absorption enhancement expected from an ideal Lambertian (randomizing) scatterer, which is considered as a baseline. It is found that for cells which absorb very weakly, the diffraction grating provides absorption enhancement above that of the ideal Lambertian scatterer over a wide wavelength range. For cells which absorb more strongly, the grating underperforms the ideal Lambertian scatterer over almost all wavelengths. Finally, the grating period, well height and well radius are optimised.

It is typicallyused only in solving for intensity and modes within shaped (bent, tapered, terminated) waveguidestructures, as opposed to scattering problems. These structures typically consist of isotropic optical materials, but the BPM has also been extended to be applicable to simulate the propagation of light in general anisotropic materials such as liquid crystals.

50|$|Since light propagates as waves, the {{patterns}} it produces {{on the film}} {{are subject to the}} wave phenomenon known as diffraction, which limits the image resolution to features on the order of several times the wavelength of <b>light.</b> <b>Diffraction</b> is the main effect limiting the sharpness of optical images from lenses that are stopped down to small apertures (high f-numbers), while aberrations are the limiting effect at large apertures (low f-numbers). Since diffraction cannot be eliminated, the best possible lens for a given operating condition (aperture setting) is one that produces an image whose quality is limited only by diffraction. Such a lens is said to be diffraction limited.|$|E
