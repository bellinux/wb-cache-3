5|$|The {{western part}} of the Stadtbahn was {{electrified}} on 4 July 1993 up to Zoologischer Garten station. The eastern part of the <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Ostbahnhof had been electrified since 1987. As soon as electrification reached the Zoo station, ICE trains began to use the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} opening {{took place on}} 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII. When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the <b>line.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> 70 people worked on the line, in addition to station employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the tent with the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured clavicle.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he would}} later qualify for Ireland and {{represent}} them in international cricket, West began his professional cricketing career in New Zealand, the country of his birth.

Though he did not bat, West was <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> come in at number seven. He took 1wicket in the match for 38runs (1/38), that of Matthew Hart.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{eventually}} adopted was {{the least}} expensive (other than doing nothing) – to connect the tunnel to the tracks of the IND Queens Boulevard Line, {{at a cost of}} $222 million, and a timetable of at least eight years. It was estimated that the project would attract 16,500 passengers per hour. The MTA board approved this plan on December 14, 1984. The section of the <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Long Island City was projected to open by the end of 1985.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war in May 1945, NSB {{took control}} over the construction. They shifted focus towards {{bringing}} the existing <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> standards. The Dunderland Line was bought by the state and taken over by NSB on 1 July 1947. Class 87 diesel multiple units were introduced between Elsfjord and Mosjøen, later extended to Majavatn, until 1951. An express train started running directly from Trondheim in 1949 and the next year a night train service was introduced. Sleeping cars to Mo i Rana were introduced in 1956, and to Mosjøen in 1970.|$|E

Joffre told Sir John of his plans for twin offensives at Arras and Rheims in 1915, the former offensive to be assisted by the BEF, and then a further thrust towards the Rhine from Verdun and Nancy.
