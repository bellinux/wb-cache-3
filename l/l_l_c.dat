40|$|Abstract Background Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) {{are large}} multimodular enzymes that {{synthesize}} {{a wide range}} of biologically active natural peptide compounds, of which many are pharmacologically important. Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by the Condensation (C) domain. Various functional subtypes of the <b>C</b> domain exist: An <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain catalyzes a peptide bond between two L-amino acids, a D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain links an L-amino acid to a growing peptide ending with a D-amino acid, a Starter C domain (first denominated and classified as a separate subtype here) acylates the first amino acid with a β -hydroxy-carboxylic acid (typically a β -hydroxyl fatty acid), and Heterocyclization (Cyc) domains catalyze both peptide bond formation and subsequent cyclization of cysteine, serine or threonine residues. The homologous Epimerization (E) domain flips the chirality of the last amino acid in the growing peptide; Dual E/C domains catalyze both epimerization and condensation. Results In this paper, we report on the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship of NRPS C domain subtypes and analyze in detail the sequence motifs of recently discovered subtypes (Dual E/C, D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> and Starter domains) and their characteristic sequence differences, mutually and in comparison with <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domains. Based on their phylogeny and the comparison of their sequence motifs, <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> and Starter domains appear to be more closely related to each other than to other subtypes, though pronounced differences in some segments of the protein account for the unequal donor substrates (amino vs. β -hydroxy-carboxylic acid). Furthermore, on the basis of phylogeny and the comparison of sequence motifs, we conclude that Dual E/C and D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domains share a common ancestor. In the same way, the evolutionary origin of a C domain of unknown function in glycopeptide (GP) NRPSs can be determined to be an <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain. In the case of two GP C domains which are most similar to D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> but which have <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> activity, we postulate convergent evolution. Conclusion We systematize all C domain subtypes including the novel Starter C domain. With our results, it will be easier to decide the subtype of unknown C domains as we provide profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) for the sequence motifs {{as well as for the}} entire sequences. The determined specificity conferring positions will be helpful for the mutation of one subtype into another, e. g. turning D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> to <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L,</b> which can be a useful step for obtaining novel products. </p...|$|R

5000|$|For North America, in 1944 the {{zoologist}} Edward Goldman {{recognized as}} many as 23 subspecies in North America, based on morphology alone. In 1959, E.

5000|$|In 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in {{the case}} Star Athletica, <b>L.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>C.</b> v. Varsity Brands, Inc. to {{determine}} when a [...] "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature" [...] incorporated into a useful article is eligible for copyright protection, holding that such features are eligible for copyright protection [...] "only if the feature (1) can {{be perceived as a}} two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work—either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression—if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated." [...] Star Athletica began as a suit by Varsity Brands against Star Athletica for infringing the copyright of five cheerleader uniform designs. Applying its new test to the cheerleader uniform designs, the Court said: [...] "First, one can identify the decorations as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities. Second, if the arrangement of colors, shapes, stripes, and chevrons {{on the surface of the}} cheerleading uniforms were separated from the uniform and applied in another medium—for example, on a painter’s canvas—they would qualify as 'two-dimensional [...] [...] [...] works of [...] [...] [...] art'. And imaginatively removing the surface decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium would not replicate the uniform itself. Indeed, respondents have applied the designs in this case to other media of expression—different types of clothing—without replicating the uniform. The decorations are therefore separable from the uniforms and eligible for copyright protection." [...] This produces a relatively low threshold for pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features on useful articles to be eligible for copyright protection, which one commentator clearly highlighted: the Star Athletica decision [...] "really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection...once we determine that the designs 'have … graphic … qualities … could be applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met." ...|$|E
