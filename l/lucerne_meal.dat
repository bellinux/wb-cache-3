So, {{the aim of the}} study was to screen and compare the main effects of EO and EOC on short-term DMD and NDFD using the in vitro method. The addition of phenylpropanoid-rich cinnamon oil (CIN) and clove oil (CLO), terpenoid-rich thyme oil (THY) and oregano oil (ORG), and four EOC: cinnamaldehyde (CIN-C), eugenol (EUG), thymol (THY-C) and carvacrol (CAR) was studied at a dose of 0. 5 mg ? l? 1 of main active compound. Products were tested on four substrates: <b>lucerne</b> hay, soyabean <b>meal,</b> maize meal and a total mixed ration (TMR). Digestibility was determined at 4 and 24 h of fermentation. Both CIN and CIN-C increased NDFD 4 of <b>lucerne</b> and maize <b>meal,</b> and decreased NDFD 24 of soyabean meal; while CIN-C reduced NDF 24 of TMR and CIN reduced DMD of soyabean at both examined hours. CLO and EUG decreased the NDFD 24 of soyabean meal improving its DMD 24. Also initial DMD of lucerne was increased by both these factors. Only CLO reduced NDFD 24 of maize meal. Both THY and THY-C reduced DMD 4 of soyabean meal; however only THY-C improved NDF 4 of lucerne and reduced NDFD 24 of soyabean meal and TMR. DMD 24 of most substrates (except lucerne) was reduced by ORE, but not by CAR which improved NDFD 4 of lucerne.

More than 98 % of the total DCI fed to rats as diet 5001, purified pinitol or [2 H 6]DCI was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Rats chronically on diet 5001 consumed 921 mmol total DCI/kg body weight per d but excreted less than 5 · 3 % in the stools and urine, suggesting that the bulk was metabolised. The levels of pinitol or DCI in plasma, stools or urine remained relatively stable in mice fed Purina PicoLabw Rodent Diet 20 5053 over a 5 -week period, whereas these values declined to very low levels in mice fed a pinitol/DCI-deficient chemically defined diet.

40|$|Dairy heifers in {{industry}} at present are frequently falling {{short of the}} recommended liveweight targets. Rearing of dairy heifers is expensive and involves a two-year non-productive period after which, if she becomes pregnant, income can be received from milk production. Milk yield in first and second lactation is affected by a heifer’s live weight prior to calving and therefore meeting liveweight targets is critical for subsequent milk production. Those heifers that fail to become pregnant are of considerably lower value than those that become pregnant. To maximise the chance for heifers to become pregnant, heifers need to have completed a number of oestrus cycles prior to the planned start of mating. Mating of heifers during the third oestrus cycle compared with the first oestrus cycle after reaching puberty, provides an increased probability of the heifer becoming pregnant. This thesis contains two experiments. The aim of the first experiment was to measure the effects on average daily gain, wither height, girth and crown-to-rump length, of feeding 6 -month-old dairy heifers on alternative feeds, over the summer period when pasture quality and availability is limiting. Sixty 6 -month-old Friesian-Jersey crossbred heifers were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments (pasture (P), conserved forages (C) or Lucerne (L), with all treatments receiving supplementary meal). Heifers were weighed at 0, 3 and 6 weeks of treatment period, and wither height, girth and crown-to-rump length were measured at the start {{and end of the}} experiment. L heifers had a greater (P< 0. 05) average daily gain (1. 22 ± 0. 03 kg/day) than P heifers (0. 57 ± 0. 03 kg/day), and C heifers were intermediate (0. 78 ± 0. 03 kg/day). The aim of the second experiment was to determine the effect that live weight, percentage of individual liveweight target achieved and achieving individual liveweight target at 6, 9, 12 and 15 months of age had on 5 reproductive parameters: reaching puberty by 12 & 15 months of age; becoming pregnant during a 7 week mating period; becoming pregnant in the first 3 weeks of mating; and becoming pregnant in the first 6 weeks of mating. Heifer live weights were recorded approximately every month. Scanning of the heifers’ ovaries at 12 and 15 months of age was completed to determine whether each heifer had reached puberty by the respective age. Natural mating was completed over a seven-week period, and age of the fetus was estimated at pregnancy scanning was to determine in which cycle the heifer became pregnant. There was no effect on the pregnancy parameters measured as a result of live weight, reaching live weight target and the percentage of liveweight target achieved. Heifers that were heavier at 6, 9 and 12 months of age had an increased likelihood of reaching puberty by 12 months of age. Increased average daily gain was achieved from heifers grazing <b>Lucerne,</b> with supplementary <b>meal</b> also fed, although these increased average daily gains had limited benefit on reproductive performance of the heifers at first breeding...|$|R

If only the results determined after an incubation period of 28 days are considered, the toxicity of NM- 300 K and AgNO 3 are comparable in terms of potential ammonium oxidation activity and nitrate accumulation when applying an inorganic soluble nitrogen source, but no inhibition of nitrate accumulation was observed when <b>lucerne</b> <b>meal</b> {{was used as the}} additional nitrogen source. In experiment 1, the EC values for NM- 300 K and AgNO 3 for (i) nitrate formation using (NH 4) 2 SO 4 as nitrogen source and (ii) the potential ammonium oxidation activity differ by a factor of less than 3 (e.g., EC 50 potential ammonium oxidation for NM- 300 K and AgNO 3 = 1.6 and 2.9 mg/kg, respectively; EC 50 nitrate accumulation for NM- 300 K and AgNO 3 = 7.3 and 2.8 mg/kg, respectively). NM- 302 appeared to be slightly less toxic than NM- 300 K and AgNO 3 in terms of the effect on nitrate accumulation. The EC values differed at least by a factor of 6, but this was a screening approach carried out with three test concentrations and a spacing factor of 10, suggesting the EC values for NM- 302 are less reliable.

OECD TG 216 describes a laboratory test that is used to investigate the long-term effects of chemicals on the microbial nitrogen transformation resulting in nitrate accumulation after a single exposure. The measured nitrate concentration reflects the sum of several microbial activities, such as ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and formation of microbial biomass. Denitrification is expected to be of minor relevance due to the aerobic test conditions. Sieved soil is supplemented with powdered plant meal (e.g., <b>lucerne</b> <b>meal).</b> According to the OECD test guideline, for non-agrochemicals, the nitrate concentrations in treated and control samples are measured {{at the start of the}} test and after incubation for 28 days; for agrochemicals additional sampling points are requested. We applied this test to two silver nanomaterials and the soluble silver salt AgNO 3, and by considering only the start and end point, we found no evidence of toxicity towards soil-nitrifying bacteria. However, the same concentrations of test materials showed clear concentration-effect curves in the carbon transformation test (substrate-induced respiration) [3]. For strongly biocidal compounds, dose-related inhibition of substrate-induced respiration combined with a stimulated N-mineralization is typical [19]. In the following chapters, we discuss/consider the unusual sensitivity of both test systems (effects in C-transformation test; no effect in N-transformation test) when investigating Ag-NM and soluble AgNO 3.|$|E

Two groups of 128 weaned rabbits (37 d-old) were fed on diets containing 25 or 35 % DLM. At 64 d of age, the rabbits were randomly {{divided into four}} groups; two of them received the same diet whereas the others were fed on diets containing both 25 or 35 % DLM and 8 % linseed until slaughtering (87 d). The main effects of DLM (25 vs. 35 %) and LIN (0 vs. 8 %) were considered according to a 2 × 2 factorial statistical design. With regard {{to the effect of}} lucerne, the main result was the higher content of a-linolenic acid in meat from rabbits fed the higher level of DLM (6. 34 vs. 5. 82 % in DLM 35 and DLM 25, respectively; P< 0. 05) without impairing the lipid susceptibility to oxidation. The use of linseed strongly (P< 0. 01) influenced the fatty acid composition of the meat by enhancing the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 33. 68 vs. 27. 79 %; for LIN 8 and LIN 0, respectively) and mainly a-linolenic acid which was three times higher in LIN 8 rabbits (9. 42 vs. 2. 95 %; P< 0. 01), producing a lower n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio (2. 28 vs. 6. 59; P< 0. 01).

The best estimate of the NE 1 density of FOW was 2. 55 MJ/kg DM at 2. 7 ×M NE intake, a value only slightly lower than that of 2. 62 at 2. 7 ×M based upon a Van Soest et al. (1984) discount from equations of Van Es (1978), who suggested 3. 00 MJ/kg DM at 1. 1 ×M of NE intake. FOW is a low protein, high fibre and low NE 1 feedstuff that will be of limited value in rations of high producing lactating ewes...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrepancy}} in fatty acid (FA) status between a “natural” and a “civilized” environment, {{recognized as a}} major dietary phenomenon of clinical relevance in humans, was historically first described in the comparison of free-ranging and captive wild animals (CRAWFORD 1968). Compared to their free-ranging counterparts, captive specimens {{seemed to have a}} lower polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) status, and in particular a lower omega(n) 3 /n 6 PUFA ratio. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the available data on free-ranging and captive wild animals was missing so far. We collated data on the FA status of free-ranging and captive wild animals, comparing only data for the same body tissues and lipid fractions. In general, zoo-kept wild animals had a lower n 3 /n 6 PUFA status; in particular, birds and mammalian herbivore species for which data were available consistently showed lower proportions of n 3 PUFA and total PUFA in captivity. In zoo animals, this discrepancy has been repeatedly suspected to contribute to clinical problems, although conclusive studies are lacking. Should an adjustment of the FA status in captivity to the one in the wild be an objective in the dietary management of zoo animals, several strategies could be adopted: the feeding of horse or rabbit instead of ruminant meat; the use of food insects that are raised on green produce instead of grain products; the feeding of marine non-vertebrates such as shrimp or squid to animals specialized on these items but conventionally fed fish. In particular, a higher proportion of forage in general, the use of fresh or ensilaged forage instead of hay, a reduction of the use of grain-based concentrates, and an increased use of forage products (grass or <b>lucerne</b> <b>meal)</b> and linseed products in pelleted feeds, are measures that have been demonstrated in domestic herbivores to increase the n 3 /n 6 PUFA status...|$|E
40|$|Functional stability, {{measured}} in terms of resistance and resilience of respiration and growth rate of bacteria and fungi, was studied in soils that have been exposed to copper and low pH for more than twenty years. We used treatments, consisting of soil with no or high copper load (0 or 750 kg ha(- 1)) and low or neutral pH (4. 0 or 6. 1). Stability was examined by applying an additional stress in the form of lead or salt. After addition of lead, respiration (decomposition of freshly added <b>lucerne</b> <b>meal)</b> showed lower resistance at low than at neutral pH and at high copper than at low copper. The most acid and contaminated soil was the least resistant. Respiration showed no resilience after addition of lead. Bacterial growth rate (thymidine incorporation) also showed resistance at low pH but only in soils that were not contaminated with copper. After addition of salt, respiration showed no differences in resistance but the soils without copper contamination showed higher resilience. Bacterial growth rate showed lower resistance at low pH than at neutral pH, the latter in which the growth rate increased by on average 123 %. This increase at high pH was faster in soil without copper than in soil with copper contamination in which the growth rate initially decreased and then increased. The effects of secondary stress depended {{on the nature of the}} stress (lead or salt) and on the parameter measured (respiration or bacterial growth rate). In general the highest resistance and/or resilience were found in the least contaminated soils with neutral pH and/or no copper contamination. Thus, the microbial communities in the cleaner soils showed the highest functional stability. The results seem to confirm the notion that environmental stress alters ecosystems such that supplementary stress will have stronger impacts than in an unstressed system. The results may also confirm the insurance-hypothesis that reduced biodiversity due to the first stress negatively affected community stability. As an alternative, we discuss the observed effects in terms of altered energy budget...|$|E
30|$|Here we {{investigated}} whether {{the type of}} nitrogen source influences nitrite and nitrate accumulation caused by two silver nanomaterials differing in parameters such as size and shape, and by a soluble silver salt, over an incubation period of 28 days. We applied three different procedures addressing the nitrogen mineralization in the nitrogen cycle. Briefly, the nitrogen cycle consists of the following: (i) nitrogen mineralization with the individual steps ammonification (organic nitrogen → ammonium) and nitrification (ammonium → nitrite → nitrate), (ii) nitrogen immobilization and assimilation (nitrate → organic nitrogen; ammonium → organic nitrogen), (iii) denitrification (nitrite → N 2), and (iv) nitrogen fixation (N 2 → organic nitrogen) [17]. At {{the beginning of the}} test, we added the complex insoluble organic nitrogen source <b>lucerne</b> <b>meal</b> according to OECD test guideline (TG) 216 [2] (first approach), or the soluble inorganic nitrogen source (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (second approach), and periodically measured the nitrate content/nitrate accumulation during the 28 -day incubation period. The addition of the ammonium salt (second approach) was based on a former German test guideline for the investigation of pesticide side effects [18]. In a third approach, we incubated non-augmented soil and measured the transformation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 to nitrite in periodic subsamples [4]. This test has a short incubation period of 6 h and was applied 2 to 3 times during the 28 -day incubation period. The three procedures all cover a 28 -day exposure of the soil microflora to silver. The measured microbial activity, however, depends on the time point at which the nitrogen source is added. The test on nitrite accumulation provides information on the activity of the respective microorganisms at the time when samples are taken: the nitrogen source is added to a subsample, and microbial activity is determined. The test on nitrate accumulation monitors the microbial activity from test start up to the sampling day since the nitrogen source is added {{at the start of the}} 28 -day incubation period. The effects on nitrite and nitrate accumulation were compared with the results of the carbon transformation test (soil-induced respiration) [3], in which short-term aerobic respiration after the addition of an easily degradable soluble carbon source (glucose) is indicated by oxygen depletion. Short-term respiration was determined 2 to 3 times during the 28 -day incubation period. Analogous to the short-term test on nitrite accumulation, the short-term respiration test provides information on the microbial activity at the sampling time. The selected approaches allowed us to determine the suitability of the current procedure for the assessment for silver nanomaterials in the context of chemical regulation.|$|E
