40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp and fill yarn, amplitude of warp and fill yarn, width of warp and fill yarn, height of warp and fill yarn and the gap between two adjacent warp and fill yarns.

Handle is influenced by mechanical properties of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the surface roughness. The KES-F system is standard objectified method among different measurement methods. But the measurement of surface roughness applied the KES-F which is contact method disturbs an accurate measurement for analysis of tactile perception. Hence we measure the surface roughness of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> without deformation by a non-contact method applied the laser displacement sensor with a resolution of 1 µm and a accuracy of 0. 01 % and high precisely controlled linear motor for translated at constant speed. Since the <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are woven and knitted with various colored yarn and its surface treated with chemical treatment to make luster, we analyze the effect of color and luster {{in order to reduce the}} optical errors. And the results of surface roughness of various <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> compared with the surface characteristic values (MIU, MMD) measured by KES-F system.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new semi-supervised defect {{detection}} scheme for {{solving the problem}} of automated defect detection for <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In {{the development of the}} scheme, Gabor wavelet network (GWN) is deployed as the major technique to extract texture features from <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> An optimal Gabor filter is then designed {{on the basis of the}} features extracted. The proposed defect detection scheme consists of one real-valued optimal Gabor filter and one smoothing filter. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by using an offline test database with 78 homogeneous fabric images. The test results exhibit accurate defect detection with low false alarm, thus showing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is further evaluated by conducting real time tests using a prototyped automated defect detection system. The experimental results obtained clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme is indeed an effective and efficient means for detecting defects in <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Keywords—Defect detection, filtering, Gabor function, Gabor wavelet networks, <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R

In particular interest from the transport industry {{is associated with the}} concept of twinning the <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> with the high performance plywood. Therefore deriving the weight efficient panel structure with enhanced vibration, thermal and electromagnetic damping properties are the prerequisites to enter new market sector. <b>Textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are in particularly effective when impact energy absorption of the structures are required. Moreover combination of plywood and textiles made out of natural fibres contributes to eco friendly manufacturing philosophy of the European car industry.

40|$|AbstractMaterials {{nowadays}} become {{smarter and}} “more intelligent”, containing novel functionalities or sensory components. In {{all areas of}} materials science, integrating new abilities into common materials belongs to the most important topics in research and development. In the textile area, several functions {{can be achieved by}} finishing techniques, i. e. physical and/or chemical modifications of textile surfaces. The integration of electronic components, however, still suffers from incompatibilities between soft, flexible, bendable <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and rigid electronic parts. Connecting conductive yarns with electronic components, such as SMD-LEDs etc., cannot be performed by soldering nor by sewing. The typical connection technologies of both areas fail in these cases. A new possibility to achieve such electrical {{and at the same time}} mechanical connections is given by 3 D printing. In a recent project, we have studied chances and limitations of electric circuits combining <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> with 3 D printing. <b>Textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were woven and knitted from common yarns as well as wires, strands and different conductive yarns. 3 D printing was used to connect SMD elements and other small electronic parts with these base circuits and compared with soldered and sewn contacts.

The article will give an overview of possibilities and problems in electrical contacting of small electronic components on partly conductive <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> by conductive 3 D printed connections.
