40|$|This paper aims to {{quantify}} the driving forces behind the observed divergence of Indian economy. The results show that in a closed economy with agriculture as the predominant mode of production, the comparative advantage is mainly determined by the difference in land quality and climate across regions within a country. However, when the economy opens its door {{to the rest of}} the world, a region’s comparative advantage is evaluated in a broader global context. Therefore, regions adjacent to more developed economies, or with better infrastructure such as ports and airports, enjoy a far better location advantage for trade and development than <b>landlocked</b> <b>regions.</b> More investment in physical infrastructure such as roads will bring the interior regions closer to the world markets and reduce regional disparity. Among all the factors considered, education is the only equalizing factor to regional development...|$|R

It has land borders with China, Myanmar, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The region can be categorised into the Eastern Himalaya and the Brahmaputra and the Barak valley plains. Northeast India has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons, and mild winters. The region is covered by the mighty Brahmaputra-Barak river systems and their tributaries. Geographically, apart from the Brahmaputra, Barak and Imphal valleys and some flat lands in between the hills of Meghalaya and Tripura, the remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) above MSL. The region's high rainfall, averaging around 10,000 millimetres (390 in) and above, creates problems of ecosystem, high seismic activity, and floods.

5000|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{the areas}} of Guangxi {{dominated}} by the Zhuang people greatly aided the Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War. Soon after the Communist victory in 1949, in 1952 the People's Republic of China created a Zhuang autonomous prefecture in the western half of Guangxi. However, some scholars of the Zhuang {{do not believe that}} this decision came out of genuine grassroots demands from that ethnic group, who made up only 33% of the province's population, which is contradictory to reality of facts from Chinese scholars that the Zhuang people clearly maintain their distinct culture and lifestyle (i.e. language, religion, etc.). Scholars like George Moseley and Diana Lary instead argue that the conversion of Guangxi to a Zhuang autonomous region was designed to foil local sentiment against the Communist Party as well as to smash pan-Lingnan sentiment. [...] Shortly afterward, many Cantonese in the Guangxi government were replaced by Zhuangs and Guangxi annexed the Nanlu region of Guangdong in 1952, giving the formerly <b>landlocked</b> <b>region</b> access to the sea.

Although the community is not free from problems, it does have many services that are uncommon in the region, primarily due to its distance from the district capital. Its Centros de Saúde (health centres), along with private initiatives, have made it one of the more dynamic municipalities in the country, providing local service without unnecessary trips to distant hospitals. The local Bombeiros Voluntários (volunteer fire brigade) has been active in this role, responsible for both protection from civil and forest fires and transporting the sick and injured. The Lar da Terceira Idade da Santa Casa da Misericórdia, the Santuário de Cerejais (Mariano) and other smaller institutions in the parishes provide local assistance to seniors, in addition to home-care. The largest schools, both primary and secondary level, are located within the city of Alfândega da Fé. While the establishment of a municipal library and Casa da Cultura have assisted education within these communities, the area has also experienced a decrease in local enrollment, resulting in the closure of several smaller schools.

40|$|We {{study the}} impacts of changes in {{international}} trade and domestic transport costs on the internal geography of countries {{in the presence of}} geographical asymmetries. To do so, we develop a two-country four-region model in which one country has a region that exhibits a ‘geographical advantage’ in terms of better access to the other country’s markets. Our analysis reveals that, in equilibrium, the space-economies of the trading partners are interdependent and that agglomeration in one country reduces the occurrence of agglomeration in the other, thus showing that physical geography suffices to build strong connections between the two space-economies. We also show that remoteness need not be a geographical disadvantage since a <b>landlocked</b> <b>region</b> may well be the location that attracts the larger share of firms. This is so when internal transport costs are high and, therefore, act as a barrier to competition from abroad...|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{transportation}} of heavy wooden barrels of wine over land was a costly and risky proposition. Wine regions close to easily navigable rivers, {{such as the}} Loire and Garonne, found the possibility of trade to other regions and outside France more attainable and profitable while more isolated and <b>landlocked</b> <b>regions</b> like Burgundy had a harder time developing much of a trade market outside their region. Port cities like Bordeaux, La Rochelle and Rouen emerged as formidable centers of commerce with the wines of Gascony, Haut Pays, Poitou and the Île-de-France. During this period, political climates and alliances played a substantial role in the trade of French wines to other European countries. The 1152 marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with Henry Plantagenet, the future Henry II of England, {{was the beginning of}} a long and fruitful relationship between Bordeaux and England. The 1295 Auld Alliance between France and Scotland against England gave the Scots ample access to French wines for themselves.

50|$|Gyeongsang cuisine {{is based}} on Gyeongsang province, {{consisting}} of the North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang provinces. The region has a similar climate to that of Jeolla province because both geographically border two seas—Gyeongsang province borders the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east, and the East China Sea to the south. However, the types of harvested fish and seafood are different from each other, and fish are regarded as the best foodstuff in Gyeongsang cuisine. Seafood is variously cooked in the cuisine, and especially hoe, raw sliced seafood, is considered the best delicacy. Soups made with fresh fish are common in Gyeongsang province, unlike other mountainous and <b>landlocked</b> <b>regions.</b> Myeolchi jeot (fermented salted anchovies) is the most commonly prepared jeotgal (fermented salted seafood); the number of jeotgal types placed {{on the table for}} a meal is the next after Jeolla province. The style of Gyeongsang cuisine is simple with less decoration, while various seasonings are heavily used, so the taste is even more salty and hot and spicy than Jeolla's. Fields in the province produce diverse grain crops and noodles are the most enjoyed dish among the foods made with grains. The locals prefer noodles with a soft texture made by mixing raw soybean powder, cut by a kitchen knife.Andong, a city that was once the center of Korea's Confucianist traditions, has a wide variety of local delicacies.

40|$|The {{opening up}} of the prairies for wheat {{cultivation}} had a major impact upon this <b>landlocked</b> <b>region</b> by trans-forming it from a frontier dependent upon the fur trade {{into a series of}} very well defined cultural landscapes where agriculture became the norm. But in addition, this agricultural revolution has also had a significant impact upon cultural landscapes outside the region, reflecting the location of the Prairie provinces within the country. This is particularly noticeable where termi-nal elevators were constructed in order to ensure the efficient overseas export of grain. This paper details the belated (when compared to the Lakehead) rise of grain terminals on Canada’s Pacific Coast, from its begin-nings up to the early 1930 s, when the landscape was essentially complete. It discusses the changing patterns of ownership of the structures, and explains the changes in the “balance of terminal power ” during the early development of this region. It concludes with a brief update on west-coast terminals in later years...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{contrasts}} {{the response}} to the Wenchuan earthquake (May 2008) which took place in a <b>landlocked</b> <b>region</b> of China with that of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which as an island nation, was theoretically easily accessible to external aid provision via air or sea. In the initial period following the Wenchuan earthquake, the response was wholly internal as a detailed needs assessment was carried out. Once the Chinese authorities had established the scale of response required, international assistance was quickly allowed into the country. Several multimodal solutions were devised to minimize the risk of supply breakdown. Haiti required substantial external aid and logistics support, but severe organizational and infrastructural weaknesses rendered the supply chain extremely vulnerable locally. This translated to a mismatch between the volume of aid supplied and logistics capability, highlighting the importance of “last-mile” distribution management. The two earthquakes posed extreme challenges to the logistics operations, though both required a mix of military and non-military input into the logistics response. Nonetheless, in each case the non-standard logistics solutions which were devised broadly met the requirements for effective aid distribution in extreme environments...|$|E
40|$|Having natural {{resources}} in abundance including {{oil and gas}} reserves, apart from being a strong market for millions of consumers, Central Asia as a region not only connects Asian and European continents but also provides the shortest transit route to Europe from Asia. What is striking is that its importance lies into {{the centrality of the}} region’s geographical location and therefore, geographic factors have had a tremendous influence on the whole region so much so that Central Asia has now become a region of geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic significance in the sphere of international relations. Looking back into antiquity, one can find that the Central Asian territory was the main route for the Great Silk Road linking Europe with Asia, in particular China and India. Now that the twenty-first century has been witnessing a reorganisation of the Great Silk Road, Central Asia occupies a special place in India’s foreign policy priorities. Unlike the past, its importance to India today remains not just merely civilisa-tional, but geopolitical and economic as well. However, so far India {{has not been able to}} achieve the desired objectives in Central Asia due to disadvantages at several fronts, which calls for revamping Indian strategies in this <b>landlocked</b> <b>region.</b> It is in this context that the book under review provides a relevant perspective on components that shape Indian perceptions and strategies towards its relations with Central Asia...|$|E

40|$|Areas {{with limited}} {{transport}} accessibility {{are considered to}} mean territories lacking year-round roads and routes, such as railroads, motor roads, sea routes, and inland waterways. Siberia, as Russia's largest macroregion, has within its boundaries huge territories difficult of access, where only seasonal waterways and winter motor roads, and also expensive air transport are available. The socioeconomic state of the Siberian areas with limited transport accessibility is under a negative influence of two transport-economic barriers simultaneously. The presence of the former barrier is characteristic {{for the whole of}} Siberia, including the zone serviced by railroads and all-the-year-round motor roads. The operation of this barrier is associated with the landlocked macrolocation of Siberia, and with the huge and expensive distances which have to be traveled when transporting cargo and passengers to the leading centers and sea ports of Russia and the world at large (and, accordingly, vice versa). The chief point is that there is still a significant difference between land transport tariffs, on the one hand, and economical sea transportation rates, on the other. Therefore, in <b>landlocked</b> <b>regions,</b> and in Siberia in particular, the high transport expenses continue to have an unfavorable influence on economic efficiency and remain a severe obstacle to the entry into the remote markets. The second barrier arises directly because of lack of year-round communications, and its operation is characteristic precisely for areas with limited transport accessibility doomed to drag out a backward socioeconomic existence or bear sky-rocketed transport expenses. Compared with the belt along the railroads, the transport expenses in areas without railroads increase several times, which was established through our estimation of cost for the transport-geographical location (TGL) of Siberia's administrative districts. Districts with a particularly disadvantageous TGL are represented by the most backward and peripheral territories of the Sakha Republic, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Irkutsk Oblast, Tyva Republic, and some other Siberian subjects of the Russian Federation which are distinguished for an exceptionally sparse network of human settlements, a total lack of good roads, and for extensive kinds of economy. The broad-scale construction of new railroads and all-the-year-round motor roads, as planned by the "Transport strategy of the Russian federation into the year 2030 ", would radically change the situation for the better. According to our assessment, the implementation of the aforementioned "Strategy" would lead to a reduction in transport expenses and to an improvement in TGL of about 100 areas of Siberia, which would create favorable possibilities for their full-fledged socioeconomic development...|$|R
