Törngren soon fell into financial difficulties before the premises were taken into use. Already {{in the following year}} the new owner became Tampere Linen and Iron Industry, which still had to invest a substantial sum of money on buildings, dock and machinery, before the yard finally became operative. The new owner had planned to sell the yard after commissioning, but it had difficulties to reach a satisfying <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> and a prominent new owner. Finally, in 1880 the company was sold to engineer Oskar Eklund. Eklund enlarged the premises, but suffered continuously of lack of funding. In 1895 Helsingfors Skeppsdocka was declared to bankruptcy by the main creditor, Union Bank of Finland.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} farming premium wine grapes can generate profit on a 10 acre site in Napa County, and if farming wine grapes can be a profitable long term investment. The report utilizes two techniques for analysis of the data. The break-even analysis {{will be used to}} determine whether the operation is potentially profitable. Vineyard establishment costs were outlined in and production costs (from year 3 forward) defined. Production costs and grape revenues are weighed to determine net revenues above total costs. Monthly per acre break down of costs demonstrates how vineyard production costs fluctuate during dormancy, the growing season and harvest in the fall. A ranging analysis of grape revenue weighted against costs at varying prices and yields provides possible <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability.</b> Depreciation for all equipment purchased for the operation is used to calculate capital recovery. To determine the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the operation based on various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> yield and price, marginal cost and marginal revenue criterion was used to find various break even points and to observe points where revenue exceeds cost. The vineyard operation was profitable over the long term on an annual basis. The establishment costs have been spread over twenty years in the analysis to make the operation feasible. After the third year the vines reach full production and annual cost was exceeded by annual grape revenues...|$|R
