The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of fighting power, had little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5|$|Typically, Othnielosaurus {{has been}} {{interpreted}} like other hypsilophodonts as a small, swift herbivore, although Bakker (1986) interpreted the possibly related Nanosaurus as an omnivore.

5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore <b>little</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological and toponymic {{evidence}} of Wormshill's existence predates its {{appearance in the}} Domesday survey of 1086. The village contains a number of heritage-listed buildings, which include a Norman church, a public house {{and one of the}} oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom. The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past 500years, and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average. The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns.|$|E

5|$|Beshear did <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} arena {{for almost a}} decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H. Ford, and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair Bob Kerrey – to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell. Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E

Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty (907–1125) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty (1115–1234).|$|E

Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters.

5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since {{he did not want to}} lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|Its {{coterie of}} {{personnel}} by now being {{referred to as}} the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), CFS commenced its first course on 17August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of World WarI. Its students included Captain Thomas White and Lieutenant Richard Williams, with Harrison providing initial training to solo standard and Petre advanced instruction. In September, Harrison was given command of a flying unit that accompanied the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to Rabaul in German New Guinea. With <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of enemy resistance, however, the aircraft were never assembled in country and he had to return without leading the first Australian airmen into combat, a distinction that instead went to Petre as commander of the Mesopotamian Half Flight the following year.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had very}} <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of heavy weapons, {{as they had}} {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns {{due to lack of}} ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered {{despite the fact that they}} had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E

5|$|The National Library of Somalia was {{established}} in 1975, and came under {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The National Library later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library. With Zainab Hassan serving as Director, the $1 million federal government funded initiative will see a new library complex built in the capital within six months. In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other Arab League states are expected to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and newel posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> renovation.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E

And, all the rest of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world read the books, and thought themselves each as good as the President; and perhaps they were right, for every one knows his own business best. But Tom thought he would sooner have a jolly good fairy tale, about Jack the Giant-killer or Beauty and the Beast, which taught him something that he didn't know already.|$|R
