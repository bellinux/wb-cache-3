40|$|INTRODUCTION The magnicon [1, 2] is a {{scanning}} [...] beam {{microwave amplifier}} that is under consideration {{as an alternative}} to klystrons in powering future high [...] gradient <b>linear</b> <b>electron</b> <b>accelerators.</b> Scanning [...] beam amplifiers modulate the insertion point of the electron beam into the output cavity in synchronism with the phase of a rotating rf wave. This synchronism creates the potential for an extremely efficient interaction in the output cavity, since every electron will in principle experience identical decelerating rf fields. In the magnicon, the output interaction is gyrotron [...] like, and requires a beam with substantial transverse momentum. The transverse momentum is produced by spinning up the electron beam in a sequence of TM 110 deflection cavities, the first driven by an external rf source. The output cavity employs an rf mode that rotates in synchronism with the deflection cavity modes. As a result, the beam entering the output cavity is fully phase modu...|$|R
