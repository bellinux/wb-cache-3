5000|$|There {{was only}} one hard-disk format. The format program {{required}} a hard disk with the right number of heads, platters, and cylinders. There were numerous makes and models of 10, 20, and 32 MB hard disks that met that requirement. The program formatted the hard disk 8 megabytes at a time (CP/M's limit for a <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive)</b> until it had successfully finished four partitions and quit, or suddenly ran out of hard disk. Thus a 10 MB hard disk had an 8 MB partition and a 2 MB partition; a 20 MB hard disk had two 8 MB partitions and one 4 MB partition; and a 32 MB hard disk had four 8 MB partitions. (The [...] "IV by 2" [...] mentioned above had four partitions, 8 MB, 2 MB, 8 MB, and 2 MB.) ...|$|E
50|$|The 88/HD was a {{subsystem}} with an 18 MB SASI hard drive, {{housed in}} an 8810 chassis. Software called Volume Manager partitioned the available space into several <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> {{similar to the}} FDISK partitioning command used by other operating systems.|$|R
50|$|When IBM first {{released}} the magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> in the 1956 IBM 305, a single <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> would be directly attached to each system, managed {{as a single}} entity. As the development of drives continued, {{it became apparent that}} reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved, so that more than one physical disk is used to produce a single <b>logical</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{operating}} system may define volumes or <b>logical</b> <b>disks</b> and assign each to one physical disk, {{more than one}} physical disk {{or part of the}} storage area of a physical disk. For example, Windows NT can create several partitions on a hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> each of which a separate volume with its own file system. Each floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> optical disc drive or USB flash drive in Windows NT becomes one volume. Windows NT can also create partitions that span multiple hard <b>disks</b> <b>drives.</b> Each volume is identified with a drive letter.|$|R
50|$|A <b>logical</b> <b>disk,</b> <b>logical</b> volume or {{virtual disk}} (VD or vdisk for short) {{is a virtual}} device that {{provides}} an area of usable storage capacity on one or more physical <b>disk</b> <b>drive(s)</b> in a computer system. The disk is described as logical or virtual {{because it does not}} actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right. The goal of the <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> is to provide computer software with what seems a contiguous storage area, sparing them the burden of dealing with the intricacies of storing files on multiple physical units. Most modern operating systems provide some form of logical volume management.|$|R
5000|$|Concatenation or {{spanning}} of drives {{is not one}} of the numbered RAID levels, but it is {{a popular}} method for combining multiple physical <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> into a single <b>logical</b> <b>disk.</b> It provides no data redundancy. Drives are merely concatenated together, end to beginning, so they appear to be a single large disk. It may be referred to as SPAN or BIG (meaning just the words [...] "span" [...] or [...] "big", not as acronyms).|$|R
50|$|Virtual <b>disks</b> {{and virtual}} <b>drives</b> are common {{components}} of virtual machines in hardware virtualization, {{but they are}} also widely used for various purposes unrelated to virtualization, such as for the creation of <b>logical</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another common {{feature of}} address spaces are {{mappings}} and translations, often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. For example, file system on a <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> operates linear sector numbers, which {{have to be}} translated to absolute LBA sector addresses, in simple cases, via addition of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> connected via Parallel ATA, each of them must be converted to logical (means fake) cylinder-head-sector address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the disk controller and then, finally, to physical cylinder, head and sector numbers.|$|R

5000|$|Many modern {{business}} information technology environments use a SAN. Here, many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network. A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server, and some capacity to another. Therefore, <b>logical</b> <b>disks</b> are used to partition the available capacity and provide the amount of storage needed by each host from a common pool of <b>logical</b> <b>disks.</b> The IBM SAN Volume Controller uses the term [...] "vdisk" [...] to refer to these <b>logical</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A LUN may be {{used with}} any device which {{supports}} read/write operations, such as a tape drive, but is most often {{used to refer to}} a <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> as created on a SAN. Though not technically correct, the term [...] "LUN" [...] is often also used to refer to the <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> itself.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to building noncentralized ("serverless") distributed file systems, using the shared <b>logical</b> <b>disk,</b> which provides the abstraction of a fault-tolerant, entry-consistent, shared array of persistent data blocks. By separating the storage management level from higher-level file system functions like metadata management, we significantly reduce the overall complexity of the file system's implementation. We describe the implementation of a file system and an underlying shared <b>logical</b> <b>disk,</b> designed to run on workstation networks and on the SHRIMP multicomputer. The file system level is very similar to a conventional uniprocessor file system, relying on the underlying shared <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> to handle all communication, caching, and coherence operations. The shared <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> provides some simple hooks to allow the file system to express its faulttolerance requirements.

40|$|Atomic {{recovery}} units (ARUs) are {{a mechanism}} that allows several <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> operations {{to be executed}} as a single atomic unit with respect to failures. For example, ARUs can be used during file creation to update several pieces of file meta-data atomically. ARUs simplify file systems, as they isolate issues of atomicity within the <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> system. ARUs are designed {{as part of the}} <b>Logical</b> <b>Disk</b> (LD), which provides an interface to disk storage that separates file and disk management by using logical block numbers and block lists. This paper discusses the semantics of concurrent ARUs, as well as the concurrency control they require. A prototype implementation in a log-structured <b>logical</b> <b>disk</b> system is presented and evaluated. The performance evaluation shows that the run-time overhead to support concurrent ARUs is negligible for Read and Write operations, and small but pronounced for file creation (4. 0 % [...] 7. 2 %) and deletion (17. 9 % [...] 20. 5 %), which mainly manipulate meta-data.

40|$|Abstract * This paper {{describes}} {{a simple but}} effective method to generate and observe the effects of external vibration on the read and write bandwidth of a <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> Furthermore, it quantifies these effects as a first-order numerical approximation. This paper {{is not intended to}} rate <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> relative to manufacturer, model, size, form factor, …etc. Rather it is simply intended to answer the simple questions of “Is there a performance impact of external vibration on a <b>disk</b> <b>drive?</b> ” and “How significant is that impact?” After testing several 3. 5 - and 2. 5 -inch consumer-grade and enterprise-class <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> the conclusion is that the consumer-grade <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> are more sensitive to external vibration. In the presence of an external vibration caused by adjacent <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> seek operations the bandwidth performance of a consumer-grade <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> “feeling” these vibrations will decrease about 10 %- 15 % when reading data and about 25 %- 40 % when writing data.
