40|$|Coexisting arsenic (As) and {{fluoride}} (F) in groundwater poses severe {{health risks}} worldwide. Highly efficient simultaneous removal of As and F is therefore of great urgency and high priority. The {{purpose of this}} study was to fabricate a novel. composite adsorbent and explore the mechanism for concurrent removal of As(V) and F at the molecular level. This bifunctional adsorbent with titanium and <b>lanthanum</b> <b>oxides</b> impregnated on granular activated carbon (TLAC) exhibits a pronounced As(V) and F adsorption capacity over commercially available iron- and aluminum-based adsorbents for synthetic and real contaminated groundwater samples. Synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence analysis demonstrates, that and Ti were homogeneously distributed on TLAC. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic results suggest that As(V) formed bidentate binuclear surface complex as evidenced by an averaged Ti-As bond distance of 3. 34 angstrom in the presence of F. Adsorption tests and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicate that F was selectively adsorbed on <b>lanthanum</b> <b>oxides.</b> The surface configurations constrained with the spectroscopic results were formulated in the charge distribution multisite complexation model to describe the competitive adsorption behaviors of As(V) and F. The results of this study indicate that TLAC could be used as an effective adsorbent for simultaneous removal of As(V) and F...|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} project work essentially {{deals with the}} synthesis of highly bright fluorescent nanoparticles which {{have the ability to}} emit wavelength shorter than that of the pumped wavelength. The synthesis was carried out using thermal decomposition method to dope lanthanide ions into the host lattice using <b>lanthanum</b> <b>oxides</b> as precursors. The Upconversion NPs formed were either capped by oleylamine or oleic acid, yielding their dispersibility in organic solvents and preventing them from agglomeration. We developed UCNPs having varied colours which can prove useful for barcoding and imaging purposes. Further, we functionalised our NPs with silica using reverse micro-emulsion technique. These bifunctional nanocomposites increase the stability of upconversion materials and prevent the escape of rare earth ions from the lattice.

40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining {{nanosized}} LaCoO 3 crystals from calcination of a precursor powder synthesized by a hydrothermal route is reported.

It is determined that LaCoO 3 phase is produced by a reaction of cobalt and <b>lanthanum</b> <b>oxides,</b> the latter produced by a two-step dehydration process of La(OH) 3. Finally, it was found that nearly stoichiometric LaCoO 3 nanocrystals can be obtained at temperatures as low as 850 °C.
