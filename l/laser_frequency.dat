5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the <b>laser</b> <b>frequency.</b> The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

The first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by Brillet & Hall (1979), in which they analyzed a <b>laser</b> <b>frequency</b> stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical Fabry–Pérot cavity. They set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the Earth's motions of Δc/c≈10−15, where Δc is the difference between the speed of light in the x- and y-directions.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} dissipation on the energy balance in the electron dynamics of metal clusters excited by strong electro-magnetic pulses. The dynamics is described theoretically by Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory (TDDFT) {{at the level of}} Local Density Approximation (LDA) augmented by a self interaction correction term and a quantum collision term in Relaxation-Time Approximation (RTA). We evaluate the separate contributions to the total excitation energy, namely energy exported by electron emission, potential energy due to changing charge state, intrinsic kinetic and potential energy, and collective flow energy. The balance of these energies is studied as function of the <b>laser</b> parameters (<b>frequency,</b> intensity, pulse length) and as function of system size and charge. We also look at collisions with a highly charged ion and here at the dependence on the impact parameter (close versus distant collisions). Dissipation turns out to be small where direct electron emission prevails namely for <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies</b> above any ionization threshold and for slow electron extraction in distant collisions. Dissipation is large for fast collisions and at low <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies,</b> particularly at resonances. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the principles}} of collision induced radiative processes, followed by an examination of the effects of <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies</b> on these processes. A one-dimensional problem involving two electron states is considered, and it is found that the Hamiltonian of the radiation field is dominated by electric-dipole interaction which couples states of different parity. Transitions are noted to be dependent on collisions, and the complexities of three-dimensional systems are expressed as considerations of the angular momentum of the photon, the necessity of treating different states simultaneously, and the fact that a radiation field destroys rotational invariance. Changing the radiation frequency alters the crossing point and offers opportunities to study the interplay of potential surfaces with molecular dynamics. Experiments on Na+A systems are outlined for several collision energies and various <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Multiple crossings were obtained, although the total cross-section, at all energies, decreased at 18, 350 /cm...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of electromagnetically {{modified}} absorption to achieve selective excitation in atoms: that is, the laser excitation of one transition while avoiding simultaneously exciting another transition whose frequency {{is the same as}} or close to that of the first. The selectivity which can be achieved in the presence of coherent population trapping (CPT) is limited by the decoherence rate of the dark state. We present exact analytical expressions for this effect, and also physical models and approximate expressions which give useful insights into the phenomena. When the <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies</b> are near-resonant with the single-photon atomic transitions, CPT is essential for achieving discrimination. When the <b>laser</b> <b>frequencies</b> are far detuned, the "bright" two-photon Raman resonance is important for achieving selective excitation, while the "dark" resonance (CPT) need not be.
