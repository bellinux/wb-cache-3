50|$|A pentamirror is {{an optical}} device {{used in the}} {{viewfinder}} systems of various single-lens reflex cameras instead of the pentaprism. It is used to reverse again the <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> <b>image</b> coming from the reflex mirror.|$|E
50|$|While the 35 mm SLR camera {{had already}} {{appeared}} before the war, its major disadvantage was the waist-level finder which gave a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> <b>image,</b> taking away the immediacy between the photographer and his subject. In the Contax reflex, {{to be called the}} Contax S, a pentaprism was positioned directly above the focusing screen, which offered an eye-level, unreversed view of the viewfinder. This major technical advantage was critical in establishing the 35 mm SLR as the definitive camera type for the decades that followed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} this prism is the roof {{pentaprism}} which {{is commonly used}} in the viewfinder of single-lens reflex cameras. The camera lens renders an image that is both vertically and laterally reversed, and the reflex mirror re-inverts it leaving an image laterally reversed. In this case, the image needs to be reflected left-to-right as the prism transmits the image formed on the camera's focusing screen. This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a [...] "roof" [...] section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90°, which laterally reverses the image back to normal. Reflex cameras with waist-level finders (viewed from above), including many medium format cameras, display a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> <b>image</b> directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the camera obscura that provides {{an image of a}} scene dates back to ancient China. Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscura that are formed by dark caves {{on the edge of a}} sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed,</b> upside down <b>image</b> on a piece of paper. So the birth of photography was primarily concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>image</b> {{search is}} a {{content-based}} image retrieval (CBIR) query technique that involves providing the CBIR {{system with a}} sample image that it will then base its search upon; in terms of information retrieval, the sample image is what formulates a search query. In particular, <b>reverse</b> <b>image</b> search {{is characterized by a}} lack of search terms. This effectively removes the need for a user to guess at keywords or terms {{that may or may not}} return a correct result. <b>Reverse</b> <b>image</b> search also allows users to discover content that is related to a specific sample image, [...] popularity of an image, and discover manipulated versions and derivative works.|$|R

40|$|<b>Laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> (mirrored) {{fingerprints}} {{are difficult}} to detect by applying routine search procedures. One suggestion to avoid errors when dealing with probable reversals is to perform comparisons with both direct and reversed fingerprints.

In one of the reported cases, experts found on the web the same fingerprints used by criminals in fake documents. This finding is important because it indicates that matched fingerprints do not necessarily link different criminal cases...|$|R

[...] Many printmaking techniques produce images where the printed copy is <b>reversed</b> from the <b>image</b> made on the printing plate, so in a print copying another image, or a real scene or object, unless the artist deliberately creates the plate as a mirror-image of his subject, the finished print will be {{a mirror image of}} it. Many print makers developed the skill of <b>reversing</b> <b>images</b> when making printing plates, but many prints, especially early ones, have <b>images</b> that are <b>reversed.</b>|$|R
