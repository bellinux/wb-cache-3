5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> and a pocket of homes {{at the start of the}} concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district on Main Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E
5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. He never saw action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle feed mill, Bormann became estate manager of a <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless, foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Ro√übach in 1922, acting as section leader and treasurer.|$|E
50|$|Dated October 7, 1936 Steinbeck's third article {{explores the}} system of oppression that <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> have {{developed}} so as to maintain their complete control over the lives of migrant workers. Steinbeck first draws a juxtaposition between the <b>large</b> <b>farms,</b> responsible for the oppression, and the smaller farms that often treat the migrants more properly. The author points out that small farms are often forced {{to side with the}} <b>larger</b> <b>farms</b> on issues of labor because of the former's debt with the banks, which are controlled by the farm association. To ignore the demands of the <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> might cause farmers to have their smaller farms foreclosed upon.|$|R
40|$|In Poland, present {{policies}} {{are aimed at}} promoting <b>large,</b> mechanized <b>farms</b> over smaller family farms. These {{policies are}} based on the perception that <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> offer real economies of scale. But international evidence indicates that such <b>large,</b> mechanized <b>farms</b> are generally less efficient and use less labor than small family farms. The authors analyzed the relationship between farm size and efficiency in Polish agriculture. They used two different methods to do so. First they determined differences in total factor productivity between small and <b>large</b> <b>farms.</b> They then used Data Envelope Analysis to estimate scale efficiencies. The results show that, for the sample of <b>farms</b> analyzed: 1) <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> are not more efficient than smaller farms; and 2) smaller farms are more labor-intensive than <b>larger</b> <b>farms.</b> These results have important policy implications for farm restructuring in Poland and other transition economies facing similar issues and conditions.

5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
5|$|State Route958 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with a two-lane U.S. Route6 {{east of the}} city of Corry. The route progresses northward as a two-lane roadway through the rural regions of western Pennsylvania. Route958 soon enters the community of Wrightsville, a small community of a few residences and mostly fields. At Deadmans Run Road, the highway begins to cross through a populated area, however, it soon leaves Wrightsville and turns to the northwest in the deep fields north of the community. The northwestern bend curves back to the northward progression and Route958 passes through a <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> near an intersection with Kidder Road. Some residences parallel the highway as it makes another northwestern bend and soon comes on a northward stretch into the community of Lottsville, where the highway intersects with Route957.|$|E
5|$|The college {{began looking}} for a new home at the same time Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a {{university}} to the city, having failed to convince Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to locate Cornell University there rather than in Ithaca. Syracuse resident White pressed that the new university should locate on the hill in Syracuse (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages, and thereafter considered Syracuse a Sodom and Gomorrah insisting the university be in Ithaca on his <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> on East Hill, overlooking the town and Cayuga Lake.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of the agricultural sector in Mozambique, focusing on the role of commercial farms. Using agricultural survey data from 2002 to 2012, we analyse the spatial distribution of <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> and identify factors influencing their location decisions. We find that the spatial dispersion of <b>large</b> <b>farms</b> across the country is not uniform. <b>Large</b> <b>farms</b> tend to be located in wealthier and more educated areas, with better road access and higher levels of population density. Given an increasing volume of investments in the agricultural sector in Mozambique, a better understanding of these spatial trends can shed light on the processes through which <b>large</b> commercial <b>farming</b> entities may influence smallholder agricultural production and rural welfare...|$|R

5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> {{to the north of}} Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of <b>large</b> <b>farm</b> machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 yards away, a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E
