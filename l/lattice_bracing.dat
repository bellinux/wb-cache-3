5000|$|In 1873, local {{officials}} arranged with the Wrought Iron Bridge Company of Canton, Ohio {{for the construction}} of a bowstring arch bridge over the Scioto River. The completed bridge features <b>lattice</b> <b>bracing</b> over the deck, which enabled the design to have both vertical and horizontal support at a low cost. [...] Its structure combines elements of iron and steel.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} the second one to span the river at Goondiwindi. It was erected in 1914-1915 and {{replaced}} a timber structure which served the border river crossing from 1878. The bridge was built {{at the expense of}} both colonies, at a cost of £12,325/5/-, but on the responsibility of Queensland. It consists of two 120ft. spans of hogbacked steel-lattice girders, braced overhead with steel <b>lattice</b> <b>bracing.</b> The roadway has a width of 20ft. in the clear, and is carried above the highest known flood level.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} advanced, prefabricated skeletal iron or {{steel structures}} {{tended to be}} used for lighthouses constructed in the 20th century. These often have a narrow cylindrical core surrounded by an open <b>lattice</b> work <b>bracing,</b> such as Finns Point Range Light.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Master´s thesis is to create and examine {{two versions of the}} project for a bearing steel structure of a multi-purpose sports building) in Polička. The multi-purpose sports hall has dimensions 33 x 48 metres with a terraced floory part that has dimensions 18 x 24 metres. The hall is made of cross-links from lattice truss placed on fixed columns. The structure ridgidity is by wind braces. The storey part is made coupled steel-conrete slabs attached to the columns. The ridgidity of the storey part is provided by <b>lattice</b> <b>braces</b> in traverse and longitudinal direction. The thesis in its detail focuses on individual parts of the construction and is carried out in compliance with the Eurocode...|$|R
5000|$|Jim Redgate is an Australian {{classical}} guitar luthier, {{who owns}} Redgate Guitars. As of 2012, he makes four models, the lattice-braced, the double-top, {{and the new}} wave double-top and traditional fan braced. His customers include Pepe Romero, Ana Vidovic, Ralph Towner, Slava Grigoryan, Leonard Grigoryan, Bertrand Thomas, Jeff Young, Gareth Koch, Odair Assad, Wolfgang Muthspeil, Karen Schaupp, Emmanuel Rossfelder, Hucky Eichelman, and Phillipe Mariotti. One author said of him, [...] "Like fellow Australian Greg Smallman, Redgate builds his (<b>lattice</b> <b>braced)</b> guitars with an arched back to improve their volume and projection, and he uses lightweight carbon fiber reinforcements under the soundboard. While not as thin as a Smallman's, Redgate's soundboards are much lighter than traditionally braced examples, and his guitars are therefore more responsive, energy efficient, and louder than traditional classical instruments.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor´s thesis "two-bay {{industrial}} hall" {{is processed}} {{in the form}} of project documentation according to applicable regulations. It is a steel hall. It is designed as a single-storey, two-bay with a gable roof. The hall is located in Brno. Main structure consists of planar cross coupling, which is stored on restraint articulated columns. The construction is designed 9 cross ties and spacing of individual bonds is 6. 0 m in the extreme lateral links are hinged mounted columns with stored axial length 6. 0 m, which are secured <b>lattice</b> <b>bracing</b> longitudinal forces from the effects of wind. All columns are stored on concrete footings. In the longitudinal direction of the object is reinforced by transverse glue press in the plane of the roof and walls. Lateral bracing is located in the outer fields of the structure. Purlins and side runner are statically designed as simple beams, stored in the longitudinal direction of the transverse links and columns...|$|E
40|$|Steel frames with {{reinforced}} concrete infill walls (SRCW) {{are an interesting}} seismic-resistant structural solution. However, an effective seismic design of SRCWs is not easy due to the current lack of specific capacity design rules that allow controlling {{the formation of a}} proper energy dissipating mechanism. In order to overcome such an issue, a ductile design procedure is presented in this paper. The proposed procedure leads to innovative SRCW systems where energy dissipation is expected to take place only in the vertical elements of the steel frame, which are subjected mainly to axial forces. The non-ductile components, i. e. {{reinforced concrete}} wall and steel-to-concrete connections, are expected to suffer negligible damage. Accordingly, the system is designed to control the formation of diagonal struts in the infill walls and behaves as a <b>lattice</b> <b>brace</b> instead of a shear wall. Experimental test results and nonlinear finite element analyses are illustrated to support the developed ductile design approach and highlight the advantages of SRCWs...|$|R
50|$|Bridge over North Fork of Roanoke River was a {{historic}} Pratt truss bridge located near Ironto, Montgomery County, Virginia. It {{was built by}} the King Bridge Company in 1892, and was a pin-connected through Pratt truss spanning 105 feet from poured concrete abutments. It had ornamental steel <b>lattice</b> portal <b>bracing</b> {{around the top of}} the portals. The bridge was removed in 1995-1996, and replaced with new bridge.|$|R
50|$|The overall span {{measures}} 115 ft, {{carrying a}} 15.58 ft wide roadway. In cluding the approach spans, the bridge has a total length of 191 ft. The bridge rests on stone piers and abutments, with timber pile piers and abutments supporting the timber stringer approach spans. The bridge deck is timber, laid {{perpendicular to the}} span. The bridge features decorative cresting and <b>lattice</b> lateral <b>bracing.</b> The truss uses rigid horizontal and vertical members and rod bracing for the diagonals.|$|R
40|$|In my diploma thesis the {{proposal}} is developed as supporting steel structure sports hall with dimensions 45 x 54 m, a maximum height of 15. 5 meters,for the area of Znojmo. In a static calculation are designed and assessed the main bearing structural components such as solid panel purlins, spatial <b>lattice</b> truss, <b>bracing</b> and solid panel columns, which together with the truss form create a crosslinks, column bases and anchoring, plus Tribune. The work includes the design documentation consisting of a layout drawing, drawing anchoring and drawing selected details...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Telford {{worked as}} the County Surveyor of Shropshire between 1787 to 1834, and {{the bridge is}} {{reported}} to have once held a cast iron plate above the centre of the arch inscribed with [...] "Thomas Telford Esqr - Engineer - 1818", which is apparently visible in historic photographs, but has not been in place since at least 1985. The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone abutments with ashlar dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, string courses, and moulded cornices. The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four arched <b>lattice</b> ribs, <b>braced</b> by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{remains of}} the Abbey except for the Gatehouse and Tower, which by the {{architecture}} and arms sculptured upon the building, show it is of much more modern date than {{the foundation of the}} house. This tower is not square, but oblong, having an exploratory turret on each corner. The north side is ornamented with a niche, canopied, capable of receiving a statue five feet high: most probably it contained the effigies of the dedicatory Virgin. Beneath is a figure of an angel in relief, with expanded wings. Over this entrance are shields of arms, a cross, supposed to be the arms of the Vesci family, and a cross Moline. On the south side, in a niche, is the figure of one of the Religious, of the order of White Friars of Premonstratenses, in his proper habilament, in fairly good preservation. This front is ornamented with shields of arms, the arms of Brabant adopted by the Percys, with the arms of Lucys quarterly, the principal; and also the arms of Vesci.A gate opens to the east, on each side of which are the figures of cherubs supporting armorial shields: on this front is also a canopy and niche for a statue. Here are the arms of Brabant and the arms of the Lucys on separate shields. At this entrance, as also on the north side, were machicolations; and {{in the center of the}} arching of the gateway is a square aperture, from which the possessors could annoy assailants. The masonry of this tower is excellent; the gates of <b>lattice</b> <b>braced</b> with iron still remain.Above the gate going into the court of the house is an escutcheon of white marble, much injured by the weather, but retaining some marks of the sculptor, to distinguish that it once contained the crest of the Doubledays, an arm in armour suspending a mullet. The antiquity of this piece has been much doubted, but the materials determine that point clearly.|$|R
40|$|The major system {{providing}} {{lateral load}} resistance in steel <b>lattice</b> towers is <b>bracing</b> system. There are {{different types of}} bracing systems for steel lattice towers. The heights of these towers vary from 20 to 500 meters, based on the practical requirements. This study has focused on identifying the economical bracing system for a given range of tower heights. Towers of height 40 m and 50 m have been analyzed with different types of bracing systems under wind loads. The diagonal wind {{has been found to}} be the maximum for towers. The optimal bracing system has been identified and reported...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the building is {{a variation of the}} tube-in-tube scheme, in which the core (or inner 'tube') is built in concrete, and the perimeter structure (or outer 'tube') is built in steel. This perimeter structure is split in two rings: an interior vertical {{structure of}} very slender H pillars (10x10cm in the upper half of the tower, 14x14 cm in the lower half, under the 13th floor hosting the technical floor), placed every 135 cm; and an exterior <b>bracing</b> <b>lattice</b> supporting the torsion and flexing stresses of the tower produced by wind or earthquakes.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{instability}} takes {{different forms}} in various ordered and disordered systems. We study {{the effect of}} thermal fluctuations in two disordered central-force lattice models near mechanical instability: randomly diluted triangular <b>lattice</b> and randomly <b>braced</b> square <b>lattice.</b> These two lattices exhibit different scalings {{for the emergence of}} rigidity at T= 0 due to their different patterns of self stress at the transition. Using analytic theory we show that thermal fluctuations stabilize both lattices. In particular, the triangular lattice displays a critical regime in which the shear modulus scales as G ∼ T^ 1 / 2, whereas the square lattice shows G ∼ T^ 2 / 3. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{body of the}} {{instrument}} is {{a major determinant of}} the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce, red cedar, redwood or mahogany. This thin (often 2 or 3 mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar. The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. Different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers (Torres, Hauser, Ramírez, Fleta, and C.F. Martin being among the most influential designers of their times); to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also to affect the resonation of the top. Some contemporary guitar makers have introduced new construction concepts such as [...] "double-top" [...] consisting of two extra-thin wooden plates separated by Nomex, or carbon-fiber reinforced <b>lattice</b> - pattern <b>bracing.</b> The back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany, Indian rosewood and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra). Each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength, and such choice can also {{play a significant role in}} determining {{the instrument}}'s timbre. These are also strengthened with internal bracing, and decorated with inlays and purfling.|$|R
