5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, Xanthippe has {{a vision}} and collapses. Her husband soon awakes and, {{having had a}} dream, asks some wise men for an interpretation. They declare that the dream reveals the {{struggle}} between Satan and Christ and advise that the husband be baptized. When they <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his wife Xanthippe, expecting her to be near death, they discover her singing praises to Jesus. This impresses the wise men {{to the extent that}} they have Xanthippe take them to Paul. All of this induces her husband to likewise convert.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Malone {{arrives at}} an anti-Fourth of July protest rally and {{publicly}} renounces his former views. This triggers an outraged mob {{from which he}} is rescued, however, by American servicemen. Meeting up with Malone, Ahmed and Fayed defuse their own bomb, thus sparing {{the people at the}} anti-Independence Day rally and resulting in the capture of the terrorist Aziz. Safe inside a country music concert, the three are formally welcomed to [...] "the real America" [...] by Trace Adkins (this time as himself). A reformed Malone then goes to a Navy base to see his nephew Josh off to the Persian Gulf. He tells Josh how very proud he is of him and promises to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his wife and family during his deployment. In the final scene, Malone now decides to make films he feels people would appreciate, as well as Fayed and Ahmed as part of the crew, who have been pardoned for foiling the bombing. Malone is last seen working on a biographical film about President Kennedy.|$|E

60|$|So {{they run}} {{there with a}} lantern and crowded up and <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> me.|$|R
60|$|It was a grand spectacle, when Mr. Dusautoy <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Mrs. Kendal and her staff, {{armed with}} their yard-wands.|$|R
60|$|Passing it over, let us <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{that happy}} home when toned {{down to a}} {{condition}} of reasonable felicity.|$|E

60|$|And in {{had come}} Kennedy. The attractions of Kay's were small, and he usually <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Jimmy Silver <b>in</b> the afternoons.|$|R
60|$|I made my arrangements, unwillingly enough, {{for leaving}} London {{early the next}} day. Towards evening Pesca <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> <b>on</b> {{his way to a}} dinner-party, to bid me good-bye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you worry, honey!" [...] {{advised the}} well-meaning girl {{who would have}} been <b>in</b> her element <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Job with Bildad the Shuhite and his friends. [...] "Don't you worry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do. Come, Nelly, {{hold your}} tongue--it {{will be a}} treat for her to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> us. Hareton, get {{forwards}} with the lass. You shall walk with me, Nelly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on," [...] he invited. [...] "The machine's outside. We'll {{just go and}} <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the Professor {{and tell}} him the news. Poor old chap, I'm afraid he'll {{never be the same}} man again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, I'll {{make you}} a present o' one, then," [...] {{returned}} North, thrusting a Bible into the other's hand; [...] "you can't refuse it of an old comrade. Good-night. I'll <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> you soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Bradley, seating {{himself in}} his {{constrained}} manner. 'This is but a flying visit. I have <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> <b>on</b> my way, to ask a kindness of you as a neighbour.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The rector <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{her to give}} a final [...] "Good-bye; God bless you; {{we shall}} see you again before long," [...] and then {{returned}} to Mrs. Davilow, saying half cheerfully, half solemnly-- ...|$|R
60|$|Coming south, he had <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Mike's {{people for}} a brief space, and, {{at the request of}} Mike's mother, took the early express to Wrykyn in order to pay a visit of inspection.|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, yes,” he acknowledged. “I {{remember}} the ‘Forge.’ Filled with pretty sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions. By the way, Mr. Van Weyden, you’d better <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Cooky. He’s complaining and restless.” ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} of the following day Willie set off to the City in quest of Mr Thomas Tippet. Having to pass the King Street fire station, he resolved to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} you," [...] responded the ranger, [...] "and I've been hoping you'd <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> me. The Supervisor's {{daughter}} has just written {{me to look}} after you. She said you were not very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{the doctor}} who wrote to us about your injury before we came here, {{and he told us}} you were strong enough for a little quiet conversation. We haven't {{appointed}} another director yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{have to keep}} a good {{look-out}} {{ahead for}} land, about half-past three. It's fairly clear, though. You have <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the captain as you came along--eh? He knows the time? Well, then, I am off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no chance, I suppose, of your <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{the loft}} about two. Some {{of our young}} people are going to amuse {{themselves}} with a new sacque- dance--best white flour only," [...] said the Black Rat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Water," [...] {{repeated}} the doctor; [...] "as {{much as he}} likes to take, of course. Let me see: to-day is Tuesday. I'll <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Friday, or Saturday at latest; but till then he must have nothing but clear cold water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it is Miss Sophia!" [...] exclaimed Judith. [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon, ma'am, I {{thought it was}} Dame Spurrell, who said she would come and <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> me, or I would not have troubled you to come up." ...|$|E
6000|$|There seemed {{nothing more}} to say, and Maxwell {{did not attempt to}} make conversation. Hilary offered him his hand, and he said, as if to relieve the parting of abruptness, [...] "If you care to <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> me again, later on, perhaps--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I thought I {{heard you}} say {{something}} about tea this afternoon, Scott,' said Venables. 'I just <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the chance. Good Heavens, man! Fancy muffins {{at this time of}} year! Do you happen to know what the thermometer is in the shade?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{not going}} to prove much of a difficulty, {{particularly}} as it's one Mrs. Hunter has provided for. As it happens, Hall <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> us last night, and I gathered that he hadn't a very high opinion of your cookery and catering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So be it,' said he crisply. 'Get to bed, Lawford; it's better so. And I'll <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> my {{way back}} from Witchett. I came, my dear fellow, in gloomy {{disturbance}} of mind. It was getting up too early; it fogs old brains. Good-bye, good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly {{not safe}} {{that you should}} come {{backwards}} and forwards," [...] said Ermine. [...] "Rose must not be put in danger; so, dear, dear Ailie, you had better take your things up, and only <b>look</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> us now {{and then at the}} window." ...|$|E

60|$|Some days later--it {{may have}} been the next week; the exact date appears to have got mislaid--Marigold, M.P., <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the Professor. They talked about Tariff Reform, and then Marigold got up and made sure for himself that the door was tight closed.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, {{talking of}} that picture, I <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> {{him about a}} couple of afternoons later, and he'd taken it down from the wall and laid it on the floor and was staring at it in a dashed marked sort of manner. That was peculiar, what?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{his views}} on this subject {{were not to be}} shared with me for many a long day. Our half-hour was over; and there stood Mrs Monnerie, mushroom-shaped, it is true, but {{suggesting}} nothing of the evanescent, as she <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> us from the mahogany doorway.|$|R
