40|$|The {{biological}} materials nacre and wood are renowned for their impressive combination of toughness and strength. The key mechanisms of these highly complex structures are crack deflection at weak interfaces, crack bridging, functional gradients and reinforcing elements. These principles {{were applied to}} a more fracture-tolerant model material which combined porous stiff ceramic layers, manufactured by freeze casting, infiltrated and bonded by a polymer phase reinforced with fabric layers. In the hybrid composites, crack deflection occurred at the ceramic–fabric interface and the intact fabric layers served as crack-bridging elements. Fabric-reinforced epoxy layers stabilized the fracture behaviour and delayed catastrophic failure of the material. The influence of the different components was analysed by varying the ceramic, fabric and interface properties. More ductile fabrics lead to larger strain to failure and more crack bridging but reduced the composite strength and stiffness after initial cracking. Higher elastic mismatch between the components improved crack deflection and bridging but resulted in deterred load transfer and a lower strength. The stiffness and strength of the ceramic layers influenced the elastic properties of the <b>laminar</b> <b>composite</b> and the initial crack resistance.

40|$|Considered in {{this study}} are the axis-symmetric {{problems}} of fracture of composite materials with interacting cracks, which are subjected to residual (initial) stresses parallel to the cracks planes. An analytical approach in the framework of three-dimensional linearised mechanics of solids is used. Two geometrical schemes of cracks placement are studied: a circular crack is located parallel to the surface of a semi-infinite composite with residual stresses and two parallel penny-shaped cracks are contained in an infinite composite material with residual stresses. The cracks assumed to be under a normal or a radial shear load. Analysis involves reducing the problems to the systems of Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, where the solutions are identified with harmonic potential functions. The representations of the stress intensity factors near the cracks edges are obtained. These stress intensity factors are influenced by the residual stresses. The presence of the free boundary and the interaction between cracks has significant effects on the stress intensity factors as well. The parameters of fracture for two types of composites (a <b>laminar</b> <b>composite</b> made of aluminum/boron/silicate glass with epoxymaleinic resin and a carbon/plastic composite with stochastic reinforcement by short ellipsoidal carbon fibers) are analyzed numerically.

40|$|A {{series of}} woven fabric <b>laminar</b> <b>composite</b> plates and narrow strips were {{fabricated}} {{from a variety}} of pitch-based pristine and bromine intercalated graphite fibers in an attempt to determine the influence of the weave on the electrical and thermal conduction. It was found generally that these materials can be treated as if they are homogeneous plates. The rule of mixtures describes the resistivity of the composite fairly well if it is realized that only the component of the fibers normal to the equipotential surface will conduct current. When the composite is narrow with respect to the fiber weave, however, there is a marked angular dependence of the resistance which was well modeled by assuming that the current follows only along the fibers (and not across them in a transverse direction), and that the contact resistance among the fibers in the composite is negligible. The thermal conductivity of composites made from less conductive fibers more closely followed the rule of mixtures than that of the high conductivity fibers, though this is thought to be an artifact of the measurement technique. Electrical and thermal anisotropy could be induced in a particular region of the structure by weaving together high and low conductivity fibers in different directions, though this must be done throughout all of the layers of the structure as interlaminar conduction precludes having only the top layer carry the anisotropy. The anisotropy in the thermal conductivity is considerably less than either that predicted by the rule of mixtures or the electrical resistivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the procedure of embedding fiber optic sensors in laminar thermoplastic composite material, {{as well as}} damage investigation after ballistic loading. Thermoplastic-reinforced composite materials were made for increased material damage resistance during ballistic loading. Damage inside the composite material was detected by observing the intensity drop of the light signal transmitted through the optical fibers. Experimental testing {{was carried out in}} order to observe and analyze the response of the material under various load conditions. Different types of Kevlar reinforced composite materials (thermoplastic, thermo reactive and thermoplastic with ceramic plate as the impact face) were made. Material damage resistance during ballistic loading was investigated and compared. Specimens were tested under multiple load conditions. The opto-electronic part of the measurement system consists of two light-emitting diodes as light sources for the optical fibers, and two photo detectors for the light intensity measurement. The output signal was acquired from photo detectors by means of a data acquisition board and personal computer. The measurements showed an intensity drop of the transmitted light signal {{as a result of the}} applied loading on composite structure for all the optical fibers. All the diagrams show similar behavior of the light signal intensity. In fact, all of them may be divided into three zones: the zone of penetration of the first composite layer, the bullet traveling zone through the composite material till its final stop, and the material relaxation zone. The attenuation of the light signal intensity during impact is caused by the influence of the applied dynamic stress on the embedded optical fibers. The applied stress caused micro bending of the optical fiber, changes in the shape of the cross-section and the unequal changes of the indices of refraction of the core and cladding due to the stress-optic effect. The main goal of the experiment was to develop a system for thermoplastic composite structure health monitoring during real life exploitation. The results of the experiments confirmed that optical fibers could be applied as intensity sensors in the real-time monitoring of structural changes in thermoplastic <b>laminar</b> <b>composite</b> materials under ballistic loading.

One of the possible reasons is the complexity in representing and understanding scientific content. Introducing tactile elements such as textures into existing Braille characters can potentially increase the information content of Braille and could likely simplify the complex notations. However, such a task requires a thorough understanding of the discrimination of textures through touch. The current dissertation focuses on: 1) Investigating the psychophysical factors involved in texture discrimination and, 2) Developing a testing system to assess friction induced skin damage from repetitive motion over textured surfaces. The tactile discrimination sensitivity for six fine textured non-patterned surfaces (fine-grit abrasive papers) was evaluated using a two-alternative forced choice technique. The surface roughness parameters and the coefficient of friction of the abrasive papers interacting with human skin were measured. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to observe the surface microstructure. The results suggest that differences in the mean spacing and the friction coefficients could be indicative of differentiability of fine textured samples. Three clearly differentiable textures identified from this study were used to investigate the effect of texture area on tactile discrimination sensitivity. A perception measurement experiment in combination with a friction measurement experiment was performed to understand the possible role of friction in touch-based texture discrimination. There was decrease in the discrimination ability with the decrease in the texture area. An elastomeric skin simulant with layered structure similar to that of human skin was constructed to replicate skin friction blisters. The relationship between applied normal load and number of cycles of reciprocating motion required for blistering was studied.
