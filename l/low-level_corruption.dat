There are allegations that some police officers in Dili have accepted bribes or sex in exchange for allowing brothels with suspected trafficking victims to continue operations. There has been no official confirmation of these allegations of <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> from the government, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).|$|E
50|$|Corruption in Georgia {{had been}} {{an issue in the}} post-Soviet decades. Before the 2003 Rose Revolution, {{according}} to Foreign Policy, Georgia was among the most corrupt nations in all Eurasia. The level of corruption abated dramatically, however, after the revolution. In 2010, Transparency International (TI) said that Georgia was “the best corruption-buster in the world.” <b>Low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> has been virtually eliminated in recent years. On the 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index, Georgia ranked in 44th place.|$|E

Since 2004, Georgia had made tremendous progress in the clamp down on corruption and reinstatement of good governance. The total dissolution of the corrupt traffic police in 2004 {{and the establishment of}} the Anti-Corruption Interagency Council in 2008 were successful examples of the reform. <b>Low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> has been virtually eliminated in recent years. Both the OECD and the World Bank praised Georgia's unique success in combating corruption.|$|E
25|$|Prostitution {{is often}} {{directly}} linked to <b>low-level</b> government <b>corruption.</b> Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating {{a significant source of}} tax revenue. On occasion, police have been implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities. Government corruption is also involved in a more indirect form — the widespread abuse of public funds to finance consumption of sex services. Pan Suiming contends that China has a specific type of prostitution that entails a bargain between those who use their power and authority in government to obtain sex and those who use sex to obtain privileges.|$|R
50|$|Aside from militant groups, {{government}} officials {{at all levels}} {{are involved in the}} illicit drug trade in Central Asia. The collapse of economies post-Soviet Union leads many low-paid government authorities to corruption. They are often given bribes {{to look the other way}} as smugglers transport drugs through the border. Fear of retaliating violence from drug lords also factors in the <b>corruption</b> of <b>low-level</b> officials. <b>Corruption</b> in the region, however, has evolved from passive low-level bribing to the direct involvement of state institutions and senior {{government officials}}. In 2001, the secretary of Tajikistan’s Security Council admitted that many of its government’s representatives are involved in the drug trade. Also pointing to high-level government corruption in the drug trade, Turkmenistan’s president, Saparmurat Niyazov, publicly declared that smoking opium was healthy. Central Asian state governments tend to have low drug confiscation levels, as officials only use the arrests to provide an appearance of fighting drugs and to ensure a state monopoly on the trade. For instance, although trafficking has increased since 2001, the number of opiate seizures in Uzbekistan fell from 3,617 kg in 2001 to 1,298 kg in 2008, while heroin confiscations remain constant.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{information}} flow tracking (also known as taint tracking) is an appealing approach to combat various security attacks. However, {{the performance of}} applications can severely degrade without hardware support for tracking taints. This paper observes that {{information flow}} tracking can be efficiently emulated using deferred exception tracking in microprocessors supporting speculative execution. Based on this observation, we propose SHIFT, a low-overhead, software-based dynamic information flow tracking system to detect {{a wide range of}} attacks. The key idea is to treat tainted state (describing untrusted data) as speculative state (describing deferred exceptions). SHIFT leverages existing architectural support for speculative execution to track tainted state in registers and needs to instrument only load and store instructions to track tainted state in memory using a bitmap, which results in significant performance advantages. Moreover, by decoupling mechanisms for taint tracking from security policies, SHIFT can detect a wide range of exploits, including high-level semantic attacks. We have implemented SHIFT using the Itanium processor, which has support for deferred exceptions, and by modifying GCC to instrument loads and stores. A security assessment shows that SHIFT can detect both <b>low-level</b> memory <b>corruption</b> exploits as well as high-level semantic attacks with no false positives. Performance measurements show that SHIFT incurs about 1 % overhead for server applications. The performance slowdown for SPEC-INT 2000 is 2. 81 X and 2. 27 X for tracking at byte-level and wordlevel respectively. Minor architectural improvements to the Itanium processor (adding three simple instructions) can reduce the performance slowdown down to 2. 32 X and 1. 8 X for byte-level and word-level tracking, respectively. ...|$|R

50|$|McKay {{began writing}} {{on both the}} visual arts and the {{environment}} in the 1980s, and throughout the 1990s was {{a regular contributor to}} journals and magazines that included: Apollo; Art Monthly; Arts Review; Artscribe; Computer Weekly; Contemporary Art (for which he was Assistant editor); Creative Camera; The Face; Geographical Magazine; The Independent on Sunday; and Private Eye. He has also been an occasional contributor of film reviews to Sight & Sound magazine, Special Correspondent (Vienna) for Photoicon magazine, and is listed as correspondent for both the photography magazine f22, and State magazine. In the mid-1990s, McKay published a series of undercover reports that exposed the complex political dealings of the British Green Party's Arts Policy Working Group at that time. He also spoke regularly on a pro-censorship platform at conferences in the UK, appearing alongside figures such as the media lawyer and freedom-of-expression advocate Mark Stephens and the journalist and writer Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. During the later-1990s-2000s, he worked mainly on a series of book projects relating to the dance culture and urban youth topics, as well as becoming the founder Editor of The Journal of Geography and Urban Research, In 2005, he returned to writing on the arts and culture industries for numerous magazines and as Editor at Large (Eastern Europe) for the British arts newspaper State of Art however, and in 2007 published a controversial series of articles that sought to expose <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> and spin within the UK's independent artist-curator networks. For his research into this topic he was {{invited to participate in the}} Agendas V symposium in Venice, at the time of the 52nd Venice Biennale.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} a novel method of audio-visual fusion, known as multi- modal optimal feature fusion (MOFF), for person identification where both the speech and facial modalities may be corrupted, {{and there is}} a lack of prior knowl- edge about the corruption. Furthermore, it is assumed there is a limited amount of training data for each modality (e. g., a short training speech segment and a single training facial image for each person). A new multimodal feature rep- resentation and a modified cosine similarity are introduced for combining and comparing bimodal features with limited training data, as well as vastly differing data rates and feature sizes. Similarity-based optimal feature selection and multi- condition training are used to reduce the mismatch between training and testing, thereby making the system robust to unknown bimodal <b>corruption.</b> <b>Low-level</b> feature fusion is performed using optimal feature selection, which automatically changes the weighting given to each modality based on the level of corruption. The framework for robust person identification is also applied to noise robust speaker identification, given very limited training data. Experiments have been carried out on a bimodal data set created from the SPIDRE speaker recogni- tion database and AR face recognition database, with variable noise corruption of speech and occlusion in the face images. Combining both modalities using MOFF, leads to significantly improved identification accuracy compared to the component unimodal systems, even with simultaneous corruption of both modal- ities. A novel piecewise-constant illumination model (PCIlVI) is then introduced for illumination invariant facial recognition. This method can be used given a single training facial image for each person, and assuming no prior knowledge of the illumination conditions of both the training and testing images. Small areas of the face are represented using magnitude Fourier features, which takes advan- tage of the shift-invariance of the magnitude Fourier representation, to increase robustness to small misalignment errors and small facial expression changes. Fi- nally, cosine similarity is used as an illumination invariant similarity measure, to compare small facial areas. Experiments have been carried out on the YaleB, ex- tended YaleB and eMU-PIE facial illumination databases. Facial identification accuracy using PCIlVI is comparable to or exceeds that of the literature. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This article {{suggests that the}} FCPA be amended in order to forbid these payments as well. As currently formulated, the FCPA {{does not address the}} very real damage caused by <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption.</b> Amending it to include small scale bribes would lead symbolic and practical benefits that outweigh potential objections.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the past decade, the tolerance of corruption by citizens of most Latin American countries has become a concept in its own right within the broader study of corruption. This construct, however, lacks a systematic approach and is yet to account for specific types of corruption tolerance or identify appropriate indicators to measure them. The present study addresses these voids by analyzing data provided by LAPOPâ€™s AmericasBarometer 2006 for Peru (a typical case for the incidence of bribery in Latin America) and the Global Corruption Barometer against a carefully constructed framework for the understanding of the phenomenon of corruption tolerance. The results indicate that attitudes toward specific types of <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> should not be equated to citizensâ€™ decisions to engage in such behavior. They further suggest that the study of corruption tolerance has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of the determinants of corruption in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|While the {{dominant}} {{place in the}} Russian state policy against corruption belongs to the struggle against <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption,</b> virtually, high-level corruption is tending to be ignored. In these conditions it is highly important to analyze international experience for the reduction of its risks. The fact {{that the issue is}} closely connected to politics in order to satisfy the needs of public sector, is exacerbated more by the huge sums of public expenditures and simultaneously growing losses because of the corruption. Author analyzes international experience of the corruption restriction in the public procurement system beginning with the UN Convention against corruption and ending with the modern widely spread in international practice method of disqualification. The comparative analysis of international and Russian anti-corruption policies in the public procurement sphere was conducted. The author substantiated the methods of corruption revelation and the ways of resistance towards corruption which help to reduce the losses. In the final analysis complex arrangements for the corruption restriction were proposed...|$|E
40|$|Globalization and {{technological}} innovations create investment opportunities for firms worldwide. In fact, while firms pursue {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) opportunities on a global basis, countries compete to attract these flows. Investment decisions by firms depend on complex and distinct factors. In particular, {{in the case of}} foreign investment one of these factors relates to the perception that investors have about the level of risk and/or corruption (or transparency) that characterises countries. Recent studies suggest that corruption negatively impacts on FDI and may act as a disincentive to investment. By using information for 97 countries, concerning inward FDI performance and perceived level of corruption, this paper intends to analyse how corruption influences on the FDI. Given that a certain level of perceived corruption can, in fact, be subject to different subjective evaluations by investors, the paper uses a fuzzy logic approach in order to determine conceivable clusters in the FDI-corruption space. The use of fuzzy clustering techniques reveals the existence of two well-defined clusters: one is formed by high-level corruption countries, where, indeed, corruption is negatively correlated, in a significant way, with FDI; the other is formed by <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> countries, where the influence of corruption on FDI is not so evident.

40|$|Corruption {{is divided}} into small <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> and {{high-level}} corruption. Small level little corruption {{is defined as the}} area of corruption which does not prejudice the interests of the majority of individuals. This category can be covered by a health care professional, the corruption of a clerk, etc through their decisions is an individual or group of individuals at the expense of others, but this kind of injustice is limited in time and space. Corruption, means high-level corruption of a dignitary, clerk, etc. This kind of corruption and the main effect over the entire State characteristic and the individuals who compose it. The consequences of this kind of corruption can translate into direct and indirect costs that will be supported in the end by all taxpayers. The objectives of corruption are double: profit and power. The international economic crisis has its origin in the manifestations of high level corruption in the governments of different countries. All the state now have to fight against corruption in order to settle new rules to avoid the effects af the crisis and to prevent a deepening of this crisis with devastating effects upon tha population. Here we try to emphasize the importance that we all should give corruption and measures had to be taken by everyone...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the root causes and solutions of main problems facing Healthcare Technology Management in Benin׳s public health sector. Conducted in Benin from 2008 to 2010, two surveys were used with key actors in Healthcare Technology Management. The first survey was based on 377 questionnaires and 259 interviews, and the second involved observation and group interviews at selected health facilities The findings of the two surveys show that the problems are based on both high- and <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption,</b> characterized by self-interest and unwillingness of the policy makers to solve healthcare care equipment and maintenance problems. Appropriate solutions include: (i) development of policy and management tools to guide distribution, (ii) the use of reference price lists for procuring equipment, (iii) development of policy and management tools to guide financial resource allocation on the life cycle cost of the equipment, (iv) creation of a healthcare equipment and maintenance directorate, (v) development of policy and management tools for obsolete equipment, and (iv) {{the development of a}} new healthcare technology management policy with a budgeted action plan. We suggest that much can be improved by the strict development and implementation of policy and management tools, as well as regulations at each level of the Healthcare Technology Management process. A key role has to be attributed to the technical specialists, and the end users of equipment in healthcare facilities. Furthermore, there is a need for capacity building in Healthcare Technology Management institutions...|$|E
40|$|In my dissertation, I {{investigate}} the strategic behavior of politicians engaging in corruption. Specifically, I consider how local {{government officials in}} Malawi choose between different forms of corruption, and how anti- corruption interventions {{such as those that}} increase transparency or sanctioning capacity condition these choices. I argue that the corruption space has two dimensions: a detectability dimension, capturing {{the degree to which a}} given form of corruption is detectable; and an immediacy dimension, capturing the likelihood that citizens will be affected by a given form of corruption enough to sanction it. My primary hypothesis is that corrupt political officials strategically respond to anti- corruption interventions by displacing their corruption along these dimensions to other forms, not by reducing their overall involvement in corruption. These displacement effects are not random, but occur in predictable patterns shaped by policy. In studying corruption dynamics, I employ four data sources from Malawi, a country with widespread <b>low-level</b> <b>corruption</b> yet active anti-corruption efforts. A citizen survey and media content analysis demonstrate that citizens in Malawi have diverse avenues for sanctioning corruption and that citizen willingness to enact sanctions varies across corruption forms. I generate an index of the sanctioning capacity of citizens across the districts of Malawi using data from the Anti-Corruption Bureau and National Statistics Office. A first person, nationally representative survey of local government officials provides a measure of corruption. Finally, I conduct a survey experiment on district officials that manipulates the level of top-down and bottom-up transparency they face. I provide support for the corruption displacement hypothesis that anti-corruption interventions cause some forms of corruption to become less prevalent and others to become more prevalent. Specifically, transparency interventions displace corruption to low-detectability forms. Officials exposed to a bottom-up transparency intervention experience greater displacement along the immediacy dimension. The displacement effect is greatest when the transparency intervention occurs in an area with high sanctioning capacity. This research sheds light on how transparency and sanctioning capacity can be used to influence government official corruption choices outside election...|$|E
