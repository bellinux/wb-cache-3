5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The <b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E

5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} production when the 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained a copy of the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The <b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E

Rama also adds, such as in section 4.38 of the Ramayana, that one must also introspect and never neglect what one's proper duties, appropriate responsibilities, true interests and legitimate pleasures are.|$|E
25|$|Profoundly {{affected}} by {{his experience in}} World War I, Crosby vowed to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> {{on his own terms}} and abandoned all pretense of living the expected life of a privileged Bostonian. He had his father's eye for women, and in 1920 met Mrs. Richard Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob), six years his senior. They had sex within two weeks, and their open affair was the source of scandal and gossip among blue-blood Boston.|$|E

When he wants to start drinking martinis, Francine objects since he cannot handle his alcohol. However, she gives him a chance, only to subsequently chase him running down the street in only his underwear. Francine then disbars the arrangement, but Stan decides to get drunk again, causing him to pass out repeatedly and believe that Francine is a witch.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{taught that}} {{to achieve a}} virtuous and {{potentially}} happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses {{to do the best}} things. When the best people come to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Tancred enlisted in the Natal Light Horse but was discharged as being unfit for active service in 1915. His marriage to Mary Chawick later that year produced two children and following a few post War matches Tancred retired from first-class cricket in 1920. It is believed that Tancred became depressed {{as he struggled to}} <b>live</b> <b>life</b> out of the limelight that surrounded his cricketing career. His disillusionment was such that Tancred strongly advised his son Louis Jnr not to embark on a career in sport. Louis Jnr instead joined the Royal Air Force and, while working as a flight instructor, was killed aged 34 in a plane crash at the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire.|$|E

25|$|The Abbey of Marmoutier was {{a monastery}} just outside today's city of Tours in Indre-et-Loire, France {{established}} by Martin around 372. The saint founded the monastery to escape attention and <b>live</b> <b>life</b> as a monastic. The Abbey at Tours {{was one of}} the most prominent and influential establishments in medieval France. Charlemagne awarded the position of Abbot to his friend and adviser Alcuin, the great English scholar and educator. At this time the Abbot could travel between Tours and the court at Trier in Germany and always stay overnight at one of his own properties. It was at Tours that Alcuin's scriptorium (a room in monasteries devoted to the copying of manuscripts by monastic scribes) developed Caroline minuscule, the clear round hand which made manuscripts far more legible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Drive {{gave the}} Prevé 4 out of 5 stars, praising the ride and handling, {{refinement}} and roominess of the Prevé, while pointing out several flaws {{which included the}} CVT powertrains, interior fit & finish, and the troubled Proton brand image. Autoworld.com.my shared similar impressions on the Prevé, where the authors declared it as Proton's best product to date, owing much to its ride and handling attributes, standard equipment and value for money appeal. The CVT powertrains and build quality were pointed out as its major let downs. Popular Malay language automobile news portal funtasticko.net echoed generally positive sentiments, in which the reviewers concluded that the Prevé symbolized {{the beginning of a}} 'new Proton' intent on shedding its negative brand image, on the domestic and global stages alike.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

500|$|In the future, {{society is}} divided between 'low-drives' that equate with the labouring classes and 'hi-drives' {{who control the}} {{government}} and media. The low-drives are controlled by a constant broadcast of pornography that the hi-drives are convinced will pacify them, though one hi-drive, Nat Mender (Tony Vogel), believes that the media {{should be used to}} educate the low-drives. After the accidental death of a protester during the Sex Olympics gets a massive audience response, the co-ordinator Ugo Priest (Leonard Rossiter) decides to commission a new programme. In The <b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Show, Nat Mender, his partner Deanie (Suzanne Neve) and their daughter Keten (Lesley Roach) are stranded on a remote Scottish island while the low-drive audience watches. Mender's former colleague, Lasar Opie (Brian Cox), feeling that [...] "something got to happen", decides to spice up the show by introducing a dangerous element to the island, and The <b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Show is deemed a triumph.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that I think he really didn't know how to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the reality}} {{television}} of The <b>Live</b> <b>Life</b> Show is the aspect most commentators pick up on, The Year of the Sex Olympics {{is also a}} wider satire on sensationalist television and the media in general. Mark Gatiss has noted that the Artsex and Foodshow programmes that also appear in the play [...] "ingeniously depicted the future of lowest common denominator TV". This view is echoed by the writer and critic Kim Newman, who has said that [...] "as an extreme exercise in revolutionary self-criticism {{on the part of}} television professionals, who also lampoon their own world of chattering commentators and ratings-chasing sensationalism, the play [...] is a trenchant contribution to a series of debates that is still raging" [...] and has concluded that [...] "Nigel Kneale might be quite justified in shouting, 'I was right! I was right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The McGuinn and Hillman {{composition}} [...] "Change Is Now", {{with its}} lyrics advising the listener to <b>live</b> <b>life</b> to the full, represents {{a celebration of}} the philosophy of carpe diem (popularly translated as [...] "seize the day"). Within this context, the song's lyrics explored a number of other themes, including epiphenomenalism, communalism and human ecology. The quasi-philosophical nature of the song prompted McGuinn to flippantly describe it in a 1969 interview as [...] "another one of those guru-spiritual-mystic songs that no-one understood." [...] An early instrumental recording of the song, listed under its original working title of [...] "Universal Mind Decoder", was included as a bonus track on the 1997 reissue of The Notorious Byrd Brothers. [...] "Change Is Now" [...] is notable for being the only song on the album to feature both David Crosby and future Byrd Clarence White together on the same track.|$|E
