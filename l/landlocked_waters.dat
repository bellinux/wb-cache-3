50|$|There {{is reason}} to believe that {{anchovies}} at the western end of the English Channel in November and December migrate from the Zuiderzee and the Scheldt in the autumn, returning there the following spring. They were believed to be an isolated population, for none come from the south in summer to occupy the English Channel, though the species does exist off the coast of Portugal. The explanation appears to be that in summer, the shallow and <b>landlocked</b> <b>waters</b> of the Zuiderzee and the sea off the Dutch coast get warmer than the coastal waters off Britain, so anchovies can spawn and maintain their numbers in warmer Dutch waters better.|$|E

40|$|Cyprinodon dearborni, Poecilia sphenops and Rivulus marmoratus seem to fill {{almost the}} same niche. In most of the {{landlocked}} bays, lagoons or pools the three species were not found together. In only two landlocked locations two of the species were found together. In the locations with an open connection with the sea all three species, or at least two were present. In <b>landlocked</b> <b>waters</b> interspecific competition seems {{to play an important}} role as the niches of the three species overlap to a large extent. Environmental factors of importance appeared to be: 1) Plant or algal growth is required by Poecilia and Rivulus. 2) Low salinities seem to be of advantage to Poecilia and Rivulus, supersaline environments seem to favour Cyprinodon. 3) Oxygen depletion may threaten Poecilia more than the others 4) Cyprinodon is able to take any food of suitable size but its main food source is formed by unicellular cyanophyceans, a source that is almost inexhaustible. Poecilia, although omnivorous, is more particular in its food choice; Rivulus is carnivorous and its population depends on the availability of live food. 5) Cyprinodon does not prey upon the other two species. Poecilia preys upon the eggs and fry of the others, and Rivulus also takes juveniles. 6) Cyprinodon is hardly ever cannibalistic; it may only consume some of its eggs. Cannibalism in Poecilia and Rivulus is of great importance. In adverse conditions, it keeps the populations small, which seems to be an advantage in small lagoons or pools. 7) Ovoviviparity and hermaphroditism in Poecilia and Rivulus may have a special advantage in maintaining very small populations. 8) In isolated waters, predation by other fish species or by birds seem to be of little importance. 9) Mass mortality because of parasitism is an exception. 10) All three species are very able to flee from adverse conditions. If a population is destroyed repopulation will take place from the sea where small, but stable populations are present. 11) Many of the characteristics mentioned are of special advantage in island environments...|$|E

40|$|The white perch, Morone {{americana}} (Gmelinl, is {{a member}} of the Percichthyidae family. It is a euryhaline species that is common along the northern Atlantic coast south to the Carolinas. Marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems with salinities ranging from 5 to 18 percent have been known to support white perch (Mansueti 1964). The species is semianadromous, making spawning runs up coastal streams. It commonly becomes completely landlocked in ponds and reservoirs of its native range where it spawns successfully. This species has been known as a game fish to generations of New England fishermen, but when stocked in <b>landlocked</b> <b>waters</b> white perch have a tendency to become overpopulated and stunted, thereby usurping the food supply and reducing the growth rates of other more desirable game species (Thorpe 1942, Everhart 1950, Stroud 1952). In 1964 the wh ite perch was brought into Nebraska in an effort to improve the sport fishery in a select group of alkaline lakes located in the Sandhills region. Adult perch were initially imported from New Jersey and allowed to spawn at the Valentine State Fish Hatchery. The progeny were used to stock the Sandh ill lakes. In the fall of 1964 white perch young-of-the-year were discovered in Wagon Train Reservoir in southeastern Nebraska. Although the source of these fish is not definitely known, it appears they were inadvertently introduced as advanced fry in June, 1964 with a stocking of largemouth bass fry. In this reservoir white perch numbers increased rapidly. This expansion and other pertinent population and historical information has been reported in the literature (Hergenrader and Bliss 1971). In 1971 white perch were discovered in Stagecoach Reservoir located approximately 6. 4 km west-southwest of Wagon Train Reservoir in Lancaster County. Here the white perch population increased dramatically, clearly following the trends experienced in the Wagon Train white perch population. Because of their small size, most Nebraska white perch were undesirable to anglers. Factors which contributed to this situation included high fecundity, high natural mortality after Age III, and food preference. When management endeavors to enhance the desirability of this species failed in both reservoirs, total renovations were conducted after reservoir drawdowns in 1975 for Wagon Train and in 1976 for Stagecoach. Subsequent to the above eliminations, Lund (1978 a) discovered a large population of white perch in Buckley 3 F Reservoir in 1977. The significance of this population in the Little Blue River watershed lies in the fact that it is entirely separate from the Salt Creek drainage where Wagon Train and Stagecoach are located. Like the latter two reservoirs Buckley 3 F was chemically renovated in July of 1980. Efforts to contain white perch in Nebraska have been successsful on a lake by lake basis, but the species has spread to other lakes and streams. An update on the current distribution and potential for dispersal is covered by Hergenrader (1980). In addition to the documented locations of white perch by the above author this species also occurs in other localities, most noteworthy of which is Offut Air Force Base Lake, a - 64 ha sand pit located along the Missouri River in Sarpy County. Results from a 1978 survey indicate reproduction has occurred. Fortunately, no natural reproduction of white perch has been documented in any Nebraska streams (Maret 1978). The objective of this report is to summarize all data gathered by or available to Nebraska Game and Parks on white perch in Nebraska. Most of the data will involve Wagon Train and Stagecoach Reservoirs, but where applicable, comparisons were related to data collected on white perch in smaller reservoirs. Since total elimination of this species in Nebraska appears remote, this should assist future strategies to manage white perch...|$|E

The base's third problem was that it was old and that many of its facilities had been jury-built using scrap materials and re-used structures salvaged from the Victory Plant Shipyard during the depths of the Great Depression when funds were hard to come by.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to obtain insight into the processes that {{play a role in}} biodiversity patterns of tropical marine species by using marine lakes as a model. Marine lakes are <b>landlocked</b> <b>water</b> bodies that maintain a marine character through narrow submarine connections to the sea. Two regions in Indonesia were studied: Berau (East Kalimantan) and Raja Ampat (West Papua). The following questions were addressed: 1. What are the different types of marine lakes in Indonesia? 2. Are the species assemblages in marine lakes distinct from those in the adjacent coastal environments? 3. To what extent are the populations in the lakes isolated? 4. Can marine lakes in Indonesia be considered natural laboratories of evolution? There is a large diversity in types of marine lakes and many more remain to be documented in Indonesia. The spatial variation in sponge species composition in marine lakes, coastal mangroves and coral reefs show that marine lakes contain three groups of sponge species: (a) widespread species known from various locations in Indo-Pacific reefs, (b) lake species that only occur in lake systems, (c) endemic species restricted to a single lake. The patterns of genetic variation found in the marine lake populations are generally consistent with populations in isolated environments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{overview}} of new knowledge on oxygen depletion (hypoxia) and related phenomena in aquatic systems resulting from the EU-FP 7 project HYPOX ("In situ monitoring of oxygen depletion in hypoxic ecosystems of coastal and open seas, and <b>landlocked</b> <b>water</b> bodies", [URL] In view of the anticipated oxygen loss in aquatic systems due to eutrophication and climate change, HYPOX was set up to improve capacities to monitor hypoxia as well as to understand its causes and consequences. Temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of hypoxia were analyzed in field studies in various aquatic environments, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Scottish and Scandinavian fjords, Ionian Sea lagoons and embayments, and Swiss lakes. Examples of episodic and rapid (hours) occurrences of hypoxia, as well as seasonal changes in bottom-water oxygenation in stratified systems, are discussed. Geologically driven hypoxia caused by gas seepage is demonstrated. Using novel technologies, temporal and spatial patterns of water-column oxygenation, from basin-scale seasonal patterns to meter-scale sub-micromolar oxygen distributions, were resolved. Existing multidecadal monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions. Organic and inorganic proxies were used to extend investigations on past oxygen conditions to centennial and even longer timescales that cannot be resolved by monitoring. The effects of hypoxia on faunal communities and biogeochemical processes were also addressed in the project. An investigation of benthic fauna is presented as an example of hypoxia-devastated benthic communities that slowly recover upon a reduction in eutrophication in a system where naturally occurring hypoxia overlaps with anthropogenic hypoxia. Biogeochemical investigations reveal that oxygen intrusions have a strong effect on the microbially mediated redox cycling of elements. Observations and modeling studies of the sediments demonstrate the effect of seasonally changing oxygen conditions on benthic mineralization pathways and fluxes. Data quality and access are crucial in hypoxia research. Technical issues are therefore also addressed, including the availability of suitable sensor technology to resolve the gradual changes in bottom-water oxygen in marine systems that can be expected as a result of climate change. Using cabled observatories as examples, we show how the benefit of continuous oxygen monitoring can be maximized by adopting proper quality control. Finally, we discuss strategies for state-of-the-art data archiving and dissemination in compliance with global standards, and how ocean observations can contribute to global earth observation attempts...|$|R

2500|$|Juvenile to subadult giant {{trevally}} {{are known}} to enter and inhabit estuaries, {{the upper reaches of}} rivers and coastal lakes in several locations, including South Africa, Solomon Islands, Philippines, India, Taiwan, Thailand, northern Australia, and Hawaii. In some of these locations, such as Australia, it is a common and relatively abundant inhabitant, while in others, including South Africa and Hawaii, it is much rarer in estuaries. The species has a wide salinity tolerance, as evident from the ranges from which juvenile and subadult fish in South African estuaries have been recorded; 0.5 to 38 parts per thousand (ppt), with other studies also showing tolerance levels of less than 1 ppt. In these estuaries, the giant trevally is known from both highly turbid, dirty water to clean, high visibility waters, but in most cases, the species prefers the turbid waters. Younger fish apparently actively seek out these turbid waters, and when no estuaries are present, they live in the turbid inshore waters of bays and beaches. These young fish eventually move to inshore reefs as they mature, before again moving to deeper outer reefs.

Because of the declining fresh water smelt population, the question arose whether this population is still supported by the diadromous population. Opportunities for exchange between fresh water and the sea are however limited to discharge sluices. The relationship between the diadromous and landlocked smelt population was analysed by means of otolith microchemistry. Our interpretation of otolith strontium ((88) Sr) patterns from smelt specimens collected in the fresh water area of Lake IJsselmeer and Markermeer, compared to those collected in the nearby marine environment, is that there is currently no evidence for a substantial contribution from the diadromous population to the spawning stock of the landlocked population...|$|R

This I have seen him do unprovoked. I fancy it must have been to show off before the whites.|$|R
