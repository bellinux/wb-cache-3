Third, we investigate the relationship between patient satisfaction and viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> for those currently in care. Clarity of health care providers' explanations and length of wait time were both significantly associated with patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was related to facility retention in HIV care, {{but it was not}} related to HIV viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> for those who were currently in care.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of memory responses in suppressive {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) {{has been an}} area of controversy. By using a previously described proliferation assay that augments specific responses, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 61 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -seropositive individuals with CD 4 counts of > 300 /mm 3 and suppressed viral burdens were studied for response to p 24 antigen as a function of time of viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> on HAART. In the majority of cases, proliferative responses could be measured in PBL from patients with plasma viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression.</b> No differences could be found in proliferative responses from PBL between individuals with a low and those with a high CD 4 cell nadir. PBL that did not respond to either Casta antigen or p 24 were found to have a higher percentage of naïve cells than did PBL that responded well to antigen. These data support the contention that, after long-term viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression,</b> PBL from infected individuals have memory cell populations that can respond to antigenic stimulation under inducible conditions...|$|E

Although {{tenofovir}} (TDF) /emtricitabine (FTC) /efavirenz (EFV) and zidovudine (ZDV) /lamivudine (3 TC) /efavirenz (EFV) {{are used}} as preferred first line regimen, their head-to-head comparison {{in terms of their}} efficacy and tolerability was limited. This review aimed to synthesize the best available evidence on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of the two regimens. Methods. Seven sites and databases in addition to Google search until August 20, 2016, were searched. Only randomized clinical trials conducted on adult population were included in this study. Our primary outcome was viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> while secondary outcomes were death and tolerability. Undetectable viral load is defined as < 50 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies/ml. Joanna Briggs institute meta-analysis of statistics assessment and review instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and critical appraisal and data extraction tool were applied for critical assessment and data extraction, respectively. We performed a random effect meta-analysis to pool the relative risk (RR) for viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> (< 50 HIV RNA copies/ml and < 400 HIV RNA copies/ml), tolerability, and death. Result. Data was extracted from four articles, which included a total of 2381 participants. We found superior viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> among tenofovir (TDF) arm compared to zidovudine (ZDV) arm. Tenofovir arm achieves viral load < 50 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [1. 04, 1. 21], I 2 = 0 %) higher than zidovudine arm. Similarly TDF arm is superior in viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> to < 400 HIV RNA copies/ml (RR = 1. 19, 95 % CI [1. 11, 1. 27], I 2 = 0 %). Moreover, TDF based regimens {{were more likely to be}} tolerated than ZDV based regimens (4 trials, 2381 participants (RR = 1. 06, 95 % CI [1. 02, 1. 10], I 2 = 51 %)).

Methods: Using systematic sampling, 520 HIV-infected patients were selected prior to initiation of ART from 4 HIV care and treatment clinics (CTC) in Dar-es-Salaam. Data on HIV status disclosure and adherence were collected using a structured questionnaire, while viral load and CD 4 + T-cell counts were determined through laboratory investigations. Patients were followed up for one year. We performed logistic regression to determine the association between HIV status disclosure and the outcomes. Results: Four hundred and sixty two patients were analyzed, of whom 136 (29. 4 %) were males. Sixty (13 %) and 310 (67. 1 %) of the study patients disclosed their HIV-status early and late respectively, while 92 (19. 9 %) did not disclose their HIV-status. Between males and females in each category, male had low number of HIV-status disclosure, p< 0. 05. The proportion adhering to therapy of 96. 7 % was higher in patients who disclosed their HIV-status before ART initiation {{compared to that of}} 85. 4 % among those who disclosed later on, p= 0. 0109.

40|$|The {{association}} between {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I (HIV- 1) RNA load changes {{and the emergence of}} resistant virus variants was investigated in 24 HIV- 1 -infected asymptomatic persons during 2 years of treatment with zidovudine by sequentially measuring serum HIV- 1 RNA load and the relative amounts of HIV- 1 RNA containing mutations at reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 70 (K [...] >R), 41 (M [...] >L), and 215 (T [...] >Y/F). A mean maximum decline in RNA load occurred during the first month, followed by a resurgence between 1 and 3 months, which appeared independent of drug-resistance. Mathematical modeling suggests that this resurgence is caused by host-parasite dynamics, and thus reflects infection of the transiently increased numbers of CD 4 + lymphocytes. Between 3 and 6 months of treatment, the RNA load returned to baseline values, which was associated with the emergence of virus containing a single lysine to arginine amino acid change at RT codon 70, only conferring an 8 -fold reduction in susceptibility. Despite the relative loss of RNA <b>load</b> <b>suppression,</b> selection toward mutations at RT codons 215 and 41 continued. Identical patterns were observed in the mathematical model.

However, a high proportion of patients present late for care. Our objective was to assess CD 4 cell count recovery up to seven years in naïve patients initiating cART with at least three drugs in usual clinical care. Methods: From the French Hospital Database on HIV, we selected naïve individuals initiating cART from 2000 with at least two years of follow-up. Participants were further required to have achieved viral <b>load</b> <b>suppression</b> by six months after initiating cART and were censored in case of virological failure. We calculated the proportion of patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates) who achieved CD 4 recovery to > 500 /mm 3 according to baseline CD 4 cell count. Results: A total of 15, 025 patients were analyzed with a median follow-up on ART of 65. 5 months (IQR: 42. 3 – 96. 0). At cART initiation, the median age was 38. 6 years (IQR: 32. 2 – 46. 0), 9734 (64. 8 %) were men, median CD 4 cell count was 239 (IQR: 130 – 336) and 2668 (17. 8 %) had a prior AIDS event.

40|$|The {{presence}} of transmitted {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) - 1 drug-resistance (TDR) {{at the time of}} antiretroviral therapy initiation is associated with failure to achieve viral <b>load</b> (VL) <b>suppression.</b> Here, we report TDR surveillance in a specific population of {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. In this study, the rate of TDR was evaluated in 64 HIV-infected individuals from a cohort of MSM between 1996 -June 2012. Fifty-four percent had a documented recent HIV infection, with a seroconversion time of less than 12 months. The median CD 4 +T lymphocyte count and VL were 531 cells/mm 3 and 17, 746 copies/mL, respectively. Considering the surveillance drug resistance mutation criteria, nine (14. 1 %) patients presented TDR, of which three (4. 7 %), five (7. 8 %) and four (6. 2 %) had protease inhibitors, resistant against nucleos(t) ide transcriptase inhibitors and against non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors mutations, respectively. Two of the patients had multi-drug-resistant HIV- 1. The most prevalent viral subtype was B (44, 68. 8 %), followed by subtype F (11, 17. 2 %). This study shows that TDR may vary according to the population studied and it may be higher in clusters of MSM...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{syphilis}} incidence {{among men}} who have sex with men (MSM) has been reported. The index case was a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -positive MSM who presented coincidentally with the secondary syphilis and a rebound of plasma viral <b>load</b> after complete <b>suppression</b> of HIV- 1 (below 50 copies/ml) for 13 months with potent antiretroviral therapy (PART), suggesting a possibility of HIV- 1 super-infection. We analyzed HIV- 1 sequences before and after syphilis in four HIV- 1 -positive patients including the index case to explore drug re-sistance mutations (DRMs) and a possibility of HIV- 1 superinfection. There were patients who obtained DRMs around syphilis infection but no evidence of HIV- 1 superinfection was obtained. Our results underline the importance of strict adherence to PART. 2006 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS...|$|R
