40|$|Abstract: Since 1976 {{when school}} {{students}} in Soweto {{took to the streets}} in active defiance of the apartheid state, students as a political constituency have always been admired, noted and feared for the political positions they have taken and campaigns launched. South African student organisations in the 1980 s and 1990 s a <b>ligned</b> themselves with mass democratic movements and engaged with and shaped their agendas. Commentators suggest however, that the nature and character of student organisations have changed in post-apartheid South Africa, and consequently, also students’ interest in ‘getting involved’. With regard to SRCs, while many authors argue that SRCs are no longer a ‘revolutionary force’ and have become either retrogressive or disempowered, others suggest that more effort needs to be made to understand the content of ‘new’ SRCs in post-apartheid South Africa and their appeal to diverse student populations. This paper seeks to establish the attitudes of University of Johannesburg (UJ) students towards voting for, and supporting, the Students Representative Council (SRC), and, for involving themselves in student politics at UJ. In making sense of students’ perceptions, the paper probes differences and similarities in terms of four key factors: gender, race, year of study, and residential background...|$|E
40|$|The fluvial {{sequences}} of the Milton and the Letchworth formations {{in the south}} Midlands of England and neighbouring regions represent at least two pre-existing rivers, the Milton and Brigstock streams, underlying Middle Pleistocene glacial sediments. The Milton Formation includes sand sourced from the Midlands bedrock. This implies that both streams were aligned in a northwest to southeast direction. This direction parallels the contemporaneous courses of the rivers Thames and Trent, the former turning towards the east and northeast to enter the North Sea. Their alignments indicate that the Milton and Letchworth streams formed left-bank tributaries of the Thames, joining the river in Hertfordshire and Essex, as illustrated in the article. This reconstruction {{has important implications for}} the interpretation of the proto-Soar river of the south Midlands, represented by the Baginton Formation. Although originally thought to represent a late Middle Pleistocene line, this southwest to northeast aligned system was reinterpreted as the headwaters of a pre-Anglian ‘Bytham river’, a 1 <b>ligned</b> towards East Anglia. However, recent work has shown that this river could not have existed in the pre-Anglian since there is no link between the Midlands and East Anglian spreads. Recent re-recognition that the Baginton Formation deposits do represent a later, post-Anglian drainage line is reinforced by the identification of the Milton and Letchworth streams, whose catchments occupied the area later drained by the proto-Soar. Overall, the main drainage alignment in southern England during the pre-Anglian period was dominated by northwest–southeast-draining consequent rivers adjusted to the regional geological dip. After widespread drainage disruption caused by the Anglian glaciation, northeast–southwest-orientated subsequent streams eroded frost-susceptible clay bedrock under periglacial and permafrost conditions, and beheaded the courses of some of the older consequent streams...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: 2 D {{ultrasound}} TAPSE and MAPSE examination may characterise ventricular {{function in}} the fetus. We aimed to evaluate feasibility of STIC M-mode for measuring TAPSE and MAPSE {{in the second half}} of gestation. Methods: We recruited gravidae presenting from 20 to 34 weeks for routine surveillance, with structurally normal singleton pregnancies. STIC volumes of a complete cardiac cycle were acquired and saved. Manipulation of the volumes and measurements were performed ofﬂine in post-processing and in a lower speed. All unnamed volumes were evaluated by two operators to assess repeatability. 15 STIC volumes were also duplicated and appeared randomly three times each for intraobserver repeatability evaluation. The operators scrolled through each volume to optimise the 4 chamber view then rotated the cardiac apex to 12 o’clock. The M-mode beam was a <b>ligned</b> through the lateral aspect of the tricuspid valve annulus, parallel to the interventricular septum. The x and y axes were further adjusted in order to deﬁne the most appropriate distinct line to measure the maximum annular movement. The excursion, or vertical movement, of the tricuspid annulus during systole and diastole was measured from the M-mode wave amplitude. This process was then repeated for mitral annulus excursion. Inter- and intraobserver variability were tested with intraclass correlation coefﬁcients (ICC). Results: 60 volumes from 16 gravidae were evaluated by eachoperator. The mean TAPSE was 5. 4 (SD, 1) mm and 5. 3 (SD, 1. 1) mm measured by operator 1 and 2 respectively. The mean MAPSE was 4. 3 (SD, 0. 8) mm and 4. 2 (SD, 0. 7) mm measured by operator 1 and 2 respectively. ICCs for TAPSE were high with intraobserver ICCs of 0. 94 and 0. 92 for operator 1 and 2 and an interobserver ICC of 0. 91. MAPSE ICCs were lower with intraobserver ICCs of 0. 80 for both operators and interobserver ICC of 0. 76. Conclusions: STIC allows easy and accessible evaluation of systolic {{function in the}} fetus, that is reliable and repeatable, more so for TAPSE than MAPSE...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the orifice area in aortic stenosis can be determined accurately and reliably by multiplane transesophageal ecocardiography. Background. Monoplane transesophageal echocardiography has been used for planimetry of aortic valve orifice areas; however, obtaining a precise short-axis view is sometimes impossible. methods. In 41 consecutive patients with known valvular calcific aortic stenosis (20 men, mean age 64 ± 9 years), aortic valve orifice area was measured by planimetry using a multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe that allows full rotation of the cross-sectional plane. Results were compared with invasive measurements obtained by the Gorlin formula and determined noninvasively by transthoracic echocardiography using the continuity equation. Results. Multiplane transducer technology enabled the rotation of the cross-sectional plane from an exactly <b>ligned</b> long-axis view of the stenosed valve to a precise short-axis view without moving the tip of the echocardiographic probe, thus achieving an orifice cross section at a level predetermined in the long-axis view. Planimetry was feasible in 38 patients (93 %). In three patients with pinhole stenosis (area determined by the Gorlin formula < 0. 4 cm 2), the valve area could not be exactly delineated. Correlation between areas derived by transesophageal echocardiogaraphic planimetry (0. 56 ± 0. 31 cm 2) and by the Gorlin formula (0. 58 ± 0. 31 cm 2) was excellent (r = 0. 95; standard deviation of regression [SDR] = 0. 054; Y = 0. 92 X + 0. 085, where Y = Gorlin area and X = planimetry area). Correlation between Gorlin- and continuity equation-derived (0. 65 ± 0. 46 cm 2) was r = 0. 79; for continuity equation- and transesophageal planimetry-derived it was r = 0. 83. Severe aortic stenosis (valve area ≤ 0. 75 cm 2) was predicted with high sensitivity (96 %) and specificity (88 %). Conclusions. Multiplane transesophageal echocardiography is a practical and accurate clinical tool for the assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background DNA ligases are {{required}} for DNA strand joining in all forms of cellular life. NAD + -dependent DNA ligases are found primarily in eubacteria but also in some eukaryotic viruses, bacteriophage and archaea. Among the archaeal NAD + -dependent DNA ligases is the <b>LigN</b> enzyme of the halophilic euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, the gene for which was apparently acquired by Hfx. volcanii through lateral gene transfer (LGT) from a halophilic eubacterium. Genetic {{studies show that the}} LGT-acquired <b>LigN</b> enzyme shares an essential function with the native Hfx. volcanii ATP-dependent DNA ligase protein LigA. Results To characterise the enzymatic properties of the <b>LigN</b> protein, wild-type and three mutant forms of the <b>LigN</b> protein were separately expressed in recombinant form in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). Non-isotopic DNA ligase activity assays using λ DNA restriction fragments with 12 bp cos cohesive ends were used to show that <b>LigN</b> activity was dependent on addition of divalent cations and salt. No activity was detected in the absence of KCl, whereas maximum activity could be detected at 3. 2 M KCl, close to the intracellular KCl concentration of Hfx. volcanii cells. Conclusion <b>LigN</b> is unique amongst characterised DNA ligase enzymes in displaying maximal DNA strand joining activity at high (> 3 M) salt levels. As such the <b>LigN</b> enzyme has potential both as a novel tool for biotechnology and as a model enzyme for studying the adaptation of proteins to high intracellular salt levels. </p...|$|R

Sphingobium sp. strain SYK- 6 degrades guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE) to α-(2 -methoxyphenoxy) -β-hydroxypropiovanillone (MPHPV), and then the ether linkage of MPHPV is cleaved to generate α-glutathionyl-β-hydroxypropiovanillone (GS-HPV) and guaiacol. We have characterized three enantioselective glutathione S-transferase genes, including two genes that are involved in the ether cleavage of two enantiomers of MPHPV and one gene that is involved in the elimination of glutathione from a GS-HPV enantiomer. However, {{the first step in the}} degradation of four different GGE stereoisomers has not been characterized. In this study, three alcohol dehydrogenase genes, ligL, <b>ligN,</b> and ligO, which conferred GGE transformation activity in Escherichia coli, were isolated from SYK- 6 and characterized, in addition to the previously cloned ligD gene. The levels of amino acid sequence identity of the four GGE dehydrogenases, which belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, ranged from 32 % to 39 %. Each gene was expressed in E. coli, and the stereospecificities of the gene products with the four GGE stereoisomers were determined by using chiral high-performance liquid chromatography with recently synthesized authentic enantiopure GGE stereoisomers. LigD and LigO converted (αR,βS) -GGE and (αR,βR) -GGE into (βS) -MPHPV and (βR) -MPHPV, respectively, while LigL and <b>LigN</b> transformed (αS,βR) -GGE and (αS,βS) -GGE to (βR) -MPHPV and (βS) -MPHPV, respectively.

Two- and one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Scheffé tests were used for data analysis (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). RESULTS This investigation showed an influence of the veneering method on the fracture load results independent of the aging level. The highest fracture load was measured for the FDPs with digital veneering (1882 [*]±[*] 152 N at baseline, 2021 [*]±[*] 184 N after thermocycling). The remaining groups showed comparable results, and no impact of thermal aging was observed. Digital and conventional veneers showed cracks in the pontic region starting from the connector area as a main failure type after loading, while the pre-manufactured veneers showed predominantly adhesive failures.

However, proteins of slightly lower molecular mass than ApxI, ApxII and ApxIII which showed limited cross-reactions with monospecific, polyclonal anti-ApxI, anti-ApxII and anti-ApxIII were detected on immunoblot analysis of A. equuli, A. seminis and P. aerogenes. The presence of Apx toxins and proteins that imunologically cross react with Apx toxins in porcine Actinobacillus species other than A. pleuropneumoniae can be expected to interfere with serodiagnosis of porcine pleuropneumonia...|$|R
40|$|The {{cosmopolitan}} polypore genus Ganoderma (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) has {{an enormous}} economic value, due to the caused diseases on different tree plantations (e. g. G. boninense in oil palms) and the medicinal properties of certain species (e. g. G. applanatum, G. lingzhi and G. sinense). The cultivated Ganoderma strains used by Hungarian growers originate both from selected wild strains or more often taxonomically not evaluated isolates with uncertain origin. However, based on morphological characteristics, the species concepts in the genus lack consensus, and the taxonomy of many Ganoderma taxa is thus problematic. Therefore, {{in addition to the}} morphological examination, suitable molecular methods have recently been required to the taxonomically correct identification of the wild Ganoderma species and cultivated strains in many cases. DNA barcode is a widely accepted tool for species identification and authentication of commercial products containing Ganoderma species. Among the tested fungal DNA barcoding markers, the application of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is the most commonly used and it was formally proposed as the primary fungal barcode marker. Besides the ITS, several other DNA barcoding markers were used by different authors to clarify taxonomic difficulties in Ganoderma: e. g. β-tubulin, LSU, rpb 1, rpb 2, Tef 1 -α or the mtSSU rDNA sequence. Formerly, the Hungarian Ganoderma species (viz. G. adspersum, G. applanatum, G. carnosum, G. cupreolaccatum, G. lucidum and G. resinaceum) were briefly studied by Papp and Szabó (2013, in Acta Silv. <b>Lign.</b> Hung. 9 : 71 – 83.), however, based on solely morphological charactersitics. In this study we aimed (i) to generate DNA barcoding sequences for all wild Ganoderma species observed in Hungary; furthermore, (ii) to investigate and evaluate the Hungarian cultivated strains labelled as “G. lucidum” and the Ganoderma spp. isolates preserved in culture collections, based on DNA barcoding sequence analysis.
