25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A <b>laparoscope</b> may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the first {{solution}} to 3 D reconstruc-tion in monocular laparoscopy using methods based on Photometric Stereo (PS). Our main contributions are {{to provide the}} new theory and practical solutions to successfully apply PS in close-range imaging condi-tions. We are specifically motivated by a solution with minimal hardware modification to existing <b>laparoscopes.</b> In fact the only physical modifica-tion we make is to adjust the colour of the <b>laparoscope’s</b> illumination via three filters placed at its tip. Once calibrated, our approach can compute 3 D from a single image, does not require correspondence estimation, and computes absolute depth densely.

50|$|Live {{images from}} the {{fluorescent}} dye and the surgical field are obtained {{using a combination of}} filters, lenses and cameras. During open surgery, hand held devices are usually preferred for their ease of use and mobility. A stand or arm can be used to maintain the system on top of the operating field, particularly when the weight and complexity of the device is high (e.g. when multiple cameras are used). The main disadvantage of such devices is that operating theater lights can interfere with the fluorescence emission channel, with a consequent decrease of signal-to-background ratio. This issue is usually solved by dimming or switching off the theater lights during fluorescence detection. FGS can also be performed using minimally invasive devices such as <b>laparoscopes</b> or endoscopes. In this case, a system of filters, lenses and cameras is attached {{to the end of the}} probe. Unlike open surgery, the background from external light sources is reduced. Nevertheless, the excitation power density at the sample is limited by the low light transmission of the fiber optics in endoscopes and <b>laparoscopes,</b> particularly in the near infrared. Moreover, the ability of collecting light is much reduced compared to standard imaging lenses used for open surgery devices.FGS devices can also be implemented for robotic surgery (for example in the da Vinci Surgical System).|$|R
