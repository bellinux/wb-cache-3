5|$|Brachiopods <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim {{for up to}} a month and have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia on the shore of the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|While jaguars now <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the Americas, {{they are}} descended from Old World cats. Two million years ago, {{scientists}} believe, the jaguar and its closest relative, the similarly spotted leopard, {{shared a common}} ancestor in Asia. In the Early Pleistocene, the forerunners of modern jaguars crossed Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait and connected Asia and North America. These jaguar ancestors then moved south into Central and South America, feeding on the deer and other grazing animals that once covered the landscape in huge herds.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Atlantic Ocean on the RMS Lusitania to London, where they gathered the supplies {{they would need}} for their expedition, Beebe and his team traveled across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt, through the Suez Canal, and across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, where they began their task of documenting the native wildfowl. From Ceylon they traveled to Calcutta, {{with the goal of}} capturing the species of pheasants which <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the Himalayas. By this point Beebe was beginning to be in conflict with Horsfall, who was unaccustomed to such expeditions. After Beebe had finished his documentation {{in the eastern part of}} the range, Horsfall refused to accompany Beebe in the western part of the range, causing Beebe to leave him in the town of Jorepokhri and continue his work in the Western Himalayas without him. Horsfall rejoined them in Calcutta, from which they sailed to Indonesia. The next ship took them to Singapore, where Beebe established a base of operations for the next stage of his expedition.|$|E

Roy W. Johnson Hall and Margaret Loock Residence Hall were constructed in 1967, and are traditional residence halls; while Regents Hall and Grohmann Tower are arranged apartment style.|$|E
25|$|Drying, if {{carried out}} {{promptly}} after felling of trees, also protects timber against primary decay, fungal stain and attack by {{certain kinds of}} insects. Organisms, which cause decay and stain, generally cannot thrive in timber with a moisture content below 20%. Several, though not all, insect pests can <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> green timber.|$|E

25|$|When the Roman Republic {{was formed}} in 1798 and took over the Papal States, it annulled the {{requirement}} for Jews to <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the ghetto; and a Tree of Liberty was planted in Piazza delle Cinque Scole ("Piazza of the Five Synagogues"). However, when the Papal States were restored in 1799, the ghetto was reestablished and Jews who had left were compelled {{to return to the}} ghetto.|$|E
25|$|The {{immigration}} {{of a group}} of 300 Jews headed by the Tosafists from England and France in 1211 struggled very hard upon arrival in Eretz Israel, as they had no financial support and no prospect of making a living. The vast majority of the settlers were wiped out by the Crusaders, who arrived in 1219, and the few survivors were allowed to <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> Acre. Their descendants blended with the original Jewish residents, called Mustarabim or Maghrebim, but more precisely Mashriqes (Murishkes).|$|E
25|$|When Today debuted, it {{was seen}} <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the Eastern and Central time zones, {{broadcasting}} for three hours each morning but seen for only two hours in each time zone. Since 1958, Today has been tape-delayed for the five other U.S. time zones (Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian). Partly to accommodate host Dave Garroway's declining health, the program ceased live broadcasts {{in the summer of}} 1958, opting instead to broadcast an edition taped the previous afternoon. The experiment, which drew criticism from many sides, ended when John Chancellor replaced Garroway in July 1961.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} {{bettongs}} are extant and two are extinct. Bettongs were endangered because settlers took {{much of their}} habitat, and the foxes they introduced to the continent also killed many of them. At one time, species lived all over Australia. Today, the Tasmanian bettong <b>lives</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> {{the eastern half of}} Tasmania, and the northern bettong <b>lives</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> three isolated populations in northern Queensland.|$|R

25|$|The Ganges river dolphin {{is one of}} {{only five}} true {{freshwater}} dolphins in the world. The other four are the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) of the Yangtze River in China, now likely extinct; the Indus river dolphin of the Indus River in Pakistan; the Amazon river dolphin of the Amazon River in South America; and the Araguaian river dolphin (not considered a separate species until 2014) of the Araguaia–Tocantins basin in Brazil. There are several marine dolphins whose ranges include some freshwater habitats, but these five are the only dolphins who <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> freshwater rivers and lakes.|$|E
25|$|Jewish hermits, {{living in}} a state of celibacy and devoting {{themselves}} to meditation, are still (circa 1906) found among the Falashas. They claim that Aaron the high priest was the first Nazarite who from the time of his consecration separated from his wife to <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the shadow of the tabernacle. Accordingly, they join the monastic order after they have been married and have become fathers of children (Halévy, Travels in Abyssinia, p.230). According to Flad (Abyssinische Juden, pp.32 et seq.), the order founded by Abba Sabra (Halévy, Abba Sura) consists altogether of eunuchs. This would indicate non-Jewish influence, of which the Falashas show many traces.|$|E
25|$|Reef-building or hermatypic corals <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the {{photic zone}} (above 50m), the depth to which {{sufficient}} sunlight penetrates the water, allowing photosynthesis to occur. Coral polyps do not photosynthesize, {{but have a}} symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae of the genus Symbiodinium, {{commonly referred to as}} zooxanthellae. These organisms live within the tissues of polyps and provide organic nutrients that nourish the polyp. Because of this relationship, coral reefs grow much faster in clear water, which admits more sunlight. Without their symbionts, coral growth would be too slow to form significant reef structures. Corals get up to 90% of their nutrients from their symbionts.|$|E

25|$|Sea urchins have conquered most sea habitats, on an {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} depths. Some species, such as Cidaris abyssicola, can live down to several thousands of meters deep. Many genera are totally indentured to the abyssal zone, such as many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, or the strange genus Dermechinus. One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the hadal zone and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E
500|$|The {{classical}} Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as {{the only}} necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy {{to the extent of}} neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the [...] title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word κύων (meaning [...] "dog") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.|$|E
500|$|The intellectuals {{were stuck}} at a bypass; they {{recognized}} the government’s increasing normalization, {{but they were}} unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek’s promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article “Cesky udel” (Our Czech Destiny) in Literarni listy on 19 December. He wrote: [...] "People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting {{that there are not}} enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> illusions of certainty." ...|$|E

500|$|Brachiopods <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the sea. Most species avoid {{locations}} {{with strong}} currents or waves, and typical sites include rocky overhangs, crevices and caves, steep slopes of continental shelves, and in deep ocean floors. However, some articulate species attach to kelp or in exceptionally sheltered sites in intertidal zones. The smallest living brachiopod, Gwynia, {{is only about}} [...] long, and lives in between gravel. Rhynchonelliforms (Articulata excluding Craniida), whose larvae consume only their yolks and settle and develop quickly, specialize in specific areas and form dense populations that can reach thousands per meter. Young adults often attach to the shells of more mature ones. On the other hand, inarticulate brachiopods, whose larva swim {{for up to a}} month before settling, have wide ranges. Members of the discinoid genus Pelagodiscus have a cosmopolitan distribution.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1952, {{after the}} first section of the {{buildings}} was complete, J. M. Richards, the editor of the Architectural Review, said that Nuffield was [...] "a large-scale example of period-style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind". As the site was away from the [...] "ancient colleges" [...] of the city centre and in an area of [...] "undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building", there had been a [...] "rare opportunity" [...] of building something [...] "belonging... to the twentieth century, and of showing that Oxford does not <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the past". He said that the [...] "compromise between contemporary needs and what is imagined to be the English collegiate tradition is quite unworthy of the educational enterprise the new foundation represents". He was, however, [...] "thankful" [...] that the building used smooth-faced stone [...] "in the proper Oxford style" [...] rather than rubble facing, which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford [...] "with extraordinarily unpleasing results".|$|E
2500|$|Gilmor's {{opponents in}} the last three {{election}} cycles prior to his death made an issue of his residence, and many of the condominium's residents claimed they rarely saw him there. Members of the House are constitutionally required to <b>live</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the state they represent, but it has become a strong convention that they live in or close to the district they represent as well. [...] However, Gillmor long insisted that Seneca County (home to both Old Fort and Tiffin) was his true home.|$|E
