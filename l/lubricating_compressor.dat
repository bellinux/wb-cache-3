An example is the requirement for new computer processors. One approach is to use vapour cycle refrigeration circuits with evaporators that have miniaturised heat exchange surfaces.

40|$|The devlopment of {{domestic}} heat pump systems is mainly {{based on the}} use of volumetric oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>compressors.</b> Following the implementation of economizer based rotary compressors, which represented a major improvement step, one major opportunity to improve both efficiency and heat rate, in particular for high temperature lift heat pumps, is to use two stage cycles. However the reliability of those can be strongly impaired by oil migration, resulting in oil level unbalance when using oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>compressors,</b> unless more sophisticated auxiliaries including an oil pump are added. The need for this additional equipment, the requirement of higher vapour velocity for oil return and impediments to the efficiency of enhanced surfaces for heat exchangers are some of the incentives for the development of oil free compressor systems. As high speed bearings and electrical motors are gradually becoming available this open the way to consider the use of low power, compact, oil-free and high speed radial compressors. This paper describes the basic design of a high speed single stage radial compressor for high pressure ratios and a wide flow range aimed for the first stage of a two stage heat pump. A commercially available 3 D viscous code has been applied to calculate the flow field through the impeller and the diffuser. The particular choice of the bearings allows using very small tip clearences resulting in low leakage losses. To complete the design a commercial 3 D Finite Element code has been used for stress prediction {{as well as for the}} calculation of the blade critical frequencies and their corresponding modes. During the design process the impeller blade geometry has been continuously checked for machinability in order to ensure a feasible impeller using conventional 5 axis milling machines.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{details the}} {{development}} and sensitivity analysis of a model to predict the spatial saturation profile in oil mist filters in the air flow direction. Oil-mists are generated by many industrial processes, including engine crankcase ventilation and generation of compressed air by oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>compressors.</b> It is necessary to remove these mists to avoid problems further downstream or to meet health and safety regulations. The most common method for removing such particles from an air stream {{is the use of}} fibrous filters. Such filters operate for almost their entire life in a steady state, in which the saturation becomes independent of time for a constant set of operating conditions. However, in this steady state, the saturation varies spatially within the filter, due to the following effects (Figure 1) : Layer Number Sa tu ra tio...|$|R

50|$|Smaller {{compressors}} {{are often}} splash lubricated - {{the oil is}} splashed around in the crankcase by {{the impact of the}} crankshaft and connecting rods - but larger compressors are likely to have pressurized lubrication using an oil pump which supplies the oil to critical areas through pipes and passages in the castings. Most oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>compressors</b> will have a wet sump {{at the bottom of the}} crankcase, and require the oil level to be within limits indicated by a sight glass or dipstick for proper lubrication. The compressor should also be level within the manufacturer's specification while operating. These constraints ensure that the lubricant is in the right place for either the moving parts to contact it for splash lubrication, or for reliable suction to the oil pump. Failure to comply with these specifications can lead to damage to the compressor due to excessive friction and overheating, and contamination of the breathing air by toxic breakdown products of the lubricants.|$|R

50|$|Oil, {{which must}} be used to <b>lubricate</b> the <b>compressor's</b> {{internal}} parts, can be harmful if it contaminates the breathing gas and is inhaled as a mist. Petroleum-based oils cannot be absorbed and metabolized by the body and will coat the internal surfaces of the lungs, causing a condition known as lipoid pneumonia and leading to asphyxiation and death. For this reason, compressors must be carefully designed and maintained to ensure that oil contamination of the breathing gas is within safe limits. Oils used should {{be approved by the}} compressor manufacturer and rated as safe for breathing air compressors. A range of mineral based and synthetic oils are supplied by several lubricant manufacturers for this application.|$|R
50|$|Rotary-screw {{compressors}} use two meshing helical screws, {{known as}} rotors, to compress the gas. In a dry-running rotary-screw compressor, timing gears {{ensure that the}} male and female rotors maintain precise alignment. In an oil-flooded rotary-screw <b>compressor,</b> <b>lubricating</b> oil bridges the space between the rotors, both providing a hydraulic seal and transferring mechanical energy between the driving and driven rotor. Gas enters at the suction side and moves through the threads as the screws rotate. The meshing rotors force the gas through the compressor, and the gas exits {{at the end of the}} screws.|$|R
50|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is a {{gas that}} {{is present in}} the exhaust gas of internal combustion engines, including those often used to drive compressors. It also comes from the breakdown of <b>lubricating</b> oil when <b>compressors</b> run too hot. CO is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. CO is deadly even in small quantities, because it readily binds with the hemoglobin in red blood cells and thus destroys the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Breathing air compressors must be carefully designed and placed so that the compressor's intake is located in fresh air well away and upstream from any engine exhaust.|$|R
50|$|The {{compressor}} {{and drive}} {{need to be}} qualified {{to work together and}} for dedicated applications.

The inverter frequency drives need to use algorithms developed specifically for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) or for refrigeration. They ensure that the system will run within the application constraints.The drive can also manage other devices such as oil injection valves or multiple compressors. As the compressor rotational speed changes, the amount of refrigerant — and oil — flowing through the compressor increases or decreases.

40|$|Lubricants are {{important}} components {{of almost all}} air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Their primary function is to <b>lubricate</b> the <b>compressor,</b> provide sealing of clearances between low and high pressure sides of the compressor and remove frictional heat. But the lubricant is in contact with refrigerant at all times in the refrigeration cycle and plays a thermo-fluidic role that can impact both system capacity and coefficient of performance (COP). Lubricants can influence capacity by altering the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients, and increasing pressure drop required to maintain set point temperatures. Lubricants can also affect the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. Â Recent research has conclusively demonstrated that the optimization of lubricant/refrigerant properties can provide improvements in energy efficiency and COP. Â Examples of optimization of refrigerant/lubricant properties for improved energy efficiency have been demonstrated for pure refrigerants such as R- 32, R- 744 and R- 290. Â This paper discusses the extension of our previous techniques for refrigerant/lubricant optimization to low global warming potential refrigerant blends; in particular, to mildly flammable alternatives to R- 404 A (GWP= 3952) with GWP 3 ̆c 150.

Leading candidates to replace R- 22 and R- 410 A in air conditioning and heat pump applications include R- 32 (difluoromethane) and a plethora of HFC/hydrofluoro-olefin blends with GWPs in the range of 400 - 650. Considerable data has been generated comparing R- 410 A with various low GWP alternative refrigerants in full system tests. Most notable is the work sponsored by AHRI under the Alternative Refrigerant Evaluation Program (AREP). But these studies have either been refrigerant “drop in” tests to commercial R- 410 A systems or “soft optimized” tests, where minor component modifications were made to better adapt a system to the properties of the new refrigerants. In all cases, the lubricants used for these studies were the commercial polyol ester (POE) lubricants used with R- 410 A. But commercial POE lubricants used today are much less compatible with R- 32 and HFC/HFO blends. There is concern that issues may arise with long term reliability of compressors due to inadequate lubrication, poor oil return to the compressor and undesirable lubricant hold up in the system; problems that would not be observed in the short term capacity and energy efficiency tests. But regardless, there is also interest in understanding if properly optimized lubricants can improve the overall performance of low GWP-based systems. This paper presents the results of a study of the solution phase behavior and lubricating performance of several commercial and new developmental POE lubricants with low GWP R- 410 A replacement refrigerants. The results suggest that POE lubricants used today with R- 410 A may not be acceptable for use with R- 32 or related HFC/HFO blends.

40|$|This report {{described}} the work {{conducted at the}} National Institute of Standards and Technology under an interagency agreement signed in September 1992 between DOE and NIST for 5 years. The interagency agreement envisions continual funding from DOE to support the development of fuel efficient, low emission engine technologies in terms of lubrication, friction, and wear control encountered {{in the development of}} advanced transportation technologies. However, in 1994, the DOE office of transportation technologies was reorganized and the tribology program was dissolved. The work at NIST therefore continued at a low level without further funding from DOE. The work continued to support transportation technologies in the development of fuel efficient, low emission engine development. Under this program, significant {{progress has been made in}} advancing the state of the art of lubrication technology for advanced engine research and development. Some of the highlights are: (1) developed an advanced high temperature liquid lubricant capable of sustaining high temperatures in a prototype heat engine; (2) developed a novel liquid lubricant which potentially could lower the emission of heavy duty diesel engines; (3) developed lubricant chemistries for ceramics used in the heat engines; (4) developed application maps for ceramic lubricant chemistry combinations for design purpose; and (5) developed novel test methods to screen lubricant chemistries for automotive air-conditioning <b>compressors</b> <b>lubricated</b> by R- 134 a (Freon substitute). Most of these findings have been reported to the DOE program office through Argonne National Laboratory who manages the overall program.

Additional reports have also been submitted separately to DOE program managers. These are attached in Appendix B...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSINTEF Energy Research {{have for}} several years worked with a plant concept for small scale LNG {{production}} {{in the range from}} 5 to 20 tonnes per day. This process, called Mini-LNG, is based on mixed refrigerant and standard refrigeration components such as oil <b>lubricated</b> screw <b>compressor</b> and plate heat exchangers. The design has emphasized low costs and high robustness. In this master thesis, written in cooperation with SINTEF, production of LNG at a rate from 20 to 100 tonnes per day has been reviewed. The feed could be for instance associated gas. Focus has been put on evaluating existing processes, both mixed refrigerant and nitrogen expansion. Four criteria have been highlighted as increasingly important namely; operation and reliability, specific power consumption, cost and complexity and production rate. In order to evaluate the thermodynamic efficiency, the most interesting processes were simulated in the program PRO/II. Initial values were gathered from a literature survey. An exergy analysis was made to quantify the losses is each component. The assumptions were feed gas at 40 bar at a Norwegian climate with sea water temperature of 15 &# 176;C. It is not accounted for pressure drop losses in the heat exchangers and other equipment. This is due to uncertainly of two-phase pressure drop modeling and the thought of the simulations only to be considered as a benchmark. A novel LNG process has been proposed, based on the concept of SINTEF Mini-LNG, but with improved efficiency. The novel process includes a phase separator, two turbo compressors and several brazed plate heat exchangers. Through simulations it was calculated that is has lower specific power consumption than existing small scale LNG processes evaluated in this report. The exergy efficiency is over 40 percent, which is considered to be relatively high. At the given conditions this corresponds to specific power consumption slightly above 325 kWh/tonne. As the process is based on simulations, only further work can state if it can be realized. Uncertainty is linked with the size of the plate heat exchangers which may not be available, but perhaps can be tailor-made. The easiest mixed refrigerant process, PRICO, was calculated to have an exergy efficiency of 37 percent vs. 27 percent for the most advanced nitrogen dual expansion process, cLNG. Instability and maldistribution of mixed refrigerant in multichannel heat exchangers is a problem that can obstruct normal operation and reduce the plant efficiency. So called Ledinegg-instability is a problem that leads to uneven distribution of refrigerant in the channels due to several possible flow solutions. This is visualized as an N-shaped curve when plotting pressure drop versus mass flow. Simulation in Aspen Plate+ and S-Plate gave no clear answer to whether this may appear in the plate heat exchangers for the novel process. More work must be done in validating the models used for simulation. The complete evaporation progress has been compared with that of PRICO. The novel process was briefly evaluated for use for liquefaction of associated gas offshore. More work must be done to clarify the area footprint and plant components. It is unlikely to build such as plant on an FPSO unless it is included in a retrofit design. A more probable alternative is to place a plant on small floaters adjacent to existing FPSOs for oil and LPG production. An economic feasibility study must also be made in order to evaluate costs and income for operation after plateau production. </p...|$|R
40|$|In vapor {{compression}} {{cycles of}} {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration systems, {{a small amount of}} the <b>compressor</b> <b>lubricating</b> oil is carried with the refrigerant and it circulates in the system components. In the heat exchangers, oil is a contaminant and it decreases the heat transfer rate and increases the pressure losses: both are unavoidable challenges. Nanolubricants, that is, nanoparticles dispersed in the non-volatile component of a refrigerant and oil mixture and working as thermal energy transport vectors within the mixture, have the potential to overcome these challenges in a cost-neutral manner for both new and retrofitting applications. This papers documents the effects of the nanoparticles thermal conductivity and aspect ratio on the two-phase flow heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop of nanolubricants by experimentally studying two types of nanolubricants. The first type used spherical Alumina (Î³-Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles with 40 nm nominal particle diameter. The second type used ZnO nanoparticles with 20 to 40 nm nominal particle diameter and with an elongated hexagonal wurtzite shape. The experimental results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants increased linearly with the added amount of nanoparticles in POE oil, and Î³-Al 2 O 3 and ZnO based nanolubricants had similar thermal conductivity if the nanoparticle concentration was 10 wt. % and 20 wt. %. However, even when diluted in the liquid phase of the refrigerant R 410 A and POE oil mixture, these two types of nanoparticles provided heat transfer performance that were measurably different from each other during two phase flow boiling inside an horizontal 9. 5 mm micro-fin evaporator tube. Depending on the mass flux, oil concentration, and heat flux, nanolubricants provided either an enhancement or a degradation of the heat transfer coefficients. These results supported the hypothesis that thermal conductivity of the nanolubricants was not the main property responsible for the heat transfer coefficient intensification during flow boiling. The experimental results also suggested that the magnitude of the enhancements of the two phase flow boiling heat transfer coefficient due to the nanoparticles dispersed in the POE oil were depended on the mass flux and shear rates within the liquid phase of the mixture. Interesting, even when high heat transfer coefficients were observed for the nanolubricants, the effect of the nanoparticles on the two phase flow pressure drop of the mixture was negligible. ...|$|R
