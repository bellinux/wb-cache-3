50|$|The {{concept of}} ECLI was first {{launched}} at the Legal Access Conference (Paris, December 2008) and at Jurix Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law in Florence (December 2008). Around the same time, {{the study by}} a task group of the EU Council Working Group on e-Law showed that accessibility of judicial decisions, both at the national and European level, was seriously hampered {{by the lack of}} standardised identifiers and metadata:The task group suggested to establish a voluntary common identification system based on the European Case-Law Identifier (ECLI). ECLI as an identifier would be linked to an index with references. This would enable any citizen or legal practitioner to find any decision to which ECLI has been attributed from any public or private register or database in the EU. In addition a Dublin-core implementation for case-law should be established to facilitate searching case-law in different search engines.Based on the report of this task group, the Council of Ministers agreed on the principles of ECLI and common metadata, and asked the EU Council Working Party on <b>Legal</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> (e-Law) to elaborate the initial work. This continued work resulted in the Council Conclusion inviting the introduction of the European Case Law Identifier (ECLI) and a minimum set of uniform metadata for case law of the European Union., decided upon by the Council of Ministers on 22 December 2010. It was published in the Official Journal of 29 April 2011 (2011/C 127/01).|$|E

40|$|Obligation for telecom {{operators}} to retain traffic and location data for combating crime purposes had been controversial {{ever since the}} adoption of the Data Retention Directive in 2006 because of its inherent negative impact on the fundamental right to privacy and personal data protection. However, the awaited judgment of the CJEU in April this year, which declared the Directive invalid, did not so far resolve the ambiguity of the issue. Namely, having in mind that half a year later, some countries did not amend their national data retention legislations (yet) to comply with the aforementioned CJEU judgment, telecom operators as addresses of this obligation are in uncertain legal situation which could be called “lose-lose” situation. Also, the emphasis from the question of proportionality between data privacy and public security is shifted to the question of existence of valid <b>legal</b> basis for <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> (retaining <b>data</b> and providing them to authorities) in the new legal environment in which national and EU law are still not in compliance. In this paper the author examines the implications of the CJEU judgment to national EU legislation, telecom operators and data subjects, providing comparative analysis of national data retention legislation status in EU member states. The existence of valid <b>legal</b> basis for <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is examined within EU law sources, including within proposed EU General Data Protection Regulation and opinions of the relevant data protection bodies (e. g.

40|$|Moore's law {{was first}} {{postulated}} in 1968, and it loosely {{says that the}} cost of making calculations on a computer falls by 50 % each year. Securities markets are, in essence, a form of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, Moore’s law has driven important changes in those markets over the past forty years.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> complexity, partitionability, {{locality}} and provenance play {{a crucial}} role in the effectiveness of distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Dynamics in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> necessitates effective modeling which allows the understanding and reasoning of the fluidity of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Through virtualization, resources have become scattered, heterogeneous, and dynamic in performance and networking. In this paper, we propose a new distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> model based on automata where <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is modeled as state transformations. This approach falls within a category of declarative concurrent paradigms which are fundamentally different than imperative approaches in that communication and function order are not explicitly modeled. This allows an abstraction of concurrency and thus suited for distributed systems. Automata give us a way to formally describe <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> independent from underlying processes while also providing routing information to route data based on its current state in a P 2 P fashion around networks of distributed processing nodes. Through an implementation, named Pumpkin, of the model we capture the automata schema and routing table into a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> protocol and show how globally distributed resources can be brought together in a collaborative way to form a <b>processing</b> plane where <b>data</b> objects are self-routable on the plane...|$|R
