50|$|A {{line level}} is a level {{designed}} {{to hang on}} a builder's <b>string</b> <b>line.</b> The body of the level incorporates small hooks {{to allow it to}} attach and hang from the <b>string</b> <b>line.</b> The body is lightweight, so as not to weigh down the <b>string</b> <b>line,</b> it is also small in size as the <b>string</b> <b>line</b> in effect becomes the body; when the level is hung {{in the center of the}} string, each leg of the <b>string</b> <b>line</b> extends the level's plane.|$|R
50|$|A rope is a {{group of}} yarns, plies, fibers or strands that are twisted or braided {{together}} into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting, but are too flexible to provide compressive strength. As a result, they cannot be used for pushing or similar compressive applications. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, <b>line,</b> <b>string,</b> and twine. Fiber rope is made from fiber, whereas wire rope is made from wire.|$|E

50|$|TopoJSON is an {{extension}} of GeoJSON that encodes topology. Rather than representing geometries discretely, geometries in TopoJSON files are stitched together from shared line segments called arcs. Arcs are sequences of points, while <b>line</b> <b>strings</b> and polygons are defined as sequences of arcs. Each arc is defined only once, but can be referenced several times by different shapes, thus reducing redundancy and decreasing the file size. In addition, TopoJSON facilitates applications that use topology, such as topology-preserving shape simplification, automatic map coloring, and cartograms.|$|R

Initially, strokes are grouped into text line strings according to off-stroke distances. Each text <b>line</b> <b>string</b> is segmented into text lines by dynamic programming (DP) optimizing a cost function trained by the minimum classification error (MCE) method. Over-segmented text lines are then merged with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for making merge/non-merge decisions, and last, a spatial merge module corrects the segmentation errors caused by delayed strokes. In experiments on the TUAT Kondate database, the proposed approach achieves the Entity Detection Metric (EDM) rate of 0. 8816, the Edit-Distance Rate (EDR) of 0. 1234, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a generalization of the Nielsen-Olesen ansatz, in an abelian-Higgs model with externally coupled charge, which describes strings with twisted magnetic flux {{lines in the}} vortex core. The solution does not possess cylindrical symmetry, {{which leads to the}} existence of components of conserved momentum, both around the core-axis and {{along the length of the}} string. In addition, we {{consider a}} model of F-strings with rotating, geodesic windings in the compact space of the Klebanov-Strassler geometry and determine matching conditions which ensure energy and momentum conservation when loops chop off from the long-string network. We find that the expressions for the constants of motion, which determine the macroscopic string dynamics, can be made to coincide with those for the twisted flux <b>line</b> <b>string,</b> suggesting that extra-dimensional effects for F-strings may be mimicked by field- theoretic structure in topological defects.

30|$|The {{following}} {{procedure was}} adopted to interpret error-aware geospatial data files and build conduit (e.g. pipe) {{models in the}} augmented space. First, the spatial and attribute information of pipelines was extracted by parsing the data model. For example, the geographical location of pipelines is recorded under the Geometry element as “LineString”. A cursor was designed to iterate through the XML file, locate “LineString” elements, and extract the geographical locations. Second, consecutive vertices within one “LineString” were converted from the geographical coordinate to the local coordinate {{in order to raise}} computational efficiency during the registration routine. The first vertex on the <b>line</b> <b>string</b> was chosen as the origin of the local coordinate system, and the local coordinates of the remaining vertices were determined by calculating the relative 3 D vector between the rest of the vertices and the first one, using the Vincenty algorithm (Vincenty 1975). In order to save memory, a unit cylinder is shared by all pipe segments as primitive geometry upon which the transformation matrix is built.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that patterns {{formed by the}} current-current correlation function are landmarks which indicate that spin bipolarons form in doped antiferromagnets. Holes which constitute a spin bipolaron reside {{at opposite ends of}} a <b>line</b> (<b>string)</b> formed by the defects in the antiferromagnetic spin background. The string is relatively highly mobile, because the motion of a hole at its end does not raise extensively the number of defects, provided that the hole {{at the other end of}} the line follows along the same track. Appropriate coherent combinations of string states realize some irreducible representations of the point group C_ 4 v. Creep of strings favors d- and p-wave states. Some more subtle processes decide the symmetry of pairing. The pattern of the current correlation function, that defines the structure of flux, emerges from motion of holes at string ends and coherence factors with which string states appear in the wave function of the bound state. Condensation of bipolarons and phase coherence between them puts to infinity the correlation length of the current correlation function and establishes the flux in the system.

40|$|Geo data is an {{important}} foundation for any type of location-based service, but geo data often is expensive or distribution is limited by certain license restrictions. As a solution, open projects collect geo data from individuals and publish these data under a public licence. As a major drawback, the correction and integration of collected data is difficult and cost-intensive. This paper describes an approach to automatically derive linear map data (roads, paths, highways etc.) from GPS logs. People just have to passively carry inexpensive GPS loggers whenever they drive or walk outdoors. The raw GPS logs then are automatically merged to a map. The approach contains error correction and sensor data fusion mechanisms. Our algorithm {{takes into account the}} specific measurement characteristic of GPS and is based on a probabilistic model. It performs two steps: first, track parts that represent the same paths are identified. Second, identifiable parts are fused to a single path, considering the Gaussian distribution of the input measurements. We verified the approach with approx. 200 000 measurements in the area of Nuremberg that represents approx. 6 000 km driving distance. We show that an automatic processing of GPS logs to produce a road map is effectively possible. 2 Extracting <b>line</b> <b>string</b> features from GPS log...|$|E
