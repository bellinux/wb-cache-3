25|$|Large caverns of a 160m2 {{cross section}} were dug for stations, {{creating}} large open spaces, {{as opposed to}} the traditional sets of linked tunnels. For example, the ticket line is in the same space as the trains, for this purpose steel structures called 'mezzanines' have been built over the tracks. Trains are fully accessible by <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators.</b> Materials such as steel and concrete have been used throughout.|$|E
25|$|The {{system has}} also been criticised for {{improper}} maintenance of stations and the infrastructure and on the windshields of cars parked below the stations, vandalism at several stations, seepage of rainwater through holes in the roofs of stations non-functional station amenities such as <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators,</b> Station staff have expressed their concern over the Chennai MRTS's safety issues. and conducting various thefts In a recent bid to provide improve {{the security of the}} passengers using the network, it has been decided that the MRTS stations would have a single entry and exit point as it has been difficult for the RPF personnel to monitor multiple gates at the same time. According to sources, there is a 20% shortage in the strength of the railway protection force in MRTS stations.|$|E
50|$|Accessibility on the T {{generally}} {{means that}} {{some combination of}} elevators and wheelchair ramps connect the street and station platform. The MBTA provides recorded elevator, wheelchair <b>lift,</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalator</b> status updates by telephone.|$|R

25|$|The {{ticket hall}} for the railway station opens off {{the centre of}} {{eastern side of the}} concourse, and in turn gives access via ticket {{barriers}} to a pedestrian overbridge with stairs and lifts down to the railway platforms. A second concourse opens off the main concourse {{at the southern end of}} its eastern side, and this runs parallel and to the south of the platforms, giving access by stairs, <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators</b> to the tram stop, the station car park, taxi rank, vehicular pick-up and drop-off points and Queen Street. The tram stop spans the station from north to south to the east of the main entrance, at a higher level than the concourse, and to the east of that a second footbridge links the platforms and carries the previously referred to footpath 28.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the station}} and tracks are level with the ground, the {{concourse}} is actually below street level despite being open-air in nature. A row of ticket barriers with ticket windows allows passengers access to the concourse which features stairs, <b>lifts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators</b> to access the platforms. The station fulfills Sydney Trains' Easy Access criteria.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the first edition of the European standard EN 81 - 1 : 1977 (introduced in the UK as BS 5655 - 1 : 1979) the UK Lift Industry needed a wide ranging re-education of its workforce in both the Design and Field service. The need to update the workforce was recognised by the then National Association of Lift Makers (NALM), now the <b>Lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>Escalator</b> Industry Association (LEIA www. leia. co. uk). They also recognised that due to the wide geographic dispersion of potential students, distance learning was possibly the best mechanism for delivery...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an Anglo-German {{research}} project of two research groups in both countries. It {{is based on}} data collected by qualitative research in the three largest multinational corporations (MNCs) in the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalator</b> industry. The headquarters (HQs) of the three corporations are based in the United States, Finland and Germany, respectively, and all three MNCs each have subsidiaries in Germany and Britain. Our main objects of analysis were change processes in the work systems of these three MNCs. We chose the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalator</b> industry as an example because it has been characterized by strong concentration processes during the last 10 years. Most of these corporations have grown by acquisition and there are strong tendencies in the market towards standardized, globally uniform products. National cultures and institutions, first of all play a role on the HQ level. Important areas were the standardization of products and production technology, the design of management systems and location and relocation decisions for R&D and manufacturing. Second, MNCs take differences in national cultures into account and deliberately "use" them in allocating resources and investment within the multinational group. National cultures and institutions massively shape the very formulation of manufacturing strategies within the multinational groups, as well as the R&D strategies [...] a particular important field in an industry still relying heavily on small-batch and unit production. National cultures also {{play a significant role in}} implementing the global strategies of MNCs in different host countries. Our data reveal striking differences on this level.

50|$|The {{infrastructure}} {{surrounding the}} building {{was expected to be}} completed in 2007. It includes a new dual carriageway road connecting the terminal to the existing airport road, and landscaping including an artificial lake and a fountain. Terminal 2 is designed with special attention to disabled passengers. Their access to the different terminal levels and the multi-storey car park is facilitated via <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{the station}} was {{expanded}} to include three through tracks, 12-14, and a parking garage was built. This was intended to be followed by a redesign of the area immediately south of the station, but this has still not been implemented. Two platforms were extended and modernised for Karlsruhe’s inclusion in the Intercity-Express network and the access stairs were complemented with <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators.</b>|$|E
50|$|From January 2003 until May 2011 the London Underground {{operated}} a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), whereby the infrastructure assets were maintained by private companies {{but it was}} {{owned and operated by}} London Underground (LU), part of TfL. Tube Lines had a 30-year contract for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, and remains responsible for over 200 miles of track, 255 trains, 100 stations, and over 2,500 bridges, <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalators.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the Ordinance, {{building}} services installations including electrical, air-conditioning, lighting <b>and</b> <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>escalator</b> installations in newly constructed buildings {{are required to}} meet the minimum energy efficiency standards and requirements as specified in the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation. Existing buildings will also be required {{to comply with the}} requirement when undergoing major retrofitting works. The standards stipulated in the Code, which was published in February 2012 are more stringent than those in the last version promulgated in 2007, which have been implemented on a voluntary basis. Most of the new standards are comparable to those adopted in the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, while some standards are not specified in overseas jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|The Swanston Street {{concourse}} was {{altered in}} the early 2000s when redevelopment works were carried out at the adjacent Melbourne Central Shopping Centre. Inside the ticket barriers there are toilets, <b>and</b> two <b>lifts</b> <b>and</b> five <b>escalators</b> going to the platforms. Outside is a food court, an exit to La Trobe Street and Level LG of the shopping centre (which passes under Little Lonsdale Street). There is also a <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> four <b>escalators</b> to the shopping centre level above. On the next level up (Level G) there is access to Little Lonsdale and La Trobe Streets via the shopping centre. Access to Swanston Street is via three escalators rising another floor (or the lift to level 1 and a 70m walk), and a walk through the shopping centre past the shot tower.|$|R
