40|$|In {{the port}} {{injected}} Spark Ignition (SI) engine, {{the single greatest}} part <b>load</b> efficiency <b>reducing</b> <b>factor</b> are energy losses over the throttle valve. The need for this throttle valve arises {{from the fact that}} engine power is controlled by the amount of air in the cylinders, since combustion occurs stoichiometrically in this type of engine. In WEDACS (Waste Energy Driven Air Conditioning System), a technology patented by the Eindhoven University of Technology, the throttle valve is replaced by a turbine-generator combination. The turbine is used to control engine power. Throttling losses are recovered by the turbine and converted to electrical energy. Additionally, when air expands in the turbine, its temperature decreases and {{it can be used to}} cool air conditioning fluid. As a result, load of the alternator and air conditioning compressor on the engine is decreased or even eliminated, which increases overall engine efficiency. A model and validating experiment both indicate throttle losses of about 1. 25 kW in a modern 2 liter engine at common operating points. On the same engine in a different operating point, an automotive turbocharger is used in another experiment to recover 1. 1 kW of these throttling losses. Based on these measurements, a simulated MVEG-A drive cycle predicts a fuel efficiency improvement of 15 to 19 %...|$|R

50|$|The airline {{made the}} {{decision}} to introduce jet aircraft in early 2011 and 2 Avro RJ85 aircraft (both ex Lufthansa Cityline airframes) joined the fleet. The first was delivered from the UK in June 2011 (registered as JU-9909) with the second arriving in September 2011 (JU-9915). The aircraft were primarily destined to be used on charter flying to mining sites in the Gobi desert and were modified for operations on gravel runways. Both Avros remain in service although only one is now dedicated to the Ulaanbaatar - Oyut Tolgoi route. The aircraft were also used on services {{to the west of the}} country (Khovd, Ulaangom and Ulgii) but <b>reducing</b> <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> and unrealistic fare structures made the routes uneconomic for the RJs to operate. Consequently, the airline now looked to the Bombardier Dash8-Q400 to restore its economic fortunes on its longer range domestic routes while the Avros continue to provide the lift capacity required by the mining companies. The Q400s had their Danish registration cancelled by 2015 (OY-YAG repainted and now operates as S2-AGW for US-Bangla Airlines).|$|R

The effectiveness of o,o-FeEDDHA is potentially compromised by the displacement of Fe from FeEDDHA by Cu. The actual impact of Cu competition is codetermined by the kinetics of the displacement reaction. In this study, the influence of soil parameters on the displacement kinetics has been examined in goethite suspensions. The displacement reaction predominantly takes place on the reactive surface rather than in solution. The {{rate at which the}} o,o-FeEDDHA concentration declined depended on the available reactive surface area, the Cu loading, and the FeEDDHA <b>loading.</b> Soil <b>factors</b> <b>reducing</b> FeEDDHA adsorption (high ionic strength, humic acid adsorption onto the goethite surface, and monovalent instead of divalent cations in the electrolyte) decreased the displacement rate.

40|$|AbstractTo provide {{additional}} wastewater capacity and redundancy in South Chandler, Arizona, a new 28 ” High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) force main was installed from the upsized Kyrene Lift Station three miles east to tie into an existing 66 ” transmission sewer line. The force main was installed under the State Route Loop 202 (SR 202 L) freeway through existing 48 ” steel casings constructed ten years prior. Additionally, the force main was constructed {{through a narrow}} Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) corridor, which required clearance from existing utilities, including overhead 69 kV power poles. Two locations required innovative solutions to both access the existing sleeves and cross the transmission power pole foundations: 1) crossing of the 69 kV power pole required detailed slope stability analysis and location specific trench backfilling; and 2) access to the existing 48 ” was within 15 feet of an existing ADOT sound wall. Various alternatives for access were analyzed in this paper including temporary shoring, sheet pile installation, and full wall replacement and reconstructing on drilled shafts.

This was achieved by the optimisation of the electrochromic device materials (electrochromic, ion storage, protective layers, transparent conductors and polymer electrolytes) and by the refinement of a sealing method for evacuated glazing. Electrochromic evacuated glazing prototypes with dimensions up to 40 cm × 40 cm have been fabricated using vacuum techniques and chemical methods. The prototypes exhibit excellent optical and thermal performance, with a contrast ratio up to 1 : 32 (visible dynamic transmittance range Tlum,bleached = 63 % and Tlum,colored = 2 %), coloration efficiency up to 92 cm 2 /C and mid-pane U-values as low as 0. 86 W m− 2 K− 1.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} an efficient and pragmatic approach for design and optimization of <b>load</b> <b>reducing</b> controllers for wind turbines. <b>Load</b> <b>reducing</b> control means that, besides the classical rotor speed control loop, load or oscillation signals are included as additional input signals into the controller. Thereby, a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) control design problem arises. While the basic concepts of <b>load</b> <b>reducing</b> control and the achievable load reductions are essentially known from literature and will be summarized, in this work, additional focus is put on the achievable cost reductions. The rating of tower and rotor blades and the different strategies for reducing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) are discussed. It is motivated that control strategies, aiming at increasing the annual energy production or extending the operational lifetime of the turbine, {{may be more effective}} than such reducing the cost of structural components. Special attention is given to the effects of <b>load</b> <b>reducing</b> pitch control on the rating of the pitch actuation system. Detailed methods for evaluating the pitch system loading for small cyclic movements are presented and compared to standard approaches. The design of <b>load</b> <b>reducing</b> pitch controllers is carried out in the frequency domain. This makes sense, because information on the main disturbance, the turbulence of the wind field, can only be given in a statistical sense, in form of frequency spectra. It is shown that common control objectives, as fatigue loads for tower and blades and the maximum expected value of rotor speed deviations, can be evaluated in the frequency domain, based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the considered signals. If the turbine behavior can be approximated by linear models, these PSDs can be calculated very efficiently without the need for comprehensive time domain simulations. For this controller evaluation, np periodic components due to tower shadow and spatially distributed turbulence need {{to be included in the}} spectra of the output signals. This is achieved by combining the linear wind turbine models with a CPSD matrix of the output disturbances, derived from measurements or nonlinear simulations of a reference configuration. For the actual control design, different approaches based on H∞ or H 2 norm minimization are investigated. These frequency domain approaches are compatible to the controller evaluation based on PSD. It is motivated that the primary use of these multivariable control design approaches is not to find an optimum controller, but to assure the closed loop stability and to handle the couplings between different control loops. By using parametric weighting functions, higher level control design parameters can be introduced, having a more direct relation to performance and robustness properties than parameters of classical controller structures. The actual H∞/H 2 controller calculations are thus embedded in a higher level controller tuning scheme, which makes it easier to find the limits of the feasible design region and to decide on a good controller finally. Exemplarily, this hierarchical control design / controller tuning approach is demonstrated for two different types of <b>load</b> <b>reducing</b> pitch controllers: (1) a combined Rotor Speed / Active Tower Damping Controller and (2) an Individual Pitch Controller...|$|R
