Only their duration is about 103 - 104 longer in plants. The constant characterizing the rate of accommodation was calculated. A <b>limiting</b> <b>threshold</b> value was found beyond which excitation occurs, irrespective of the rate of stimulus rise (voltage gradient). The accommodation rate is approximately constant, whereas the range of accommodation varies and is dependent on the difference between the rheobase value and the <b>limiting</b> <b>threshold</b> value.

The design of theses lanthanide Pcs {{takes the form}} of mononuclear, binuclear, trinuclear, bis- and tris(phthalocyanines). Nanomaterials such as zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene oxide nanosheets (GONS) (oxidized and reduced) were employed for covalent linkage to mono- and binuclear phthalocyanines as conjugates. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize ZnO NPs, MWCNTs and GONS alone and when linked to lanthanide Pcs. Lanthanide Pcs alone and when linked to ZnO NPs, MWCNTs and GONS where embedded in polymers such as poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly (bisphenol A carbonate) (PBC) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) for thin film preparation.
