5000|$|Electric strikes {{can allow}} {{mechanical}} free egress: a departing person operates the lockset {{in the door}}, not the electric strike in the door frame. Electric strikes can also be either [...] "fail unlocked" [...] (except in Fire Listed Doors, as they must remain latched when power is not present), or the more-secure [...] "fail locked" [...] design. Electric strikes are easier to attack than a mag lock. It is simple to lever the door open at the strike, as often there is an increased gap between the strike and the door latch. <b>Latch</b> <b>guard</b> plates are often used to cover this gap.|$|E
40|$|The key to any {{sustainable}} {{presence in}} space {{is the ability}} to manufacture necessary tools, parts, structures, spares, etc. in situ and on demand. Cost, volume, and up-mass constraints prohibit launching everything needed for long-duration or long-distance missions from Earth, including spare parts and replacement systems. There are many benefits to building items as-needed in situ using computer aided drafting (CAD) models and additive manufacturing technology: (1) Cost, up-mass, and volume savings for launch due to the ability to manufacture specific parts when needed. (2) CAD models can be generated on Earth and transmitted to the station or spacecraft, or they can be designed in situ for any task. Thus, multiple people in many locations can work on a single problem. (3) Items can be produced that will enhance the safety of crew and vehicles (e. g., <b>latches</b> or <b>guards).</b> (4) Items can be produced on-demand in a small amount of time (i. e., hours or days) compared to traditional manufacturing methods and, therefore, would not require the lengthy amount of time needed to machine the part from a solid block of material nor the wait time required if the part had to be launched from Earth. (5) Used and obsolete parts can be recycled into powder or wire feedstock for use in later manufacturing. (6) Ultimately, the ability to produce items as-needed will reduce mission risk, as one will have everything they need to fix a broken system or fashion a new part making it available on a more timely basis...|$|R
