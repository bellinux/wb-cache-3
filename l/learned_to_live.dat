5|$|In 1992, {{three years}} after his Oscar win, The Last of the Mohicans was released. Day-Lewis's {{character}} research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting and fishing. Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills and {{learned how to make}} canoes. He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals.|$|E

25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since {{it was only a}} few months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E

25|$|Gilliam {{developed}} {{the story and}} wrote {{the first draft of}} the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. But then when the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson. He has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn’t think much of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. Brazil was developed under the titles The Ministry and 1984 ½, the latter a nod not only to Orwell's original Nineteen Eighty-Four but also to 8½ by Federico Fellini, a director whom Gilliam often cites as one of the defining influences on his visual style when directing. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including The Ministry of Torture, How I <b>Learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> with the System—So Far, and So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks, before settling with Brazil relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.|$|E
25|$|The Ohmu {{and other}} forest insects {{respond to this}} {{development}} and sacrifice themselves to pacify {{the expansion of the}} mold, which is beyond human control. Nausicaä resigns herself to joining in their fate. However, one of the Ohmu encapsulates her inside itself in a protective serum, allowing her to survive the mold. She is recovered by her companions, people she met after leaving the Valley and who have joined her on her quest for a peaceful coexistence. The fact that the mold can be manipulated and used as a weapon disturbs Nausicaä. Her treks into the forest have already taught her that the Sea of Corruption is actually purifying the polluted land. The Forest People, humans who have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in harmony with the Sea of Corruption, confirm this is the purpose of the Sea of Corruption and one of them shows Nausicaä a vision of the restored Earth {{at the center of the}} forest. Nausicaä travels deeper into Dorok territory, where her coming has long been prophesied, to seek those responsible for manipulating the mold. There, she encounters a dormant God Warrior who, upon activation, assumes she is his mother and places his destructive powers at her disposal. Faced with this power and its single minded and childlike visions of the world, she engages the creature, names him and persuades him to travel with her to Shuwa, the Holy City of the Doroks.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the name of José Palacios, who, here as with the {{historical}} figure of the same name, is Bolívar's [...] "long-serving mayordomo". As literary critic Seymour Menton observes, Palacios's [...] "total identification with Bolívar constitutes the novel's frame". Palacios constantly waits on the General, and at certain times he alone is allowed in the General's room. He has <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with his master's unpredictability and does not presume to read his thoughts. Simultaneously, however, [...] Palacios is also the General's closest confidante, the person best able to read his moods and share in his emotions. Born a slave, the character is six years younger than the General, and has spent his entire life in his service. Throughout the novel, Palacios provides the General with clarifications or reminders of dates and events during the General's time of disillusion. According to one critic, Palacios's ability to recall past events in Bolívar's life is essential for García Márquez's recreation of the character, as it allows the Bolívar of official history to be placed within the context of everyday life.|$|E

Brailsford wrote in 1913, [...] "She was a vulgar and worldly woman, thoroughly feminine, and rather inclined to boast of her total ignorance of philosophy." [...] While Fanny eventually <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with Clairmont, Mary's relationship with her stepmother was tense.

They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful. If not, I accept what the universe has intended for me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{stressed}} {{that he had}} come to abolish Kali Yukam [...] and to usher in an age of Dharma Yukam, when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’ was a constant refrain in his teachings. People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of Kali by transforming themselves to be 'people of Dharma Yukam' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said, [...] ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ [...] [...] He said when people grew out of kalimayai, Dharma Yukam would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as Dharma Raja, the king of Dharma Yukam.|$|E

2500|$|To some observers, New York, {{with its}} large {{immigrant}} population, seems {{more of an}} international city than something specifically [...] "American". But to others, the city's very openness to newcomers makes it the archetype of a [...] "nation of immigrants". The term [...] "melting pot" [...] derives from the play The Melting Pot, by Israel Zangwill, who in 1908 adapted Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to a setting in the Lower East Side, where droves of immigrants from diverse European nations in the early 1900s <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together in tenements and row houses for the first time. In 2000, 36% of the city's population was foreign-born. Among American cities this proportion was higher only in Los Angeles and Miami. While the immigrant communities in those cities are dominated by a few nationalities, in New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The seven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, [...] Russia, Italy, Poland and India.|$|E
2500|$|In 1532, Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán {{entered the}} Sierra Gorda and conquered it {{but did not}} hold it. From that time until the 18th century, {{there had been a}} number of {{missions}} established by the Franciscans and the Augustinians, but these missions were either destroyed by the Chichimecas or the population would flee from them and move into more inaccessible mountains and canyons. The first Spanish population in the Arroyo Seco area was in San Nicolás Concá, established as an encomienda under Pedro Guzmán between 1533 and 1538. This territory extended over much of the Sierra Gorda and into what is now San Luis Potosí. In 1587, Concá and Jalpan had missions established in them by the Augustinians from Xilitla. [...] In 1601, friar Lucas de los Ángeles from the Xichú monastery preached in the area with limited success. In 1609, viceroy Luis de Velasco ordered that the Franciscans leave missionary work to the Augustinians, including the Arroyo Seco area. However, Franciscans from Michoacán stayed and worked with the Augustinians. Those who lasted longest in the area were those who learned the Pame language and <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with Pame customs.|$|E
2500|$|When Benny {{moved to}} television, audiences {{learned that his}} verbal talent was matched by his {{controlled}} repertory of dead-pan facial expressions and gesture. The program {{was similar to the}} radio show (several of the radio scripts were recycled for television, as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television), but with the addition of visual gags. Lucky Strike was the sponsor. Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience, which he regarded as essential to timing of the material. As in other TV comedy shows, canned laughter was sometimes added to [...] "sweeten" [...] the soundtrack, as when the studio audience missed some close-up comedy because of cameras or microphones in their way. The television viewers <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> without Mary Livingstone, who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright. Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show. [...] In fact, {{for the last few years}} of the radio show, she pre-recorded her lines and Jack and Mary's daughter, Joan, stood in for the live taping, with Mary's lines later edited into the tape replacing Joan's before broadcast. [...] Mary Livingstone finally retired from show business permanently in 1958, as her friend Gracie Allen had done.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, {{sculptor}} Robert Arneson {{was commissioned}} {{to create a}} monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. [...] The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's expressionistic style and was considered acceptable by San Francisco's Art Commission. [...] However, the pedestal which the former Mayor's head rested on was deemed inappropriate and Arneson was asked to change it. At issue were references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the [...] "Twinkie Defense", the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein's mayoral succession that Arneson had included {{on the surface of}} the pedestal. [...] Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, returned the commission, and later resold the sculpture. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that [...] "Arneson's mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician." [...] In 1994 a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: [...] "San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> together with one another, to respect each other, and to work with each other for the future of their community. That's the strength and beauty of this city – it's the reason why the citizens who live here are the luckiest people in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chester's {{character}} had no surname until Baer ad libbed [...] "Proudfoot" [...] {{during an}} early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by [...] "Townsman". Again, Conrad's {{sense of what}} the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as [...] "W" [...] in the June 15, 1958 episode [...] "Old Flame", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode [...] "Marshal Proudfoot", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's [...] "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode [...] "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode [...] "Hank Prine" [...] (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his [...] "deputy" [...] stating [...] "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch - McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the limp and virtually forget it.|$|E
