In the episode 'Mrs Dribelle's Big Day' he asks her to marry him, {{with the intention of}} getting his hands on her money. After Mrs Dribelle discovers his plan, she throws him out of the flat. A year later when Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford at the beginning of Series 8 to run a hotel, they are horrified to discover that Mr Smart is their next door neighbour once again. He is also running a hotel, but never seems to have any guests and is always trying to steal Bodger's or trying to outshine his rival in every despicable way possible.

500|$|In 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary. However, the Lakers sued {{their former}} star and {{successfully}} {{prevented him from}} actually playing, because he still owed them the option year of his contract. Barred from playing, Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck, who recalled: [...] "Chamberlain... has a great feel for pro basketball... the day-to-day things that {{are an important part}} of basketball... just bored him. He did not have the patience." [...] The players were split on Chamberlain, who was seen as competent, but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who <b>Lives</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Door</b> than with coaching. [...] He once skipped a game to sign autographs for the book. In his single season as a coach, the Conquistadors went a mediocre 37–47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals. However, Chamberlain was not pleased by the Qs' meager attendance: crowds averaged 1,843, just over half of the Qs' small San Diego 3,200-seat sports arena. After the season, Chamberlain retired from professional basketball.|$|E

2500|$|Peanuts {{had several}} {{recurring}} characters that were actually absent from view. Some, {{such as the}} Great Pumpkin or Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron), were merely figments of the cast's imaginations.

Adult figures only appeared in the strip during a four-week Sunday-comic sequence in 1954 in which Lucy plays in an amateur golf tournament, with Charlie Brown [...] "coaching" [...] her. At no time, however, were any adult faces seen (it was also in this story that Lucy's family name, [...] "van Pelt", was first revealed.)
