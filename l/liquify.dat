25|$|In {{commerce}} and manufacturing, {{there are many}} uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to <b>liquify</b> gases - oxygen, nitrogen, propane and methane, for example. In compressed air purification, {{it is used to}} condense water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a high octane gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.|$|E
25|$|Often {{the making}} of conserves can be trickier than making a {{standard}} jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for {{just enough time to}} allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and <b>liquify.</b> This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. Currants and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquified</b> gas (sometimes {{referred}} to as liquid gas) is a gas that {{has been turned into}} a liquid by cooling or compressing it. Examples of <b>liquified</b> gases include liquid air, liquefied natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas.|$|R

25|$|Many gases can be {{liquefied}} by cooling, producing liquids such as liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, {{liquid hydrogen}} and liquid helium. Not all gases can be <b>liquified</b> at atmospheric pressure, for example carbon dioxide {{can only be}} <b>liquified</b> at pressures above 5.1 atm.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} liquids, honey has very poor thermal conductivity, {{taking a long}} time to reach thermal equilibrium. Melting {{crystallized}} honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot, or if it is not evenly distributed. However, honey takes substantially longer to <b>liquify</b> when just above the melting point than at elevated temperatures. Melting 20kg of crystallized honey, at , can take up to 24 hours, while 50kg may take twice as long. These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at [...] However, many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating, changing the flavor, aroma, or other properties, so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time.|$|E
6000|$|Prof. Andrews {{has shown}} that for each kind of gaseous matter there is a {{temperature}} above which no amount of pressure can cause liquefaction. The remark, made a priori in the above extract, [...] "that if, under increasing pressure, a gas retains all the heat evolved, its resisting force is absolutely unlimited", harmonizes with the inductively-reached result that if the temperature is not lowered to its [...] "critical point" [...] a gas does not <b>liquify,</b> however great the force applied. At the same time Prof. Andrews' experiments imply that, supposing the temperature to be lowered to {{the point at which}} liquefaction becomes possible, then liquefaction will take place where there is first reached the required pressure.

"But what," [...] {{it may be}} asked, [...] "will {{become of}} this gaseous nucleus [...] when exposed to the {{enormous}} gravitative pressure of a shell some [...] thousands of miles thick? How can aeriform matter withstand such a [...] pressure?" [...] Very readily. It has been proved that, even when the [...] heat generated by compression is allowed to escape, some gases [...] remain uncondensible by any force we can produce. An unsuccessful [...] attempt lately made in Vienna to <b>liquify</b> oxygen, clearly shows this [...] enormous resistance. The steel piston employed was literally [...] shortened by the pressure used; and yet the gas remained [...] unliquified! If, then, the expansive force is thus immense when the [...] heat evolved is dissipated, what must it be when that heat is in [...] great measure detained, {{as in the case}} we are considering? Indeed [...] the experiences of M. Cagniard de Latour have shown that gases may, [...] under pressure, acquire the density of liquids while retaining the [...] aeriform state, provided the temperature continues extremely high. [...] In such a case, every addition to the heat is an addition to the [...] repulsive power of the atoms: the increased pressure itself [...] generates an increased ability to resist; and this remains true to [...] whatever extent the compression is carried. Indeed it is a [...] corollary from the persistence of force that if, under increasing [...] pressure, a gas retains all the heat evolved, its resisting force [...] is absolutely unlimited. Hence the internal planetary structure [...] we have described is as physically stable a one as that commonly [...] assumed." ...|$|E
