50|$|The site in Dillingen/Danube {{was founded}} in 1953. The 1650 square meters productionhall was {{constructed}} in 2007 and contains two turning and milling machines, which are adapted to RÖHM’s special requirements. The machines enabled the processing of parts of up to four meters in diameter and 25 tons in weight. Due to a net weight of 108 tons the machine required a foundation of 180 tons of iron and steel. The Dillingen site mainly produces <b>lathe</b> <b>chucks,</b> machine vices and special clamping equipment for turning and milling machinery {{as well as for}} machining centres.|$|R

50|$|Simon Fairman (1792-1857) of West Stafford, Connecticut, is {{credited}} as having invented the scroll-type <b>lathe</b> <b>chuck</b> in 1830; his son-in-law, Austin F.

5000|$|RÖHM [...] is a German {{chucking}} tool manufacturer. It {{was founded in}} 1909 by Heinrich Röhm. Its headquarters is in Sontheim/Brenz Germany. RÖHM’s range of products includes drill chucks, live centers, face drivers, <b>lathe</b> <b>chucks</b> and independent chucks as well as vices, gripping technology, power chuck technology, mandrels and tool clamping systems. RÖHM currently counts approximately 1500 employees. The company’s products offer solutions especially for the automobile industry, engineering, the energy sector, rail vehicles and aerospace. From the 1950s until 2010, they also manufactured a line of inexpensive firearms under the Röhm Gesellschaft (RG) division. In 2010, RG was sold to Umarex.|$|R
25|$|The 1921 {{edition of}} the ASME {{mechanical}} catalog and directory showed that J offered several models of Hartness flat turret <b>lathe,</b> an automatic <b>chucking</b> <b>lathe,</b> an automatic die, a screw-thread comparator, and the Fay automatic lathe. J had offices in Springfield, Vermont, San Francisco, California, and London, England, plus agents in five other countries.|$|R
50|$|The {{faceplate}} was the {{ancestor of}} <b>lathe</b> <b>chucks,</b> {{an arrangement of}} three or more adjustable 'dogs' bolted to the faceplate providing a primitive chuck arrangement. The smaller plate in the upper photo is specifically a 'dog face' with slots intended to hold a bent tail dog while the work itself was supported on centers. The larger plate to the right simply provides {{a variety of ways}} by which work can be bolted or clamped to the plate. The slotted plate on the lower photo accepts wedged holders which can be used to fasten the work to the plate. The plates were expendibles, so it was not unusual as shown in both photos for a machinist to drill additional holes in the plates for attaching work that could not otherwise be attached. While the Dog plates were usually fairly small regardless of the lathe size, the classic face plate is usually matched to the maximum diameter that the lathe will swing.|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style <b>lathe</b> <b>chuck</b> backplates screw onto the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|E
50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the <b>lathe</b> <b>chuck</b> in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|E

50|$|During 1946, {{the company}} was located at 105 South Townsend Street and they were hiring machine workers to operate their Brown and Turret <b>Lathes,</b> Bar and <b>Chuck,</b> Engine <b>Lathes,</b> Sharpe millers and Cincinnati millers.|$|R
50|$|A chuck is a {{specialized}} type of clamp. It {{is used to}} hold an object with radial symmetry, especially a cylinder. In drills and mills it holds the rotating tool whereas in lathes it holds the rotating workpiece. On a <b>lathe</b> the <b>chuck</b> is mounted on the spindle which rotates within the headstock. For some purposes (such as drilling) an additional chuck may be mounted on the non-rotating tailstock.|$|R
50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some <b>lathe</b> <b>chucks</b> have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 09 / 03 / 1999. For many companies, design related information mainly exists as rooms of paper-based archives, typically {{in the form of}} manufacturing drawings and technical specifications. This 'static' information cannot be easily reused. The work presented in this thesis proposes a methodology to ease this problem. It defines and implements a computer-based design tool that will enable existing design families to be transformed into 'dynamic' CAD-based models for the Conceptual, Embodiment and Detailed stages of the design process. Two novel concepts are proposed here, i) the use of a Function Means Tree to store Conceptual and Embodiment design and ii) a Variant Method to represent Detailed design. In this way a definite link between the more abstract conceptual and the concrete detailed design stages is realised by linking individual detailed designs to means in the Function Means Tree. The use of the Variant Method, incorporating 'state-of-the-art' developments in Solid Modelling, Feature-Based Design and Parametric Design, allows an entire family of designs to be represented by a single Master Model. Therefore, instances of this Master Model need only be stored as a set of design parameters. This enables current design families and new design cases to be more created more efficiently. Industrial Case Studies, including a <b>Lathe</b> <b>Chuck</b> family, a Drive-End casting and a family of Filtration Systems are given to prove the methodology...|$|E
50|$|To chuck a tool or {{workpiece}} {{is to hold}} it with a chuck, {{in which}} case it has been <b>chucked.</b> <b>Lathe</b> work whose workholding involves chucking individual slugs or blanks is often called chucking work, in contrast to bar work or bar feed work. In bar work the bar protrudes from the chuck, is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. Automatic lathes that specialize in chucking work are often called chuckers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{machine shop}} {{typically}} has a storage area containing a large variety of bar stock. To create a metal component, {{a bar of}} sufficient volume is selected from storage and brought to the machining area. This piece may then be sawed, milled, drilled, turned, or ground to remove material and create the final shape. In turning, for large-diameter work (typically more than 100 mm, {{although there is no}} universal threshold), a piece of the bar is cut off using a horizontal bandsaw to create a blank for each part. The blanks are then fed into a <b>chucking</b> <b>lathe</b> (chucker) which <b>chucks</b> each one in turn. For smaller-diameter work, the entire length of bar stock is more often fed through the spindle of the lathe. The entire bar rotates with the spindle during the part-machining cycle. When the cycle ends and one part is done, the chuck opens, the bar is pulled or pushed forward ("fed") by any of various automatic means, the chuck closes, and the next cycle begins. The last step of the cycle is to cut off the machined part from the bar, which is called [...] "parting it off" [...] and is achieved with a [...] "cutoff" [...] or [...] "part-off" [...] tool, a tool bit that grooves the bar {{all the way down to}} the centreline, causing the part to fall off. Then the cycle repeats.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many drill presses, handheld drills, and <b>lathes,</b> which have <b>chucks</b> (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On drills, drill presses, and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R
40|$|A three {{jaw chuck}} set from a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the machine tool operator. Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal processing undertaken as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of <b>lathe</b> <b>chuck</b> jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to scrap worn jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine tool guarding was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the machine tool operator. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the measurement of}} temperature distribution across a metal plate and the non-contact measurement of torsion in a rotating shaft. After a thorough theoretical study {{of the origin of}} fibre Bragg gratings, methods of fabrication and erasing of gratings, methods of demodulating the signals from gratings, and methods of discriminating between strain and temperature variations in gratings, simulations and experiments were done to prove the feasibility of both temperature distribution measurement and non-contact torsion measurement. For the measurement of temperature distribution, a 450 x 450 x 1. 6 mm type 304 stainless steel plate was used. Two 4, 7 Ω 25 W resistors were used as heat sources, and five fibre Bragg gratings measured the temperature at strategic points on the plate. The measured values were interpolated appropriately and a three-dimensional representation of the temperature distribution was shown on a personal computer monitor. The measurement of torsion was first done on a non-rotating 25 mm diameter solid shaft with torque applied. Both resistive strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings were attached to the shaft and the measurement results compared well. Up to 90 Nm of torque was applied to the shaft. The non-contact measurement of torsion on a rotating shaft was done with fibre Bragg gratings and involved the use of graded index (GRIN) lenses for transmitting optical information between the light source, the gratings, and back to the spectrum analyser through free space. A special Böhler steel with high yield strength was used, and the set-up was mounted on a lathe. The one end of the shaft was clamped in the <b>lathe</b> <b>chuck,</b> and the other was fixed to an automobile drum brake system, allowing the application of torque on the rotating shaft. Up to 97 Nm of torque was applied to the shaft rotating at 190 rpm, and the results are within 10 % of the expected values. As far as we are aware, {{this is the first time}} that torsion is measured by fibre Bragg gratings without the need to have physical contact with the shaft, i. e. slip rings, to transmit the information to and from the sensors. The experimental results of this thesis confirm that fibre Bragg grating sensors can be applied usefully in temperature distribution measurement, as well as in the measurement of torsional stress in rotating shafts...|$|E
5000|$|The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company {{was founded}} in 1909 by William LeRoy (Roy) Bryant, one of the machine tool {{entrepreneurs}} mentored by James Hartness of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J&L). Roy Bryant had joined J&L in 1897, became chief draughtsman in 1899, and was chief engineer by 1905. While working on tooling for <b>chucking</b> <b>lathes,</b> he invented a multispindle grinder for second-operation work, which he patented (...) [...] He took Hartness's advice and formed a company to build his grinders, and the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company joined J&L as one of several firms that made Springfield, Vermont an important center for machine tools and their tooling, such as accessories and cutting tools. (Others were the Fellows Gear Shaper Company and the Lovejoy Tool Company). Hartness helped finance the Bryant venture and was the firm's first president; Roy Bryant afterward assumed the post.|$|R
5000|$|Larger {{cam-operated}} {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called automatic <b>chucking</b> <b>lathes,</b> automatic lathes, automatic chuckers, automatics, or chuckers. The [...] "chucker" [...] {{part of the}} name {{comes from the fact}} that the workpieces are usually discrete blanks, held in a bin called a [...] "magazine", and each one takes a turn at being chucked (gripped by the machine for being worked on) and cut. (This is analogous to the way that each round of ammunition in the magazine of a semi-automatic pistol gets its turn at being chambered.) The blanks are either individual forgings or castings, or they are pre-sawed pieces of billet. However, some members of this family of machine tools turn bar work or work on centers (for example, the Fay automatic lathe). Regarding bar work of large diameter (for example, 150 mm or more), it is merely an academic point whether it is called [...] "screw machine work" [...] or just [...] "automatic work".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the <b>lathe</b> spindle <b>chuck</b> jaws. The position of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.

40|$|Precise {{machining}} {{of bearing}} rings {{is integral to}} finished bearing assembly quality. The output accuracy of center-based machining systems such as <b>lathes</b> or magnetic <b>chuck</b> grinders relates directly {{to the accuracy of}} part centering before machining. Traditional tooling and methods for centering on such machines are subject to wear, dimensional inaccuracy, setup time (hard tooling) and human error (manual centering). A flexible system for initial part centering is developed based on a single measurement system and actuator, whereby the part is placed by hand onto the machine table, rotated and measured to identify center of geometry offset from center of rotation, then moved by a series of controlled impacts or pushes to align the centers. The prototype centering system is developed as a demonstration platform for research in a number of mechanical engineering areas, particularly: Characterization of optimal state estimators through analysis of accuracy and computational efficiency; Distributed communication and control, efficient transfer of information in a real-time environment, and information sharing between processes; Modeling of sliding dynamics and the interaction of friction with compliant body dynamic models; Motion path planning through both deterministic geometric transforms and through frequency domain command manipulation. A vision is created for future work not only in the described areas, but also in the areas of advanced controller design incorporating multiple variables, derived machine diagnostic information, and application of the distributed communication architecture to information flow throughout the manufacturing organization. The guiding motivation for this research is reduction of manufacturing processing costs in the face of global competition. The technologies researched, developments made, and directions prescribed for future research aid in enabling this goal. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Thomas R.
