25|$|<b>LLDPE</b> {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. <b>LLDPE</b> is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). <b>LLDPE</b> has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. <b>LLDPE</b> is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, <b>LLDPE</b> is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world <b>LLDPE</b> market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|E

40|$|The thermal, dynamic {{mechanical}} and stress-strain properties {{of a set}} of commercial <b>LLDPEs</b> prepared by metallocene catalysts were studied and compared with two <b>LLDPEs</b> obtained with traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The type and amount of comonomer strongly affects the degree of crystallinity and branching, resulting in different material morphology and macroscopic thermomechanical behavior. Within each set of ethylene-alpha-olefin copolymers a gradual decrease in the percentage crystallinity and position and intensity of beta- and gamma-transition is observed, with respect to the comonomer content. In addition, the studied materials are characterized by the absence of an alpha-transition. This behavior is attributed to the high comonomer content (5 - 24) %. Tensile behavior changes from the typical necking, cold drawing and strain hardening to the uniform elastomeric deformation, as the comonomer content increases. The experimental methods used, in combination with scanning electron microscopy, lead to converged results, while tensile testing proved {{to be sensitive to the}} crystallite size and distribution.

40|$|SANS {{experiments}} on blends of linear, high density (HD) and long chain branched, low density (LD) polyethylenes indicate that these systems form a one-phase mixture in the melt. However, the maximum spatial resolution of pinhole cameras is approximately equal to 10 3 Å {{and it has}} therefore been suggested that data might also be interpreted as arising from a bi-phasic melt with large a particle size (~ 1 µm), {{because most of the}} scattering from the different phases would not be resolved. We have addressed this hypothesis by means of USANS experiments, which confirm that HDPEILDPE blends are homogenous in the melt on length scales up to 20 µm. We have also studied blends of HDPE and short-chain branched linear low density polyethylenes (<b>LLDPEs),</b> which phase separate when the branch content is sufficiently high. <b>LLDPEs</b> prepared with Ziegler-Natta catalysts exhibit a wide distribution of compositions, and may therefore {{be thought of as a}} �blend� of different species. When the composition distribution is broad enough, a fraction of highly branched chains may phase separate on µm-length scales, and USANS has also been used to quantify this phenomenon...|$|R

25|$|If the {{economic}} and geological conditions are right, the mining company will level large areas of land with a small gradient, layering it with thick plastic (usually HDPE or <b>LLDPE),</b> sometimes with clay, silt or sand beneath the plastic liner. The extracted ore will typically be run through a crusher and placed in heaps atop the plastic. The leaching agent will then be sprayed on the ore for 30–90 days. As the leaching agent filters through the heap the uranium will break its bonds with the oxide rock and enter the solution. The solution will then filter along the gradient into collecting pools which will then be pumped to on-site plants for further processing. Only some of the uranium (commonly about 70%) is actually extracted.|$|E

5000|$|LDPE and <b>LLDPE</b> have unique {{rheological}} or {{melt flow}} properties. <b>LLDPE</b> is less shear sensitive {{because of its}} narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, <b>LLDPE</b> remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of <b>LLDPE</b> allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in blow-up ratios. In melt extension, <b>LLDPE</b> has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the deformation rate of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with <b>LLDPE</b> {{because of the lack}} of long-chain branching in <b>LLDPE</b> allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because <b>LLDPE</b> films can be downgauged easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of <b>LLDPE</b> are summarized as [...] "stiff in shear" [...] and [...] "soft in extension". It is not taken in most curbside pickups in communities. <b>LLDPE</b> can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes ...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} many reports of methods for {{inferring}} the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of linear polymers from either viscosity data or dynamic data. This subject is of great interest in the polymer industry, since MWD affects the processing and final properties of polymers, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), normally used for determining MWD, has several limitations. There are two main types of method for inferring the MWD from rheological data. The first one involves empirical transformations that lead directly to a MWD, whereas the second type involves the inversion of an integral that gives the relaxation modulus G(t) of a polydisperse polymer in terms of its MWD. A comparison of the reliabilities of these methods for use with samples having a wide variety of polydispersities is lacking, especially for materials with high polydispersities. This study presents a comparison of the MWD predictions of four of these techniques in terms of their performance with groups of HDPEs, <b>LLDPEs</b> and polypropylenes having polydispersities from two to six and various molecular weights. It was found that the viscosity transform (as modified by Wood-Adams) and a modified time-dependent diffusion reptation model proposed by des Cloizeaux (TDD-DR model) are, to a certain extent, satisfactory methods for use with polymers having moderate to high polydispersities, whereas the modulus transform is reliable only for narrow distributions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{catalyst}}s, denoted as catalyst 1 [silica/MAO/(nBuCp) 2 ZrCl 2] and catalyst 2 [silica/nBuSnCl 3 /MAO/(nBuCp) 2 ZrCl 2] were synthesized {{and subsequently}} used to prepare, without separate feeding of methylaluminoxane (MAO), ethylene homopolymer 1 and homopolymer 2, respectively, and ethylene- 1 -hexene copolymer 1 and copolymer 2, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Crystaf, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) [conventional and successive self-nucleation and annealing (SSA) ], and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) polymer characterization results were used, as appropriate, to model the catalyst active-center distribution, ethylene sequence (equilibrium crystal) distribution, and lamellar thickness distribution (both continuous and discrete). Five different types of active centers were predicted in each catalyst, as corroborated by the SSA experiments and complemented by an extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) report published in the literature. 13 C NMR spectroscopy also supported this active-center multiplicity. Models combined with experiments effectively illustrated {{how and why the}} active-center distribution and the variance {{in the design of the}} supported MAO anion, having different electronic and steric effects and coordination environments, influence the concerned copolymerization mechanism and polymer properties, including inter- and intrachain compositional heterogeneity and thermal behaviors. Copolymerization occurred according to the first-order Markovian terminal model, producing fairly random copolymers with minor skewedness toward blocky character. For each copolymer, the theoretical most probable ethylene sequences, nE MPDSC-GT and n E MPNMR-Flory, as well as the weight-average lamellar thicknesses, Lwav DSC-GT and Lwav SSA DSC, were found to be comparable. To the best of our knowledge, such a match has not previously been reported. The percentage crystallinities of the homo- and copolymers increased linearly as a function of LMPDSC-GT. This indicates that the homo- and copolymer chains folded excluding the butyl branch. The results of the present study will contribute to developing future supported metallocene catalysts that will be useful in the synthesis of new grades of ethylene-α-olefin linear low-density polyethylenes (<b>LLDPEs).</b> © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Os primeiros polietilenos de baixa densidade (PEBDs) foram produzidos em reatores de alta-pressão de tecnologia {{autoclave}}, resultando em materiais com boas propriedades ópticas e facilmente processáveis em injeção, extrusão de filmes plano ou balão e revestimento por extrusão, tanto na forma pura quanto em misturas com polietilenos de baixa densidade linear (PEBDLs). No entanto, as plantas autoclave têm se tornado cada vez mais escassas no mundo, já que novos investimentos têm sido realizados em unidades industriais maiores e mais produtivas de tecnologia tubular. Assim, a compreensão das diferenças físicas, estruturais e principalmente reológicas entre PEBDs destas duas tecnologias é o objetivo principal deste trabalho. Além disso, pretende-se estudar o comportamento reológico destes PEBDs no processo de revestimento por extrusão, que é um dos mais críticos em termos de reologia. Para isso, foram selecionados três PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave (A 1, A 2 e A 3) e um de tecnologia tubular (T 1) e foram preparadas misturas de T 1 e A 1. As amostras foram caracterizadas em relação à densidade, temperaturas de fusão e cristalização e grau de cristalinidade por calorimetria diferencial de varredura (DSC), massas molares médias (Mn, Mw, Mz) e polidispersão (PD) por cromatogradia de permeação de gel (GPC); e com relação ao comportamento reológico, tendo sido avaliadas quanto ao índice de fluidez, reometria rotacional, reometria capilar, resistência do fundido e análise dinâmico-mecânica (DMA). Os resultados indicam que as amostras de PEBDs de tecnologia autoclave avaliadas foram produzidos em condições de reação distintas, cada qual resultando em determinada polidispersão e quantidade de cadeias de alta massa molar, responsáveis pelo aumento da elasticidade e resistência do fundido. O PEBD de tecnologia tubular apresentou menor PD, refletindo em menor grau de elasticidade e pseudoplasticidade. O acréscimo de diferentes teores de A 1 (mais ramificado) em T 1 (menos ramificado) resultou em uma interessante combinação entre as características reológicas das duas amostras de PEBDs. Finalmente, conclui-se que diferenças significativas de propriedades físicas, térmicas, estruturais e reológicas entre os PEBDs podem influenciar o desempenho de neck-in e draw-down em processamento e também no produto final. The first {{low density polyethylene}}s (LDPEs) {{were produced}} in high-pressure reactors and autoclave technology, resulting in materials with good optical properties and easily processed in injection, cast and blown film extrusion and extrusion coating, either pure or blended with {{linear low density polyethylene}} (<b>LLDPEs).</b> However, autoclave plants have become increasingly scarce in the world, as new investments have been made in larger and more productive plants based on tubular technology. Thus, understanding the physical, structural and rheological differences between LDPEs of these two technologies is the main objective of this work. Furthermore, this work aims to study the rheological behavior of the LDPEs in the extrusion coating process, {{which is one of the}} most critical in terms of rheology. For this purpose, three autoclave LDPEs (A 1, A 2 and A 3) and one tubular LDPE (T 1) were selected and some blends were prepared with different proportions of A 1 and T 1. The samples were characterized with respect to density, melting/crystallization temperatures and degree of cristalinity by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), average molecular weight distribution (Mn, Mw, Mz) and polydispersity (PD) by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and also the rheological characterization was performed by assessing melt index, rotational rheometry, capillary rheometry, melt strength and dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMA). The results indicate that the autoclave LDPEs were produced at distinct reaction conditions, each one resulting in particular polydispersity and level of long chain branching, which are responsible for elasticity and melt strength. The tubular LDPE presented lower PD, reflecting a lower degree of elasticity and shear thinning. The addition of A 1 (more branched) in hot blends with T 1 (less branched) resulted in an interesting combination of rheological characteristics of the two LDPEs. Finally, it was concluded that distinct physical, thermal, structural and rheological properties between the LDPEs may influence neck-in and draw-down performance during processing and also the final product characteristics...|$|R
