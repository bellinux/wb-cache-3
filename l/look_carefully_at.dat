If you <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> the outer sprays of any tree at twenty or thirty yards' distance, you will see them defined against the sky in masses, which, at first, look quite definite; but if you examine them, you will see, mingled with the real shapes of leaves, many indistinct lines, which are, some of them, stalks of leaves, and some, leaves seen with the edge turned towards you, and coming into sight in a broken way; for, supposing the real leaf shape to be as at a, Fig. 7, this, when removed some yards from the eye, will appear dark against the sky, as at b; then, when removed some yards farther still, the stalk and point disappear altogether, the middle of the leaf becomes little more than a line; and the result is the condition at c, only with this farther subtlety in the look of it, inexpressible in the wood-cut, that the stalk and point of the leaf, though they have disappeared to the eye, have yet some influence in checking the light at the places where they exist, and cause a slight dimness about the part of the leaf which remains visible, so that its perfect effect could only be rendered by two layers of color, one subduing the sky tone a little, the next drawing the broken portions of the leaf, as at c, and carefully indicating the greater darkness of the spot in the middle, where the under side of the leaf is.|$|E
60|$|The {{works of}} Stanfield evidently, and at all times, proceed from {{the hand of}} a man who has both {{thorough}} knowledge of his subject, and thorough acquaintance with all the means and principles of art. We never criticise them, because we feel, the moment we <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> the drawing of any single wave, that the knowledge possessed by the master is much greater than our own, and therefore believe that if anything offends us in any part of the work, it is nearly certain to be our fault, and not the painter's. The local color of Stanfield's sea is singularly true and powerful, and entirely independent of any tricks of chiaroscuro. He will carry a mighty wave up against the sky, and make its whole body dark and substantial against the distant light, using all the while nothing more than chaste and unexaggerated local color to gain the relief. His surface is at once lustrous, transparent, and accurate to a hairbreadth in every curve; and he is entirely independent of dark skies, deep blues, driving spray, or any other means of concealing want of form, or atoning for it. He fears no difficulty, desires no assistance, takes his sea in open daylight, under general sunshine, and paints the element in its pure color and complete forms. But we wish that he were less powerful, and more interesting; or that he were a little less Diogenes-like, and did not scorn all that he does not want. Now that he has shown us what he can do without such aids, we wish he would show us what he can do with them. He is, as we have already said, wanting in what we have just been praising in Fielding--impressiveness. We should like him to be less clever, and more affecting--less wonderful, and more terrible; and as the very first step towards such an end, to learn how to conceal. We are, however, trenching upon matters with which we have at present nothing to do; our concern is now only with truth, and one work of Stanfield alone presents us with as much concentrated knowledge of sea and sky, as, diluted, would have lasted any one of the old masters his life. And let it be especially observed, how extensive and how varied is the truth of our modern masters--how it comprises a complete history of that nature of which, from the ancients, you only here and there can catch a stammering descriptive syllable--how Fielding has given us every character of the quiet lake, Robson[65] of the mountain tarn, De Wint of the lowland river, Nesfield of the radiant cataract, Harding of the roaring torrent, Fielding of the desolate sea, Stanfield of the blue, open, boundless ocean. Arrange all this in your mind, observe the perfect truth of it in all its parts, compare it with the fragmentary falsities of the ancients, and then, come with me to Turner.|$|E

I do not believe that either the [...] "Miracle of [...] St. Mark," [...] or the great [...] "Crucifixion" [...] in the Scuola di San Rocco, cost [...] Tintoret more pains than this comparatively small work, which is now [...] utterly neglected, covered with filth and cobwebs, and fearfully [...] injured. As a piece of color, and light and shade, it is altogether [...] marvellous. Of all the fifty figures which the picture contains, there [...] is not one which in any way injures or contends with another; nay, [...] there is not a single fold of garment or touch of the pencil which [...] could be spared; every virtue of Tintoret, as a painter, is there in [...] its highest degree,--color at once the most intense and the most [...] delicate, the utmost decision in the arrangement of masses of light, [...] and yet half tones and modulations of endless variety; and all [...] executed with a magnificence of handling which no words are energetic [...] enough to describe. I have hardly ever seen a picture in which there [...] was so much decision, and so little impetuosity, and in which so [...] little was conceded to haste, to accident, or to weakness. It is too [...] infinite a work to be describable; but among its minor passages of [...] extreme beauty, should especially be noticed the manner in which the [...] accumulated forms of the human body, which fill the picture from end [...] to end, are prevented from being felt heavy, by the grace and [...] elasticity of two or three sprays of leafage which spring from a [...] broken root in the foreground, and rise conspicuous in shadow against [...] an interstice filled by the pale blue, grey, and golden light in which [...] the distant crowd is invested, the office of this foliage being, in an [...] artistical point of view, correspondent to that of the trees set by [...] the sculptors of the Ducal Palace on its angles. But they have a far [...] more important meaning in the picture than any artistical one. If the [...] spectator will <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> the root which I have called broken, [...] he will find that in reality, it is not broken, but cut; the other [...] branches of the young tree having lately been cut away. When we [...] remember that one of the principal incidents in great San Rocco [...] Crucifixion is the ass feeding on withered palm leaves, we shall be at [...] no loss to understand the great painter's purpose in lifting the [...] branch of this mutilated olive against the dim light of the distant [...] sky; while, close beside it, St. Joseph of Arimathea drags along the [...] dust a white garment--observe, the principal light of the [...] picture,--stained with the blood of that King before whom, five days [...] before, his crucifiers had strewn their own garments in the way.|$|E

6000|$|But to {{understand}} David's history, {{we must go}} back a little through the lessons which have been read in church the last few Sundays. We find in the eighth and in the twelfth chapters of this same book of Samuel, that the Jews asked Samuel for a king--for a king like the nations round them. Samuel consulted God, and by God's command chose Saul to be their king; {{at the same time}} warning them that in asking for a king they had committed a great and fearful sin, for [...] "the Lord their God was their king." [...] And the Lord said unto Samuel, that in asking for a king they had rejected God from reigning over them. Now what was this sin which the Jews committed? for the mere having a king cannot be wrong in itself; else God would not have anointed Saul and David kings, and blessed David and Solomon; much less would He have allowed the greater number of Christian nations to remain governed by kings unto this day, if a king had been a wrong thing in itself. I think if we <b>look</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> the words of the story we shall see what this great sin of the Jews was. In the first place, they asked Samuel to give them a king--not God. This was a sin, I think; but it was only the fruit of a deeper sin--a wrong {{way of looking at the}} whole question of kings and government. And that deeper sin was this: they were a free people, and they wanted to become slaves. God had made them a free people; He had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, out of slavery to Pharaoh. He had given them a free constitution. He had given them laws to secure safety, and liberty, and equal justice to rich and poor, for themselves, their property, their children; to defend them from oppression, and over-taxation, and all the miseries of misgovernment. And now they were going to trample under foot God's inestimable gift of liberty. They wanted a king like the nations round them, they said. They did not see that it was just their glory NOT to be like the nations round them in that. We who live in a free country do not see the vast and inestimable difference between the Jews and the other nations. The Jews were then, perhaps, so far as I can make out, the only free people on the face of the earth. The nations round them were like the nations in the East, now governed by tyrants, without law or parliament, at the mercy of the will, the fancy, the lust, the ambition, and the cruelty of their despotic kings. In fact, they were as the Eastern people now are--slaves governed by tyrants. Samuel warned the Jews that it would be just the same with them; that neither their property, their families, nor their liberty would be safe under the despots for whom they wished. And yet, in spite of that warning, they would have a king. And why? Because they did not like the trouble of being free. They did not like the responsibility and the labour of taking care of themselves, and asking counsel of God as to how they were to govern themselves. So they were ready to sell themselves to a tyrant, that he might fight for them, and judge for them, and take care of them, while they just ate and drank, and made money, and lived like slaves, careless of what happened to them or their country, provided they could get food, and clothes, and money enough. And as long as they got that, if you will remark, they were utterly careless as to what sort of king they had. They said not one word to Samuel about how much power their king was to have. They made not the slightest inquiry as to whether Saul was wise or foolish, good or bad. They did not ask God's counsel, or trouble themselves about God; so they proved themselves unworthy of being free. They turned, like a dog to his vomit, and the sow to her wallowing in the mire, cowardly back again into slavery; and God gave them what they asked for. He gave them the sort of king they wanted; and bitterly they found out their mistake during several hundred years of continually increasing slavery and misery.|$|E
