25|$|Because Niépce's camera {{photographs}} {{required an}} extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), {{he sought to}} greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>resin,</b> but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Commercial <b>light-sensitive</b> <b>resins</b> for Rapid Prototyping of {{cellular}} materials are often unsuitable for different molding techniques because {{removal of the}} mold uses thermal decomposition at temperatures of up to 600 °C. In this study, a resin formulation based on water-soluble polymers was developed and evaluated regarding its usabil-ity as sacrificial mold material. The base monomer dimeth-ylacrylamide gave fast curing and excellent polymer solu-bility. Methacrylic acid {{was found to be}} a useful comonomer to improve mechanical strength and feature resolution. The latter criterion was also improved by adding poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) as filler and by using a hydrolytically cleavable crosslinking agent such as methacrylic acid anhydride...|$|R
