40|$|Abstract—A {{simplified}} {{and integrated}} technique {{has been proposed}} to form an oxide/nitride storage dielectric in a single-furnace process by <b>low-pressure</b> <b>oxidation</b> and nitride film deposition with an extra N 2 O treatment for the trench {{dynamic random access memory}} (DRAM). Compared to the conventional nitride/oxide dielectric, this newly developed dielectric enjoys cell-capacitance-enhancement factor as high as 12. 5 % without de-grading the leakage current and electron-trapping property. From the reliability test, the qualification for the DRAM application is also proven by the dielectric lifetime longer than 10 -years. Most importantly, this technique can reduce the production cycle time without an additional equipment investment, which is essen-tial in the cost-competitive DRAM arena.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have studied}} the {{inversion}} layer mobility of n-MOSFET’s with thin-gate oxide of 20 to 70 Å. Direct relationship of electron mobility to oxide/channel interface roughness was ob-tained from measured mobility of MOSFET’s and high-resolution TEM. By using a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>oxidation</b> process with native oxide removed in situ prior to oxidation, atomically smooth interface of oxide/channel was observed by high-resolution TEM for oxide thicknesses of 11 and 38 Å. The roughness increased to one to two monolayers of Si in a 55 -A ̊ oxide. Significant mobility improvement was obtained from these oxides with smoother interface than that from conventional furnace oxidation. Mobility reduction with decreasing oxide thickness was observed in the 20 -and 35 -A ̊ oxide, with the same atomically smooth oxide/channel interface. This {{may be due to}} the remote Coulomb scattering from gate electrode or the gate field variation from poly-gate/oxide interface roughness. I...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy and diffraction studies {{were made on}} thin sections of 18 Cr- 8 Ni and 25 Cr- 20 Ni stainless teels oxidized in ~ 10 - 4 mm Hg dry air at 300 ~ 176 and on oxide repl ica films formed on etched surfaces of both steels in a molten nitrate solution at 300 ~ 176 The oxide films con-sisted of spinel phase oxides, near FeCr 204 in the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>oxidation</b> and near NiCr 204 in the molten nitrate oxidation, and completely paral le l growth between these spinel oxides and the austenite crystals was observed in both cases. Electron micrographs of the oxidized thin sections showed anisotropy of oxidation of the austenite crystal, suggesting that the (111) plane is least active and the ~ 110 ~ direction is most active for oxidation. Many studies have been pub l i shed on the res is t-ance of stainless steels to corrosion and h igh- tem-perature oxidat ion.

40|$|Utilizing {{a focused}} laser beam {{manipulated}} through computer-controlled mirrors, and capable of “writing” spatiotemporal temperature fields on a surface, we explore here the fundamental impact of localized spatiotemporal perturbations on a simple reaction–diffusion system. Our two-dimensional model system is the <b>low-pressure</b> catalytic <b>oxidation</b> of CO on Pt(110), a reaction exhibiting well-understood spatiotemporal patterns. In the simplest case the laser spot causes the ignition of a reaction wave by a single critical “kick” at a selected surface location. The cooperativeness between two local subcritical perturbations separated in time and/or space is then explored. A temperature heterogeneity moving along a line may ignite waves along its path, or can drag preexisting pulses. In the oscillatory region we find localized beat patterns when the laser spot moves along a circle. The ratio between the underlying natural oscillation frequency and the forcing (circlewriting) frequency is important here. Finally we demonstrate how pulses, the basic building blocks of chemical patterns, can be modified, guided, and erased and how the overall reaction rate can be increased through localized actuation. Computational studies supplement and rationalize the experimental findings...|$|R
