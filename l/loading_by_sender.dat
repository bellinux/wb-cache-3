40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to comparison of open source as well as proprietary transport protocols for highspeed data transmission via IP networks. The contemporary common TCP needs significant improvement since it was developed as general-purpose transport protocol and firstly introduced four decades ago. In nowadays networks, TCP fits not all communication needs that society has. Caused of it another transport protocols have been developed and successfully used for e. g. Big Data movement. In scope of this research the following protocols have been investigated for its efficiency on 10 Gbps links: UDT, RBUDP, MTP and RWTP. The protocols were tested under different impairments such as Round Trip Time up to 400 ms and packet losses up to 2 %. Investigated parameters are the data rate under different conditions of the network, the CPU <b>load</b> <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> andreceiver during the experiments, size of feedback data, CPU usage per Gbps {{and the amount of}} feedback data per GiByte of effectively transmitted data. The best performance and fair resources consumption was observed by RWTP. From the opensource projects, the best behavior is showed by RBUDP...|$|R
40|$|Information seeking in {{personal}} information collections such as email {{is often a}} solitary activity performed by the owner– user alone. However, information objects such as email that are the products of collaboration are inherently social objects. In this paper, we describe a technique, using email as an example, that exploits the actions of one’s close social network to assist in one’s own information seeking tasks. We note that tagging of email messages {{is an example of}} human computation, and then describe a system that enables the tags applied by one user to be shared with other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We discuss how such shared tagging contributes to common ground among the participants of a collaborative group, and may be performed with minimal global cognitive <b>load</b> <b>by</b> the <b>sender</b> of the message. We provide scenarios of collaborative information seeking tasks that include sub-tasks such as collaborative information management and synchronous re-finding of previously-encountered information. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and its impact on collaborative information seeking practices...|$|R

However, signal extension + SIFS interval following RTS {{transmission is}} sensed as idle <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> B. If sender B initiates RTS transmission during this event, it {{will result in}} unsuccessful reception of CTS from a at sender A, which is the event of collision for flow Aa. Therefore, probability of packet loss for flow Aa can be computed by modeling the probability of the event of RTS transmission <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> B during interval signal extension + SIFS between RTS and CTS transmission by flow Aa. This event can be modeled as one-dimensional Markov model with m states. The expressions in Table 2 are valid for the purpose with the difference of number of states and the variable γ [...]...|$|R

30|$|The senders A and B {{of the two}} {{flows in}} this {{category}} (and all subsequent categories) are not within the transmission range of each other. Therefore, the RTS frame transmitted <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> A is not successfully decoded <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> B and vice versa. However, the channel is sensed busy during RTS transmission, preventing the other sender from initiating a transmission. This is different from SIS category proposed by Garetto et al. [5] where senders {{are assumed to be}} outside the sensing range and cannot sense the RTS transmitted <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> of the alternate flow. The receivers of both flows are within the transmission range of the alternate senders, i.e., interference interactions Ab and aB are connected. This means that the receivers can successfully decode the RTS frame transmitted <b>by</b> the alternate <b>senders</b> resulting in setting NAV at alternate receiver. Similarly, senders can successfully decode the CTS packet transmitted by the alternate receivers. Therefore, collision can only occur if one sender starts transmission of RTS during the idle interval between RTS and CTS transmission of the alternate flow.|$|R

For the sender, due to the communication capacity among actors are stronger than sensor node, when the sender actor wants to communicate with other actor, the actors are adopted as the relay nodes unless when the communication cannot be bypass by sensor node. Therefore, in the HTDM, although the actor communicate with the other actor in different actor sets, our main goal is to send the data in any actor located <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> actor to any actor node in the actor located by receiver actor. Because, it can be communicated using algorithm 3 when the actor inside of the sender actor set and the receiver actor set. So, the algorithm 4 can only consider how to send the data in actor set located <b>by</b> <b>sender</b> actor to the actor set located by receiver actor.|$|R
