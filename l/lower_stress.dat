25|$|Real {{crystals}} feature defects or {{irregularities in}} the ideal arrangements described above {{and it is}} these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes {{for one of the}} principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue. Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s. Dislocations in the crystal lattice allow shear at <b>lower</b> <b>stress</b> than that needed for a perfect crystal structure.|$|E

40|$|Aim. This aim of {{this study}} is to propose a {{conceptual}} framework for guiding interventions to enhance the cognitive function of people with dementia. Background. Few studies have been published on non-pharmacological approaches with a conceptual framework for an intervention to enhance cognitive function. The Progressive <b>Lowered</b> <b>Stress</b> Threshold model is one of the useful theoretical models for predicting the occurrence of dysfunctional behaviour in people with dementia. Based on the theoretical assertion of the Progressive <b>Lowered</b> <b>Stress</b> Threshold model and empirical findings on the relationship of anxiety and depression with cognitive function, an expanded model is proposed. Design. Discursive paper. Method. Literature regarding stress and anxiety in people with dementia was reviewed and critically analysed, and then integrated into the Progressive <b>Lowered</b> <b>Stress</b> Threshold Model. With careful considerations about the relationships between the variables indicated in the Model and the evidences and limitations suggested in the literature reviewed, an expanded model has been proposed, which may guide the development of non-pharmacological intervention for promoting cognitive functions of people with dementia. Recommendations or implications for practice have been given. Conclusion. There are three commonly used models in dementia care, including the biomedical, behavioural and Progressively <b>Lowered</b> <b>Stress</b> Threshold model. Their uses and weaknesses are given. An expanded model is suggested, and explanations are provided with regard to its merits in guiding the development of interventions for people with dementia. Further testing on this model is suggested. Relevance to clinical practice. Cognitive function and dysfunctional behaviour are the major concerns of caregivers of dementia patients. Interventions that can alleviate the symptoms and enhance cognition are likely to improve the well-being of patients and their caregivers. This purposed model can guide the development of interventions. School of Nursin...|$|R

It is found that increasing the total sputtering pressure while keeping the optimum Fe to N arrival flux constant can <b>lower</b> the residual <b>stress.</b> The films with <b>lowered</b> residual <b>stress,</b> however, are more susceptible to the formation of stripe domains which are detrimental to the magnetic properties. In order to avoid these stripe domains, the thickness of the film should not exceed the critical stripe domain onset thickness. For applications where thicker films are desired, we demonstrate that laminating single layer films whose thicknesses do not exceed the critical thickness produces films with good magnetic properties and acceptable residual stress.

40|$|Abstract Dementia is {{a disease}} that impacts {{millions}} of people worldwide. Amongst the complications of this disease are behaviors that affect not only the individual with dementia but also their caregivers. These behaviors can be challenging especially for formal caregivers {{and it is important}} that they are taught how to prevent them. Long-term care facilities are the perfect settings for this type of education. For this reason, an educational program, including a needs assessment, PowerPoint presentation, and on-site support, was brought to a locked, assisted-living unit of Jewish Geriatric Services in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. The educational program was inspired and supported by a specific nursing model: the Progressively <b>Lowered</b> <b>Stress</b> Threshold model. This model focuses on preventing behavioral symptoms of those with dementia and it was effective in increasing the amount of learning for participants while decreasing behaviors and caregiver reactions with clinical significance.

We developed a perivascular shear stress modifier that induces regions of lowered, increased, and lowered/oscillatory (ie, with vortices) shear stresses in mouse carotid arteries and studied plaque formation and composition. Atherosclerotic lesions developed invariably in the regions with <b>lowered</b> shear <b>stress</b> or vortices, whereas the regions of increased shear <b>stress</b> were protected. <b>Lowered</b> shear <b>stress</b> lesions were larger (intima/media, 1. 38 +/- 0. 68 versus 0. 22 +/- 0. 04); contained fewer smooth muscle cells (1. 9 +/- 1. 6 % versus 26. 3 +/- 9. 7 %), less collagen (15. 3 +/- 1. 0 % versus 22. 2 +/- 1. 0 %), and more lipids (15. 8 +/- 0. 9 % versus 10. 2 +/- 0. 5 %); and showed more outward vascular remodeling (214 +/- 19 % versus 117 +/- 9 %) than did oscillatory shear stress lesions.
