Focusing on the transition process for hydrogen-based energy and transport systems in the United States, especially California, this study outlines the key characteristics of TM that have been employed in managing the transition. Several characteristics of TM have been noted in the United States’ hydrogen transition, including: (a) the complementarity of the long-term vision with incremental targets, (b) the integration of top-down and bottom-up planning, (c) system innovations and gradualism, (d) multi-level approaches and interconnectedness, and (e) reflexivity by learning and experimenting. These characteristics are instrumental in bringing about the development and initial commercialization of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and related energy infrastructure in the United States...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHydrogen is a {{promising}} avenue for decarbonising energy systems and providing flexibility. In this paper, the JRC-EU-TIMES model – a bottom-up, technology-rich {{model of the}} EU 28 energy system – is {{used to assess the}} role of hydrogen in a future decarbonised Europe under two climate scenarios, current policy initiative (CPI) and long-term decarbonisation (CAP). Our results indicate that hydrogen could become a viable option already in 2030 – however, a long-term CO 2 cap is needed to sustain the transition. In the CAP scenario, the share of hydrogen in the final energy consumption of the transport and industry sectors reaches 5 % and 6 % by 2050. <b>Low-carbon</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production technologies dominate, and electrolysers provide flexibility by absorbing electricity at times of high availability of intermittent sources. Hydrogen could also {{play a significant role in}} the industrial and transport sectors, while the emergence of stationary hydrogen fuel cells for hydrogen-to-power would require significant cost improvements, over and above those projected by the experts...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} to a hydrogen economy will occur simultaneously with many other profound changes to the UK energy system. We have used the UK MARKAL energy system model to: (1) examine the prospects for hydrogen deployment in the transport and residential sectors; and, (2) consider how hydrogen transitions might interact with other energy transitions. We have substantially improved the modelling of {{all aspects of the}} hydrogen energy system compared with previous UK energy system studies, with a particular focus on the physical infrastructure that will be required. With this new model, we have examined how the UK can most efficiently transition from the existing highly-developed, high-carbon energy infrastructure to a <b>low-carbon</b> <b>hydrogen</b> infrastructure. From an economic perspective, our study suggests that the level of hydrogen deployment in the UK will depend on the relative costs and capabilities of hydrogen and battery vehicles, the availability of biofuels {{and the extent to which}} existing infrastructure can be adapted for hydrogen. Both gaseous pipeline and liquid road tanker delivery are likely to be adopted in different parts of the country but the final configuration will depend on the nature of the transition, particularly the decisions of the stakeholders driving the transition...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{and global}} demand for {{hydrogen}} {{is large and}} growing {{for use in the}} production of chemicals, materials, foods, pharmaceuticals, and fuels (including some <b>low-carbon</b> biofuels). Conventional <b>hydrogen</b> production technologies are expensive, have sizeable space requirements, and are large carbon dioxide emitters. A novel sorbent-based hydrogen production technology is being developed and advanced toward field demonstration that promises smaller size, greater efficiency, lower costs, and reduced to no net carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production technology. Development efforts at the pilot scale have addressed materials compatibility, hot-gas filtration, and high-temperature solids transport and metering, among other issues, and have provided the basis for a preliminary process design with associated economics. The process was able to achieve a 93 % hydrogen purity on a purge gasfree basis directly out of the pilot unit prior to downstream purification...|$|R
40|$|Achieving the Department of Energy {{target of}} an 80 % {{reduction}} in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by 2050 depends on transportation-related strategies combining technology innovation, market adoption, and changes in consumer behavior. This study examines expanding low-carbon transportation fuel infrastructure to achieve deep GHG emissions reductions, {{with an emphasis on}} fuel production facilities and retail components serving light-duty vehicles. Three distinct low-carbon fuel supply scenarios are examined: Portfolio: Successful deployment of a range of advanced vehicle and fuel technologies; Combustion: Market dominance by hybridized internal combustion engine vehicles fueled by advanced biofuels and natural gas; Electrification: Market dominance by electric drive vehicles in the LDV sector, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles, that are fueled by <b>low-carbon</b> electricity and <b>hydrogen.</b> A range of possible low-carbon fuel demand outcomes are explored in terms of the scale and scope of infrastructure expansion requirements and evaluated based on fuel costs, energy resource utilization, fuel production infrastructure expansion, and retail infrastructure expansion for LDVs. This is {{one of a series of}} reports produced as a result of the Transportation Energy Futures (TEF) project, a Department of Energy-sponsored multi-agency project initiated to pinpoint underexplored transportation-related strategies for abating GHGs and reducing petroleum dependence...|$|R
40|$|Gasification of coal when {{associated}} with {{carbon dioxide capture}} and sequestration {{has the potential to}} provide low-cost as well as <b>low-carbon</b> <b>hydrogen</b> for electric power, fuels or chemicals production. The key element to the success of this concept is inexpensive, effective separation of hydrogen from carbon dioxide in synthesis gas. Many studies indicate that membrane technology is one of the most, if not the most, economical means of accomplishing separation; however, the advancement of hydrogen separation membrane technology is hampered by the absence of experience or demonstration that the technology is effective economically and environmentally at larger scales. While encouraging performance has been observed at bench scale (less than 12 lb/d hydrogen), it would be imprudent to pursue a largescale demonstration without testing at least one intermediate scale, such as 100 lb/d hydrogen. Among its many gasifiers, the Energy & Environmental Research Center is home to the transport reactor demonstration unit (TRDU), a unit capable of firing 200 — 500 lb/hr of coal to produce 400 scfm of synthesis gas containing more than 200 lb/d of hydrogen. The TRDU and associated downstream processing equipment has demonstrated the capability of producing a syngas over a wide range of temperatures and contaminant levels — some of which approximate conditions of commercial-scale gasifiers. Until this activity, however, the maximum pressure of the TRDU’ s product syngas was 120 psig, well below the 400 + psig pressures of existing large gasifiers. This activity installed a high-temperature compressor capable of accepting the range of TRDU products up to 450 °F and compressing them to 500 psig, a pressure comparable to some large scale gasifiers. Thus, with heating or cooling downstream of the TRDU compressor, the unit is now able to present a near-raw to clean gasifier synthesis gas containing more than 100 lb/d of hydrogen at up to 500 psig over a wide range of temperatures to hydrogen separation membranes or other equipment for development and demonstration...|$|E
