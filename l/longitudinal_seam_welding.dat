This article describes the causes of this serious organizational failure with a view to learning by other organizations that operate hazardous facilities. The rupture occurred when a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> failed. The weld had been poorly made at the time the pipeline was fabricated and installed in 1956. The line had not been inspected or tested since that time. While the details are specific to the case at hand, organizational lessons are valid for other organizations operating complex sociotechnical systems that face the problem of sleeping or latent faults that can remain dormant for many years. This analysis focuses on the organizational arrangements that led to such ineffective integrity management, in particular how the potential for an event such as the one that occurred was systematically ignored by the operating company for many years. The key to effective management of the potential for disaster is to ensure that risk management does not become a "fantasy" but remains grounded in the reality of the dangers that the assets pose to workers, the public, and to the organization itself...|$|R
40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central <b>longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above.

40|$|Extrusion {{through the}} {{porthole}} die is a predominant forming process {{used in the}} production of hollow aluminum alloy profiles across the aluminum extrusion industry. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> formed during the process may negatively influence the quality of extruded profiles.

40|$|Abstract. A {{detailed}} analysis of metal flow through a porthole die to produce a rectangular hollow aluminium profile was performed by means of three-dimensional FE simulation using DEFORM 3 D. It was aimed at revealing the flow patterns of a medium-strength aluminium alloy 7020 through a porthole die and gaining an insight into the formation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> inside the <b>welding</b> chamber during extrusion. In the case of extruding a rectangular hollow profile through a porthole die with four ports, two neighbouring ports were different from each other. Using an FE model including these two ports, different flow patterns of two individual metal streams were revealed. The 3 D FE simulation also showed how two unequal metal streams contacted each other and became bonded in the welding chamber under a certain hydrostatic pressure and at a certain temperature, before the metal flew through the die bearing. The difference in velocity between the metal streams led to uneven flow at the die bearing and thus a wavy extrusion nose...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>Seam</b> <b>welds</b> {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow extrusion profile type which has <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, only a slight change was observed in <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength. Hardness values of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region were lower than the main material’s hardness values, but higher than the defective region’s.

It describes the <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets. The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod (CP Mo or AISI 304) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure. As soon as the distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet, an axial force was applied. After an initial dwell time, the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length, thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets. Multi-track and multi-metal <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of high temperature metallic sheets, AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloys, Cp Cu, Ti 6 Al 4 V and low temperature metallic sheets, AA 6061 were obtained.

Tensile- shear testing showed that the <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA 6061 was weaker due to softening.

40|$|Abstract. Porthole die {{extrusion}} of lightweight alloys is {{used for}} the production of profiles, which may have complex cross section geometries. The mechanical properties of these profiles are deeply affected by the <b>seam</b> <b>welds,</b> which are generated in hollow profiles along the whole length. The <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> result from the rejoining of the material streams in the welding chamber of the porthole die. The joining phase and hence the <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> quality are strongly influenced by the temperature and the pressure conditions in the welding chamber. Those process conditions can be adjusted by a proper die design. In this work, the focus lies on the feeder section of the extrusion die, which consists of a set of bridges, whose shapes influence the material entry in the welding chamber. A numerical study was carried out to investigate different bridge shapes with regard to the pressure inside the welding chamber and the punch load. Subsequently, the volume of the bridge was fixed to isolate and better investigate the influence of the shape. It was observed that bridge designs leading to higher flow distortion cause higher pressure decrement along the welding plane and, consequently, degradation of the welding conditions...|$|R

It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot <b>welding,</b> <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly <b>welded</b> structure. Most <b>seam</b> welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|R
40|$|It is {{essential}} in damage tolerance design to determine the stress intensity factor theoretically. The stress intensity factor for a cracked plate that is reinforced with a sheet by <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> is determined theoretically and plotted as function of the <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> location and stiffness ratio. The singular integral equation is derived based on the compatibility condition between the cracked plate and the reinforcement plate, and it is solved by means of Erdogan and Gupta‘s method. The theory is verified {{by comparing the results}} of the present analysis with those of a numerical analysis. The results from the present analysis show that the reinforcement effect improves as the welding line is situated closer to the crack and as the stiffness ratio of the cracked plate and the reinforcement plate increases...|$|R
