5|$|Like Eliurus, Voalavo has {{moderately}} high-crowned (hypsodont) molars with crowns that consist not {{of discrete}} cusps, but of transverse <b>laminae</b> (plates) that generally lack longitudinal connections. However, Eliurus molars are slightly more hypsodont {{than those of}} Voalavo. The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in Voalavo than in Eliurus. Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete <b>laminae</b> in Voalavo, and the lower third molar has only two <b>laminae</b> (three in Eliurus). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors are orthodont (with their {{cutting edge}} {{perpendicular}} to the plane formed by the molars) and have yellow to light orange enamel. On the lower incisor, the enamel contains series of fine ridges. The toothrows are longer than in eastern voalavo. As in Eliurus, the molars are incipiently hypsodont (high-crowned) and the individual cusps have lost their identities, having merged into transverse <b>laminae</b> that are not connected longitudinally. There are three <b>laminae</b> on each first and second molar, two on the third lower molar, and the <b>laminae</b> cannot be differentiated on the third upper molar. Although {{the first and second}} molars are similar to each other in size, the third (upper and lower) molars are conspicuously smaller. There are three roots below each upper and two below each lower molar.|$|E
5|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour. The <b>laminae</b> are {{generally}} obovate to orbicular, between 5.5 and 13centimeters (2–5in.) long and supported by a 1 to 3.5centimetre (⅜–1⅜in.) petiole.|$|E

50|$|This is {{transitional}} tissue {{composed of}} two zones, the <b>lamina</b> lucida and <b>lamina</b> densa. The <b>lamina</b> lucida appears as a low density clear zone medial to the epithelial basal cells. The <b>lamina</b> densa has a greater density of filaments and is adjacent to the <b>lamina</b> propria. The basal <b>lamina</b> or BMZ mainly provides physical support to the epithelim through anchoring fibers and is essential for repair of the epithelium.|$|R
5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its <b>laminae</b> to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These {{are attracted}} by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, and upon alighting {{on the plant}} adhere to the sticky drops of mucilage. Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their <b>laminae.</b> The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping <b>laminae.</b> The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
40|$|On histologic {{vertical}} {{sections of}} skin, the epidermis {{is separated from}} the dermis by an amorphous thin membrane, the basal <b>lamina.</b> Ultrastructurally, the basal <b>lamina</b> is composed of four areas, including the basal-cell plasma membrane and hemidesmosomes, the <b>lamina</b> incida, the <b>lamina</b> densa, and the sub-lamina densa fibrillar region. In culture, epidermal keratinocytes are able to produce hemidesmosomes, <b>lamina</b> lucida, and <b>lamina</b> densa. There {{is no evidence that}} cultured keratinocytes can produce sub-lamina densa fibrils. Biochemically, the <b>lamina</b> lucida contains two major glycoproteins. One, the bullous pemphigoid antigen, is synthesized by epidermal keratinocytes in vitro. These cells also synthesize laminin, the other glycoprotein of <b>lamina</b> lucida. At the interface between <b>lamina</b> lucida and <b>lamina</b> densa there is probably a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Whether this proteoglycan is produced by keratinocytes in culture is not known, but the possibility can be considered. <b>Lamina</b> densa contains collagen IV, and this collagen is synthesized by keratinocytes in culture. However, cultured keratinocytes may also synthesize collagen types I, III, and V. Type V is associated with the basal <b>lamina,</b> but its exact location is unknown. Types I and III (if they are produced in vivo) would be situated in the sub-basal <b>lamina</b> region. The problem of fibronectin remains unsolved. There is “some” fibronectin in the <b>lamina</b> lucida, but its origin is not clear...|$|R
50|$|Anchoring fibrils (composed {{largely of}} type VII collagen) extend from the basal <b>lamina</b> of {{epithelial}} cells and {{attach to the}} <b>lamina</b> reticularis (also known as the reticular <b>lamina)</b> by wrapping around the reticular fiber (collagen III) bundles. The basal <b>lamina</b> and <b>lamina</b> reticularis together make up the basement membrane. Anchoring fibrils {{are essential to the}} functional integrity of the dermoepidermal junction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Composite <b>lamina</b> {{is widely}} used {{in a variety of}} applications. The <b>laminas</b> used are of {{different}} shapes. Based on the shape of the <b>laminas</b> its mechanical behavior also changes. <b>Laminas</b> that are tapered along a single direction {{are one of the most}} commonly used. We can analyze these <b>laminas</b> by considering them as a set of regular <b>laminas</b> of varying lengths arranged one above the other. This paper gives an alternative set of formulae that can be used to determine the mechanical behavior of such <b>laminas.</b> The formulae speak about the manner in which the tapered <b>lamina</b> deforms along each axis. A Compliance matrix will be formulated specifically for the analysis of composite tapered <b>laminas.</b> For this paper the data obtained from the derived formulae is verified against the data obtained from already existing FEA software like ABAQUS...|$|R
5|$|The hoof of {{the horse}} {{contains}} over a dozen different structures, including bones, cartilage, tendons and tissues. The coffin or pedal bone is the major hoof bone, supporting {{the majority of the}} weight. Under the coffin bone is the navicular bone, itself cushioned by the navicular bursa, a fluid-filled sac. The digital cushion is a blood vessel-filled structure located {{in the middle of the}} hoof, which assists with blood flow throughout the leg. At the top of the hoof wall is the corium, tissue which continually produces the horn of the outer hoof shell, which is in turn protected by the periople, a thin outer layer which prevents the interior structures from drying out. The wall is connected to the coffin bone by sensitive <b>laminae,</b> a flexible layer which helps to suspend and protect the coffin bone. The main tendon in the hoof is the deep digital flexor tendon, which connects to the bottom of the coffin bone. The impact zone on the bottom of the hoof includes the sole, which has an outer, insensitive layer and a sensitive inner layer, and the frog, which lies between the heels and assists in shock absorption and blood flow. The final structures are the lateral cartilages, connected to the upper coffin bone, which act as the flexible heels, allowing hoof expansion. These structures allow the hoof to perform many functions. It acts as a support and traction point, shock absorber and system for pumping blood back through the lower limb.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{of human}} {{diabetic}} glomerulosclerosis with a newly devleoped guanidine method have revealed that, like renal tubules, thickening of the glomerular capillary basal <b>lamina</b> is due exclusively to inordinate accumulation of the epithelial basal <b>lamina.</b> There is no excessive deposition of the endothelial basal <b>lamina.</b> Thus, the diabetic nephropathy {{is characterized by}} a diffuse thickening of the epithelial basal <b>lamina</b> involving the entire nephron unit, a feature distinct from peripheral diabetic microangiopathy, where the endothelial basal <b>lamina</b> plays a predominant role. The nodular and diffuse mesangial sclerosis is composed of increased mesangial basal <b>lamina,</b> there is no evidence indicating collapsed capillary epithelial basal <b>lamina</b> within Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.

50|$|The <b>lamina</b> densa was {{formerly}} known as the basal <b>lamina.</b> The terms basal <b>lamina</b> and basement membrane were often used interchangeably, until it was realised that all three layers seen with the electron microscope represent the single layer seen with the light microscope.

30|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the performance of Sugi <b>lamina</b> impregnated with low-molecular weight phenolic (LMWP) resin using the full cell process followed by curing at high temperature. In this study, penetration of LMWP resin into finger-jointed <b>lamina</b> was examined. Physical and mechanical properties, such as surface hardness, dimensional stability, bending and shear strength of LMWP-resin-treated and untreated <b>lamina</b> were investigated. In addition, the bonding quality and nail-withdrawal resistance of 3 -ply assembly specimen made from LMWP-resin-treated and untreated <b>lamina</b> bonded using resorcinol–phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive were also investigated. The main results were as follows: LMWP resin was found to have penetrated sufficiently into finger-jointed <b>lamina.</b> The physical properties of LMWP-resin-treated <b>lamina</b> were found to have improved significantly in comparison with untreated <b>lamina.</b> However, no significant difference was found between LMWP-resin-treated and untreated <b>lamina</b> in terms of their mechanical properties. There was an improvement in bonding quality of the assembly made from LMWP-resin-treated <b>lamina</b> when compared with that made from untreated <b>lamina.</b> In the assembly made from untreated <b>lamina,</b> a significant decrease in nail-withdrawal resistance was observed between dry conditions test and after humidity conditioning test. However, the same tendency was not found in the assembly made from LMWP-resin-treated <b>lamina.</b>|$|R
25|$|Separating the {{anterior}} horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum: a thin, triangular, vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum {{down to the}} fornix. During the third month of fetal development, a space forms between two septal <b>laminae,</b> known as the cave of septum pellucidum (CSP), which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment. During the fifth month of development, the <b>laminae</b> start to close and this closure completes from about {{three to six months}} after birth. Fusion of the septal <b>laminae</b> is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus, amygdala, septal nuclei, fornix, corpus callosum and other midline structures. Lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior-to-anterior fusion, resulting in the continuation of the CSP into adulthood.|$|E

40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} are to determine allometric relationships between petiole mass and <b>lamina</b> mass, area, and volume in different bioclimatic zones and {{to detect the}} effect of plant functional types on the relationships. Methods Typical and zonal mature forests were selected from boreal Huzhong, temperate Changbai Mountain, warm-temperate Dongling Mountain, subtropical Gutian Mountain, Shennongjia and Dujiangyan in China, and one 1 hm 2 plot was investigated at each site. Traits of <b>lamina</b> and petiole of the dominant woody species were measured in August 2009. The relationship between <b>lamina</b> and <b>lamina</b> support was analyzed by the Standardized Major Axis estimation (model type II regression) with software (S) MATR Version 2. 0. Important findings Statistically significant allometric scaling relationships were found between petiole mass and <b>lamina</b> mass, area, and volume in all functional types and climate zones, with common slopes of 0. 82, 0. 70 and 0. 80, respectively, all of which significantly departed from 1. 0. Shrubs had greater <b>lamina</b> volume at a given petiole mass than trees, but the <b>lamina</b> mass and area they support were not significantly different. Evergreen species were observed to have greater <b>lamina</b> mass and <b>lamina</b> volume than deciduous ones, whereas deciduous species had a greater <b>lamina</b> area at a given petiole mass than evergreen ones. With the exception of Shennongjia, the species in subtropical sites {{were found to have}} greater <b>lamina</b> mass, <b>lamina</b> area, and <b>lamina</b> volume than temperate sites at a given petiole mass. However, the petiolar support efficiency in the subtropical climate of Shennongjia was close to sites in temperate climate. Our results indicate that the petiole constrains the maximization of <b>lamina</b> size (including mass, area and volume) and that the allometric relationship between <b>lamina</b> and <b>lamina</b> support varies with plant functional type, climate and habitat...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the shape}} of the nuclear <b>lamina</b> are {{exhibited}} in senescent cells, as well as in cells expressing mutations in <b>lamina</b> genes. To identify cells with defects in the nuclear <b>lamina</b> we developed an imaging method that quantifies the intensity and curvature of the nuclear <b>lamina.</b> We show that this method accurately describes changes in the nuclear <b>lamina.</b> Spatial changes in nuclear <b>lamina</b> coincide with redistribution of lamin A proteins and local reduction in protein mobility in senescent cell. We suggest that local accumulation of lamin A in the nuclear envelope leads to bending of the structure. A quantitative distinction of the nuclear <b>lamina</b> shape in cell populations was found between fresh and senescent cells, and between primary myoblasts from young and old donors. Moreover, with this method mutations in <b>lamina</b> genes were significantly distinct from cells with wild-type genes. We suggest that this method can be applied to identify abnormal cells during aging, in in vitro propagation, and in <b>lamina</b> disorders...|$|R
25|$|Upward fining facies {{successions}} {{within the}} Members are characterised by planar laminated, ripple-bedded and cross-bedded sandstones with abundant intraformational rip-up clasts, exotic clasts and water escape structures.

25|$|The leaf {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. orchidioides are smooth, rigid, and succulent, and {{generally}} green in color. The <b>laminae</b> are generally ovate to lanceolate, between 20 and 46millimeters (2–5in.) long and 6–18millimeters wide, and have deeply involute margins. These are supported by 10–30millimeter petioles with ciliate margins.|$|E
25|$|Colouration {{is highly}} variable. The <b>laminae</b> and {{petioles}} are often green throughout when produced in shaded conditions and red to purple in plants exposed to direct sunlight.

50|$|The basal <b>lamina</b> layer {{can further}} {{be divided into}} two layers. The clear layer closer to the {{epithelium}} is called the <b>lamina</b> lucida, while the dense layer closer to the connective tissue is called the <b>lamina</b> densa. The electron-dense <b>lamina</b> densa membrane is about 30-70 nanometers thick, and consists of an underlying network of reticular collagen IV fibrils which average 30 nanometers in diameter and 0.1-2 micrometers in thickness. In addition to collagen, this supportive matrix contains intrinsic macromolecular components. The <b>lamina</b> densa, whose collagen IV fibers are coated with the heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan perlecan, and the <b>lamina</b> lucida (made up of laminin, integrins, entactins, and dystroglycans) together make up the basal <b>lamina.</b>|$|R

In order to investigate {{the characteristics of the}} phenomenon based on the presence/absence of the <b>lamina</b> dura and radiolucency below the crown, we studied the relationship between 58 men and 43 women with a <b>lamina</b> dura without radiolucency, 12 men and 8 women without a <b>lamina</b> dura with radiolucency, 34 men and 16 women without a <b>lamina</b> dura without radiolucency, and the status of teeth in the ipsilateral mandible. Subjects without a <b>lamina</b> dura without radiolucency were significantly older than those with a <b>lamina</b> dura without radiolucency in both men (P < 0. 0001) and women (P < 0. 01), indicating different chronological causes.

25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} {{laid down in}} layers called beds or strata. A bed {{is defined as a}} layer of rock that has a uniform {{lithology}} and texture. Beds form by the deposition of layers of sediment on top of each other. The sequence of beds that characterizes sedimentary rocks is called bedding. Single beds can be a couple of centimetres to several meters thick. Finer, less pronounced layers are called <b>laminae,</b> and the structure it forms in a rock is called lamination. <b>Laminae</b> are usually less than a few centimetres thick. Though bedding and lamination are often originally horizontal in nature, this is not always the case. In some environments, beds are deposited at a (usually small) angle. Sometimes multiple sets of layers with different orientations exist in the same rock, a structure called cross-bedding. Cross-bedding forms when small-scale erosion occurs during deposition, cutting off part of the beds. Newer beds then form at an angle to older ones.|$|E
