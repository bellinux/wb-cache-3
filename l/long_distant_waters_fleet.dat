The present study critically reviews trends in <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing as well as identifies those tropical host countries most dependent on fishing agreements. It is shown that traditional, more responsible <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleets</b> (DWFs) are being displaced by less responsible, low-cost DWFs and that the most vulnerable host countries are small coastal states with large exclusive economic zones that lack the ability to benefit from value adding processes associated with fishing.

50|$|Britain's {{negotiating}} position was {{complicated by the}} conflicting interest of the inshore and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishermen. The Scottish fleet had {{a strong interest in}} seeing the exclusive 12 mile (22.2 km) limit retained; but the UK Government was also pressed by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleet,</b> mainly, but not solely based on the east coast of England, which wanted to continue fishing off Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands. The <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishermen were, of course, strongly opposed to any extension of territorial waters of any country, including the UK. The drama of the cod war with Iceland was still to come, with Britain’s attempt to protect the interests of its <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleet.</b> Compromise was reached when it was agreed that the applicant countries would retain their 6-mile (11 km) exclusive limits, and their 12 mi limits subject to existing historical rights, for substantial parts of their coastline, preventing continental European vessels fishing in much of the Scottish west coast, including all of the Minch and Irish Sea. These limits have been renewed in legislation on two occasions, and although these rights are not a permanent feature of the policy, it is unlikely now that they will ever be extinguished, especially {{in the light of the}} need to conserve fish stocks.|$|R

The USSR is planning to further expand its efforts by implementing a multifaceted strategy to increase {{the quantity and quality of}} fish and fish products. However, future expansion is unlikely. The 1990 's will be a challenging decade for the Soviet fishing industry. Fish will remain a source of much sought after hard currency and food, but the prospects for the optimistic growth forecasted by the Soviet government are not realistic. Despite the current profitability of this industry, several factors limit future growth of this sector, including restricted Soviet access to coastal fisheries, depleted stocks worldwide, as well as the high cost of open ocean fishing operations. In addition, there is pressure for global conservation for many of the stocks targeted by the Soviet <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleet.</b> This has led to the increase of regional management schemes in the South Pacific, East Caribbean, and the Antarctic which effectively close off most new areas of expansion to the USSR.

40|$|Relations between coastal {{countries}} and fishing fleets from non-adjacent countries changed radically in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. This {{was primarily a}} consequence of the declaration of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) by many coastal states in the years leading up to the close of the negotiations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. Most significantly, by recognizing the right of coastal states to determine how their waters were to be exploited, the UNCLOS provided a legal basis and economic motivation for the negotiation of access agreements between coastal states and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing <b>fleets.</b> This paper examines some of the economic issues which arise out of such agreements, particularly as they relate to relations between relatively poor coastal states and fishing fleets from richer non-adjacent countries.

Factors related to the characteristics of the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleet</b> (ie, relative discard rates, fleet infractions, changes in fleet efficiency, and the mobility of the fleet) and the characteristics of the coastal country (ie, public debt and discount rates, capital constraints, access to overseas markets, and national political considerations) are examined in order to cast light on the incentives for signing the agreements.

40|$|Pacific cod {{have been}} {{exploited}} in Alaska for over 100 years. Originally, the fishery was exploited in coastal waters by U. S. fishermen. This domestic fishery declined following World War I, ceasing {{by the early}} 1950 's.

Pacific cod was primarily an incidental species in the harvests of these fleets. In recent years a U. S. cod fishery has redeveloped and is rapidly expanding. Coincidental to the renewed interest in a directed U. S. cod fishery has been a strong increase in Pacific cod abundance. Most of the increase {{appears to have been}} due to the occurrence of an exceptionally strong 1977 year-class. Since cod is becoming a major commercial fishery in the northeastern Pacific Ocean it is important to develop long term estimates of yield and accompanying management strategies.

40|$|Globally, {{consumers}} are increasingly relying on {{goods and services}} produced in other countries. This is particularly true for fish products, nearly 40 % of world fish production is currently traded globally. Thus, there now exists a clear disconnect between resource harvesters and resource consumers. This research is concerned with an assessment of fisheries exploitation patterns based on consumption as a complement to assessment based on fisheries catch. Such research requires an examination of two primary modes of fish acquisition: the operation of a country’s domestic fishing fleets, i. e., its landings and the purchase of fish caught by foreign fleets, i. e., its fish import. Japanese fish consumption {{will be used as}} a case study.

A new sustainable development assessment method is proposed and {{is applied to}} Senegal’s marine fishery {{in order to provide}} these recommendations. A discussion of the conditions for sustainable development suggest that the sustainable development of fisheries is dependent upon complex interdependencies between heterogeneous factors. These interdependencies lead to the assumption that assessing the sustainable development status of fishery systems should rely upon descriptive multi-criterion assessments. The proposed multi-criterion assessment evaluates the sustainable development consequences of the activities of three user groups frequenting Senegal’s marine fishery. These groups are the local artisanal group, the local industrial group and the European Union <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleets</b> which were present in Senegalese waters until June 2006. The results of this evaluation show that the heterogeneity of the user groups frequenting Senegal’s marine fishery system can be capitalised upon through allocating fishery access in accord with each group’s ability to generate sustainable development benefits, while taking policy action to mitigate their negative impacts. On the basis of these findings the article makes three key policy recommendations for the sustainable development of Senegals’s marine fishery.

Consequently, it {{is required}} by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to rent these un-exploited resources to <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleets</b> (DWFs) from other nations through access agreements. We present an analysis of access agreements signed between DWFs and the Republic of Madagascar valid in 2011. All agreements were appraised based on a number of criteria, including reporting requirements, fees, observers, restrictions and bycatch limits. Our findings highlight consistent severe shortcomings, in particular with regards to the contractual obligations and accountability of DWFs in reporting catches which result in signatories having no disincentive for over-exploitation and illegal fishing. Our analysis shows that of a total of seven agreements authorizing fishing by 170 vessels, only one agreement has a quota in place. Only two require mandatory inspection before a fishing campaign. One agreement is exempt from having any observers on boats and the European Union, whose fleet accounts the majority of licensed vessels (124), does not address the issue of bycatch. Our findings highlight many of the challenges faced by coastal developing nations in renting their fisheries resources. Whilst it is widely recognized that such states need assistance in improving MCS capacity, our analysis suggests that technical assistance in contract development and negotiation should be a fundamental pre-requisite to establishing a fair and sustainable fisheries access agreement framework...|$|R

Combined with the non-random distribution of observer effort throughout the area, this leads to severe restrictions in the ability to make estimates of overall seabird bycatch. An improvement in the level and spread of observer coverage would greatly enhance ability of WCPFC to estimate the seabird mortality in its fisheries, and to effectively reduce seabird bycatch. • Models combining fishing effort data, available bycatch rates and seabird distributions have been used to determine overall seabird bycatch within ICCAT longline fisheries (Klaer et al. 2008).

A fourfold increase was noted in standardized effort over the period 1960 – 72.

Decreases in fishing effort were effected with the implementation of extended jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977; however, several major stocks had collapsed by that time. Fundamental changes were noted in the production levels on Georges Bank during the period 1960 – 76. Declines in overall production can be attributed largely to the collapse of the herring population by 1976 – 77 under heavy exploitation. Recent increases in biomass of elasmobranchs and principal pelagic species (herring and mackerel) have resulted in further shifts in system structure.

Median age and length at maturity by sex for the 1970 – 96 year-classes was estimated by using logistic regression. Both age and length at maturity have significantly declined during the past 25 years. Mean length at age did not show significant trends for the time series. Stepwise logistic regression with interaction was used to determine if such factors as cod stock biomass and bottom temperature explain variation in maturation rates. Regressions were performed by aggregating all year-classes for each sex. Both stock biomass and temperature explained a significant amount of the variation (P< 0. 05) in sexual maturation. The influence of stock biomass was similar for both stocks, but bottom temperature had a slightly greater and opposite influence on maturation for Gulf of Maine cod than for Georges Bank cod.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Three related topics {{have been}} {{explored}} in this thesis. Those three topics {{deal with the}} pricing problems both {{in the market for}} access rights to fish and in the market for seafood. The {{purpose of this study is}} to contribute some insights into the global picture of fishery management and the market for seafood. As the consequence of the 200 -mile EEZs claims, many coastal nations and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleets</b> have been looking for cooperative fishing arrangements and the market for access rights is emerging. By using a linear control model, the study has demonstrated that the maximum present value of net revenue derived from the resource is negatively related with the discount rate under the sole owner assumption. This finding provides some help both in analyzing the coastal nations' and <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fleets' competitive abilities and in examining how prices are determined in the market for access. Most seafood at the retail level is sold to consumers through supermarkets that are multiproduct sellers and have some monopoly power. This study has explored the Redacted for Privacy pricing strategy of a multiproduct monopolist, examined the difference in the comparative statics as between the single and multiproduct monopolist, and provided a conceptual explanation for a phenomenon in the seafood industry: purchase restrictions imposed by seafood processors on fishermen. Tying selling is a specific pricing strategy used by many multiproduct sellers. In the literature on tying sales, one issue that has received little attention is tying sales as a reaction to price controls. This study has demonstrated (a) how a competitively supplied good can be used as a tying good and how it works under price controls, (b) how tying sales arrangements under price controls can be used as a price discrimination tool to increase the monopolist's profits, in addition to be used in evasion of price controls, and (c) how the pure bundling pricing may dominate mixed bundling pricing in most circumstances under price controls...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{adoption}} of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) in 1982, the right of states to fish in the seas was in a remarkable state of flux. States unilaterally and arbitrarily declared for themselves preposterous breadths of the sea as coming under their exclusive fishing jurisdictions. Waters off the coast of developing countries also came under unregulated large scale fishing by the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing <b>fleets</b> of developed countries, giving rise to resource over-exploitation. The LOSC {{in a number of ways}} infused stability and certainty in the fishing rights of states and enhanced the chances for the optimum utilisation of world fisheries. This article examines the various ways the LOSC has stabilised and enhanced fishing rights among states. It argues that although the Convention creates opportunities for the protection and optimal utilisation of fishery resources among developing countries of the world, these countries have yet to take advantage of the Convention opportunities due to numerous challenges, endogenous and exogenous, confronting them...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. <b>Distant</b> <b>Water</b> Tuna <b>Fleet</b> (DWTF) {{has grown}} {{significantly}} from 14 vessels in 2006 {{to a total}} of 39 vessels in 2012. This report looks at fatal and non-fatal traumatic injuries among workers in the DWTF and provides recommendations for preventing future injuries and fatalities. The report provides a baseline assessment of the current injury and fatality rates for this fleet, and outlines specific recommendations for employers and workers to improve safety. This report helps to identify critical areas of concern for this fleet and makes recommendations that will help vessel owners make the necessary improvements {{to ensure the safety of}} the workers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the federal government agency responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. Commercial fishing is consistently one of the most dangerous occupations in the US, with a rate of 117 fatalities per 100, 000 workers reported during 2012, 36 times higher than the average workplace fatality rate of 3. 2 per 100, 000 [BLS 2013]. NIOSH maintains the Commercial Fishing Incident Database (CFID) and has published a series of reports on commercial fishing fatalities from 2000 to 2009 in four US regions: Alaska, West Coast, East Coast, and the Gulf of Mexico [NIOSH 2010 a, b,c,d]. These reports outline the hazards of particular fisheries located within the regions and highlight the need to create interventions that focus on problems found in these specific fleets. However, these reports do not include the US <b>Distant</b> <b>Water</b> Tuna <b>Fleet</b> (DWTF), which operates far from the US West Coast in the Pacific Ocean. The <b>Distant</b> <b>Water</b> Tuna <b>Fleet</b> (also known as the US Purse Seine Fleet) is licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, which has since been amended and reaffirmed [16 USC 1 973]. The number of vessels operating in the fleet has increased from 14 in 2006 {{to a total of}} 39 vessels operating in 2012. Compared with other US commercial fishing catcher vessels, the DWTF vessels are the largest in terms of both vessel size (average length: 214. 5 ft, range: 17422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 260 ft) and number of crew (28 members average, range: 2022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 40). The fleet is also the only US fishing fleet allowed to have licensed foreign officers (other than the master) to occupy key leadership positions such as that of mate and chief engineer on the vessel [CGMTA 2006]. Since March 2007, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have submitted annual reports to Congress on the activities of the DWTF, as required by the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Public Law 109 - 241, Section 421). These reports enumerate active vessels, fish landings (amount of fish caught), foreign crew officer exemptions, and known vessel disasters and fatalities [Department of Homeland Security, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013]. In 2012, the USCG asked NIOSH to conduct a systematic review of DWTF fatal and non-fatal traumatic injuries similar to the regional analyses of other US fleets previously mentioned in order to make a baseline assessment, compare mortality rates with other US fisheries, and to provide recommendations to prevent future injuries and fatalities...|$|R
40|$|Overexploitation {{of marine}} {{resources}} {{has led to}} declining catches in many countries worldwide, and often also leads to fishing effort being exported to waters of neighboring countries or high seas areas. Thailand is currently under pressure to curb illegal fishing and human rights violations within its <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> <b>fleets</b> or face a European Union import ban. Simultaneously, Thailand is attempting to reduce fishing effort within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Crucial to these endeavors is a comprehensive knowledge of total fisheries catches over time. A reconstruction of fisheries catches within Thailand's EEZ and by Thailand's fleet in neighboring countries' EEZs was undertaken for 1950 – 2014 to derive a comprehensive historical time series of total catches. This includes landings and discards that were not accounted for in official, reported statistics. Reconstructed Thai catches from within Thailand's EEZ increased from approximately 400, 000 t·year− 1 in 1950 to a peak of 2. 6 million t·year− 1 in 1987, before declining to around 1. 7 million t·year− 1 in 2014. Catches taken by Thai vessels outside their own EEZ increased from 52, 000 t·year− 1 in 1965 to a peak of 7. 6 million t·year− 1 in 1996, before declining to around 3. 7 million t·year− 1 by 2014. In total, reconstructed catches were estimated to be nearly three times larger than data reported by Thailand to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Reconstructed Thai distant-water fleet catches were almost seven {{times higher than the}} comparable non-domestic catch deemed reported for Thailand. Thai landings from recreational fishing were conservatively estimated for the first time, and while they contributed less than 1 % of current catch, they can be expected to grow in volume and importance with increasing tourism. As Thailand takes measures to reduce fishing effort within its EEZs and increases monitoring and enforcement of illegal and foreign fishing, it should take note of the present catch reconstruction as a comprehensive historical foundation that can point to needed improvements in data collection, policy development, and monitoring and enforcement...|$|R
40|$|Billfish {{have greater}} value as living targets for non-consumptive, or {{minimally}} consumptive, recreational fisheries {{than they do}} as either directed catch or by-catch species in commercial fleets. The pilot projects seek a Coasian {{solution to this problem}} through private funding mechanisms. The angler sector has a high willingness to pay for access to the billfish resource and the plan is to develop a mechanism to generate self-sustaining private investment in the sustainable management of highly migratory billfish stocks in the areas within and beyond national jurisdictions. These investments will include improved monitoring, control and surveillance as well as investments in education and gear modifications for the small scale fleets that harvest billfish. It is hoped that these investments in billfish friendly gear modifications will pay livelihood dividends through improved catch rates for billfish in the recreational fishery, improved commercial fish quality and access to high value supply chains for harvest other than billfish and reduced congestion and conflict between sectors. It is also hoped that the project will address the increase in fishing capacity brought by an explosion anchored FADs in the region and their use in a new and growing fishery that targets billfish. As the MCS and governance capacity in the region grows, it is hoped that the same types of policies can be expanded to the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> longline <b>fleets</b> that have substantial billfish bycatch...|$|R
40|$|Neoliberalism is a {{political}} economy term that refers to a public policy mix that is market oriented, pro trade liberalization and advocates minimal state intervention in the economy. Japanese governance has arguably not been based on neoliberal principles, and some see this as contributing to Japan’s long running recession. Japan’s <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> tuna longline <b>fleet</b> has been in economic difficulties since {{the early years of}} the recession. In 2001 Prime Minister Koizumi came to power promising neoliberal style reform. This paper presents a history of government involvement in the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> tuna longline industry and looks for evidence that recent reforms have changed this involvement; both in terms of observable changes to governance structures, and of key stakeholders’ receptiveness to neoliberalism as visible in their representations of issues facing tuna fisheries. We find that very few neoliberal reforms have been implemented in this sector. Furthermore key stakeholders show little sympathy with neoliberal policy prescriptions, meaning they are unlikely to champion such reforms. This conclusion may be specific to fisheries since in Japan the political importance of food production and the iconic status of fish cuisine make the sector particularly susceptible to economic nationalism. In examining relations between industry and government the paper also highlights problems in Japan’s co-management of fisheries. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} a group of eight Pacific Island coastal States in exercising their sovereign rights for the EEZ {{to take control of the}} tuna fishery and reduce dominance of the <b>distant</b> <b>water</b> fishing <b>fleets.</b> The group is established under the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries Common Interest, with the membership including the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Known widely as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, the group has adopted a cooperative framework and work together to establish a number of instruments to facilitate the co-ordination and harmonisation the management of the common fish stocks within their EEZs. In doing this, the Parties to the Nauru Agreement were asserting and protecting their sovereign rights, creating economic opportunities for their people, and conserving and managing the tuna fish stock. The thesis argues that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement has taken control of their tuna fishery through the introduction of the instruments such as the minimum terms and conditions for access under the First, Second and Third Implement Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement, the Palau Arrangement for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery to limit fishing effort and the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement for Regional Access which provide preferential treatment for the domestic and/or locally-based vessels. The thesis concludes that in order to maintain and/or strengthen the control the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have attained, the group needs to redefine its cooperative framework to cater for the different interests they have acquired...|$|R
