5|$|Green Lantern {{is located}} in the Boardwalk section of the park. Green Lantern is the third roller coaster to occupy this plot of land, {{following}} the Sarajevo Bobsled (which ran at Great Adventure from 1984 to 1988 before moving to Six Flags Great America and Great Escape) and the Great American Scream Machine (an Arrow Dynamics looping coaster which had occupied this area from 1989 to 2010). <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> American Scream Machine, the infield of Green Lantern is covered with gravel. The coaster also reuses the Scream Machine's queue area building.|$|E
5|$|The {{second group}} {{was made up}} of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country, which {{included}} the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last {{to come to terms with}} the British.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
25|$|Although Daytona Beach has a {{significantly}} lesser tornado risk than areas <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Plains and Midwest, {{there have been}} a few deadly and destructive tornadoes in the last 100 years in Daytona Beach area. Most recently, on February 22, 1998 a tornado killed 3 people, injured 70 people, and caused $31 million in damages.|$|E
25|$|In some faiths, {{a sacred}} female figure holds a central place in {{religious}} prayer and worship. For example, Shaktism, {{the worship of}} the female force that animates the world, {{is one of the}} three major sects of Hinduism. In Tibetan Buddhism, the highest advancement any person can achieve is to become <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> female Buddhas (e.g. Arya Tara), who are depicted as supreme protectors, fearless and filled with compassion for all beings.|$|E

25|$|The Panopticon of Science and Art, {{constructed}} in the square in 1854, also affected visitor numbers. The Panopticon was constructed by a consortium hoping {{to take advantage of}} the market for scientific and cultural attractions, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Globe it struggled to draw sufficient visitors. After two years the Panopticon closed down; it reopened shortly afterwards with the addition of a circus ring, but still proved to be uneconomical and quickly closed again. Renamed the Alhambra, it reopened as a theatre and music-hall in which form it endured until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Borrell II of Barcelona {{was facing}} major defeat from the Andalusian powers so {{he sent a}} {{delegation}} to Córdoba to request a truce. Bishop Atto {{was part of the}} delegation that met with Al-Hakam II of Cordoba, who received him with honor. Gerbert was fascinated by the stories of the Mozarab Christian Bishops and judges who dressed and talked like the Arabs, well-versed in mathematics and natural sciences <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> teachers of the Islamic madrasahs. This sparked Gerbert's veneration for the Arabs and his passion for mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
25|$|Williams' {{show was}} part ghost {{illusion}} theatre and part variety show. The artists he employed included actors, {{song and dance}} teams, magicians, ballet dancers, mummers and comedians <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Little Titch. He also hired international acts such as The Brothers LaFayette (American tight rope walkers) and Professor Howard (an American illusionist). By the early 1880s, Williams' show had {{many of the same}} trappings as a theatrical touring company. The show’s crew in Manchester {{at the time of the}} 1881 census consisted of a number of actors, actresses, comedians, musicians and comic singers, as well as a set decorator and a dramatic author.|$|E

50|$|In 1829 the Province of Prussia {{was created}} by the merger of the West Prussian and East Prussian provinces, lasting until 1878. Congruent with the Kingdom of Prussia proper (i.e. former Ducal and Royal Prussia), its {{territory}}, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> Polish territory of Posen, {{was not part of the}} German Confederation.|$|R
25|$|The Berggarten is an {{important}} European botanical garden. Some points of interest are the Tropical House, the Cactus House, the Canary House and the Orchid House, which hosts one of the world's biggest collection of orchids, and free-flying birds and butterflies. Near {{the entrance to the}} Berggarten is the historic Library Pavillon. The Mausoleum of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the Paradies and the Prairie Garden. There is also the Sea Life Centre Hanover, which is the first tropical aquarium in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Because Bernard's {{family had}} {{attachments}} to the monastery of Saint-Evroul-sur-Ouche, the monkish chronicler Orderic Vitalis of that foundation had special knowledge {{of him and}} his family, though this still does not reduce the general obscurity of his origins or his life when compared to the richer Marcher lords, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> Roger of Montgomery. Bernard was the son of the minor and incompetent Norman baron Geoffrey de Neufmarché and Ada de Hugleville, and he was born at the castle of Le-Neuf-Marché-en-Lions on the frontier between Normandy and Beauvais. His ancestors on his mother's side had founded the town of Aufay south of Dieppe on the Scie, while his paternal grandfather, Turketil had served the young William II of Normandy as a guardian and was killed in that capacity. On his mother's side he also descended from Richard II of Normandy.|$|E
25|$|The Historical Section {{was busy}} on {{a history of}} the Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) in August 1914 but work was {{suspended}} on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as a full-time secretary. Experience of writing the history of the South African War, showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain C. T. Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Retreat of 1914, when few were kept and that these had big gaps. Although the diaries would not show why events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology and that later they could be scrutinised to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material.|$|E

50|$|This tree's {{leaves are}} browsed upon by game and small {{livestock}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greater</b> Kudu and goats. In {{some areas of}} Namibia and Kenya, Vachellia reficiens subsp. reficiens is considered an invasive species as it can encroach on areas of farmland, especially on disturbed soil. It is very opportunistic and hardy and can subsequently take over large areas of native vegetation.|$|R
25|$|Although the Sui dynasty was {{relatively}} short (581-618), much was accomplished during its tenure. The Grand Canal {{was one of}} the main accomplishments. It was extended north from the Hangzhou region across the Yangzi to Yangzhou and then northwest to the region of Luoyang. Again, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Wall works, the massive conscription of labor and allocation of resources for the Grand Canal project resulted in challenges for Sui dynastic continuity. The eventual fall of the Sui dynasty was also due to the many losses caused by the failed military campaigns against Goguryeo. It was after these defeats and losses that the country was left in ruins and rebels soon took control of the government. Emperor Yang was assassinated in 618. He had gone South after the capital being threatened by various rebel groups and was killed by his advisors (Yuwen Clan). Meanwhile, in the North, the aristocrat Li Yuan (李淵) held an uprising after which he ended up ascending the throne to become Emperor Gaozu of Tang. This was the start of the Tang dynasty, one of the most-noted dynasties in Chinese history.|$|E
500|$|The badge is worn {{suspended}} {{from a small}} gold link from the riband at the right hip, and is sometimes known as [...] "the Lesser George". <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> George, the badge shows St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon, but it is flatter and gold. In earlier times, the badge was worn from a ribbon tied around the neck.|$|E
500|$|Cyclones are {{not unique}} to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on Jovian planets, such as the Small Dark Spot on Neptune. It is about one third the {{diameter}} of the Great Dark Spot and received the nickname [...] "Wizard's Eye" [...] because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud {{in the middle of the}} Wizard's Eye. Mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms. Jovian storms <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Red Spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.|$|E
60|$|The {{objects of}} the Druid worship were many. In this respect {{they did not}} differ from other heathens: but it must be owned that in general their ideas of divine matters were more exalted than those of the Greeks and Romans, and that they did not fall into an idolatry so coarse and vulgar. That their gods should be {{represented}} under a human form they thought derogatory to beings uncreated and imperishable. To confine what can endure no limits within walls and roofs they judged absurd and impious. In these particulars there was something refined and suitable enough to a just idea of the Divinity. But the rest was not equal. Some notions they had, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> part of mankind, of a Being eternal and infinite; but they also, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> part of mankind, paid their worship to inferior objects, from the nature of ignorance and superstition always tending downwards.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{parts of}} 4 Baruch {{appear to have}} been added in the Christian era, such as the last chapter; due to these insertions, some {{scholars}} consider 4 Baruch to have Christian origins. [...] <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> prophets, it advocates the divorce of foreign wives and exile of those who will not do so. According to 4 Baruch, the Samaritans are the descendants of such mixed marriages.|$|R
50|$|Girls Aloud {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics, who praised Girls Aloud's original songs but criticized {{the number of}} cover versions and the show's lack of budget. Critics also noted Girls Aloud's provocative attire. Much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> hits album, <b>The</b> Sound of Girls Aloud: <b>The</b> <b>Greatest</b> Hits Tour was a commercial success. Girls Aloud released another studio album and announced an accompanying tour for the following year. The Sound of Girls Aloud: <b>The</b> <b>Greatest</b> Hits Tour remains Girls Aloud's only tour not to receive a video release.|$|R
500|$|Ursa Minor (Latin: [...] "Lesser Bear", {{contrasting}} with Ursa Major), {{also known}} as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star.|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me."

It's <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, {{it was like he was}} in another booth in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Fred Koehler, an {{electronics}} repairman from Coral Gables, Florida, sold his electronics shop {{to finance the}} completion of a two-man deep-sea submersible called Seacopter. He planned to dive to Titanic, enter the hull and retrieve a fabulous collection of diamonds rumored to be contained in the purser's safe. However, he was unable to obtain financial backing for his planned expedition. Another proposal involved using a semi-submersible platform mounted with cranes, resting on two watertight supertankers, that would winch the wreck off the seabed and carry it to shore. A proponent was quoted as saying, [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Wall of China– given enough time and money and people, you can do anything." [...] Time, money and people were not forthcoming and the proposal got no further than any of its predecessors.|$|E
