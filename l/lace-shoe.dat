5000|$|Judson {{made his}} {{invention}} to save people {{the trouble of}} buttoning and unbuttoning their shoes every day as shows in his wording in the patent application. He describes this in his patent U.S.P. 557,207 [...] From the foregoing statements it must be obvious that a shoe equipped with my device has all the advantages peculiar to a <b>lace-shoe,</b> {{while at the same}} time it is free from the annoyances hitherto incidental to lace-shoes on account of the lacing and unlacing required every time the shoes were put on or taken off the feet and on account of the lacing-strings coming untied. With my device the lacing-strings may be adjusted from time to time to take up the slack in the shoes, and the shoes may be fastened or loosened more quickly than any other form of shoe hitherto devised, so far as I am aware.|$|E
