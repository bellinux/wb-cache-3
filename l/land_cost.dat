In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made.

Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park <b>land</b> <b>cost</b> the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to be turned over to the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores how a {{retailer}} should determine whether to source goods domestically vs. directly by imports through international sourcing. Through the research a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model {{was developed and}} designed to calculate the total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> of items that were shipped from overseas locations into the US. The <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model is different from typical models in that it integrates the physical size of the item to be imported into the total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> considerations. With the <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> estimates at SKU level, the decision of whether to import or to source domestically is derived. What attributes make better import candidates over others given that a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> calculator outputs "yes" to import? What {{are some of the}} risks? In addition to creating a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> calculator, the research presents approaches around these questions. The characteristics of good import candidates are analyzed through evaluating the variables that contribute to total <b>landed</b> <b>cost.</b> Basker and Van (2008) present theories that examine the two way relationship between the size of a dominant retailer and the imports of consumer goods. They conclude that a chain needs to reach a threshold size before it begins to import. Benchmark studies of import giants like Wal-Mart are presented in this paper to understand how a longer history in the retail sector along with a robust IT infrastructure gives a company an advantage in importing retail goods. The results of this research can help retail companies with new and small import programs understand the variables that are needed to calculate total <b>landed</b> <b>costs</b> with the consideration of container utilization. Additionally it will help the retailer to decide on the best items to import in a smaller program until they can acquire economies of scale through higher import quantities. Ordering methods such as the Periodic Order Quantity Method (POQ) for fixed order periods with variable demand and Newsvendor models for advance ordering are also addressed. The results show that given several import items of varying sizes, there is an optimum region of importing which relates to COGS, size, inventory holding cost, delta of domestic to imports COGS, demand and other costs. The retailer can find this optimum region by applying analytical techniques to evaluate the candidates that are under consideration for importing. In addition to these findings, the organizational and infrastructural needs of a small imports program are addressed. The research also ties in globalization of the retail industry and the world market economy into shifts in the retailer's decisions. by Sophia E. Scipio. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>costs</b> {{account for}} a {{significant}} proportion of the total costs for many agricultural products that are traded internationally, especially for the major grain crops that the U. S. exports in competition with several other countries. For owner-operators, a common form of tenure in the U.

To the extent that land is rented or where the owner is making mortgage payments, however, larger explicit <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> are incurred and can be a very significant factor in the cost of production and competitiveness. U. S. cost of production data for most crops in recent years indicate that the returns on equity, including land and other owned resources are zero or negative, i. e., the prices of many farm products are too low to cover total costs when opportunity costs are included as part of the cost of production. Thus, <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> may not be a significant factor in competitiveness in the current policy framework where government payments are {{a significant part of the}} net returns of farm operators.

This research examines sourcing, manufacturing and distribution costs and develops a total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model for global operations. We use this total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model to estimate the total cost from raw material to the customer for one sample company operation, Tyco Electronics, across multiple manufacturing and customer countries. This total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model was used to analyze the cost for each manufacturing location, customer, and mode of transportation as well as predict the effect from risks and uncertainties in global supply chain. by Apichart Jearasatit.
