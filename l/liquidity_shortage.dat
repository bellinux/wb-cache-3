50|$|Also in 2008 Merckle {{had made}} a {{speculative}} investment based on his belief that Volkswagen shares would fall; however, in October 2008, Porsche SE's support of Volkswagen sent shares on the Xetra dax from €210.85 to over €1000 {{in less than two}} days (a short squeeze), resulting in losses of a low three-digit million in euros. When the <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortage</b> of VEM became public, media came up with speculations that this was caused by the losses from options on Volkswagen stock. Later it turned out that this was not the case. Neither the amount nor the companies involved were related to the banking negotiations and the following restructuring.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies whether default is {{triggered}} by low market asset values or by <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortages,</b> corresponding to economic versus financial distress. Default is often assumed to occur when market assets fall below a certain boundary. Consistent with this hypothesis, some low-value firms default despite sufficient <b>liquidity.</b> However, <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortages</b> can precipitate default at high asset values when firms are restricted from accessing external financing. Moreover, many distressed firms do not default for years. As a result, even though boundary-based default predictions can match observed average default frequencies, they misclassify {{a large number}} of firms in cross-section...|$|R
50|$|It is not surprising, {{given the}} size of the Soviet economy, that intra-Comecon trade was {{dominated}} by exchanges between the Soviet Union and the other members. Exchanges of Soviet fuels and raw materials for capital goods and manufactured items for consumer consumption had characterized trade, particularly among the original members. The <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortage</b> in the early 1980s forced the European Comecon countries to work to strengthen the importance of intraregional trade. In the early 1980s, intraregional trade rose to 60% of foreign trade of Comecon countries as a whole; for individual members it ranged from 45 to 50% in the case of Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union, to 83% for Cuba and 96% for Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|A {{phenomenon}} frequently {{observed during}} liquidity crises is flight to liquidity as investors exit illiquid investments {{and turn to}} secondary markets in pursuit of cash-like or easily saleable assets. Empirical evidence points towards widening price differentials, during periods of <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortage,</b> among assets that are otherwise alike, but differ {{in terms of their}} asset market liquidity. For instance, there are often large liquidity premia (in some cases as much as 10-15%) in Treasury bond prices. An example of a ﬂight to liquidity occurred during the 1998 Russian financial crisis, when the price of Treasury bonds sharply rose relative to less liquid debt instruments. This resulted in widening of credit spreads and major losses at Long-Term Capital Management and many other hedge funds.|$|E
50|$|According to the Bank of Japan, {{the central}} bank adopted {{quantitative}} easing on 19 March 2001. Under quantitative easing, the BOJ flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity to promote private lending, leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves and therefore little risk of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortage.</b> The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than {{would be required to}} set the interest rate to zero. It later also bought asset-backed securities and equities and extended the terms of its commercial paper-purchasing operation. The BOJ increased the commercial bank current account balance from ¥5 trillion to ¥35 trillion (approximately US$300 billion) over a four-year period starting in March 2001. The BOJ also tripled the quantity of long-term Japan government bonds it could purchase on a monthly basis.|$|E

He also went to the stores and talked to customers, while writing a new business plan for the company. Approximately 100 stores were closed during this time, while the production cycle was sped up, as to get fresh clothing into stores in four to six weeks.

By coordinating policies with the FSC and other relevant agencies, and enlisting the active cooperation of the financial sector, the FSS helped to increase the guarantee amount from guarantee institutions and to extend the maturity of SME loans. Thanks to the combination of SME support measures, SME loans increased by 52.4 trillion won in 2008 - despite the bleak economic circumstances of the global financial crisis - which is comparable with the average increase of 56.7 trillion won in 2006 and 2007.|$|E
50|$|Most Comecon {{countries}} {{ended their}} 1981-85 five-year plans with decreased extensive economic development, increased expenses for fuel and raw materials, and decreased dependency on the West for both credit and hard currency imports.

50|$|Expost policy intervention: Some {{experts suggest}} that the Central Bank should provide {{downside}} insurance {{in the event of}} a liquidity crisis. This could take the form of direct provision of insurance to asset-holders against losses or a commitment to purchasing assets in the event that the asset price falls below a threshold. Such ‘Asset Purchases’ will help drive up the demand and consequently the price of the asset in question, thereby easing the <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortage</b> faced by borrowers. Alternatively, the Government could provide ‘deposit insurance’, where it guarantees that a promised return will be paid to all those who withdraw. In the framework of the Diamond Dybvig model, demand deposit contracts with government deposit insurance help achieve the optimal equilibrium if the Government imposes an optimal tax to finance the deposit insurance. Alternative mechanisms through which the Central Bank could intervene are direct injection of equity into the system {{in the event of a}} liquidity crunch or engaging in a debt for equity swap. It could also lend through the discount window or other lending facilities, providing credit to distressed financial institutions on easier terms. Ashcraft, Garleanu, and Pedersen (2010) argue that controlling the credit supply through such lending facilities with low margin requirements is an important second monetary tool (in addition to the interest rate tool), which can raise asset prices, lower bond yields, and ease the funding problems in the financial system during crises. While there are such benefits of intervention, there is also costs. It is argued by many economists that if the Central Bank declares itself as a ‘Lender of Last Resort’ (LLR), this might result in a moral hazard problem, with the private sector becoming lapse and this may even exacerbate the problem. Many economists therefore assert that the LLR must only be employed in extreme cases and must be a discretion of the Government rather than a rule.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the main {{innovation}} in central bank cooperation during the financial crisis of 2008 - 09, namely the emergency provision of international liquidity through the establishment of bilateral central bank swap facilities, which have evolved to form interconnected swap networks.

We discuss the reasons for establishing swap facilities, relate our measure of currency-specific <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortages</b> to the probability of a country receiving a swap line in that currency, and find a significant relationship {{in the case of the}} US dollar, the euro, the yen and the Swiss franc. We find that countries with larger US dollar shortages on our measure, and economies that are large international financial centres, have a statistically significantly higher probability of receiving a US dollar swap line.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} interbank market (IBM) model which explains {{a number of}} facts observed during financial crises: a sudden and significant increase in IBM rates, reduced participation by lending banks, <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortages</b> (i. e. the lenders' supply being smaller than the borrowing banks' demand), and ultimately an IBM freeze. Here a crucial element is a bank's ability to assess risk correctly. The model's core feature is then the distinction between ambiguity averse and risk averse lending banks. While the latter have unique priors, ambiguity averse lenders do not and consider a set of possible priors. Our key insight is that ambiguity and risk differentially affect a bank's decision to participate as a lender in the IBM. Moreover, at a given rate, the ambiguity averse lenders supply less than the risk averse ones. Deciding on the optimal amount results in a unique IBM equilibrium where either all lenders participate (full participating equilibrium) or only the risk averse ones do (partial participating one). This distinction allows us to show how a shock with ambiguity (as {{at the start of}} a crisis) leads to a sudden spike in IBM rates, <b>liquidity</b> <b>shortages,</b> and a market freeze. This ambiguity effect is more direct and stronger compared to a rise in risk. Finally, we discuss the (in) effectiveness of different government policies in supporting the IBM. status: publishe...|$|R
