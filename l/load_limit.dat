25|$|The BB40-2 is an EMD rebuild for Ferrovia Central Atlantico in Brazil. Since FCA is metre gauge, {{there was}} no longer enough room in the trucks for the {{original}} traction motors. Also, FCA does not have a sufficiently high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> per axle to operate SD40-2s. Thus, they were rebuilt as B+B-B+B units, using the same trucks as the GE BB40-8, GE BB40-9 and GE BB40-9W. FCA also rebuilt EMD SD40T-2s in the same way, producing the EMD BB40T-2.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge with}} the {{greatest}} load capacity – as far as can be determined from the limited research – was the Alcántara Bridge the largest arch of which can support a load of 52t, followed by the Ponte de Pedra (30t), Puente Bibei (24t) and Puente de Ponte do Lima (24t) (all in Hispania). According to modern calculations, the Limyra Bridge, Asia Minor, can support a 30t vehicle on one arch plus a load of 500kp/m² on the remaining surface of the arch. The <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> of Roman arch bridges was thus far {{in excess of the}} live loads imposed by ancient traffic.|$|E

2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by laying up the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E

[...] The body-hugging Recaro shell-type RS race bucket seats (not available in North American markets), complete with electrically inflatable upper and lower side bolsters and adjustable lumbar support, are constructed {{so as not to}} need lower side airbags to comply with European crash safety standards. [...] In North America, the only front seats available are the more traditional Recaro seats (identical to those in the B6 and B7 S4), which include lower side airbags; these were also available as a no-cost option in other markets. [...] Lower side airbags are optional for the standard-fit Recaro rear seats. [...] Front, and outer rear seatbelts include pyrotechnic belt pretensioners, whilst all belts include an excess <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> function.|$|E

2500|$|Aerial {{shooting}} {{involves the}} tracking of wolves via a small airplane or helicopter {{and is considered}} by many to be the most effective method of wolf control. It was frequently used in the Soviet Union during its wolf control campaigns, starting in 1946 when the Chief Directorate of Aviation received reports that pilots flying at low altitudes frequently saw wolves. Polikarpov Po-2s and Antonov An-2s were the most frequently used models. The normal protocol was for the pilot to search frontally, and the shooter sideways. 70%-80% of wolves were first sighted by the pilot. Rocket guns would be fired into dense brush in order to scare wolves out into the open. Markers were thrown at the site of each kill for later collection. Actual shooting was done from the rear cockpit or left side when at a distance of 18–20metres from the quarry. An experienced shooter could spot a standing wolf a kilometre away at heights of up to 100–140metres. Most wolves were killed when the planes flew at speeds of 70 to 85km/h. The <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> of a Po-2 was 2 men and 5 adult wolves; the rear cockpit could hold 4 wolves, while the shooter's cockpit could hold 2, or carcasses could be tied to the fuselage or wings of the plane. Aerial hunting has been discontinued in the former Soviet Union because of budget restraints. Wolf hunting is still practiced this way in the U.S state of Alaska. [...] "Congress passed the Federal Airborne Hunting Act of 1972, which made it illegal for hunters to shoot animals from a plane or helicopter. The federal legislation does have a [...] for predator control, permitting state employees or licensed individuals to shoot from an aircraft for the sake of protecting [...] "land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops".|$|E

40|$|Determining {{frost depth}} below the {{pavement}} {{is important for}} timely implementation of winter and spring <b>load</b> <b>limits.</b> Unfortunately, existing instruments such as resistivity probes, frost tubes and moisture blocks are limited {{both in terms of}} data acquisition (automated and continuous measurements) and data interpretation. Consequently a delay between data collection, interpretation, and dissemination of information occurs. A laboratory study was conducted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation investigating the use of the Moisture Point probe as an instrument for locating the depth to the freezing front. The Moisture Point probe combines Time Domain Reflectometry with remote diode switching to provide a profile of the aggregate base and subgrade dielectric properties. From this the frost depth can be estimated. The Moisture Point probe works well in locating the frost depth and improves the ability to successfully implement spring and winter <b>load</b> <b>limits.</b> This method also provides the opportunity to validate air temperature-based models that are currently used to set spring and winter <b>load</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R
