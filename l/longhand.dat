5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or <b>longhand.</b> The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both <b>longhand</b> and on typewriter.|$|E
25|$|Kelley writes {{his first}} drafts <b>longhand</b> using a heavy metal Bic ballpoint and yellow legal pad. He easily churns out scripts {{in two to}} four days, {{initially}} working without collaboration, finding it faster and easier than trying to explain {{what he wants to}} others.|$|E
25|$|Leigh Fermor was knighted in the 2004 New Years Honours. In 2007, he said that, for {{the first}} time, {{he had decided to}} work using a typewriter, having written all his books <b>longhand</b> until then. The house at Kardamyli was {{featured}} in the 2013 film Before Midnight.|$|E
25|$|Original {{work was}} done on two other projects: <b>Longhand</b> and Ratefixer. Both were of smaller calibre than Green Mace but were {{designed}} to try and increase the rate of fire and calibre used. Similar concepts were also said {{to be used in}} the Red Queen gun, which was essentially a medium-weight version of Green Mace.|$|E
25|$|Shorthand is an {{abbreviated}} symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing {{as compared to}} <b>longhand,</b> a more common method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called stenography, from the Greek stenos (narrow) and graphein (to write). It has also been called brachygraphy, from Greek brachys (short) and tachygraphy, from Greek tachys (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.|$|E
25|$|Shorthand {{was used}} more widely in the past, before the {{invention}} of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered {{an essential part of}} secretarial training and police work, as well as useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes are typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later typing, data entry, or (mainly historically) transcription to <b>longhand,</b> although longer term uses do exist, such as encipherment: diaries (like that of the famous Samuel Pepys) being a common example.|$|E
25|$|Until he {{fell ill}} {{at the age}} of 92 in 2006, Ellis {{typically}} worked at least 16 hours a day, writing books in <b>longhand</b> on legal tablets, visiting with clients, and teaching. On his 90th birthday in 2003, he received congratulatory messages from well-known public figures such as then-President George W. Bush, New York senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the Dalai Lama, who sent a silk scarf blessed for the occasion. In 2004, Ellis was taken ill with serious intestinal problems, which led to hospitalization and the removal of his large intestine. He returned to work after a few months of supportive care.|$|E

Unlike most wrestlers who used [...] "ghostwriters" [...] {{to write their}} biographies, Copeland wrote the entire book himself, in <b>longhand.</b> Mick Foley, who also wrote his wrestling autobiography himself in <b>longhand,</b> wrote the foreword to his book. Copeland does not smoke. He claims he had his first cigarette when he was sixteen, hated it, and has not smoked since.|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote <b>longhand</b> letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain why I wanted to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said I was free to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} prior to his presidency, Kimball kept a binder of notes and {{clippings}} related to the issue. In {{the first years of}} his presidency, he was recorded as frequently making the issue one of investigation and prayer. In June 1977, Kimball asked at least three general authorities, apostles Bruce R. McConkie, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packer, to submit memos [...] "on the doctrinal basis of the prohibition and how a change might affect the Church." [...] McConkie wrote a long treatise concluding there were no scriptural impediments to a change. In 1977, Kimball obtained a personal key to the Salt Lake Temple for entering in the evenings after the temple closed and often spent hours alone in its upper rooms praying for divine guidance on a possible change. On May 30, 1978, Kimball presented his two counselors with a statement that he had written in <b>longhand</b> that removed all racial restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, stating that he [...] "had a good, warm feeling about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in <b>longhand,</b> leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E
500|$|Robert Weinberg, in {{his history}} of Weird Tales, agrees with Ashley {{that the quality of}} Baird's issues was poor, but {{comments}} that some good stories were published: [...] "it was just that the percentage of such stories was dismally small". [...] Weinberg singles out [...] "A Square of Canvas" [...] by Rud, and [...] "Beyond the Door" [...] by Paul Suter as [...] "exceptional"; both appeared in the April 1923 issue. [...] Weinberg also regards [...] "The Floor Above" [...] by M. L. Humphries and [...] "Penelope" [...] by Vincent Starrett, both from the May 1923 issue, and [...] "Lucifer" [...] by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as memorable, and comments that [...] "The Rats in the Walls", in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft's finest stories. [...] It is unclear whether Baird or Henneberger was responsible for buying Lovecraft's stories; in one of Lovecraft's letters he makes it clear that Baird was keen to acquire his stories, but Henneberger has said that he overrode Baird and that Baird did not like Lovecraft's writing. [...] It was Henneberger who came up with another idea involving Lovecraft: Henneberger contacted Harry Houdini and made arrangements to have Lovecraft ghost-write a story for him using a plot supplied by Houdini. [...] The story, [...] "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs", appeared under Houdini's name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, though it was nearly lost—Lovecraft left the typed manuscript on the train he took to New York to get married, and as a result spent much of his wedding day retyping the manuscript from the <b>longhand</b> copy he still had.|$|E
500|$|The {{area that}} would become Monte Ne was known to have had two establishments often {{considered}} essential to a pioneer settlement, a grist mill and a distillery. It is unknown when the distillery was built. It was owned in the 1830s by Abe McGarrah and his brother-in-law; they also operated a small store. The distillery's output each day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal whiskey gauger who resided in the area. The grist mill was built in 1856, and was owned by J.R. Pettigrew. It would later be owned by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake, the parents of Betty Blake, who {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "Leading Lady" [...] of Rogers, and who married entertainer Will Rogers in 1908. In 1875, the post office in the area changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew's Mill. The Blakes owned the mill until 1882, when James Blake died. The mill was later operated by David Portnell from 1889 to 1895. He sold his interest in the mill to a retired Congregational minister J.G. Bailey. Bailey later became postmaster. He petitioned the Post Office Department to change the name of the office to Vinola, in honor of a well-known vineyard that belonged to his neighbor Carl A. Starek. The letter was written in <b>longhand,</b> and the o and l were spaced too close together. As a result, the clerk misread the name as [...] "Vinda", which is how it was recorded. The area's name was later changed to Silver Springs. Bailey sold 325 acres of land and a cabin to Harvey.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in <b>longhand</b> 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{difficulty}} of transliterating Russian names into English and of Golanchikova's own variations in the use of her name, {{there are a number of}} variants. These include Ljuba Galantchikova (from Russian), Lioubov Golantchikova (French), Ljuba Galantschikoff (German), and [...] Ljuba Golantšikova (Estonian). An example of her own signature in northern European cursive <b>longhand</b> (see photo in box) is probably L. Galantchikoff. The 'T' has sometimes been interpreted as an 'S', giving L. Galanschikoff. Even in recent times, transliterations of her name are numerous.|$|E

2500|$|West {{wrote with}} little revision. [...] His first <b>longhand</b> version was usually not very {{different}} from the final printed version. Despite winning many prizes and being awarded honorary doctorates, his commercial success and his skills as a story teller, he never won the acceptance of Australia's literary clique. In the 1998 Oxford Literary History of Australia it was stated that: [...] "Despite his international popularity, West has been surprisingly neglected by Australian literary critics." [...] The previous edition, edited by Dame Leonie Kramer, did not mention him at all.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2016 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Han Kang said, [...] "As a teenager I suffered typical questions: why pain, why death? I thought that books held the answers, but curiously I realized they contain only questions. Their writers were weak and vulnerable {{just like we}} were." [...] Writing the book was a difficult task, she said, with the main cause being her joint problems which started in her mid-30s. She wrote the entire novella in <b>longhand.</b> Kang received help from a video artist and a psychiatric hospital when researching the book. The {{second part of the}} book is primarily inspired by Kang's experiences with the aforementioned artist whose body of work was extensively studied.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{worked on}} the book during the United States Senate {{election}} in New York, 2000, often writing notes or text out <b>longhand</b> in between campaign stops. [...] Writer Cheryl Merser was stated to be assisting Clinton with the research and writing of the work; she met with Clinton twice during this period. [...] The book was completed during summer 2000, but publication of it was held up until after the Senate election, to avoid the appearance that Clinton was using the book to gain an advantage with her time as First Lady. [...] Thus the book was released shortly before the author left the White House to take her seat in the United States Senate.|$|E

2500|$|A Committee {{was created}} as a {{response}} to the Peierls-Frisch memorandum. It held its first meeting on 10 April 1940, in the ground floor main committee room of the Royal Society in Burlington House in London. Its meetings were invariable held there. The original members were Thomson, Chadwick, Cockroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon; Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and [...] William Haworth were subsequently added, along with a representative of the Director of Scientific Research at the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP). The MAUD Committee held its first two meetings in April 1940 before it was formally constituted by CSSAW. CSSAW was abolished in June 1940, and the MAUD Committee then came directly under the MAP. Thomson chaired the committee, and initially acted as its secretary as well, writing up the minutes in <b>longhand</b> on foolscap, until the MAP provided a secretary.|$|E

Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for fear that I might leave one out." [...] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, [...] "I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word."

Howard Hunt, the former C.I.A. officer and later Watergate conspirator, in order to {{implicate}} the C.I.A. in the Kennedy assassination. Actually, this story surfaced in Henry Hurt's Reasonable Doubt, written 13 years ago. Similarly, the story that the K.G.B. considered schemes for breaking {{the legs of the}} ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev for defecting to the West was first reported in a book written six years ago." [...] And he added that [...] "it does seem odd that a key K.G.B. archivist never had access to a copying machine, but had to copy thousands of pages in <b>longhand.</b> Still, the overall impact of this volume is convincing, though none of the material will send historians scurrying to rewrite their books." ...|$|E

[...] Originally given 8minutes to speak, Obama's completed address ran 25minutes, leading to two more weeks of edits with advisors that brought it down to 17minutes. [...] The final draft {{was sent to a}} Democratic speechwriting team at the FleetCenter on roughly July 20, at which time some biographical material was removed so as to include more on the presidential ticket; one report indicated that roughly three quarters was reported to have been left intact after the Kerry campaign's edits, while another indicated that very little had been changed.

2500|$|Written qin music did not {{directly}} tell what notes were played; instead, {{it was written in}} a tablature detailing tuning, finger positions, and stroke technique, thus comprising a step by step method and description of how to play a piece. Some tablatures do indicate notes using the gongche system, or indicate rhythm using s. The earliest example of the modern shorthand tablature survives from around the twelfth century CE. An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript, dated to the seventh century CE, called Jieshi Diao Youlan (Solitary Orchid in Stone Tablet Mode). It is written in a <b>longhand</b> form called wenzi pu (譜) (literally [...] "written notation"), said to have been created by Yong Menzhou during the Warring States period, which gives all the details using ordinary written Chinese characters. Later in the Tang dynasty, Cao Rou and others simplified the notation, using only the important elements of the characters (like string number, plucking technique, hui number and which finger to stop the string) and combined them into one character notation. This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes, a single character could represent one note, or sometimes as many as nine. This notation form was called jianzi pu (字譜) (literally [...] "reduced notation") and it was a major advance in qin notation. It was so successful that from the Ming dynasty onwards, a great many qinpu (琴) (qin tablature collections) appeared, the most famous and useful being [...] "Shenqi Mipu" [...] (The Mysterious and Marvellous Tablature) compiled by Zhu Quan, the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty. In the 1960s, Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music. Sadly, many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost, and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years.|$|E
