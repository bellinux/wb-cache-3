5|$|The largest {{centrally}} planned Early Christian church, Milan's San Lorenzo Maggiore, {{was built}} {{in the middle of the}} 4th century while that city served as the capital of the Western Empire and may have been domed with a <b>light</b> <b>material,</b> such as timber or cane. There are two theories about the shape of this dome: a Byzantine-style dome on spherical pendentives with a ring of windows similar to domes of the later Justinian era, or an octagonal cloister vault following Roman trends and like the vaulting over the site's contemporary chapel of Saint Aquiline, possibly built with vaulting tubes, pieces of which had been found in excavations. Although these tubes have been shown to date from a medieval reconstruction, there is evidence supporting the use of Roman concrete in the original. Fires in 1071 and 1075 damaged the building and the central covering collapsed in 1103. It was rebuilt with a Romanesque dome that lasted until 1573, when it collapsed and was replaced by the present structure. The original vaulting was concealed by a square drum externally rather than the octagon of today, which dates from the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of biodrying, the waste {{material}} undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, <b>light</b> <b>material</b> is advantageous for later transport and combustion.|$|E
25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very <b>light</b> <b>material</b> and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E
40|$|Dark and <b>light</b> terrain <b>materials</b> in the Perrine and Nun Sulci quadrangles {{are divided}} into nine map units, four dark, and five light. These are placed in time-stratigraphic {{sequence}} primarily by means of embayment and cross-cutting relationships. Dark terrain is generally more heavily cratered and thus older that light terrain but, at least in these quadrangles, crater densities are not reliable indicators of relative ages among the four dark material units. The four mapped material units within dark terrain are: cratered dark materials (dc), grooved dark materials (dg), transitional dark materials (di), and dark materials, undivided (d). The five mapped units within light terrain are: intermediate <b>light</b> <b>materials</b> (li), grooved <b>light</b> <b>materials</b> (lg), irregularly grooved <b>light</b> <b>materials</b> (lgl), smooth <b>light</b> <b>materials</b> (ls), and <b>light</b> <b>materials,</b> undivided...|$|R

25|$|Three {{lifeboats}} were dispatched from Northern Ireland to {{the area}} where the aircraft was last seen on radar, along with two helicopters from Prestwick and Anglesey and one from the Strathclyde Police (during daytime hours), and the HMS Penzance, a Royal Navy minesweeper that was conducting training operations 35nm away. Coast Guard rescue teams conducted searches along the shoreline all night and the next day along with officers from the Strathclyde Police Department. Two investigators from the AAIB were also sent to the scene. Some wreckage of the aircraft was quickly found floating in the water (all three doors, the paramedic's bag, the left main landing gear leg, and other <b>light</b> <b>material),</b> with the main wreckage submerged on the seabed. The wreckage was 7.7nm west-northwest of the Campbeltown airport. The fuselage had broken into three main sections: front, centre, and rear. The centre section included the wing. The engines and propellers had been torn from the wings on impact. The paramedic's body was found strapped to his seat. The pilot's body was not found {{in the vicinity of the}} debris field.|$|E
500|$|The pincers of {{the coconut}} crab are {{powerful}} enough to cause noticeable pain to a human; furthermore, the coconut crab will often keep its hold for extended periods of time. Thomas Hale Streets reports a trick used by Micronesians of the Line Islands to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip: [...] "It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft {{parts of the body}} with any <b>light</b> <b>material</b> will cause the crab to loosen its hold." ...|$|E

They were placed where a vehicle would be obliged to stop, or at least slow down. The flame fougasse would offer instant and horrific wounds to any unprotected men caught in its fiery maw and would cause a vehicle engine to stop within seven seconds simply because it was deprived of oxygen (although it would easily start again once the fireball subsided, provided nothing was damaged).|$|E

500|$|The {{scope of}} the book was wide-ranging, {{covering}} much of the physics then known. [...] The 1839 first edition included statics, dynamics, gravitation, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, hydrodynamics, acoustics, magnetism, electricity, atmospheric electricity, electrodynamics, thermoelectricity, bioelectricity, light, optics, and polarized light. [...] In the 1843 second edition Bird expanded the material on electrolysis into its own chapter, reworked the polarized <b>light</b> <b>material,</b> added two chapters on [...] "thermotics" [...] (thermodynamics– a major omission from the first edition), and a chapter on the new technology of photography. [...] Later editions also included a chapter on electric telegraphy. [...] Brooke was still expanding the book for the sixth and final edition.

500|$|The trick {{has since}} been often {{repeated}} and explained. The medium must have the semblance of key-board, made of some <b>light</b> <b>material,</b> concealed in his coat sleeve or about his person. This he attaches {{to the bottom of}} the accordion which he holds in his hand. Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about in the basket under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small hook fastened to dark thread, which would be invisible in the gas-light.|$|E

2500|$|On September10, 2007 the Cassini orbiter passed within [...] of Iapetus and {{returned}} images showing that both hemispheres are heavily cratered. The color dichotomy of scattered patches {{of light and}} dark material in the transition zone between Cassini Regio and the bright areas exists at very small scales, down to the imaging resolution of 30 meters. There is dark material filling in low-lying regions, and <b>light</b> <b>material</b> on the weakly illuminated pole-facing slopes of craters, but no shades of grey. The dark material is a very thin layer, only a few tens of centimeters (approx. one foot) thick at least in some areas, according to Cassini radar imaging and the fact that very small meteor impacts have punched through to the ice underneath.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{evidence of}} the use of ocular prosthesis is that of a woman found in Shahr-I Sokhta, Iran [...] dating back to 2900–2800 BCE. It has a hemispherical form and a diameter of just over 2.5cm (1inch). It consists of very <b>light</b> <b>material,</b> probably bitumen paste. The surface of the artificial eye is covered with a thin layer of gold, engraved with a central circle (representing the iris) and gold lines patterned like sun rays. On both sides of the eye are drilled tiny holes, through which a golden thread could hold the eyeball in place. Since microscopic research has shown that the eye socket showed clear imprints of the golden thread, the eyeball must have been worn during her lifetime. In addition to this, an early Hebrew text references a woman who wore an artificial eye made of gold (Yer. Ned. 41c; comp. Yer. Sanh. 13c). Roman and Egyptian priests are known to have produced artificial eyes as early as the fifth century BCE constructed from painted clay attached to cloth and worn outside the socket.|$|E
