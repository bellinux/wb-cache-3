Norris, who was impressed with how Wirtz handled one of his real estate transactions. During the Great Depression, the Wirtz-Norris partnership began to purchase arenas at much reduced prices. In 1933, they purchased the Olympia Stadium in Detroit, Michigan and its hockey franchise, the Detroit Falcons, which they renamed the Detroit Red Wings for $100.000. [...] In 1935, they purchased the Chicago Stadium.

[...] He used the proceeds to pay off the mortgage on the Chicago Stadium and also purchase Madison Square Garden in New York City and the St. Louis Arena. [...] In 1946, he and James D. Norris helped Bill Tobin purchase the nearly bankrupt Chicago Blackhawks.Wirtz continued to help run the Red Wings. In summer of 1951, Arthur Wirtz left Detroit to join the (Chicago) board of directors. In 1949, he and Jim Morris (the son of James) founded the International Boxing Club which presided over 47 of 51 championships through 1955. As Wirtz and Norris had control over most of the major sporting venues east of the Mississippi, federal authorities ended their boxing monopoly in 1958 and forced them to sell Madison Square garden.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "While the General Services Administration (GSA) has used the National Broker Contract (NBC) program {{to assist with the}} agency's lease portfolio, it is unclear whether the program has resulted in the rental rate cost savings that GSA anticipated when proposing the program. GSA officials have stated that brokers should be able to obtain lower rental rates than in-house staff because brokers have greater market expertise and in addition are able to credit a portion of the broker's commission to the rental rate. In 2012, when GSA attempted to compare rental rates negotiated by brokers with those negotiated by in-house staff, the agency not only found little difference between the two, but also stated that the data were insufficient to conduct a meaningful comparison. In April 2013, GSA began requiring the use of a different market rent data report [...] "Bullseye" [...] which includes market information, analysis, and insight regarding the local submarket. Officials said this new data would improve their ability to compare rental rates negotiated by brokers to market rental rates, but will likely not allow officials to determine whether brokers are negotiating better deals than in-house staff. Beginning in fiscal year 2013, GSA also deemphasized previous annual goals for broker use and began identifying and assigning <b>leases</b> to <b>brokers</b> based on where agency officials believe the brokers provide the greatest value. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that many durable {{products}} are sold through dealers, the literature has largely ignored the issue of how product durability affects the interactions between a manufacturer and her dealers. We seek to fill this gap by considering a durable goods manufacturer that uses independent dealers to get her product to consumers. In contrast to much of the literature, we specifically consider the possibility that if the manufacturer sells her product, then the dealers can either sell or lease it to the final consumer. One of our more interesting findings is that, when the level of competition among dealers is high, the manufacturer prefers to use a lease-brokering arrangement in which the dealers earn a margin for <b>brokering</b> <b>leases</b> between the manufacturer and end consumers, instead of selling her product to the dealers. This complements existing results that show that when suppliers of durable goods interact directly with consumers, selling is the dominant strategy for high levels of competitive intensity. channel structure, durability, time inconsistency, double marginalization, competition...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} clouds with diversified {{properties}} have been built. Many of them span multiple geographical locations over the globe, imposing time-varying costs on and offering different service proximities to users. Clouds could be private or public, requiring {{different levels of}} administration effort and providing different levels of freedom to control. Hybrid clouds, which blend together multiple public and private clouds, possess properties of both types. Based on these diversified properties, multiple clouds {{have the potential to}} provide services with higher scalability, lower operational cost and better QoS. To exploit this potential, I examine the means of deploying services on multiple clouds, that can maximize utility in dynamic environments. Firstly, I consider the migration of an important representative application, content distribution services, to geo-distributed hybrid clouds. I model the problem of joint content data migration and request dispatching as a unified optimization framework, and then design a dynamic control algorithm to solve it. The algorithm bounds the response times within the preset QoS target, and guarantees that the overall cost is within a small constant gap from the optimum that can be achieved by a T-slot look ahead mechanism with known future information. Secondly, I study the problem of efficient scheduling for disparate MapReduce workloads on hybrid clouds. I build a fine-grained and tractable model to characterize the scheduling of heterogeneous MapReduce workloads. An online algorithm is proposed for joint task admission control for the private cloud, task outsourcing to the public cloud, and VM allocation to execute the admitted tasks on the private cloud, such that the time-averaged task outsourcing cost is minimized over the long run. The online algorithm features preemptive scheduling of the tasks, where a task executed partially on the on-premise infrastructure can be paused and scheduled to run later. It also achieves such desirable properties as meeting a pre-set task admission ratio and bounding the worst-case task completion time. Thirdly, I consider a cloud computing resource market where a broker is employed that pools the spare resources of multiple private clouds and leases them to serve external users' jobs. I model the interaction between the broker and the private clouds as a two-stage Stackelberg game. As the leader in the game, the broker decides on the pricing for renting VMs from each private cloud. As a follower, each private cloud responds with the number of VMs that it is willing to lease. Combining all this with Lyapunov optimization theory, I design online algorithms for the broker to set the prices and schedule the jobs on the private clouds, and for each private cloud to decide the numbers of VMs to <b>lease.</b> The <b>broker</b> achieves a time-averaged profit that is close to the offline optimum with complete information on future job arrivals and resource availability, while each private cloud earns the best that it can. Through theoretical analysis and empirical study, I rigorously examine the cost or profit optimality, and QoS guarantee of my design, and show that they can indeed outperform existing solutions. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
