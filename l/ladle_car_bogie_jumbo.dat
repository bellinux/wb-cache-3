40|$|Purpose. In this paper, it is {{necessary}} to examine the dynamic properties of the gondola <b>car</b> with <b>bogies,</b> model 18 - 1711 when it moves on straight and curved sections of a track. Methodology. The calculations were performed using the object-oriented programming on the program "Dynamics of Rail Vehicles" ("DYNRAIL" Myamlin S. V. registered 20. 03. 2003). Mathematical models of a gondola <b>car</b> and <b>bogies</b> 18 - 100 and 18 - 711 were created for the calculations. Findings. Dynamic performances comparison of the gondola <b>car</b> with <b>bogies</b> 18 - 1711 and the gondola <b>car</b> with <b>bogies</b> 18 - 100, obtained by calculation method was carried out. Originality. Firstly calculations {{in order to determine the}} dynamic properties of the gondola <b>car</b> with <b>bogies</b> 18 - 1711 when it moves on straight and curved sections of track were performed. At the same time an assessment of the dynamic characteristics of the gondola car was made. The following dynamic standards were determined: the coefficient of vertical dynamics (Cdv), the coefficient of horizontal dynamics (Cdh), and the safety factor against derailment (SFd). Track irregularities in vertical and horizontal transverse planes were assigned as perturbations. They should be so that the dynamic indexes of the widely used in operation gondola <b>car</b> on <b>bogies</b> model 18 - 100 keep in admissible range of speeds up to 80 km / h for the empty gondola car and at speeds up to 90 km / h for the loaded gondola cars. Practical value. As a result of the calculations and comparisons of their results, we have findings that the use of bogies with bilinear characteristic of the central suspension will improve the dynamic performances of gondola cars, currently operating on bogies, model 18 - 100. And by improving the dynamic performances it is possible to increase the permissible speeds of these cars motion...|$|R
5000|$|Until recently, {{pig iron}} was {{typically}} poured {{directly out of}} {{the bottom of the}} blast furnace through a [...] into a <b>ladle</b> <b>car</b> for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as hot metal.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different loads on the stress-strain state of the freight <b>car</b> <b>bogie</b> side frame, {{as well as to}} {{evaluate the}} distribution of the stress fields {{in the design of the}} freight <b>car</b> <b>bogie</b> side frame supported through the horizontal surface and through the horizontal and inclined surfaces of the pedestal opening. Methodology. A volumetric finite element model of the side frame of ZK- 1 bogie of the freight car was designed. The forces under the current regulatory documentation for theoretical research were applied to the model, the stress arising in the model elements were determined. The static tests of ZK- 1 bogie side frame were conducted; they allowed determining the stresses in the key points of the frame under the action of forces in accordance with the existing procedure of static tests of the freight <b>car</b> <b>bogie</b> side frame. To check the quality of the finite element model we determined the stress in the model under the action of forces corresponding to the static requirements. The corresponding coefficients were determined to match the stress obtained through theoretical studies and static tests. The results of theoretical and experimental studies of stress for dangerous sections of the side frame design were compared. Findings. The regulatory documentation for carrying out experimental research of the side frame strength does not fully take into account the load acting on the frame during its operation and that provided while assessing the side frame strength theoretically. The strength evaluation of the side frame by the results of field tests only does not give a complete picture of the distribution of stress fields, as the provided sensor installation points do not cover most of the design elements with possible stress concentration. Originality. The loads applied to the side frame during theoretical and experimental studies were compared to the loads acting during operation. The impact of use of inclined surfaces in the pedestal box opening was evaluated. Practical value. The obtained results allow the more accurate assessment of the three-piece bogie side frame strength, as well as allow you to choose the more preferred method of side frame support in the axle box...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work is aimed to: 1) analyze the technical condition of freight cars and technological methods {{used in the}} repair; 2) identify possible ways to improve resource of freight car bogies; 3) develop a mathematical model to describe the wear geometry of the original surface of bogie center pad at the corresponding life cycle of a freight car. Methodology. In order {{to solve the problem}} complex of increasing TBO of freight <b>car</b> <b>bogies</b> the methods for the synthesis, analysis and systematic approach were used. In addition, the use of mathematical modeling unit, solid state physics, the theory of friction and wear of solids. Findings. The analysis of the technical condition of freight cars has shown that up to 15 % of the faults falls on the bogies. A separate element of the repaired bogie is a bolster. At this the center pad is recovered most often. The center pad wear is uneven and the technological methods used for the repair, do not allow providing uniform wear due to which there is a need in premature repairs. One of the ways to improve the center pad resource during repair is the application of welding or sputtering deposition, but with providing discrete strength and durability in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the car axis, respectively. In order to establish the boundaries of the distribution of renewable material along the center pad diameter it was considered the fatigue wear process in cooperation with center plate and described the geometry of the surface of the center pad wear. Originality. Technical condition of freight <b>car</b> <b>bogies</b> according to wear criterion was analyzed in the paper. It is shown that the dynamics of bogie faults has a positive character. In addition, a significant place among the repaired parts takes the bolster, and a special loaded place is the center pad.

Furthermore, analyses on underbody velocity field, pressure coefficient on bogie sections, wake and leeward vortex structure affected by rotating wheels are performed. The comparison shows that drag coefficient decreases about 1 % when wheels rotating. In the rotating condition, the lift forces of train bodies are reduced, especially the bogie sections.

40|$|Purpose. When {{locomotives}} move in curved {{sections of}} the railway track, horizontal forces arise, which lead to pressing the ridge of the wheel pair to the railway track. The article is aimed to develop a method for determining the frame force acting on the bogie {{from the side of}} body of the locomotive section using the current methodology of calculating the lateral force. It is also aimed to determine the basic parameters that influence the value of the frame force. It is necessary to construct the dependencies of the frame force on the travel time of electric locomotive in the corresponding curve changing these parameters. Methodology. As is known, the electric locomotive is a multimass mechanical system. We will assume that this system consists of seven bodies: a body, two frames of carriages and four wheel sets. To determine the lateral force acting on the rail from the wheelset one need to solve differential equations of motion of locomotive bogie in curves of small radius. Using the equations of kinetostatics for wheelset one should come to determining the frame force acting on the <b>car</b> <b>bogie</b> from the side of body of the locomotive section. The nominal geometric and mass parameters of parts and components of electric locomotive are taken in the calculations. The curve radius, the length of transition curve, the length of circular curve, the longitudinal slope of railway track and other parameters are fixed values. Findings. There were obtained calculated values of the frame force of electric locomotive VL 80 acting on the bogie from the side of body of the locomotive section. Based on the obtained results there were built the dependencies of frame force on the travel time of electric locomotive on the corresponding curve when changing the speed and corresponding elevation of the outer rail.
