500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list {{and we went to}} this little cafe. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> we'd be playing that set for the next ten years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E
2500|$|The famous Old English riddle Ic wæs be Sonde {{describes}} a conch: [...] "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt {{alone in my}} first resting place... <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." [...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] is that {{the sound of the}} conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is downright unnatural, truly, {{that the}} fellow should be there!" [...] he replied, shaking his head, but meaning {{no more than}} that it was entirely out of the order of {{nautical}} propriety; [...] "I see the philosophy of what you say, Captain Wilder; and <b>little</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to explain it. It is a ship, to a mortal certainty!" ...|$|R
60|$|What I then {{supposed}} him to mean by this, I cannot imagine. As <b>little</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> when <b>I</b> {{began to}} comprehend {{that he was}} a prominent member of some obscure denomination or congregation, every member of which held forth to the rest when so inclined, and among whom he was called Brother Hawkyard. It was enough for me to know, on that day in the ward, that the farmer's cart was waiting for me at the street corner. I was not slow to get into it; for it was the first ride I ever had in my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "This forest, Essper, {{and this}} spear, make me {{remember}} days when I was vain {{enough to think}} that I had been sufficiently visited with sorrow. Ah! <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> then <b>know</b> of human misery, although I imagined I had suffered so much!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E

"That {{is another}} thing that {{inclines}} me to believe in a Providence, Ghita! <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> when rescuing you and your good kinsman from the boat of the Algerine, who I was saving. And yet you see how all has come to pass, and that in serving you I have merely been serving myself." ...|$|E

60|$|I smiled bitterly--and walked proudly {{from before}} Rupert's door. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> then <b>know</b> that Lucy was seated within thirty feet of me, {{listening}} to Andrew Drewett's conversation and humour. Of {{the mood in}} which she was listening, I shall have occasion to speak presently. As for Marble, when he overtook me, I was informed that Rupert had stopped him in order to ascertain our address;--a piece of condescension for which I had not the grace to be thankful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that you would take care of me?" [...] she said softly. [...] "I am afraid I am a very ignorant <b>little</b> person. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> much about England or English ways, and every one says that things are so {{different}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be {{the name}} of the Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} spoken at random, {{a kind of}} {{ejaculation}} from the heart, caused by the sting of Marais's cruelty and insults, like the cry of a beast beneath a blow. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how true they would prove, but at times it is thus that truth is mysteriously drawn from some well of secret knowledge hidden in our souls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Eustace Hignett gravely, [...] "could make me do that. Our souls have blended. Our {{beings have}} called {{to one another}} from their deepest depths, saying ... There are your pyjamas, over in the corner ... saying, 'You are mine!' How could I forget her after that? Well, as I was saying, we parted. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that she was sailing on this very boat! But just now {{she came to me}} as I writhed on deck...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{something}} is wrong," [...] admitted the book-merchant; {{and then he}} added in an undertone: [...] "I meant to send you word about it. I don't care to have the boy aware how much or how <b>little</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know.</b> Send him out, and I'll tell you the whole affair. The boy is not so innocent as he looks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I don't mind telling you," [...] {{the lady}} continued, leaning over towards him confidentially, [...] "that I'm dead off {{that old man}} who came prying round and took me out to dinner, to pump me about poor Barney! He didn't get much out of me. For one thing, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> much. But the <b>little</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> I'd sooner tell you than him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear madam," [...] he replied, [...] "you are {{blaming the}} wrong person. <b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> my mind, and what <b>little</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> of it <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not make it, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not select it. I am more {{dissatisfied}} with it {{than you can}} possibly be. It is a greater mystery to me {{than it is to}} you, and I have to live with it. You should pity not blame me." ...|$|R
60|$|After this nothing {{happened}} {{to me for a}} long while. Indeed I had the best time of my life and grew very strong and big, yes, the strongest and biggest hare of any that I ever saw, also the swiftest of foot. Twice I was chased by dogs; once by Giles's black beast, Nigger, and once by that of a shepherd. Finding that I could run right away from them without exerting myself at all, I grew to despise dogs. Ah! <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> then that there are many different breeds of these animals.|$|E
60|$|Well, the day {{was drawing}} near: the clothes were ordered; the banns were read. My dear mamma had built a cake {{about the size of}} a washing-tub; and I was only waiting for a week to pass to put me in {{possession}} of twelve thousand pounds in the FIVE per Cents, as they were in those days, heaven bless 'em! <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the storm that was brewing, and the disappointment which was to fall upon a young man who really did his best to get a fortune.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Vholes! If any man {{had told}} me when I first went to John Jarndyce's house that he was {{anything}} but the disinterested friend he seemed--that he was what he has gradually turned out to be--I could have found no words strong enough to repel the slander; I could not have defended him too ardently. So <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of the world! Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me {{the embodiment of the}} suit; that in place of its being an abstraction, it is John Jarndyce; that the more I suffer, the more indignant I am with him; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from John Jarndyce's hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was partly}} {{on that subject}} I wished to speak to you. I don't want to lessen your indignation against me, or {{ask you to do}} {{anything}} for my sake. I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil consequences of the past, which is unchangeable. I don't mean consequences to myself, but to others. It is but <b>little</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the worst consequences will remain; but something may be done, and you can help me. Will you listen to me patiently?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{was better}} able to teach you, Peter, {{from the bottom of}} my heart; but the <b>little</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> you shall hear. I would not deny you for a {{thousand}} worlds, for I believe the Holy Spirit has touched your heart, and that you will become a new man. Christians believe that all must become new men, who are to live in the other world, in the presence of God." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked by}} the warden {{if he had a}} final statement, he looked at the family of Davidson and said:Yes sir, <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> To the victim's family, I hope it helps a <b>little.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> how, but <b>I</b> hope it helps.

60|$|I sat {{myself down}} upon {{a seat in}} the shade. Presently, as I had expected, Nicephorus, the priest-Cæsar, and his four brethren came into the garden. Two of them led the blind man by the hand, and the other two clung close to him, for all these unfortunates loved each other dearly. The four with the split tongues gabbled in his ears. Now and again, when he could catch or guess at the meaning of a word, he {{answered}} the speaker gently; or the others, seeing that he had not understood them aright, painfully tried to explain the error. Oh! it was a piteous thing to see and hear. My gorge rose against the young brute of an Emperor and his councillors who, for ambition's sake, had wrought this horrible crime. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> then that ere long their fate would be his own, and that a mother's hand would deal it out to him.|$|E
6000|$|This armour, I should tell, William {{took for}} himself, {{since it was}} of his size. Also on the morrow, {{returning}} to the Castle Hill, I stripped the knight whom I had slain with the sword, Wave-Flame, of his splendid Milan mail, whereof the plastron, or breast-plate, was inlaid with gold, having over it a camail of chain to cover the joints, through which my good sword had shorn into his neck. The cognizance on his shield strangely enough was three barbed arrows, {{but what was the}} name of the knight who bore it I never learned. This mail, which must have cost a great sum, the Bailiff of Hastings granted me to keep, since I had slain its wearer and borne myself well in the fight. Moreover, I took the three arrows for my own cognizance, though in truth I had no right to any, being in those days but a trader. (<b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> then how well this mail was to serve me in the after years.) ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the {{suffering}} to which those words of mine condemned him. For {{not only had}} he to {{make up his mind}} to resistance, which to his nature was infinitely worse than it was to Griffith to face a raging mob, but he knew very well that it would almost inevitably produce his own ruin, and renew the disgrace out of which he was beginning to emerge. I did not--even while I prayed that he might do the right--guess at his own agony of supplication, carried on incessantly, day and night, sleeping and waking, that the Holy Spirit of might should brace his will and govern his tongue, and make him say the right thing at the right time, be the consequences what they might. No one, not constituted as he was, can guess at the anguish he endured. I knew no more. Clarence did not come home the next Saturday, to my mother's great vexation; but on Tuesday a small parcel was given to me, brought from our point of contact with the Bristol coach. It contained some pencils I had asked him to get, and a note marked PRIVATE. Here it is - ...|$|E

"Yes;--just a <b>little</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> {{should care}} for {{everybody}} to hear that I received visitors,--or worse still, a visitor,--at this hour on this day. But then it is so pleasant to feel oneself to be naughty! There is a Bohemian flavour of picnic about it which, though it does not {{come up to the}} rich gusto of real wickedness, makes one fancy that one is on the border of that delightful region in which there is none of the constraint of custom,--where men and women say what they like, and do what they like." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was--you shall hear {{immediately}} why I am not now--Egbert Craddock Cummins. The name remains. I {{am still}} (Heaven help me!) Dramatic Critic to the Fiery Cross.

6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] she implored; [...] "I {{thought they}} would {{distress}} you, and I had such a desire to bring you nothing but happiness. To bear them by myself seemed to be helping you, and I was glad, I was proud, to feel myself of use to you even to that <b>little</b> extent. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> you had the same fears; I thought that perhaps they came only to women; have you had them before?

6000|$|... "Tenderly!--that's the {{way they}} speak of me at Oakwood, eh? Human, not to say elf, nature, could not {{withstand}} giving the fellow a start. I sped off, whipped into the Church, popped into a surplice I found ready to hand, caught up a candle, and!--Little did I think who it was that was hanging on his arm. So <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it that my heart began to be drawn to St. Germain, where I still imagined you. Altogether, after that prank, all broke out again. I entertained the lads with a few more freaks, for which I did ample penance, but it grew on me that in my case all was a weariness and a sham, and that my demon might get a worse hold of me if I got into a course of hypocrisy. They were very good to me, those fathers, but Jesuits as they were, I doubt whether they ever fathomed me. Any way, perhaps they thought I should be a scandal, but they agreed with me that their order was not my vocation, and that we had better part before my fiend drove me to do so with dishonour. They even gave me recommendations to the French officers that were besieging Tournay. I knew the Duke of Berwick a little at Portsmouth, and it ended in my becoming under-secretary to the Duke of Chartres. A man who knows languages has his value among Frenchmen, who despise all but their own." ...|$|E
6000|$|Salem, Oct. 4th. Union Street [Family Mansion]--. [...] . Here I {{sit in my}} old {{accustomed}} chamber, where I used to sit in days gone by. [...] .

This claims {{to be called a}} haunted chamber, for thousands upon thousands of visions have appeared to me in it; and some few of them have become visible to the world. If ever I should have a biographer, he ought to make great mention of this chamber in my memoirs, because so much of my lonely youth was wasted here, and here my mind and character were formed; and here I have been glad and hopeful, and here I have been despondent.

And sometimes it seemed as if I were already in the grave, with only life enough to be chilled and benumbed. But oftener I was happy,--at least, as happy as I then knew how to be, or was aware of the possibility of being. By and by, the world found me out in my lonely chamber, and called me forth,--not, indeed, with a loud roar of acclamation, but rather with a still, small voice,--and forth I went, but found nothing in the world that I thought preferable to my old solitude till now.
