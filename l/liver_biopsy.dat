5|$|There is no totally {{reliable}} {{test for}} Wilson's disease, but levels of ceruloplasmin and copper in the blood, as {{well of the}} amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression {{of the amount of}} copper in the body. The gold standard—or most ideal test—is a <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy.</b> This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy.</b> The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. <b>Liver</b> <b>biopsy</b> is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy</b> three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of {{hepatitis}} is {{made on the}} basis of some or all of the following: a patient's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy.</b> In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes {{of hepatitis}}, the patient's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis. For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful. In this case, <b>liver</b> <b>biopsy</b> is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis as histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.

40|$|Hepatic {{fibrosis}} {{continues to}} be a risk in patients receiving methotrexate for psoriasis. Measurement of amino terminal levels of type III procollagen (P 3 NP) has been advocated as an effective non‐invasive test for ongoing hepatic fibrogenesis that could avoid <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies.</b> An audit was conducted to assess the practice of P 3 NP monitoring using guidelines produced by Manchester and whether the agreed levels correlate with histological severity. Sixty five patients with 174 P 3 NP assays and 30 <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> were reviewed between the years 1999 and 2003. Total number of patient‐methotrexate years was 278. 9 and the mean cumulative dose of methotrexate received was 2000 (SD 1838) mg. A higher cumulative dose of methotrexate correlated significantly with high mean and maximum P 3 NP levels. Of the 30 <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies,</b> 26 (86. 6 %) showed normal histology or mild to moderate steatosis, three had focal fibrosis, and one had early cirrhosis.

40|$|AbstractHepatic Candida {{infection}} (HCI; {{known as}} chronic disseminated candidosis or CDC) {{is a distinct}} form of disseminated Candida infection with predominant involvement of the liver. Diagnosis of HCI is usually made on clinical suspicion together with multiple lesions in liver on ultrasound (US), CT and/or MRI scan. Fungal elements {{may not always be}} visible in liver tissue and mycological culture is frequently negative, making the evidence for proven fungal disease difficult. We studied a novel commercially available low-cost and density-array (LCD) chip technique for a molecular diagnosis of HCI. This is a two-step procedure with PCR amplification after DNA extraction followed by hybridization on a small chip provided by the manufacturer (Fungi 2. 1, Chipron GmbH). The analysis of DNA from 45 fungal control strains showed an excellent specificity and sensitivity. The DNA from 11 <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> of patients with haematological malignancies suffering from CDC was analysed on the LCD chip and overall 11 fungal pathogens could be detected in eight <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies,</b> supporting the clinical diagnosis of HCI/CDC. Analysis of <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> from controls was negative for fungal DNA in all samples studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{retrospective}} study evaluates the degree {{and distribution of}} hepatic steatosis in predominantly African-American patients who had <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> {{over a period of}} five years in our institution. METHOD: A search in the pathology registry of Howard University Hospital was performed for the presence of fat in <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Each biopsy was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 320 <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> that were reviewed, 61 were found to have steatosis. Fifty-six of the 61 patients were African-American. The mean body mass index in those African-American patients was found to be 30. Grade- 1 steatosis was found in 16 patients, grade 2 in 22 patients, grade 3 in 14 patients and nine patients had grade- 4 steatosis. Four patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). All four patients had simple steatosis without any inflammation. The frequency of NAFLD in our study population was found to be < 2 %. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was not found in any of our study population. Dyslipidemia was found in all four patients with steatosis. CONCLUSION: NAFLD has a low prevalence in African-American patients.

40|$|Background & Aims: To {{establish}} a chronic infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has {{to evade the}} host defense. Expression of HCV proteins in cultured cells and in hepatocytes of transgenic mice inhibits interferon-alpha-induced intracellular signaling through the Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway. It is not known if interferon-a signaling is inhibited in patients with chronic hepatitis C as well, and the molecular mechanisms are not well defined. Methods: Interferon alpha-induced signaling was investigated in <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with chronic hepatitis C. The molecular mechanisms of HCV interference with Jak-STAT signaling were analyzed in cultured cells, HCV transgenic mice, and <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Results: Interferon-alpha-induced DNA binding of STAT 1 was significantly impaired in <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with chronic hepatitis C compared with controls. Tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT 1. were intact, but methylation of STAT 1 on arginine 31 was reduced. Hypomethylated STAT 1 associated with PIAS 1, an inhibitor of STAT DNA binding. Increased expression levels of Protein Phosphatase 2 A were found in liver extracts from HCV transgenic mice and in <b>liver</b> <b>biopsies</b> of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Overexpression of PP 2 Ac in Huh 7 cells resulted in hypomethylation of STAT 1, increased binding to PIAS 1, and reduced interferon-alpha-induced DNA binding of STAT 1. Conclusions: We conclude that HCV interferes with interferon-alpha signaling via up-regulation of PP 2 Ac, hypomethylation of STAT 1, and increased STAT 1 -PIAS 1 association, resulting in reduced transcriptional activation of interferon-alpha-stimulated genes...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} stages (as with NAFLD and early NASH), most {{patients}} are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes, including being overweight, diabetes, high blood fats, and high blood pressure. A number of less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, certain medications, and gallstones.
