40|$|An {{efficient}} and practical {{synthesis of the}} antipsoriatic drug <b>Lonapalene</b> is reported. This involves the thermal rearrangement of 4 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 4 -hydroxy- 2, 3 - dimethoxycyclobutenone to 6 -chloro- 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2, 3 -dimethoxynaphthalene which was converted to <b>Lonapalene</b> upon treatment with acetic anhydride/pyridine.

40|$|The pharmacologic and {{clinical}} {{effects of the}} 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor, <b>lonapalene,</b> have been determined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, topical study in ten volunteers with psoriasis. A statistically significant clinical improvement was seen in lesions treated with 2 % <b>lonapalene</b> ointment as compared with vehicle-treated sites. Although there was a statistically significant reduction in the levels of material similar or identical to the chemoattractant arachidonate 5 -lipoxygenase product, leukotriene B 4 >, in skin chamber fluid samples from <b>lonapalene</b> versus vehicle treated lesions, no significant reduction in arachidonic acid or 12 -hydroxy- 5, 8, 10, 14 -eicosatetraenoic acid was seen. The reduction in leukotriene B 4 equivalents occurred before significant clinical improvement in lesions was seen. This and the selectivity of the pharmacologic response suggest that the therapeutic effect of topical <b>lonapalene</b> in psoriasis {{might be related to}} inhibition of leukotriene B 4 synthesis. These results support the view that 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, and that leukotriene B 4 is a relevant mediator of the pathology of this disease...|$|E
