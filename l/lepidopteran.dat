5|$|The Malagasy {{people believe}} {{the soul of}} the dead or of {{ancestors}} appears {{in the form of a}} <b>Lepidopteran,</b> and thus to attack it is to attack the ancestors.|$|E
5|$|While escaping, {{the newly}} hatched larvae of many species {{sometimes}} eat the chorion to emerge. Alternatively, the egg shell {{may have a}} line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge. The egg shell and {{a small amount of}} yolk trapped in the amniotic membranes forms the first food for most <b>lepidopteran</b> larvae.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a <b>lepidopteran</b> pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
40|$|Nelly N, Rusli R, Yaherwandi, Yusmarika F (2010) Diversity of {{parasitoid}} <b>Lepidopterans</b> larvae on Brassicaceae. Biodiversitas 11 : 93 - 96. Diversity of parasitoid <b>lepidopterans</b> larvae on Brassicaceae {{was conducted}} in several Brassicaceae areas in West Sumatra. The objective of the research was to study the diversity of parasitoid <b>lepidopterans</b> larvae on Brassicaceae. Sampling was conducted on Brassicaceae plants: cabbage, cauliflower, petsai and sawi. It was taken five samples in every plot, by using W method. Collection technique was done by direct collecting larvae, by using yellow trap and insect net. Adult of parasitoids was identified until family. The result of the research {{indicated that there was}} the diversity of parasitoid <b>lepidopterans,</b> the highest diversity was found on sawi. The number of parasitoid <b>Lepidopterans</b> larvae found was 566, 83 species, 9 families. The degree of parasitation on the three plants was low...|$|R

50|$|Eulepidoptera is a {{division}} of <b>lepidopterans</b> in the infraorder Heteroneura.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 a {{meta-analysis}} of 25 independent studies assessing effects of Bt Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control <b>lepidopteran</b> and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact {{the survival of}} honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, {{and there is also}} a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. <b>Lepidopteran</b> eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some <b>lepidopteran</b> species, {{including}} the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>lepidopterans</b> (moths and butterflies) exhibit small {{amplitude}} oscillation {{of their}} antennae at constant angles during flight. Antennal movements in <b>lepidopterans</b> were originally hypothesized {{to aid in}} wind or gravity perception. A study performed using the hawk moth, Manduca sexta, confirmed that these tiny, antennal oscillations were actually contributing to body rotation sensation.|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous <b>lepidopteran</b> may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to <b>lepidopteran</b> species including the Maruca.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera {{sequester}} or manufacture toxins which {{are stored in}} their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous <b>lepidopteran</b> may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E
50|$|The diet of white-throated rock thrushes {{consists}} {{mainly of}} invertebrates. These include weevils, mole crickets, and <b>lepidopterans.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} the American elm serve as food for the larvae of various <b>lepidopterans</b> (butterflies & moths).|$|R
25|$|The Belgian {{entomologist}} Auguste Lameere challenged this conclusion, claiming palaeontinids {{were more}} closely related to the extant family Cicadidae (cicadas). The English-Australian entomologist and geologist Robert John Tillyard supported Lameere's conclusion, noting that the wings of palaeontinid fossils lacked the characteristic scales of <b>lepidopterans</b> but instead had tubercules, pits, and cross-ridges like those found in modern cicadas. He also cited characteristics of wing venation that distinctly differs from that of <b>lepidopterans.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{estimated}} to be 100,000 species of ichneumonoid wasps in the families Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. These are almost exclusively parasitoids, mostly utilising other insects as hosts. Another family, the Pompilidae, is a specialist parasitoid of spiders. Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside <b>lepidopteran</b> larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their haemolymph, but if a parasitoid emerges from the host, the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the parasitoid. Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism. In Peru, 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against <b>Lepidopteran</b> (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in <b>lepidopteran</b> eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
50|$|Scramble {{competition}} also {{exists in}} <b>lepidopterans.</b> For example, male mourning cloak butterflies will fly around {{in search for}} widely dispersed females.|$|R
50|$|Scientifically, {{butterflies}} {{belong to}} the insect group of <b>lepidopterans,</b> which also includes moths, and moths also have the attention of Banteay Srey Butterfly Centre. The centre showcase examples of the large variety of <b>lepidopterans</b> in Cambodia, preferably local varieties, in large netted garden environment. As butterflies have a short lifespan {{of no more than}} a few weeks and because many species are seasonal, there are twice as many species present around the centre during November and December.|$|R
50|$|Several fossils {{originally}} {{described as}} <b>lepidopterans</b> have subsequently {{been assigned to}} other groups, some as basal Amphiesmenoptera, others into other entirely distinct insect orders.|$|R
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that <b>lepidopteran</b> eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill <b>lepidopteran</b> caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|E
25|$|Studying the {{evolution}} of butterflies and moths is challenging, since fossils are so rare. But the few <b>Lepidopteran</b> fossils that exist, captured in amber or compressed in fine-grained rocks, show great detail. The earliest <b>Lepidopteran</b> fossils appear in rocks that are about 190 million years old. These tiny fragments of scaled wings and bodies clearly indicate that moths evolved before butterflies.|$|E
50|$|Helianthus {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of many <b>lepidopterans.</b> The seeds of the species Helianthus annuus {{are used as}} human food.|$|R
50|$|Insects diversified {{during the}} Cretaceous, {{and the oldest}} known ants, {{termites}} and some <b>lepidopterans,</b> akin to butterflies and moths, appeared. Aphids, grasshoppers and gall wasps appeared.|$|R
5000|$|Cynara {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of many <b>lepidopterans,</b> such as the {{artichoke}} plume moth (Platyptilia carduidactyla), a pest of artichoke crops.|$|R
25|$|The {{light brown}} apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) (often {{abbreviated}} to LBAM) is a leafroller moth {{belonging to the}} <b>lepidopteran</b> family Tortricidae.|$|E
25|$|The Hepialidae are {{a family}} of insects in the <b>lepidopteran</b> order. Moths of this family are often {{referred}} to as swift moths or ghost moths.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} common names, the {{application}} of the word is arbitrary and the larvae of sawflies commonly are called caterpillars as well. Both <b>lepidopteran</b> and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes.|$|E
50|$|The western whiptail mostly eats insects, spiders, scorpions, <b>lepidopterans</b> (butterflies and moths), crickets, grasshoppers, and beetles. They {{use their}} jaws {{instead of their}} tongue to capture their prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{variable}} checkerspot's main predators are birds. Populations of {{the variable}} checkerspot, like most <b>lepidopterans,</b> are usually scarcely distributed and thus direct observation of avian predation on butterflies is rare.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lepidopterans</b> {{and their}} parasitoids on okra plants in Riberão Preto (SP, Brazil) Lepidópteros e seus parasitoides em cultura de quiabo em Ribeirão Preto, SP, Brasil Received 05. 18. 11 Approved 11. 26. 11 Returned {{by the author}} 03. 08. 12 CR- 5378 The {{aim of this study}} was to {{identify}} the defoliating <b>lepidopterans</b> and their parasitoids occurring on okra plants in the district of Riberão Preto city (SP. Brazil). Caterpillars were collected by hand from an experimental field of okra, in March and April, 2009. They were placed individually on Petri dishes lined with wet filter paper, containing shredded okra leaves, and kept in a climactic chamber (25 ± 1 °C, 12 : 12 h light/ dark photoperiod, RH 70 ± 10 %) until the emergence of <b>lepidopterans</b> and/or parasitoids. In all, 63 <b>lepidopterans</b> were obtained: three species of Noctuidae, Anomis flava (Fabricius), Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) and Pseudoplusia includens (Walker); one of Pieridae, Ascia monuste orseis (Godart), and an unidentified species of Tortricidae. One unidentified tachinid fly (Diptera) and the Hymenoptera parasitoids Copidosoma floridanum (Ashmead) (Encyrtidae) and Euplectrus sp. (Eulophidae) emerged from A. flava, while C. floridanum and an unidentified tachinid, from P. includens. This is the first report of an association between the herbivores S. frugiperda, P. includens and A. monuste orceis, the parasitoids C. floridanum and Euplectrus sp. on okra plants...|$|R
