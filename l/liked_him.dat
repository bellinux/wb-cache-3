5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in The Doorway to Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth. [...] "Oh yes!--because you <b>like</b> <b>him!</b> But {{you know}} nothing of him--nothing. How can you <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> not knowing him? He may be a real bad character. How would you <b>like</b> <b>him</b> then?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{have done}} a lot of books, and I can tell you — without {{mentioning}} names — that publishers are not all <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> There are very few <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Or there are none <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He is also, I might add, a madman. Helmut Newton ...|$|R
5|$|With Homer having {{convinced}} Lisa {{that nothing}} can go wrong at Krusty's show, Lisa and Ralph go together. On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was because nobody else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E
25|$|McAnly {{said that}} Cottrell invited Phillips to his Elizabethtown motel room. When Phillips arrived, Cottrell asked if Phillips <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> without his shirt, and when Phillips said yes and touched him, Cottrell {{put him in}} a {{headlock}} and choked him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Like him? Of course, {{she will}} <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Why should she not <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> Young, and good-looking, {{with a fine}} business, doesn't owe a sou, I'll be bound, and with a houseful of furniture. Of course, she'll <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I don't suppose {{there is so much}} {{difficulty}} about that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The gentleman's {{always for}} doing something,' said the other, forcing him along as he spoke. 'I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> for that. I do <b>like</b> <b>him</b> for that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you know}} Mr. Arabin, I am sure you must <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I know and <b>like</b> <b>him</b> much. Everybody that knows <b>him</b> must <b>like</b> him." ...|$|R
25|$|Gu Li was {{initially}} a servant under Sun Quan. Sun Quan <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his attentive and forthright personality and promoted {{him to the}} position of a Close Attendant (親近監). Gu Li was loyal, daring, and direct in speech, so Sun Quan trusted him even more and regarded him as a close aide.|$|E
25|$|When Schur's lectures were {{canceled}} in 1933, {{there was an}} outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> By the efforts of his colleagues Erhard Schmidt Schur was allowed to continue lecturing {{until the end of}} September 1935 for the time being. Schur was the last Jewish professor who lost his job at this time.|$|E
25|$|Duncan Idaho is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Introduced in the first novel of the series, 1965's Dune, the character became a breakout character as the readers <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> and was revived by Herbert in 1969's Dune Messiah. He is the only character to feature in all six of Herbert's original Dune novels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{heard of}} it, upon my word; {{and why do}} you wish I should be more <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> I don't wish to be <b>like</b> <b>him</b> at all, thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{she said}} frankly. [...] "Oh, I don't hate him, of course. I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> well enough. I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very well. But we'll quarrel all our lives." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Jewish girl bemoans, [...] "Finally, I meet a nice, rich Jewish boy! He's {{just like}} papa. He looks <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He acts <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Oy vey, mama hates him!" ...|$|R
25|$|When {{only four}} fresh eggs were {{available}} one morning at a London hotel, he awarded {{them to the}} bowlers because Lancashire {{were likely to be}} fielding all day. His team respected and <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> and he did exactly what an amateur should: he declared boldly to give the opposition a chance and his bowlers time to take their wickets. The crowds returned to Old Trafford, and the team were slightly unlucky to finish only third.|$|E
25|$|According to one eyewitness,"...he did {{not become}} a puppet {{in the hands of}} the lamas but, on the contrary, took them in hand. Since his young years he wanted to restore the great Mongolian kingdom of Genghis Khan or, at least, to {{liberate}} Mongolia from the Chinese and make it self-dependent. Local princes feared him, but the masses <b>liked</b> <b>him...</b> An independent and clever first hierarch and ruler was unacceptable neither for Tibet, nor for the Chinese".|$|E
25|$|The bank's {{high level}} contact in Tehran was general Albert Houtum-Schindler who was, like Reuter, a British subject of German origin. Schindler lived in Persia {{for many years}} and was the most {{informed}} member of the European community in Persia at the time. Henry Drummond Wolff <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> so much that he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the foreign office to engage him as a member of Legation staff. Reuter employed him instead.Schindler and Rabino were instrumental in increasing the Bank's reputation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is," [...] she declared. [...] "I have only known Captain Granet {{for a very}} short time. I <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> of course--every one must <b>like</b> <b>him</b> who knows him--but that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was gone}} from him, fleeing away along the path in a run while the last words were being spoken; and yet, though they were spoken in a low voice, she heard and remembered every syllable. What did the man mean by saying that he {{intended}} that she should <b>like</b> <b>him?</b> <b>Like</b> <b>him!</b> How could she fail of <b>liking</b> <b>him?</b> Only was it not incumbent on her to take some steps which might save her from ever seeing <b>him</b> again? <b>Like</b> <b>him,</b> indeed! What was {{the meaning of the}} word? Had he intended to ask her to love him? And if so, what answer must she make? ...|$|R
60|$|I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> {{to give me}} {{back the}} {{responsibility}} for general affairs, a responsibility which he can't acquit, and which saps his life. I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> to give me back {{the responsibility for the}} future. I would <b>like</b> <b>him</b> to give me back the responsibility for thought, for direction. I wish we could take hope and belief together. I would undertake my share of the responsibility, if he gave me his belief.|$|R
25|$|Boycie (John Challis) — A shady {{used car}} {{salesman}} and a frightful snob. Boycie, a freemason, was very self-centred {{and prone to}} boasting about his high social status. Challis had played a similar character in an episode of Citizen Smith. Sullivan <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> and promised to cast him in a future series, which led to Boycie. Boycie later featured in a spin-off series, The Green Green Grass, starting in 2005, in which {{he and his wife}} Marlene fled from a criminal gang.|$|E
25|$|Bee {{saw to it}} that White, {{his future}} star, was {{provided}} the comfort and special assistance he needed. He would tip the local YMCA's janitor {{to make sure that the}} courts were open all night, for example. White, who deferred socially to his older, more street-wise teammates, became friendly with a guard, coincidentally named Eddie Gard. White <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> for his personable nature and sense of style. Gard, however, was also thievish, and it was he who ultimately got White involved in the point shaving scandal that followed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1844 {{election}} Willard, a Democrat, stumped {{all around}} the Louisville area and southern Indiana for James Polk who ultimately won the election. While on the stump the people of New Albany, Indiana so <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> that they invited him to come live in their community. He accepted their offer and moved there {{in the spring of}} 1845 and set up a law office. Finding there to be a lack of clients, he also worked for a time as a writer in the clerk's office to obtain extra income. He met Carline C. Cook, a town native, and was married to her in 1847. The couple had three children, but the oldest, Ashbel P. Willard Jr. died from scarlet fever at age three. New Albany remained Willard's home {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is so {{much more}} good-natured when he is ill,' was Helen's defence. 'I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> now; I don't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> at all when he is well, because then he is always cross. Don't you think so, Johnnie?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I don't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> at all;--and now {{you know}} the truth. You believe in him;--I don't. You think {{him to be a}} fine fellow and a gentleman, whereas I don't think him to be either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know him}} better, certainly, {{if you mean}} that," [...] said Bessie. [...] "And I <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much. But I don't <b>like</b> <b>him</b> enough to make trouble for him with his family. However, I don't believe in that." ...|$|R
25|$|The Whigs built {{a strong}} party {{organization}} in most states; they were weak {{only on the}} frontier. The Whigs used newspapers effectively, and soon adopted the exciting campaign techniques that lured 75 to 85% of the eligible voters to the polls. Abraham Lincoln emerged early as the leader in Illinois—where he usually was bested by an even more talented politician, Stephen Douglas. While Douglas and the Democrats were somewhat behind the Whigs in newspaper work, they made up for this weakness by emphasis on party loyalty. Anyone who attended a Democratic convention, from precinct level to national level, was honor bound to support the final candidate, whether he <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> or not. This rule produced numerous schisms, {{but on the whole}} the Democrats controlled and mobilized their rank and file more effectively than the Whigs did.|$|E
25|$|After the defeat, Richthofen {{travelled}} to see Hitler on 11 February. He {{first met}} with Göring, who {{was worried that}} Richthofen would use the opportunity to criticise his leadership. In the event he did not, but Richthofen did criticise Göring's reluctance to disagree with Hitler and attacked his willingness {{to allow him to}} receive what he considered to be faulty advice. When Richthofen did meet Hitler he criticised him openly for micromanagement, though he did insist he had been let down by his advisors. Hitler took all of this calmly, and admitted (as he had done to Erhard Milch) that he bore the ultimate responsibility for the air lift fiasco. Richthofen argued commanders needed more tactical and operational freedom, as had Manstein. Hitler agreed. Richthofen was probably helped, regardless of his criticism, by the fact that Hitler genuinely <b>liked</b> <b>him,</b> and believed him to be loyal. Four days later Richthofen was promoted to the rank of field marshall being the youngest officer beside Göring to reach this rank in the Wehrmacht.|$|E
500|$|Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a {{cartoonist}} for the San Francisco Chronicle. While {{researching the}} film, Fincher considered Gyllenhaal to play Graysmith. According to the director, [...] "I really <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> in Donnie Darko and I thought, He's an interesting double-sided coin. He {{can do that}} naive thing but he can also do possessed." [...] To prepare for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith and videotaped him in order to study his mannerisms and behavior.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> uncle, {{because he}} saved your life; {{but in other}} respects I {{do not know that}} I do <b>like</b> <b>him</b> particularly. He is very {{pleasant}} and very amusing, but I don't feel that I quite understand him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are glad I <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> my dear. If I did n't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and you did, {{it would n't be}} {{satisfactory}} at all. I can imagine nothing more miserable; I should n't die in any sort of comfort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Betsey Jane,' {{returned}} Mrs Wickam in {{her most}} solemn tones, 'was put upon as that child has been put upon, and changed as that child has changed. I have seen her sit, often and often, think, think, thinking, <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I have seen her look, often and often, old, old, old, <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I have heard her, many a time, talk just <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I consider that child and Betsey Jane on the same footing entirely, Miss Berry.' ...|$|R
