25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, it is {{stated that}} Issachar {{was born on}} the fourth of Av, and lived 122 years. According to the midrashic Book of Jasher, Issachar married Aridah, the younger daughter of Jobab, a son of Joktan; the Torah states that Issachar had four sons, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt, with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus. The midrashic Book of Jasher portrays Issachar as somewhat pragmatic, due to his strong effort in being more learned, less involved with other matters which led him to such actions <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> feeble part in military campaigns involving his brothers, and generally residing in strongly fortified cities and, depending on his brother Zebulun's financial support in return for a share in the spiritual reward he gains.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{where she}} earned an M.A. in 1936, Brodie lost {{her faith in}} {{religion}} entirely. In 1975, she recalled, [...] "It was <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could {{not go back to}} the old life, and I never did." [...] She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married Bernard Brodie on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.|$|E
500|$|From {{his general}} reading, Larkin had {{acquired}} a considerable knowledge of girls' school fiction, and had formed definite views on the authors of such works: [...] "stupid women without a grain of humour in their minds", who lacked [...] "erotic sensibility" [...] and treated the lesbian perspective [...] "too casually". His intention to write in this genre is expressed {{in a letter to}} his friend Norman Iles, dated 5 June 1943, just before Larkin sat his degree Finals: [...] "I am spending my time doing an obscene Lesbian novel in the form of a school story". The novel was Trouble at Willow Gables, a school adventure story in the manner of Dorita Fairlie Bruce or Dorothy Vicary, which Larkin completed at home while awaiting his Finals results. That was the prelude to a busy summer's writing: [...] "Leaving Oxford was <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> cork out of a bottle. Writing flooded out of me", Larkin later told his biographer.|$|E

It seemed much <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> undue {{advantage}} of Sewatis to use his money, and yet there could be no question but that he was pained when it was refused.|$|R

2500|$|December 9, 1991: It {{has been}} {{often said that}} [...] "Getting an Education from MIT is <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> drink from a Fire Hose", inspiring hackers to connect a real fire hose and a concrete-embedded fire hydrant to a {{drinking}} fountain in Building 16. Years later, the iconic monument has been semi-permanently re-installed by the MIT Museum in the Stata Center.|$|E

We've {{been talking about}} doing {{something}} <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> small chamber orchestra – 10 or 15 people – and tour with them. And we have to write songs. We have to write new material – totally new – so the whole, entire set will be a new album. Then we'll go into the studio after the tour, record, produce and release a record as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "random" [...] isometry, <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> {{sheet of}} paper from a table and {{randomly}} laying it back, [...] "almost surely" [...] is a rotation or a glide reflection (they have three degrees of freedom). This applies regardless {{of the details of}} the probability distribution, as long as θ and the direction of the added vector are independent and uniformly distributed and the length of the added vector has a continuous distribution. A pure translation and a pure reflection are special cases with only two degrees of freedom, while the identity is even more special, with no degrees of freedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just because}} we are girls, and they are ashamed to refuse us," [...] she acknowledged. [...] "It seems <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> unfair {{advantage}} of them, I know, but those who need urging and shaming, to induce them to respond loyally to the nation's needs, deserve no consideration. We're not robbing them, either," [...] she added, [...] "but just inducing {{them to make a}} safe investment. Isn't that true, Gran'pa Jim?" ...|$|R

60|$|Now Alvina did {{not want}} to learn to ride a bicycle. The two Miss Carlins, two more old maids, had made {{themselves}} ridiculous for ever by becoming twin cycle fiends. And the horrible energetic strain of peddling a bicycle over miles and miles of high-way did not attract Alvina at all. She was completely indifferent to sight-seeing and scouring about. She <b>liked</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion. But rushing about in any way was hateful to her. And then, to be taught to ride a bicycle by Albert Witham! Her very soul stood still.|$|R
2500|$|With {{both the}} teams level on one win each, the final and fourth test match was {{critical}} to both the teams' ambitions. Sourav Ganguly won the toss and elected to bat first on a good, bouncy pitch. The Indian openers, Sehwag and Chopra added 98 runs for the first wicket [...] before lunch. Sehwag and Chopra stitched the runs with a definite uncertainty, as they were troubled by the swing and seam [...] movement generated by Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, the latter coming off an injury. The openers played and missed frequently, as Brett Lee looked <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wicket.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{the book}} drew fire {{from one of}} McKay's contemporaries, W. E. B. Du Bois. To Du Bois, the novel's frank depictions of {{sexuality}} and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the [...] "prurient demand" [...] of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black [...] "licentiousness." [...] As Du Bois said, [...] "Home to Harlem ... {{for the most part}} nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> bath." [...] Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as propaganda in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people.|$|E
2500|$|The March 8, 1969 {{issue of}} Nature offered a {{generally}} positive review for the Condon Report, but wondered {{why so much}} effort had been expended on such a subject: [...] "The Colorado project is a monumental achievement, but one of perhaps misapplied ingenuity. It would doubtless be inapt to compare it with earlier centuries' attempts to calculate how many angels could balance {{on the point of}} a pin; it is more <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> sledgehammer to crack a nut, except that the nuts will be quite immune to its impact." [...] On January 8, 1969, the New York Times headlined its coverage: [...] "U.F.O. Finding: No Visits From Afar." [...] The article said that based on the Report, the ETH could finally be dismissed and all UFO reports had prosaic explanations. It noted that the Report had its critics, but characterized them as [...] "U.F.O. enthusiasts." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nothing that I {{have ever}} been called upon to do caused me more worry than the act of {{charging}} those land-seekers for their meals and bunks, {{and yet it was}} perfectly right that they should pay. Our buildings had been established with great trouble and at considerable expense, and my father said, [...] "We cannot afford to feed so many people without return," [...] and yet it seemed to me <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> unfair advantage of poor and homeless men. It was with the greatest difficulty that I brought myself to charge them anything at all. Fortunately the prices had been fixed by my father.|$|R

2500|$|Norbury (Riley) {{opined that}} it was [...] "unbelievable" [...] to work with Rawle, saying [...] "You can learn {{everything}} from Jeff - he's been there, done it and he knows everyone!" [...] Kingston (who plays India) called Rawle [...] "amazing" [...] {{and said she was}} pleased upon learning that he would play Silas. Kilkelly of Digital Spy praised Rawle's performance, stating: [...] "Jeff Rawle [...] does a fantastic job of portraying the dual role of the affable older man and sinister killer. He should definitely be one to watch out for as he becomes a more permanent fixture in the village in the weeks ahead." [...] Rachel Shenton (who plays Mitzeee) described Rawle as [...] "brilliant" [...] and said the storyline is [...] "really interesting". In September 2011, Porter (Theresa) praised Rawle, calling him a [...] "brilliant actor". Barlow (Rae) said Rawle was [...] "amazing" [...] and a [...] "dream come true" [...] to work with. Hassan (Lynsey) praised Rawle, saying she really enjoyed working with him. She said [...] "Jeff has the ability to turn any scene into a really great, gritty scene, so for me it's been <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> masterclass, really." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series also {{introduces}} a new character named Singularity, a pocket universe that gains self-consciousness during [...] "Secret Wars". Wilson likened Singularity to Q from [...] and said, [...] "Her entire existence is so {{unlike that of}} ours that she really has to learn about {{what we think of}} as being an individual and having an identity from the ground up, with no point of access except those she meets." [...] Wilson also stated that Singularity can act as [...] "a whole world within herself and she can also move between different worlds and dimensions <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk, so she has access to all corners of the Marvel U in a way that other characters do not." [...] " [...] one of the first people we have encounter Singularity," [...] Bennett revealed. [...] "So Nico is put in charge of acclimating this character and showing her their civilization and world while trying to save it. Nico is sort of like the grounding human force and the anchor that begins to show Singularity the capacity of human beings, both for good and for evil, so Nico becomes even more invested when she starts to see her homeland through the eyes of this stranger." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mike Tyson (voiced by himself) - The title {{character}} of the series, Mike Tyson is a retired boxer who now solves mysteries. He is portrayed as being wildly {{out of touch with}} reality, confusing a chess Grandmaster with the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, or Elon Musk with Elton John, thinking a binary code spells out 'Oooh', and eating junk food without realizing he's on a diet. He has a reputation for doing unusual things <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> oatmeal bath with cooked oatmeal, owning a pet grizzly bear, and using mosquitoes to help him sleep, along with pronouncing the names of many other characters incorrectly, even by calling his own daughter Yang or Yee instead of Yung.|$|R
5000|$|WPI {{has also}} {{generated}} criticism for statements defending {{the use of}} antiretroviral medications {{as a treatment for}} CFS. For some individuals, these medications can have substantial side effects. Jay Levy states that taking anti-HIV medications is [...] "not <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> aspirin". There is currently no consensus that XMRV is capable of infecting humans, much less causing disease; the rush to prescribe antiretrovirals has been described as premature and based on [...] "an unproven hypothesis". Another criticism is that even if XMRV did cause CFS and antiviral medications were effective against the virus, rigorous trials would be needed to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing. Anecdotal treatments, they say, are unhelpful and possibly harmful to [...] "the million or more individuals experiencing these serious conditions".|$|R

In 1988 he told a reporter from the New York Times that Israel {{should be willing to}} trade land for peace, [...] "We would give up Jewish land not with a sigh of relief, <b>like</b> <b>taking</b> off <b>a</b> tight pair of shoes, but rather with the anguish of an amputation.

500|$|The show's website {{released}} a motion comic {{based on the}} first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary, and other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed pleasure that the show is faithful to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that [...] " [...] really are doing six one-hour movies", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. [...] "The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel <b>like</b> <b>taking.</b> <b>As</b> long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to.
