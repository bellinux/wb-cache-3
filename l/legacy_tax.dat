40|$|Although {{supply side}} theory {{may have been}} obvious to economists, it instigated {{a major change in}} the nature of tax policymaking through {{marginal}} rate cuts in both the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Also, the 1981 bill was the culmination of an era in which policymakers could use expected revenue increases to enact rate cuts as well as special tax provisions. The deficit became a force in tax policymaking not only because of revenue losses from the 1981 bill, but because the indexation of rate brackets turned projected future surpluses into projected future deficits. Finally, starting in 1982, the <b>legacy</b> of special <b>tax</b> provisions led to cries for a level playing field that would treat similar taxpayers more equally and improve efficiency in the allocation of resources. ...|$|R
40|$|Real {{option and}} dynamic asset {{valuation}} techniques are becoming established as standard methods for evaluating investment {{decisions that are}} subject to quantifiable uncertainty. This has been particularly the case in natural resources industries. In the UK oil industry there is renewed interest in oilfield valuation techniques - the 22 nd UK Offshore Licensing Round was held in 2004 {{with a total of}} 97 licences offered to 58 companies in 2004, of which 15 were new entrants to the UK Continental Shelf. Many firms involved in these bid processes now routinely use dynamic modelling and real option valuation to assess oilfield value premiums in differing operating and taxation enviroments. Literature on PV and real option valuation is clear that models should accommodate tax effects but is unclear about its universal treatment in dynamic models. We examine the impact of the North Sea oil industry’s tax regime on the valuation of shelf real options by using a sample of forty oil fields that for the period 1970 to 2001 had initial estimated reserves greater than 75 million barrels of oil. Our sample uses Wood Mackenzie primary source field data updated quarterly by analysts using bottom up field research. Our findings are that the tax enviroment of itself will cause asymmetrical movements in both free cash flow models and option values. These results are of interest to both academics and practitioners in that that tax {{plays an important role in}} the valuation process of real options in the oil and gas sector. Our results show that North Sea valuation models that treat taxation as a deterministic function systematically overstate DCF valuation results, understate volatility estimates and undervalue real options. Specifically our analysis suggests that failure to incorporate the variable nature of tax into the valuation process leads to an 18 percent over valuation of asset PV and an under valuation of the option price by 19. 5 percent. The increased usage of real option techniques in assessing oil field bids highlights the need for valuation models to incorporate the country specific nature of tax terms. This is especially important for oil fields in the North Sea where field exploration block bidding interest remains high and the <b>legacy</b> of <b>tax</b> changes is long; demanding from financiers a new way of assessing bid values in the face of future cash flow uncertainty.

40|$|As {{the governments}} of {{countries}} in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union continue {{to grapple with the}} challenges of transition, many significant policy developments have already taken place over the past six years, developments of interest to policymakers and economists alike. Conditions in these Countries in Transition (CITs) have presented a formidable challenge to reformers, a challenge that has been met with bold, rapid action in some cases; timid, tepid response in others. Now, as CITs enter the seventh year of transition, perhaps lessons can be drawn from their experience which may be of value in the future to those countries that will, in time, be in transition from socialist to market-based economic systems. The goal {{of this paper is to}} review the transition experience in tax reform over the past six years, offer a preliminary evaluation of the impact of different approaches to tax reform, and extract lessons from the successes and failures of this experience. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start with a brief review of tax systems in socialist planned economies in Section 2, and then move on to an examination of the enduring <b>legacy</b> of <b>tax</b> systems under central planning in Section 3. Many of the failures, problems, and idiosyncrasies of the reform efforts during the transition can be traced to the past, when these tax systems started. In Section 4, we review the two general paradigms for reform that policymakers faced early on in the transition: the adoption wholesale of a western-type, modern tax system or a tax system adapted to transition economies. Many of the current problems in the fiscal arena can be partially attributed to the scope, pace, and stability of the reform process. In Section 5 we offer a short description of the evaluation and current structure of tax systems in CITs. In Section 6 we make a preliminary attempt to quantify the impact of different approaches to tax reform on economic performance of CITs. In Section 7, we summarize the lessons from tax reform in CITs. While no strategy could be comprehensive and infallible, there are lessons to extract from the concrete experiences, relatively better practices and mistakes of CITs for the remaining centrally-planned economies when they in turn embark upon comprehensive market reform.

40|$|This article {{examines}} a specific category of legal transfers between the United Kingdom and Canada, considering the <b>legacy</b> of UK <b>tax</b> concepts in Canadian income tax law. Two main areas are considered where, in our view, this influence {{has been most}} profound: (i) the concept of income deployed for Canadian tax purposes; and (ii) judicial approaches to statutory interpretation and tax avoidance. Although the rules and concepts that Canadian courts and legislatures have adopted {{in each of these}} areas have necessarily evolved over time, the path of this evolution as well as current approaches reflect the enduring influence of UK tax concepts on Canadian income tax law. The first substantive section examines the structure and concept of income in Canadian tax law, linking its origins and development to the global and schedular taxes that were adopted in the United Kingdom in 1799 and 1803, and to the source and trust concepts that UK courts have employed to interpret the meaning of income for tax purposes. The next section considers judicial approaches to the interpretation of tax statutes and tax avoidance in Canada, tracing the origins of a strict construction approach to interpretation and a formalistic approach to the characterisation of transactions and relationships to early judicial decisions in the UK, and explaining the influence of this traditional approach on subsequent legislative and judicial developments. The final section concludes that the traditional approach endures, albeit uneasily, in Canadian income tax law in the continuing emphasis on textual interpretation of tax legislation and in the formalist application of the general anti-avoidance rule by the Supreme Court of Canada...|$|R
60|$|The World State in {{this ideal}} {{presents}} {{itself as the}} sole landowner of the earth, with the great local governments I have adumbrated, the local municipalities, holding, as it were, feudally under it as landlords. The State or these subordinates holds all the sources of energy, and either directly or through its tenants, farmers and agents, develops these sources, and renders the energy available {{for the work of}} life. It or its tenants will produce food, and so human energy, and the exploitation of coal and electric power, and the powers of wind and wave and water will be within its right. It will pour out this energy by assignment and lease and acquiescence and what not upon its individual citizens. It will maintain order, maintain roads, maintain a cheap and efficient administration of justice, maintain cheap and rapid locomotion and be the common carrier of the planet, convey and distribute labour, control, let, or administer all natural productions, pay for and secure healthy births and a healthy and vigorous new generation, maintain the public health, coin money and sustain standards of measurement, subsidise research, and reward such commercially unprofitable undertakings as benefit the community as a whole; subsidise when needful chairs of criticism and authors and publications, and collect and distribute information. The energy developed and the employment afforded by the State will descend like water that the sun has sucked out of the sea to fall upon a mountain range, and back to the sea again it will come at last, debouching in ground rent and royalty and license fees, in the fees of travellers and profits upon carrying and coinage and the like, in death duty, transfer <b>tax,</b> <b>legacy</b> and forfeiture, returning to the sea. Between the clouds and the sea it will run, as a river system runs, down through a great region of individual enterprise and interplay, whose freedom it will sustain. In that intermediate region between the kindred heights and deeps those beginnings and promises will arise that are the essential significance, the essential substance, of life. From our human point of view the mountains and sea are for the habitable lands that lie between. So likewise the State is for Individualities. The State is for Individuals, the law is for freedoms, the world is for experiment, experience, and change: these are the fundamental beliefs upon which a modern Utopia must go.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} taxation in the transitional economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. The governments of transitional economies have been implementingsimultaneous reforms of legal, political, and economic institutions, reforms which are dependent upon {{the ability of the}} emerging tax systems to efficiently enforce the tax system. As the transitional process continues, we are able to identify characteristics of successful reform programs, and note the common problems that hinder implementation of more stable tax systems. The discussion covers 4 main issues: the enduring <b>legacy</b> of centralized <b>tax</b> systems, the general direction and timing of tax reform, the tax policies of the transitional period, and thoughts about the path of reform in the future. In the Centrally Planned Economy (CPE), taxes were viewed as an instrument to manage cash flows and to fulfill the budget plan. Taxes were often retroactively adjusted to meet perceived expenditure needs. In many cases, the final tax liability of an enterprise was more dependent upon its ability to negotiate with the financial administration than tax law. Private activity was taxed at exorbitant rates and in most cases, citizens were unaware of taxation. Tax administration was simplified by the central role of the government in the economy and the control over the payment system. The path and timing of reform had to address the legacy of the previous system and determine the structure of the transitional tax system. Two major options were considered,a transitional system of taxesthat would be relatively simple to administer and provide broad coverage of the economy, and a system that would replicate most features of Western tax systems. The most common adoption of the latter system led to substantialproblems, although over time there has been convergence towards sensible tax structures. Yet, the gains of the last 4 to 6 years are endangered by the almost universal lack ofprogress in the reform and modernization of tax administrations. While governments have been able to adopt andevolve their Western oriented tax systems with relative ease, the lack of a significant commitment to modernize existing tax administrations has led to higher tax evasion and low rates of revenue mobilization. Only recently, as governments face substantial fiscal deficits resulting for low rates of revenue mobilization, is more attention being paid to tax administration. tax, transition, tax reform...|$|R

It has so far dynamically tapped talent, support and development partnerships in cross-disciplinary collaborations, throughout the university. A fitting development context for early access creation, to a publicly-owned resource like Oregon's Percent for Art Collection located at Oregon State. Included in her studies of everything French, Kerrie is a community artist who is deeply passionate about both sides of the access to the arts challenge. She advocates for the value of the arts in all our lives in multiple ways, from learning about seeing things differently, to supporting development of cultural voices, to pure enjoyment that can be shared in inspiring ways. This multicultural orientation on the personal level, has found expression in the unique nature of this mobile application project's inclusion of two additional features meant to draw viewers into the entire exploration and discovery process. Starting with implementation of augmented reality technology, hence the name: the ARt project- digital overlays located in our real world environment become accessible through one's smart device. These augments provide us additional pathways of connecting with contextualized forms of information in a place-based orientation; an exciting way to guide visitors through the state university's niche setting to discover the public art along with a plethora of public knowledge previously, more commonly, unknown. The ARt project features the Percent for Art Collection as a delightfully exploratory tool to further consider mobile technology integration within our daily experiences, as it's second feature rooted in a visual thinking content model, invite each viewer to become incrementally more aware of the looking experience over time, and consider what having eyes means in a variety of contexts...|$|R
