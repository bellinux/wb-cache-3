40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Three {{hundred fifty}} {{families}} from 11 breeding zones in southwest Oregon were grown {{in a common}} garden in Corvallis, Oregon, and patterns of genetic variation for seed weight and six first-year seedling characteristics were described. For most characteristics, large differences among breeding zones were found along an east-west transect, with small differences associated with changes in latitude. Consistent trends with elevation were apparent only for date of budset, the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> and seed weight. Most patterns of variation for seedling characteristics appear {{to be associated with}} climatic variables of the source locations, particularly annual precipitation. Total height, epicotyl length, number of branches, date of budset (weeks after July 1), and the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> increased with an increase in moisture, i. e. were greatest in breeding zones near the coast and at higher latitudes. Seed weight and the frequency of second flushing decreased with increasing moisture availability; i. e., parent trees from dry, particularly low elevation, inland areas produced heavier seed and seedlings which second flushed more frequently. Date of budset and the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> appear to be influenced by winter temperatures, as they were found to decrease with increasing elevation. The proportion of variation among the 350 families due to differences among families within zones was high for all seedling traits (mean 41. 1 percent) and generally of similar magnitude to variation observed among breeding units (mean 43. 8 percent). Variation among breeding zones (elevations) within breeding units was high only for date of budset (29. 1 percent) and frost damage (33. 0 percent) (mean 10. 8 percent for seedling traits) ...|$|R

40|$|Agriculturally used grasslands in the Alps are characterised by a {{trade-off}} between high fodder production in some and high plant species richness in others. In contrast to plant species richness and production, however, {{little is known}} on the relevance of biological interactions between plants, invertebrate herbivores, and fungal pathogens for grasslands in the Alps. At {{the time when the}} vegetation was fully developed, but prior to agricultural use, we examined whether <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> herbivory and fungal pathogen infection, and their diversity, are affected by plant functional group, land use, and altitude. Moreover, we studied whether extent and diversity of <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> are related to each other, to plant species richness, and to standing crop. We recorded the <b>leaf</b> area <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> ten types of herbivory and five types of fungal pathogen infection on 12, 054 plant leaves of legumes, other forbs, and graminoids collected in 215 grassland parcels in 12 valleys in the Swiss Alps. With 83 % of all leaves infested, herbivory and fungal pathogen infection were omnipresent. However, only 2. 7 % <b>leaf</b> area was <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> herbivory and 1. 2 % <b>by</b> fungal pathogens. <b>Damage</b> <b>by</b> herbivory was highest on legumes, and <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> fungal pathogens was highest on graminoids. More <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> herbivory occurred in traditionally mown sites and at lower altitudes, while <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> fungal pathogen infection was independent of land use and altitude. Most types of herbivory were found on legumes and on leaves from fertilised sites, whereas the number of fungal pathogen types was highest on graminoids and in unfertilised sites. Larger standing crop was associated with higher <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> and diversity of herbivory types per <b>leaf.</b> Neither <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> herbivory nor by fungal pathogens was correlated with plant species diversity. In more plant species rich parcels, the number of herbivory types was lower at the leaf level, but tended to be higher at the parcel level. Our results highlight the omnipresence of plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions. They suggest that current land use changes from mowing to grazing or to abandonment decrease the diversity of herbivory, and that fertilisation decreases pathogen diversity. As our results did not reveal conservation conflicts between diversities of plants, herbivores, and fungal pathogens, and as the damage from herbivory and pathogens is generally low, we conclude that for protecting the high diversity of plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions a diverse low-intensity land use should be maintained...|$|R
50|$|Although this shrub is drought resistant, if {{supplied}} with adequate water {{will produce a}} massed display of reddish-orange flowers.

50|$|Many {{deciduous}} plants flower {{during the}} period when they are leafless, as this increases the effectiveness of pollination. The absence of leaves improves wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants and increases the visibility of the flowers to insects in insect-pollinated plants. This strategy is not without risks, as the flowers can be <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> or, in dry season regions, result in water stress on the plant. Nevertheless, there is much less branch and trunk breakage from glaze ice storms when leafless, and plants can reduce water loss due to the reduction in availability of liquid water during cold winter days.|$|R
50|$|Like most succulents, {{they require}} {{extremely}} well-drained soil, and are <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> repeated <b>frosts.</b> Their preferred mode of cultivation {{is a bright}} and sunny position with gritty free-draining soil.

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} from January to November 2003 in the Province of South Sumatera. The {{objectives of the}} research were to analyze {{the rate of the}} parasitoid parasitism affected by external factors, to evaluate the interactions between parasitoid and its host, diamondback moth (DBM) eggs and larvae, and to analyze effect of the parasitization on <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) larvae. The research consisted of the field and laboratory observations. The field observation was done to collect the egg and larval parasitoids, and to study population and <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> P. xylostella on Brassicaceous crops. The laboratory observation was carried out to identify parasitoid species found on the crops, and to determine the P. xylostella parasitism by the parasitoids. Rates of the egg and larval parasitism by the parasitoids were greatly affected by insecticide application, and were also affected by crop phenology. The field treated by scheduled application of insecticide had generally low parasitism. The parasitization tended to be higher at weedy brassicaceous fields and intercropping systems than at monoculture, and also higher at earlier growing season than at later date. However, the rate of parasitization by egg parasitoids, Trichogramma spp., tended to follow the development of DBM eggs, and the rate of parasitization by larval parasitoids, Diadegma semiclusum or Cotesia sp., also tended to follow their host population. Thus, they were density dependent parasitoids. The rates of the parasitization affected the <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> DBM larvae on brassicaceous leaves. The <b>leaf</b> <b>damage</b> <b>by</b> DBM larvae decreased with increasing parasitization by the parasitoids. The heaviest infestation occurred when the parasitization was the lowest...|$|R
