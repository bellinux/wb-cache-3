5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her clothes to a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a <b>love</b> <b>letter.</b> The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E
