The first efforts to revive the Olympic Games were led by a French educator and historian, Pierre de Coubertin. The first meeting to organize the games took place at the Sorbonne in 1894, resulting in the creation of the International Olympic Committee and the holding of the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. The second games, the first Olympics held outside of Greece, were the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, from 14 May until 28 October 1900, organized in conjunction with the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900. There were 19 sports included in the event, and women competed in the Olympics for the first time. The swimming events took place in the Seine. Some of the sports were unusual by modern standards; they included automobile and motorcycle racing, cricket, croquet, underwater swimming, tug-of-war, and shooting <b>live</b> <b>pigeons.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Peña {{began his}} wrestling career as the enmascarado (masked) {{character}} El Genio (Spanish for [...] "The Genius") on April 8, 1974. After wrestling as El Genio {{for a couple}} of months Peña got his uncle's blessing to adopt the Espectro name and began wrestling as Espectro Jr. [...] Peña wore the [...] "venom green" [...] mask and trunks like Espectro, but unlike the original he wrestled barefoot most of the time. As Espectro Jr., Peña blended a good solid wrestling foundation with various psychological antics to create a character, while being a hated rudo (Heel or [...] "bad guy") character drew the crowd's attention and soon he found himself challenging the top wrestlers of the 1970s for both the Mexican National Welterweight Championship and the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, two of the top championships in Mexico at the time. While a gifted performer in the ring backstage he was described as more of a quiet, thoughtful person who would often talk about how he would change Lucha Libre and add more character and showmanship to it. In 1980 Peña decided to change wrestling personas, giving the Espectro Jr. outfit and name to his cousin Jose Elías Pinceno, who has wrestled as Espectro Jr. since then. Instead of working as Espectro Jr., Peña came up with a totally original character of his own called Kahoz (sometimes spelled Kahos or Khaoz), a sinister masked rudo character who invoked various dark spirits as part of his pre-match ritual. Many have likened the Kahoz character to one of Lucha Libre original showmen, Murciélago Velázquez. Kahoz would often carry a bag of <b>live</b> <b>pigeons</b> to the ring with him, releasing them at his opponent and then making it seem like he ripped the head of one of the pigeons and smeared the fake blood all over himself or his opponent. To Peña the Kahoz character was not about winning championships, but about the psychology of the character and actually scaring the audience, so while he did not win any titles as Kahoz it was considered a huge success and he main evented shows all over Mexico. While Peña had the mind for wrestling his body could not handle the heavy main event schedule that he wrestled as Kahoz and by 1985 he gave up the gimmick to work as Espectro de Ultratumba ("The Ghost from Beyond the grave"), giving the Kahoz gimmick to Astro Rey instead. Astro Rey's Kahoz was nowhere nearly as important nor as successful as Peña as Astro Rey lacked the charisma and theatrics of the original. Peña only worked as Espectro de Ultratumba for a short period of time, giving the gimmick to his cousin in 1986. Peña tried working as [...] "Dalia Negra" [...] but his body could not take the strain, forcing Peña to retire in 1986. Peña would briefly wrestle as [...] "the Rose" [...] in 1994 but only worked a handful of matches. Peña's final match at the 2001 Guerra de Titans where he wrestled, and lost to Cibernético.|$|E

In 1934 Arnst bought a farm south of Timaru running sheep and cattle, and growing crops, in partnership with a brother. Richard Arnst died in 1953. Two years later a Christchurch street, Arnst Place, was named after him. The Arnst River in the Nelson Lakes National Park is also named after him. In 1995 Arnst was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Hindi {{served as}} the {{president}} of the Fox Valley Animal Protectors in DuPage County, Illinois. Hindi noticed that <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> shoots were happening in the field behind Carpy's Cove, a tavern and restaurant in Will County, Illinois. About four times a year, a dozen to two dozen shooters would pay $100 to shoot 25 pigeons each. Every Sunday, Hindi drove to the bar to check whether people were preparing for a <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> shoot. Whenever he found pigeon shoot preparations, Hindi notified around two dozen activists to join him in protesting the shoot.|$|R

50|$|Pigeon {{shooting}} {{was one of}} the shooting events of the 1900 Summer Olympics. Competitors in these events had to kill as many <b>live</b> <b>pigeons</b> as possible. Birds were released one at a time from 'traps' in front of the shooters.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{shooting}} {{guns were}} heavier than a regular field gun (greater than 7 pounds). Characteristics {{of them were}} longer barrels (30 inch with ventilated ribs give better sight plane), tighter chokes (full/fuller), no safety, beavertail forend, single triggers, clipped fences, a third bite, 2 3/4 12 gauge shells (as opposed to the more common 2 1/2 inch shells). These extra features were in place to handle the higher pressure loads used for <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> competitions where the bird had to be dropped inside the ring. Today, these pigeon guns command a higher premium at auction.|$|R

50|$|Trapshooting was {{originally}} developed, in part, to augment bird hunting {{and to provide}} a method of practice for bird hunters. Use of targets was introduced as a replacement for <b>live</b> <b>pigeons.</b> Indeed, one of the names for the targets used in shooting games is clay pigeons. The layout of a modern trapshooting field differs from that of a skeet field and/or a sporting clays course.|$|E

5000|$|Trap {{shooting}} with <b>live</b> <b>pigeons</b> {{began in}} the U.S. around 1825, with the first recorded match balls containing feathers, then clay targets. Bogardus invented the first practical glass ball trap in 1877. Glass spheres, filled with feathers, were used as targets, much as clay pigeons are used today. They were called Bogardus balls. One feature of them was ridges which helped ensure that pellets would shatter the sphere, rather than glancing off.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{creation}} of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in the United Kingdom in 1824 (given Royal status in 1840), Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on April 10, 1866 in New York City on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans, and must be protected under the law. It is the oldest animal welfare organization in the United States. Founded in 1866, the ASPCA was the first humane organization in the Western Hemisphere. Buffalo's chapter, founded in 1867, is the second oldest. ASPCA was founded to stop the injustices animals face across the United States. On February 8, 1866, Bergh pleaded on behalf of animals at a meeting at Clinton Hall in New York City. Some of the issues he discussed were cockfighting and the horrors of slaughterhouses. After getting signatures for his [...] "Declaration of the Rights of Animals," [...] Bergh was given an official charter to incorporate ASPCA on April 10, 1866. On April 19, 1866, the first anti-cruelty law was passed since the founding of ASPCA, and the organization was granted the right to enforce anti-cruelty laws. At that time, there were three staff members at the ASPCA. In 1867, ASPCA operated its first ambulance for injured horses and advocated alternatives for inhumane actions toward animals such as horses, <b>live</b> <b>pigeons,</b> cats and dogs. By the time of Bergh's death in 1888, 37 out of the 38 states in the union had enacted anti-cruelty laws that were enforced by the ASPCA. Early goals of ASPCA focused on efforts for horses and livestock, since at the time they were used for a number of activities.|$|E
50|$|In 1867 Frank Heathcote {{received}} {{the permission of}} Richard Naylor to promote <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> shooting at his Hurlingham estate.

The club leased the estate from Naylor in 1869 and in 1874 acquired the land outright for £27,500. The pigeon today forms part of the club's crest. Until 1905, clouds of pigeons were released in the summer from an enclosure near what is now a tennis pavilion.|$|R
5000|$|The Seneca Hunt Club, one of Hindi's {{earliest}} aims, held pigeon shoots {{overseen by}} the Illinois Conservation Department (now named the Illinois Department of Natural Resources). Hindi attacked the Illinois Conservation Department, calling it names like [...] "Department of Cowards", [...] "Department of Chickens", [...] "Department of Mutilation", [...] "Department of Scumbags", and [...] "Department of Corruption". Following lobbying and activism by Hindi's group and other animal activist groups, the Illinois General Assembly overturned a law that permitted pigeon shoots. In 1992, {{the office of the}} Illinois Attorney General published an unofficial notice that said holding pigeon shoots likely would violate Illinois' animal care act. According to a 2007 The State Journal-Register article, pigeon shoots have been prohibited in Illinois since Hindi convinced the Illinois Attorney General's office that pigeon shoots infringed on the state's animal cruelty statutes. The Pennsylvania Record reported in April 2014 that [...] "Pennsylvania {{is believed to be the}} only state left in the nation in which shooting pigeons strictly for sport is still legal." [...] The Philadelphia Media Network reported the same month that Pennsylvania is the [...] "only state" [...] to allow <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> shooting and that since 1989, repeated bill introductions in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to outlaw <b>live</b> <b>pigeon</b> shooting were unsuccessful.|$|R
