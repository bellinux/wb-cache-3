5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, the {{governor}} {{plays a major}} role in the legislative process. Every bill that is passed by both the Oklahoma Senate and Oklahoma House of Representatives, and every resolution requiring the assent of both chambers of the legislature, must, before it becomes a law, be presented to {{the governor}}. The governor may choose to sign it or veto it and send it back to the legislature. The governor’s veto can only be overridden by a two-thirds approval vote from each house.|$|E
25|$|The post of {{vice-president}} {{was created}} by amendments to the Statute of the Court of Justice in 2012. The duty of the Vice-President is to assist the President {{in the performance of}} his duties and to take the President's place when the latter is prevented from attending or when the office of president is vacant. In 2012, judge Koen Lenaerts of Belgium became the first judge to carry out the duties of the Vice-President of the Court of Justice. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the Court of Justice, the Vice-President is elected by the members of the Court for a term of three years.|$|E

25|$|The {{members of}} the roster that would {{come to be known}} as the architects that earned the Club´s first {{promotion}} into the highest category of Spanish soccer are: Zamora, Vendrell, Febrer, Arqué, Diego, Cobo, Magín, Juanele, Guillamón, Bolao, Boixet, Ladaria, Forteza, Garcés, Currucale, Gassó, Martínez, Lorenzo, Villamide, Sureda, Oviedo, Rodríguez II, Czoka, Mir, and Laguardia. RCD Mallorca was one of only 16 professional teams to compete in this top division. And the team reinforced by picking up players from FC Barcelona, among others, where the likes of Haro, Davoine, Irusqueta and Flotats all arrived. This first season in the top division ended with RCD Mallorca in ninth place of the sixteen total teams, and coach Lorenzo did not last through the season, just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> who was replaced by Sir Lorenzo Munar. In the following season, the team finished eleventh. And so, with many ups and downs, RCD Mallorca did not last more than three years in the top echelon of Spanish soccer. The team dropped into the second division until 1964-65, when it rose up again. But, in that day in age, the only direct promotion came via winning the Segunda Division, while the second-place finisher had to play in the playoff for promotion.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{appeared}} alongside then-Senator Barack Obama at a 2006 rally, introducing him as [...] "the most galvanizing {{leader to}} come out of either party, in my opinion, in at least a decade". He donated to Obama's presidential campaign in 2007, and hosted two fundraisers for the candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary. Affleck urged voters to [...] "help make history" [...] in a MoveOn.org campaign, and made several appearances during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In the week of the presidential election, he appeared on Saturday Night Live to jokingly endorse Senator John McCain. Affleck did not actively campaign for Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> I’m going to vote for the president." ...|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

2500|$|On August 19, 2009, DeLay, {{making the}} rounds of various media shows {{in order to promote}} his {{upcoming}} participation in season nine of Dancing with the Stars, was interviewed by Chris Matthews of Hardball, a political news and talk show on MSNBC. DeLay made political news, when, during the interview, he became the most famous Republican yet to give voice to the so-called birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama. During his appearance on Hardball, when pressed by Matthews as to whether he supported the conspiracy theory and its adherents and proponents, including several Republican members of Congress, DeLay said, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> to produce his birth certificate....

2500|$|On April 28, 2006, Jackson {{spoke at}} a meeting in Dallas and {{addressed}} the subject of government contracting. [...] He recounted that a prospective HUD contractor had made a [...] "heck of a proposal" [...] and was selected upon the basis of that proposal, but upon thanking Jackson for being selected the bidder, mentioned that he did not like President Bush. [...] As a result, Jackson said, the bidder who had criticized Bush did not receive the contract: [...] "Brother, you have a disconnect—the President is elected, I was selected. You wouldn’t be getting the contract unless I was sitting here. If {{you have a problem with}} the President, don’t tell the secretary." [...] Jackson told the crowd, [...] "He didn't get the contract. Why should I reward someone who doesn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> so they can use funds to try to campaign against the President? Logic says they don't get the contract. That's the way I believe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{one second}} of each other, President Kennedy, Governor Connally, and Mrs. Kennedy all turned {{abruptly}} from looking to their left to looking to their right, between Zapruder film frames 155 and 169. Connally, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> was a World War II military veteran but unlike him, a longtime hunter. Connally {{testified that he}} immediately recognized {{the sound of a}} high-powered rifle, then he turned his head and torso rightward, attempting to see President Kennedy behind him. Governor Connally testified he could not see the President, so he then started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left). Connally also testified that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center, he was hit in his upper right back by a bullet he did not hear fired. The doctor who operated on Connally measured his head {{at the time he was}} hit as turned 27 degrees left of center. After Connally was hit he shouted, [...] "Oh, no, no, no. My God.

6000|$|There were so {{many more}} volunteers than had been called for that the {{question}} whom to accept was quite embarrassing to the governor, Richard Yates. The legislature was in session at the time, however, and came to his relief. A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments, one from each congressional district, for one month, to be paid by the State, but pledged {{to go into the}} service of the United States if there should be a further call during their term. Even with this relief the governor was still very much embarrassed. Before the war was over he was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> when he was taken with the varioloid: [...] "at last he had something he could give to all who wanted it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{one large}} ward, {{sitting by the}} fire in arm-chairs of distinction, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and Vice of the good company, were two old women, upwards of ninety years of age. The younger of the two, just turned ninety, was deaf, but not very, and could easily be made to hear. In her early time she had nursed a child, who was now another old woman, more infirm than herself, inhabiting the very same chamber. She {{perfectly}} understood this when the matron told it, and, with sundry nods and motions of her forefinger, pointed out the woman in question. The elder of this pair, ninety- three, seated before an illustrated newspaper (but not reading it), was a bright-eyed old soul, really not deaf, wonderfully preserved, and amazingly conversational. She had not long lost her husband, and had been in that place {{little more than a}} year. At Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, this poor creature would have been individually addressed, would have been tended in her own room, and would have had her life gently assimilated to a comfortable life out of doors. Would that be much to do in England for a woman who has kept herself out of a workhouse more than ninety rough long years? When Britain first, at Heaven's command, arose, {{with a great deal of}} allegorical confusion, from out the azure main, did her guardian angels positively forbid it in the Charter which has been so much besung? ...|$|E

And while other notables <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> mother Sarah Delano Roosevelt and Vincent Astor remained involved in the Society, its membership grew into the hundreds and involved a broad range of county residents.

60|$|The {{substance}} {{of his story}} was as follows: Shakings, it seems, {{had once been a}} convict in the New York State's Prison at Sing Sing, where he had been for years confined for a crime, which he gave me his solemn word of honour he was wholly innocent of. He told me that, after his term had expired, and he went out into the world again, he never could stumble upon any of his old Sing Sing associates without dropping into a public house and talking over old times. And when fortune would go hard with him, and he felt out of sorts, and incensed at matters and things in general, he told me that, at such time, he almost wished he was back again in Sing Sing, where he was relieved from all anxieties about what he should eat and drink, and was supported, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States and Prince Albert, at the public charge. He used to have such a snug little cell, he said, all to himself, and never felt afraid of house-breakers, for the walls were uncommonly thick, and his door was securely bolted for him, and a watchman was all the time walking {{up and down in the}} passage, while he himself was fast asleep and dreaming. To this, in substance, the holder added, that he narrated this anecdote because he thought it applicable to a man-of-war, which he scandalously asserted to be a sort of State Prison afloat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] he continued, [...] "compelled {{to inhabit}} this land {{and do not}} meet with proper {{protection}} from the infidel. Now, sir, this is a crying evil, {{and it is only}} becoming in one who has the true faith, and is a loyal subject of the All-Powerful, to point out with due humility that He is growing very remiss in His affairs, and is losing a good deal of His prestige. And what, senor, is at the bottom of it? Favoritism. We know that the Supreme cannot Himself be everywhere, attending to each little trick-track that arises in the world--matters altogether beneath His notice; and that He must, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Venezuela or the Emperor of Brazil, appoint men--angels if you like--to conduct His affairs and watch over each district. And it is manifest that for this country of Guayana the proper person has not been appointed. Every evil is done and there is no remedy, and the Christian has no more consideration shown him than the infidel. Now, senor, in a town near the Orinoco I once saw on a church the archangel Michael, made of stone, and twice as tall as a man, with one foot on a monster shaped like a cayman, but with bat's wings, and a head and neck like a serpent. Into this monster he was thrusting his spear. That is {{the kind of person that}} should be sent to rule these latitudes--a person of firmness and resolution, with strength in his wrist. And yet it is probable that this very man--this St. Michael--is hanging about the palace, twirling his thumbs, waiting for an appointment, while other weaker men, and--Heaven forgive me for saying it--not above a bribe, perhaps, are sent out to rule over this province." ...|$|E
