Later that year, the Commonwealth forces under Stanisław Koniecpolski scored {{a victory in the}} south, ending a war against the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In <b>later</b> <b>stages,</b> each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's first Antarctic {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09.

He returned in 1909 to participate in the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Gustaf Wallenberg (born 4 August 1912, death date unknown) was a Swedish architect, businessman, diplomat and humanitarian. He {{is widely}} celebrated for saving tens of {{thousands}} of Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary during the Holocaust from German Nazis and Hungarian Fascists during the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of World War II. While serving as Sweden's special envoy in Budapest between July and December 1944, Wallenberg issued protective passports and sheltered Jews in buildings designated as Swedish territory.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and {{three types of}} pesticide, which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry one type of pesticide at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> have more than one type of insect on screen at once, making the choice of pesticide more tactical.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} near the Sun are plotted on an HR diagram, it {{displays}} a distribution of stars of various masses, ages, and compositions.

However the diagram also typically includes stars that are in <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of their evolution and have wandered away from this main-sequence curve.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations {{have occurred in the}} Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{a portion of}} the mountain, the player reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. The player can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free. The basecamp also contains minigames, such as a shooting range, a gambling device, and optional sidequests, which reward the player with shortcuts to <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> in subsequent playthroughs for completing challenges such as finishing a level within a time limit or without receiving damage.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the two events.|$|E

5|$|British colonial {{administration}} was dominated in the 1760s and 1770s by Warren Hastings, {{the first man}} to hold the title of Governor-General. The military arm of the East India Company was directed during the Seven Years' War and the Second Anglo-Mysore War by General Eyre Coote, who died in 1783 during the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the war with Mysore. Company policy, as implemented by Hastings, had involved the company in intrigues and shifting alliances involving France, Mysore, the Marathas, and factions within those and other local territories.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the Second World War, the bailey was {{levelled}} {{and used}} to hold a set of temporary Nissen huts that formed a hospital for United States Army personnel. In 1945, the site was leased by the Air Ministry for use as offices. The Ministry of Works took over the guardianship of the castle in 1951. The ministry {{put pressure on the}} Air Ministry to leave the site, which occurred in 1956; the bailey was then grassed over again. Archaeological excavations were carried out in the bailey between 1961 and 1982, uncovering many of the medieval buildings.|$|E

An incident-packed race saw only twelve cars reach the finish line, with Max Verstappen repeating his best {{result of the}} season in fourth and Jenson Button finishing a season-best sixth. After starting in damp conditions, both Red Bull drivers were initially able to challenge the Mercedes for the lead, but later dropped back as the track dried, with Daniil Kvyat retiring after a crash and Daniel Ricciardo eventually finishing tenth.|$|E

5|$|Hotspur {{did not see}} {{any action}} during the Japanese Indian Ocean raid in April, but she did escort an {{aircraft}} carrier in September during the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the invasion of Madagascar. In June 1942 the ship returned to the Mediterranean to escort another convoy to Malta (Operation Vigorous). She was converted to an escort destroyer beginning in March 1943 in the United Kingdom and was assigned to escort convoys in the North Atlantic {{for most of the}} rest of the war. After a lengthy refit in late 1944, Hotspur escorted convoys in the Irish Sea until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 Albert Speer, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, {{informed}} Adolf Hitler of {{work that}} was being carried out to produce a supergun capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the Hochdruckpumpe ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the V-3, {{was one of the}} V-weapons– Vergeltungswaffen ("retaliation weapons")– developed by Nazi Germany in the <b>later</b> <b>stages</b> of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not a new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the Paris gun, rapidly wore out their barrels.|$|E

As his teammate Coulthard made his pit stop one lap later, Häkkinen regained the lead which he held to win his third win of the season.
