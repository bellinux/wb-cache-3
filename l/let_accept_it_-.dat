40|$|Humans can {{no longer}} afford to eat meat on a large scale. Livestock {{production}} imposes a vast burden on global resources and it is one that the expanding world population {{can no longer}} sustain. Yet imagine if we were able to culture such food in factories: we might then be able to manufacture virtually limitless supplies at a greatly reduced cost and a lessened environmental load. In 1976 I calculated that: “We could provide more than enough food for the world‟s population from an area the size of an industrial estate. ” The culture of living cells, I said, would allow us to provide proteinaceous foodstuffs for a large global population from an area the size of a city. 1 The complex could be sited in the freezing wastes of the Arctic so that metabolic temperatures could be simply controlled (there was no thought that the warming effect might pose a problem, when writing one-third of a century ago). There is now an upsurge of interest in the possibilities of meat produced from cultured cells in vitro. What should we call it? How does it fit into a broad social context? Can it work? Does it matter? Will it solve our current demand for food? What will be the environmental consequences? Would people <b>accept</b> <b>it</b> <b>–</b> and how diverse are public attitudes to the consumption of meat? Although the idea of cultured meat seems novel, it is not new.

In 1979 the monastery launched a petition to request the return of the land that had been confiscated under Khruschev, as well as to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>accept</b> more novices. The confiscated land had been turned into a museum of atheism and a polyclinic. The authorities responded to this petition by launching more searches and expulsions of pilgrims as well as the expulsion of ten novices. The highly revered spiritual father Amvrosii was expelled in 1981, and his library, which contained samizdat and religious literature, was investigated by the KGB. This was followed by the arrest of more monks, one of whom, Archimandrite Alimpi, was beaten to death, and another named Pitirim became mentally ill as a result of beatings.|$|R

60|$|The {{circle of}} the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the man who can yield him truth. He shall then {{know that there is}} {{somewhat}} more blessed and great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is the hearing man; unhappy the speaking man. As long as I hear truth I am bathed by a beautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my nature. The suggestions are thousandfold that I hear and see. The waters of the great deep have ingress and egress to the soul. But if I speak, I define, I confine and am less. When Socrates speaks, Lysis and Menexenus are afflicted by no shame that they do not speak. They also are good. He likewise defers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks. Because a true and natural man contains and is the same truth which an eloquent man articulates; but in the eloquent man, because he can articulate it, it seems something the less to reside, and he turns to these silent beautiful with the more inclination and respect. The ancient sentence said, Let us be silent, for so are the gods. Silence is a solvent that destroys personality, and gives us leave to be great and universal. Every man's progress is through a succession of teachers, each of whom seems at the time to have a superlative influence, but it at last gives place to a new.

Each new mind we approach seems to require an abdication of all our past and present possessions. A new doctrine seems at first a subversion of all our opinions, tastes, and manner of living. Such has Swedenborg, such has Kant, such has Coleridge, such has Hegel or his interpreter Cousin seemed to many young men in this country. Take thankfully and heartily all they can give. Exhaust them, wrestle with them, let them not go until their blessing be won, and after a short season the dismay will be overpast, the excess of influence withdrawn, and they will be no longer an alarming meteor, but one more bright star shining serenely in your heaven and blending its light with all your day.|$|R
