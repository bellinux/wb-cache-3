40|$|Various {{technical}} devices quite widely use bimetallic shells as {{the structural}} elements. A chamber combustion {{design of the}} liquid rocket engine (LRE) is a typical use of the bimetallic shells. In LRE operation a combustion chamber shell is subject to intense thermal and mechanical effects, which necessitates cooling. A cooling shell path is formed by a gap between its inner and outer walls connected to each other by milled or grooved spacer ribs.  The outer wall of the shell serves as a <b>load-bearing</b> element, the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is in direct contact with high-temperature combustion products and exposed to intense heat. The difference in functions of shell walls calls for their manufacturing from different materials with different thermophysical and mechanical properties. Interaction between the shell walls of different materials in heating and cooling leads to emerging thermal strains of various values in the walls. In terms of mechanical properties the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> material, usually ranks below the outer wall material strength, which uses the high strength stainless steel 12 Х 21 Н 5 Т. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is typically made from copper-based highly heat-conductive alloys. (eg. : chromium bronze). Therefore, {{the result of the}} difference in temperature deformations, arising in the walls,  is inelastic nonisothermal strain of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> material with (usually) elastic behavior of the outer wall material. For reusable LRE, a cyclic sequence of the loading steps of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> can lead to accumulating damages in its material because of the low-cycle fatigue and cause destruction of the wall or the loss of the cooling tract tightness. The main parameter that determines the level of low-cycle fatigue, is an absolute value of the accumulated inelastic strain (both plastic and evolving over time creep deformation). Quantitative evaluation of this parameter involves analysis of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> loading with multiple starts and shutdowns of LRE. The paper represents an approximate analysis of such loading under certain simplifying assumptions using the approaches typical for mathematical modeling of structures under thermal stress. </p...|$|R

50|$|This is a worn crater with a rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> {{that have}} been {{softened}} and have lost the sharp features of a young crater. The satellite crater Priestley X lies across the northern rim {{and part of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> There is a small, relatively fresh crater on the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the south-southwest. An old crater-like feature is attached to the southwestern outer rim, and shares part of its rim with Priestley. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is narrower in the southeast than elsewhere. Within the interior is a level, featureless floor.|$|R
50|$|This crater has {{undergone}} steady erosion from minor impacts, {{so that the}} features along the rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> have become softened and rounded. Significant impacts nearby have covered the floor and sides with ejecta, {{and there are a}} multitude of tiny craterlets along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The satellite crater Gruemberger A lies within the interior, along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the west-southwest.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{relatively}} fresh crater with a nicely terraced <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> This terracing is most notable along the southeastern half of the crater, and nearly disappears along the north-northwest rim where the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is at its minimum extent.

40|$|PURPOSE. In a prior study, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that glaucoma-tous eyes have a significantly lower density of pores in the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of Schlemm’s canal than do normal eyes. However, in that study the glaucomatous eyes were fixed at much lower flow rates than the normal eyes, and that is now known to affect <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> pore density. The objective of the current study was to compare the <b>inner</b> <b>wall’s</b> pore density in glauco-matous and normal eyes, accounting for the effects of fixation conditions. METHODS. Outflow facility was measured in enucleated glauco-matous human eyes. Eyes were fixed under constant flow conditions, microdissected to expose the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of Schlemm’s canal, and prepared for scanning electron micros-copy (SEM).

50|$|This is a {{somewhat}} worn crater formation {{with a wide}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> There is a pear-shaped crater along the northern <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The interior floor is relatively featureless, with only a small ridge offset to the southwest of the midpoint.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor of}} Poisson and Poisson T has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, leaving a level surface within the <b>inner</b> <b>walls.</b> A pair of old, worn craters lies along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> {{in the southeast}} part of the crater.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor of}} Lomonosov has been resurfaced with lava flows, leaving a dark, level surface marked {{only by a}} few tiny craterlets and some streaks of ray material from Giordano Bruno. Only the lowest portion of the interior is flooded, however, {{and much of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of the rim remains uncovered. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is narrower along the northern edge where the crater overlies Maxwell. There is also slumped material along the base of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{aspect of this}} crater is the {{asymmetry}} of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> To the northeast the rim is low and the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is quite narrow, almost non-existent. This portion of the rim overlies the interior of an unnamed depression in the surface; most likely a damaged crater. In the remaining arc between the eastern rim clockwise to the north, the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is much wider. As a result, the level inner floor is offset toward the northeast. The interior has a central peak located near {{the midpoint of the}} crater, then forming a linear ridge that continues until it reaches the western <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The floor is otherwise nearly featureless, except for a few tiny craterlets.|$|R
40|$|EP 1588873 A UPAB: 20051213 NOVELTY - The device has {{temperature}} sensors (2, 3) positioned in an <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface for measuring temperature at the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface. A humidity probe (1) measures relative humidity {{in a region}} surrounded by the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> An evaluation unit (4) is connected with the probe and the sensors, and accesses the values measured by the probe and the sensors.

50|$|This crater has {{relatively}} well-defined {{features that}} have not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts. The rim edge is roughly circular, with a slight outward bulge along the southern edge. The small satellite crater Meitner C lies across the rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the northeast. Sections of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> display terrace features. The interior floor of Meitner is relatively level, with a small craterlet just to the southwest of the midpoint and another along the northwest <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|This crater is {{circular}} in shape, {{with little}} appearance of wear. At {{the midpoint of}} the sloping <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> is a small central floor. The higher albedo of the <b>inner</b> <b>walls,</b> compared to the surrounding terrain, indicates that this is a relatively young formation.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the sloping}} <b>inner</b> <b>walls,</b> the crater floor is remarkably level and nearly featureless, {{at least in}} {{comparison}} to the more rugged terrain that surrounds the crater. Only a few tiny craterlets mark this interior plain, and a small crater near the south-southeast <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|As is {{the case}} with many of the craters on the Moon, this feature has become worn and eroded by {{subsequent}} impacts. A small crater with a flat floor intrudes into the southwestern rim of Quetelet. Several small craterlets lie along the northern rim and the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of Quetelet is narrower in the west than elsewhere, so that the level, relatively featureless interior floor is offset in that direction. The worn remains of a small craterlet lies along the southern <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|This crater {{has a wide}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> with {{multiple}} terraces. The width of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> varies around the perimeter, with the widest section to the south. There is some slumping along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the northwest where the rim makes its closest approach to Campbell, and the narrow terrain between these two craters is rugged and irregular. But the remaining terrain that surrounds the crater is almost equally rugged. The rim appears somewhat straighter along the southwest side, but is roughly circular elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|High speed flow {{finishing}} {{method has}} recently developed, {{which has an}} excellent performance for polishing an <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel capillary. However, its method seems to be unable to finish the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel pipe. Present paper focuses on the finishing of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel curved pipe with high speed flow finishing method. It is found that an elastic string-type mandrel inserted into the hole of curved pipe has great performance on finishing, in which a diameter of mandrel is slightly smaller than hole size of the pipe. Experiments indicate that surface roughness of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of curved pipe decreases {{with the number of}} slurry flow pass. It is found that surface roughness of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of a 90 °curved pipe decreases with the number of slurry flow pass, however, it incresases inversely after 80 passes and peculiar roughness curve is generated. On the other hand, a 180 °curved pipe indicates that there is different surface roughness curve compared with 90 °curved pipe. SEM micrographs describe that the spacing of grain boundary on the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface of the pipe extends gradually with the number of slurry flow pass, and it {{may be related to the}} variation of surface roughness...|$|R
50|$|The {{perimeter}} of this crater somewhat resembles a rounded diamond shape. The rim and <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> are rounded from impact erosion, and have lost some definition.

40|$|Glaucoma is {{the leading}} cause of {{irreversible}} blindness worldwide and is associated with elevated intraocular pressure caused by increased aqueous humor outflow resistance. The majority of outflow resistance is located near the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> endothelium of Schlemm’s canal (SC) where aqueous humor passes through micron-sized pores to cross the endothelium. The basal-to- apical direction of aqueous humor filtration pushes SC cells away from their supporting basement membrane, imposing large biomechanical strain on them and leading to the formation of dome- shaped cellular outpouchings known as giant vacuoles (GVs). Our overarching hypothesis is that the demanding biomechanical environment of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> provides local cues that regulate pore formation and filtration across SC endothelium. Four studies examined this hypothesis. The first study demonstrated that pore density increases with biomechanical strain applied to SC cells cultured on elastomeric membranes. The second study demonstrated that <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> pores co-localise with regions of greater filtration across the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The third study developed a fluorescent assay to investigate pore formation in cultured SC cells, and experiments using this assay indicated that glaucomatous SC cells may have impaired pore-forming ability in response to strain. The fourth study examined the cytoskeleton and three-dimensional ultrastructure of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> and showed that vimentin intermediate filaments colocalize with GVs, possibly provid- ing internal support to allow <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> cells to withstand the demanding mechanical environment of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> Taken together, these studies reveal that pore formation is a mechanosensitive process that allows the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to function as a self-regulating filter by modulating its own porosity in re- sponse to local biomechanical cues arising from basal-to-apical filtration across the endothelium. This process appears altered in glaucoma, contributing to impaired pore formation and elevated outflow resistance characteristic of the disease. Pores and intermediate filaments are therefore potential targets for future glaucoma therapies. Open Acces...|$|R

50|$|This is a {{relatively}} recent impact compared {{to most of the}} craters on the far side, and the rim is still well-formed with little erosion. It is old enough, however, that its albedo matches its surroundings and it lacks a ray system. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> has slumped in places and formed piles of talus along the south.
