40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{suggested}} that the elastic properties of the chest wall (CW) may be compromised in patients with ARDS because of abdominal distension (4). We partitioned CW and lung (L) mechanics, assessed the role of abdominal distension, and verified whether the underlying disease responsible for ARDS affects the impairment of respiratory mechanics. Volume-pressure (V-P) curves (interrupter technique) were assessed in nine patients with surgical ARDS and nine patients with medical ARDS. Relative to nine patients undergoing heart surgery, V-P curves of the respiratory system (rs) and <b>L</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with surgical or medical ARDS showed a rightward displacement. V-P curves of the CW and the L showed an upward concavity in patients with medical ARDS and a downward concavity in patients with surgical ARDS. Although the CW and the abdomen (abd) V-P curves in patients with medical ARDS were similar to those obtained in patients undergoing heart surgery, they showed a rightward shift and a downward flattening in patients with surgical ARDS. In five of these patients, a reduction in static end-inspiratory pressure of the abd (69 � 4 %), rs (30 � 3 %), CW (41 � 2 %), and L (27 � 3 %) was observed after abdominal decompression for acute bleeding. Abdominal decompression therefore caused an upward and leftward shift of the V-P curves of the respiratory system, chest wall, lung, and abdomen. In conclusion we showed that impairment of the elastic properties o...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{prevalent}} cancers among the women with annual growth of 2 percent. It affects grossly the patient's quality of life. Rehabilitation can be so effective on physiopsychosocical health and finally increases their quality of life recovery. This study was designed to determine the effects of rehabilitation on quality of life in women after mastectomy. Materials & Methods: In a clinical trial, 57 cancerous women who underwent modified radical mastectomy, had finished chemotherapy and radiotherapy and received hormone therapy were selected and randomly placed in two case and control groups. Control group was under medical care and the case group in addition to medical care received rehabilitation (physiotherapy, education, individual counseling) for 2 months. The quality of life, with regard to breast cancer, was measured by EORTC QLQ-BR 23, before Intervention, 1 week and 3 months after rehabilitation in both groups. Data analysis was done by chi square, fisher exact test, t- and paired t-tests and repeated measurement test. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in body image and future perspective and meaningful increase in sexual enjoyment and arm symptom in case group compared to control group before intervention, while no significant difference was seen in other scales before intervention. One week after the interference, differences of both group in two scales of sex function and sex enjoyment were meaningful and the function of case group was more undesirable then that of the control group. Three months after completing the process there was a meaningful decrease in sex function and sex enjoyment in case group in comparison with the control group but there was a significant recovery in the case group in other performance scales. Systemic therapy side effects were significantly decreased in case group 3 months after intervention whereas the quality of life in control group decreased or did not change significantly after 3 months. Conclusion: Performing rehabilitation process including education, individual counseling and physiotherapy can promote the Q.

A tota <b>l</b> <b>of</b> 170 <b>patients</b> with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction used a home-based uroflowmeter and produced a total of 1670 correctly measured flows at home. These patients also underwent a screening program with free urinary flowmetry in the hospital and a urodynamic pressure and flow study. Results. There is a circadian variability in urinary flow values in men with higher grades of obstruction. These men have a higher peak urinary flow with a smaller voided volume and thus a shorter flow time in the early afternoon when compared with late evening, early morning, and the midnight to morning periods. Conclusions. This significantly greater maximum flow in the afternoon in men with higher grades of obstruction can be an important bias in studies where the primary end point is to assess a small improvement in maximum flow. Therefore, the circadian rhythm of urofiow has {{to be taken into account}} in the evaluation of the efficacy <b>of</b> treatment. <b>Patients</b> participating in clinical research studies should produce their urinary flow in the clinic always during the same time period, either in the morning or in the afternoon, and should not switch their appointmen...|$|R
40|$|Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), {{implicated in}} {{numerous}} human diseases, including lymphoid malignancies, persistently infects peripheral B cells and transforms them into lymphoblastoid cell lines. Here {{we found that}} EBV equally infected B cells from patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome and those from healthy donors; however, it hardly transformed X-linked hyper IgM syndrome B cells, because of the dysfunctional gene of CD 40 ligand (CD 40 <b>L)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> Unlike CD 40, CD 40 L is not usually expressed on B cells. However, we found that EBV infection of normal B cells induced CD 40 L expression as a critical effector in host cell transformation and survival.

40|$|PNKD is an {{autosomal}} dominant movement disorder characterized by attacks of dystonia, chorea and athetosis. MR- 1, the gene responsible for PNKD, is transcribed into three alternatively spliced forms: long (MR- 1 L), medium (MR- 1 M) and small (MR- 1 S). Two mutations, A 7 V and A 9 V, were previously {{discovered in the}} N-terminal region common to MR- 1 L and MR- 1 S. We now found a third mutation, A 33 P, in a new PNKD patient in the same region. Contrary to previous reports, we show here that the mutation-free MR- 1 M is localized in the Golgi apparatus, ER and plasma membrane, whereas both MR- 1 L and MR- 1 S isoforms are mitochondrial proteins, imported into the organelle thanks to a 39 aminoacid-long, N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). The MTS, which contains all three PNKD mutations, is then cleaved off the mature proteins before their insertion in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, mature MR- 1 S and MR- 1 <b>L</b> <b>of</b> PNKD <b>patients</b> are identical to those of normal subjects.

40|$|Introduction: The CTU {{has been}} proven as a „one stop shop“imaging {{modality}} that offers the complete analysis of the urinary tract {{in the course of}} only one examination. The shortcomings, when compared to the conventional IVU that was for long time considered a „golden standard” in the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> with hematuria, are the relatively high radiation dose along with its inability to visualize the optimally distended and opacified urinary tract in only one scanning phase. In the literature many different patient preparation protocols have been proposed in order to optimize the distension of the urinary tract but in fact none of them {{has been proven}} to really work. Introduction of the „split bolus” technique that allows synchronous acquisition of nephrographic and excretory phases has led to significant reduction in the patient’s radiation dose when compared to the standard three-phasic scanning protocol of examination. Aim of the study: To monitor the patient radiation dose during „split bolus“ MSCT urography and during conventional IVU. To evaluate the influence of different oral hydration protocols (20 min versus 60 min prior to examination) in visualization of different urinary tract segments. Results: Distal ureter: in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that were orally hydrated with 1 <b>L</b> <b>of</b> water 1 hour before the MSCTU examination the distal ureter was fully visualized in 86. 2 %, near full visualization (99 %- 80 %) was achieved in 7. 4 % and visualization of less than 79 % of the ureter was achieved in 6. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> In the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that were orally hydrated with 1 <b>L</b> <b>of</b> water 20 minutes prior to the MSCTU examination the percentage of fully visualized distal ureters, near full visualization (99 - 80 %) and visualization of less than 79 % were 44. 4 %, 12. 7 % and 42. 6 % respectively. In the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that have undergone conventional IVU examination the results of visualization of distal ureter were as follows: 41. 6 %. 12. 2 % and 45. 6 %. Proximal ureter: in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> hydrated with 1 <b>L</b> <b>of</b> water 60 minutes prior to the CT examination the proximal ureter was fully visualized in 91. 4 %, near full visualization was achieved in 4. 6 % and less then 79 % of its course in further 4 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> The results in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> who received oral hydration 20 minutes prior to CT examination were 72. 8 %, 11. 8 % and 15 % respectively.

Renal pelvis: in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> hydrated 60 minutes prior to CT examination it was fully shown in 99. 45 % and less then 79 % of it was visualized in 0. 5 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> The results in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> who received oral hydration 20 minutes prior to CT examination were 90 %, 5 % and 5 % respectively. In the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that have undergone conventional IVU the results were 95. 4 %, 4 % and 0. 5 % respectively. Calices: in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> given oral hydration 60 minutes prior to CT examination calices were fully visualized in 91 %, near full visualization was achieved in 4. 6 % and less then 79 % visualization was achieved in 4 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients.</b> In the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> given oral hydration 20 minutes prior to the CT examination the results were 70 %, 19. 6 % and 9. 9 % respectively. In the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that have undergone conventional IVU the results were 76 %, 9. 7 % and 14. 3 %. The total number of fully visualized urinary tract segments was significally higher in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> given oral hydration 60 minutes prior to the CT examination compared to the two other groups <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> (p< 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference between}} the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> given oral hydration 20 minutes prior to the CT examination and patients that have undergone conventional IVU. The mean radiation dose was 12. 07 mSv in the group <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> that were examined with „split bolus“ MDCTU protocol in comparison to 6. 74 mSv in the group <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> that have undergone conventional IVU. Conclusion: Oral hydration given 60 minutes prior to the MDCTU examination has been proven to give excellent results in visualization of all segments of urinary tract. The radiation dose was 1. 8 times higher for patients undergoing MSCTU when compared to conventional IVU. Maintaining the reasonable indication range, using fewer scanning phases during examination and applying different imaging protocols suited for particular indications could all help in lowering radiation risk and radiation doses to the patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of {{advanced}} MR imaging techniques in demonstrating the microarchitectural changes in osteoporosis has been recently investigated. Our {{aim was to}} determine the role of quantitative and diffusion MR imaging in the diagnosis of osteoporosis compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one subjects underwent both DEXA and conventional MR imaging with diffusion and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. T 1, T 2, diffusion signal intensity, and ADC values were calculated and compared with bone mineral attenuation (BMD). Results were obtained from L 1 to <b>L</b> 4 <b>of</b> each <b>patient</b> with a total of 204 lumbar vertebrae. RESULTS: Both T 1 and T 2 signal intensities tended to increase when both diffusion and ADC values decreased with reducing BMD. CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship between BMD and T 1 and T 2 signal intensities and a direct relationship between diffusion and ADC values were present in this pilot group. The T 1 /diffusion signal-intensity ratio could be a reliable diagnostic indicator of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease of bone tissue. There isnot only a decrease in bone mass but also microarchitec-tural deterioration as well. 1 Osteoporosis occurs in approxi...|$|R

Method: We conducted a cro s s- s e c t i o n a <b>l</b> study <b>of</b> 60 <b>patients</b> (58. 3 % male) {{with mean age}} 23. 1 (3 - 75) years, followed at the Bone Marro w Transplantation Service of the Hospital de Clínicas of the Federal University of Paraná, Brazil, taking CsA {{for at least six}} months. Our protocol included clinical data, assessment of functional interf e rence of symp-toms and neurological examination including observation and grading of MD. Results: Eight (13. 3 %) sub-jects re p o rted the presence of tremor at the moment of interview and 29 (48. 3 %) recalled this symptom at some point during treatment. Neurological examination identified 14 (23. 3 %) subjects with MD: upper limb symmetric action tremor in 13 (21. 6 %) and parkinsonism (rigidity and bradykinesia) in 1 (1. 7 %). No other MD was detected. The mean scores indicated mild clinical signs in all cases. Symptoms were consid-e red subjectively mild with no functional interf e re n c e. Conclusion: Almost one quarter <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> using CsA chronically presented MD, almost always mild and transitory action tre m o r, with minimal interf e re n c e on daily living activities, not requiring any form of intervention in the majority of cases.

The biochemical composition of D. tertiolecta was strongly affected by the aeration rate. There was a negative correlation between stationary-phase protein cellular content and air flow. Carbohydrate cellular content also decreased with aeration rate, a minimum being reached with 0 · 93 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> air min− 1 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> culture− 1. Maximum carbohydrate per volume unit was achieved with maximum aeration as the increase of carbohydrates per ml was directly proportional to air flow and therefore to CO 2 availability. Maximum protein per ml was achieved with 1 · 86 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> air min− 1 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> culture− 1, keeping stable with higher air flows. The cultures supplied with CO 2 showed carbohydrate and protein concentrations similar to the cultures with 1 · 86 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> air min− 1 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> culture− 1, indicating a correlation between available CO 2 and not only carbon, but also nitrogen metabolism.

40|$|Background/Aims The {{combination}} of daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) has demonstrated a high sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR 12) {{and a low}} rate of adverse events in previous clinical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the results of treatment and side effects in Korean patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype Ib infection. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from chronic HCV genotype Ib patients treated with DCV+ASV from August 2015 to September 2016 at five hospitals in the Daejeon-Chungcheong area. Results A total <b>of</b> 152 <b>patients</b> were examined for resistance associated variants (RAVs). Among them, 15 (9. 9 %) were positive for Y 93 and one (0. 7 %) was positive for <b>L</b> 31. <b>Of</b> 126 <b>patients</b> treated with DCV+ASV, 83 patients completed treatment and 76 patients were included in safety and efficacy analysis. Five (6. 6 %) were positive for Y 93 and 12 (15. 8 %) exhibited cirrhotic change. DCV+ASV was the first-line treatment for 58 (76. 3 %) patients. Eleven (14. 5 %) patients relapsed after previous treatment that included interferon and seven (9. 2 %) <b>of</b> these <b>patients</b> were found to be intolerant of interferon. Adverse events occurred in 10 (13. 2 %) patients and two patients stopped the medication because of severe itching and skin rash.

40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) for {{critically}} ill patients with {{acute renal failure}} has been provided as intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). IHD is often complicated by hypotension and inadequate fluid removal, and CRRT by high cost of solutions and problems with anticoagulation. Sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLED) has been suggested as an alternative treatment. This is an observational, prospective pilot study describing the introduction of SLED at our institution. We compared SLED (23 patients, 165 treatments) with CRRT (11 patients, 209 days), focusing on cost, anticoagulation, and small solute removal. SLED consisted of 8 h of HD 6 days a week, with blood flow of 200 ml/min, dialysate flows of 350 ml/min, and hemofiltration with 1 <b>l</b> <b>of</b> saline/h. CRRT <b>patients</b> were anticoagulated with either heparin or citrate, and SLED patients with either heparin or saline flushes. The weekly costs to the hospital were $ 1431 for SLED, $ 2607 for CRRT with heparin, and $ 3089 for CRRT with citrate. Sixty-five percent of SLED treatments were heparin-free; filter clotting occurred in 18 % of heparin treatments and 29 % of heparin-free treatments (NS). Weekly Kt/V was significantly higher for SLED (8. 4 ± 1. 8) and time-averaged serum creatinine was lower; equivalent renal clearance (EKRjc) was 29 ± 6 ml/min for SLED, similar to that for CRRT. In summary, SLED may be routinely performed without anticoagulation; it provides solute removal equivalent to CRRT at significantly lower cost...|$|R
