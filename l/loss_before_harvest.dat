Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered <b>losses</b> shortly <b>before</b> <b>harvest</b> season. Crop damage totaled to around $8million (2003USD).

50|$|Research {{into the}} food {{industry}} of the United States, whose food supply is the most diverse and abundant of {{any country in the}} world, found food waste occurring at the beginning of food production. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and severe weather, which cause <b>losses</b> <b>before</b> <b>harvest.</b> Since natural forces (e.g. temperature and precipitation) remain the primary drivers of crop growth, losses from these can be experienced by all forms of outdoor agriculture. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Economic factors, such as regulations and standards for quality and appearance, also cause food waste; farmers often harvest selectively, preferring to leave crops not to standard in the field (where they can be used as fertilizer or animal feed), since they would otherwise be discarded later. In urban areas, fruit and nut trees often go unharvested because people either don't realize that the fruit is edible or they fear that it is contaminated, despite research which shows that urban fruit is safe to consume.|$|R

These can affect the purity of subsequently harvested crops and cause an uncontrolled flow of GM pollen into the agro-ecosystem. Management strategies that reduce these long-term effects of GM crops include (1) minimizing the input of GM seeds into the soil, (2) preventing proliferation by volunteers and (3) fast depletion of the soil GM seed bank. Formulation of such strategies requires knowledge of the biology of the GM plant (seed <b>loss</b> at or <b>before</b> <b>harvest,</b> seed survival, germination and emergence rates, reproduction, etc.) and {{of the effect of}} management practices on the different life stages.

The work was undertaken in April 1993 in a Canterbury vineyard {{at the suggestion of}} Pest Management Services Ltd., who market eye-spot balloons. Fieldwork was conducted as a 4 th-year project by a University of Canterbury wildlife management class. Objective • To measure the effect {{of a small group of}} eye-spot balloons on bird damage to grapes at various distances from the balloons and at various times <b>before</b> <b>harvest.</b> Methods • Six balloons were hung above a ripening crop of pinot noir grapes five weeks <b>before</b> <b>harvest.</b> • At weekly intervals a visual assessment was made of bird damage to bunches of grapes at distances of up to 40 m from the balloons. Results • Bird damage increased rapidly as harvest approached and the grapes ripened and coloured. • One week <b>before</b> <b>harvest,</b> bird damage to grapes directly beneath the balloons was only 55 % of that recorded 40 m from the balloons. • The deterrent effect of the balloons extended about 20 m during the first week of the trial, and over shorter distances thereafter. Recommendations • Eye-spot balloons repel pest birds, but need to be used in conjunction with other methods of bird control. • Eye-spot balloons have little effect on birds more than 20 m from them. • Birds begin to habituate to eye-spot balloons within 1 - 2 weeks. Their installation in vineyards should therefore be delayed until shortly <b>before</b> <b>harvest,</b> when the risk of bird damage is greatest. ...|$|R

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{public and private}} organizations, the Agricultural Research Service is very {{concerned}} about how much food goes to waste between farm and fork—both nationally and internationally. By reducing losses in our food systems, U. S. growers, processors, and others can enhance America’s ability to feed itself and the world. By the same token, slashing waste may provide new opportunities to reduce costs along the entire supply chain and make better use of increasingly limited natural resources. The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) estimated— in 2008 —that {{the amount of food}} lost annually at just the retail and consumer levels alone averaged 275 pounds per person, representing a total yearly national impact of $ 165 billion. Cutting our food losses by just 15 percent would provide enough extra food to feed more than 25 million Americans every year from existing crop, pasture, and rangelands. Another ERS assessment found that most of the food loss in developed countries happens postharvest, that is, after food has left the farm gate, while in less developed countries, the bulk of the <b>loss</b> occurs <b>before</b> <b>harvest.</b> In the United States, nonprofit organizations concerned with a stable and accessible food supply—and wise use of the resources that are needed to produce and deliver that food—have called on the federal government to conduct a comprehensive study of losses in our food systems and to set national goals for reducing this waste. Meanwhile, ARS scientists at laboratories throughout the country have, for some time, been conducting a range of studies to create new technologies or to newly apply existing ones to curb food waste. Our ongoing work encompasses a wide variety of foods, from grains to grapes, meats to potatoes, and more. For example, we have developed an ozone-based treatment that growers of organic grapes can use—after harvest—to inhibit Botrytis cinerea, the microbe that causes gray mold. The research provides an alternative to sulfur dioxide, which organic growers cannot use. We are investigating the combined use of refrigeration, improved packaging, and a natural compound that delays ripening to help perishables such as strawberries, blueberries, and tomatoes stay fresh longer during shipping and storage. We are developing powdered fruit- and vegetable-based coatings to inhibit spoilage of fresh-cut produce. We are experimenting with the use of cold plasma technology to ionize the atmosphere inside packages of raw chicken breasts to quickly, safely, and effectively extend the shelf life of this popular product. We are inventing robots for in-orchard culling of apples, a high-tech approach that could help reduce the postharvest spread of insects or crop diseases from one apple to the next...|$|R

At times the price relationship between corn, soybean meal, and {{dried distillers grains}} with solubles (DDGS) warrants the inclusion of more than 30 % DDGS in swine growing-finishing diets. However, adding more than 20 % DDGS to these diets can cause soft pork fat. Pigs with less backfat, such as immunologically castrated pigs, are more sensitive to dietary fatty acid composition than physical castrates with greater backfat thickness. To overcome soft pork fat resulting from feeding DDGS diets, DDGS can either be removed <b>before</b> pigs are <b>harvested</b> or the dietary inclusion rate can be gradually decreased during the growing-finishing period. However, it is unknown if using these feeding strategies are effective for immunologically castrated pigs that can be harvested 3 to 10 weeks after the second Improvest® (gonadotropin releasing factor analog - diphtheria toxoid conjugate; Zoetis, Inc, Florham Park, NJ) dose. Gradually decreasing the DDGS inclusion from 40 to 10 % was more advantageous than withdrawing DDGS from the diet 5 wk <b>before</b> <b>harvest</b> because lean gain/d and lean gain caloric efficiency were greater than feeding 40 % DDGS diets throughout the growing-finishing period, and similar to pigs fed corn-soybean meal diets with no DDGS. Feeding diets containing 40 % DDGS throughout the growing-finishing period resulted in reduced loin and fat quality. Gradually reducing the DDGS inclusion or withdrawing DDGS 5 wk <b>before</b> <b>harvest</b> were not effective in improving loin quality, but both reduced belly fat iodine value. Delaying the second Improvest® dose to 5 weeks <b>before</b> <b>harvest</b> resulted in the greatest benefit for improving lean gain caloric efficiency. Harvesting pigs at 5, 7, or 9 weeks after the second Improvest® dose did not alter pork loin quality and delaying the second Improvest® dose slightly improved pork fat firmness. However, all immunologically castrated pigs had acceptable fat firmness based on current industry standards. In conclusion, gradually reducing the DDGS dietary inclusion was more beneficial than withdrawing DDGS 5 weeks <b>before</b> <b>harvest,</b> and delaying the second Improvest® dose to 5 weeks <b>before</b> <b>harvest</b> captured the greatest benefit of improved lean gain caloric efficiency and {{did not result in}} adverse loin or fat quality characteristics...|$|R
