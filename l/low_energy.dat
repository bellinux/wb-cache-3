40|$|Conformational {{ensemble}} of Digoxin and Digitoxin, the two prominent cardiac glycosides {{was developed by}} employing force fields based geometry optimization and energy minimization methods to find <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformers. The interamolecular <b>energies</b> of each <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformer obtained by various approaches were computed. The torsional space explored by the <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformers were calculated by measuring its rotatable bonds angle. Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) over all atoms in conformational space interspersed over <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformers was estimated to study the confidence of obtaining <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformers over converged iterations. We emphasized the role of force-fields and multiple steps of iterations for conformational space exploration in determining the <b>lowest</b> <b>energy</b> conformers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{know that}} the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) fails at <b>low</b> <b>energies.</b> For example, within QCD, we cannot {{calculate}} precise mass and spin of nucleons. It does not concern the Scale-Symmetric Theory (SST). Moreover, experimental data show that at <b>low</b> <b>energies</b> the effective range parameters for nn, np, and pp scatterings are similar, but different. Why? Here, applying SST, we calculated the effective range parameters and scattering lengths for nn (respectively 2. 732 fm and- 18. 806 fm), for np (2. 778 fm and- 23. 867 fm), and pp (2. 824 fm and- 16. 995 fm). These theoretical {{results are consistent with}} experimental data. At <b>low</b> <b>energies,</b> the effective range parameters follow from exchanges of virtual pions (which are responsible for the nuclear strong interactions) and production of the virtual condensates (which are responsible for the nuclear weak interactions at <b>low</b> <b>energies).</b> The condensates insignificantly increase the effective ranges. Just at <b>low</b> <b>energies,</b> the effective range parameters for nucleons follow from their strong-weak interactions described within SST. On the other hand, the scattering lengths we interpret as the circumferences of the produced gluon/photon loops with maximum radius. The obtained here and within SST results show that QCD is the incomplete and partially incorrect theory- the same concerns the electroweak theory at <b>low</b> <b>energies.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{dependence}} of the path-length distribution of cosmic rays at <b>low</b> <b>energies,</b> below relativistic velocities, is studied, {{and its implications for}} models of cosmic-ray confinement and propagation in the Galaxy and Galactic halo, including the effects of a possible Galactic wind, are studied. It is found that the mean free path in Galactic propagation must be fully energy-dependent, with the mean of an exponential path-length distribution increasing with increasing energy below 1 GeV per nucleon and decreasing with increasing energy above 1 GeV per nucleon. This indicates that, at <b>low</b> <b>energies,</b> diffusion is not the controlling process. The path-length distribution is not purely exponential but is depleted in short path lengths at <b>low</b> <b>energies.</b> This depletion is energy-dependent, being largest at <b>low</b> <b>energies</b> and decreasing with increasing energy...|$|R
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} of the pion in 1947, the search for new elementary particles became a popular research topic. By operating fast ionization chambers within a cloud chamber, Herbert showed that the bursts of ionization they recorded were primarily produced by relatively <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> cosmic rays, whose nuclear interactions typically involve the ejection of several heavily ionising nuclear fragments. On the basis of this effect, he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions {{is similar to that of}} penetrating showers.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of {{berkelium}} on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. <b>Low</b> <b>energy</b> eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E
