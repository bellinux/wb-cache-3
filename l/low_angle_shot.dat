50|$|The {{contrasts}} and {{the movements}} are highlighted by a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{point of view}} of the scene. There is no supernatural aspect and the painting is clearly influenced by realism, as if the scene could happen in real life, except the fact that the characters are only dressed with togas.|$|E
50|$|One of the film’s {{aesthetic}} and storytelling “innovations” {{was to try}} and tell much of the story from the cane toads’ point of view. This was achieved {{by a number of}} extremely <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Lewis’ goal was to give a voice to the toads who were at the center of so much controversy, and “create some sympathy for this animal that was so widely reviled”.|$|R
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots.</b> Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|R

50|$|Fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (FLASH MRI) is a basic measuring principle for rapid MRI invented in 1985 by Jens Frahm, Axel Haase, W Hänicke, KD Merboldt, and D Matthaei (German Patent Application P 35 04 734.8, February 12, 1985) at the Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie in Göttingen, Germany. The technique is revolutionary in shortening MRI measuring times by up to two orders of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|The Dark Knight (directed by Christopher Nolan): Nolan uses {{extremely}} low angle shots {{to give the}} Joker a more powerful image in The Dark Knight, especially during the scene where the truck he was driving is flipped over and he gets out and starts shooting at Batman. In this scene, the angle actually goes from a normal medium close up and slowly moves into a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{action was}} {{broadcast}} via fifty-two cameras, including cameras situated inside fences, although {{the use of}} jockey cams, cameras placed inside riders helmets was not used this year. The famous head-on elevated shot of Becher's Brook, which became synonymous with the fence for almost 50 years was replaced with a <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot.</b> This was the 49th annual broadcast of the race live by the BBC but was the first not to be broadcast {{as part of a}} Grandstand special.|$|E
50|$|Amid {{considerable}} transfer speculation, Adams {{played in}} Sheffield United's opening fixture of the 2016-17 season, but a bid was accepted from Championship club Birmingham City shortly afterwards, and {{he signed a}} three-year contract with the club on 8 August 2016. The fee was undisclosed, although the Sheffield Star reported it to be around £2 million, and that United had turned down deals valued at £1.2m and £1.7m. Adams made his Birmingham debut on 16 August, as a second-half substitute in a 1-1 draw away to Wigan Athletic. He started the next match, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers four days later, and opened the scoring with a <b>low</b> <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> across the goalkeeper; he played 61 minutes as Birmingham went on to lose 3-1.|$|R
50|$|Alireza Haghighi then saved {{well from}} Mahmoud {{with his feet}} but as the first period {{drew to a close}} there was time for a final moment of drama as Pooladi {{received}} his second yellow card of the match following a coming together with Iraq goalkeeper Jalal Hassan to see Iran go into the break a man down and within three minutes of the second half Iran almost saw their goal advantage disappear, too, as Yaser Kasim's free-kick was athletically saved by a Haghighi who launched himself to his left to tip the ball over the bar. But on 56 minutes Iraq got the equaliser they had been threatening as Alaa Abdul-Zahra's wicked cross from the left wing evaded defenders and attackers alike before Yasen latched onto the ball at the far post and drove his <b>low</b> <b>angled</b> <b>shot</b> through a group of players and into the net.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the film}} high and <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> {{are used in}} order to express the balance of power, those at the “top” and those at the “bottom”. At some parts, the film {{utilizes}} stylistic devices of the Nazi weekly reviews, which recorded Hitler’s speeches. An example {{for this is the}} closing speech of Wenger. In this scene the camera is placed close behind him, at the level of his nape, and so offers a view of the geometrically arranged crowd of students. Other scenes are based on pop culture. Especially the film clip in which the Wave-supporters spray their logo on buildings, is staged in the style of a music video. This logo is designed as [...] "a jagged tsunami wave in a similar way to Manga comics." [...] There is a high frequency and abrupt manner of film editing. There is fast, even rapid camera work and the rock music, that accompanies many of the scenes, is often characterized as impulsive.|$|R
50|$|Matthaei {{worked at}} the Georg-August-University of Göttingen and at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance in biological systems. He {{was looking for a}} scientific development of NMR techniques based on magnetic resonance imagery. With Axel Haase and Jens Frahm he succeeded in 1985 with the invention of rapid image proceedings FLASH MRI (fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot)</b> a revolutionary breakthrough that allows the use of MRI imaging for clinical diagnosis. It enabled the first real coherent representation of body functions.|$|E
50|$|The {{institute}} also accommodates {{the independent}} Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH headed by Jens Frahm, {{which was founded}} in 1993. The focus of this association is the development and application of spatially resolved NMR techniques for non-invasive studies of the central nervous system in animals and humans. These innovative approaches allow for unique insights into the structure, metabolism and function of the intact living brain. Jens Frahm and his coworkers invented a rapid acquisition technique for magnetic resonance imaging termed FLASH MRI (fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot)</b> technique which allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{projects}} was a more sophisticated development of the rather modest MRI techniques available {{in the early eighties}} - mainly with respect to speed and specificity. Already in 1985 the group presented a major breakthrough for the future development of MRI in both science and medicine. The invention of a rapid imaging principle, the FLASH MRI (fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot)</b> technique, allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH acquisition technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging. Examples include breathhold imaging of the abdomen, electrocardiogram-synchronized quasi-real time movies of the beating heart, dynamic scanning of contrast media uptake, 3D imaging of complex anatomic structures such as the brain that allow for unprecedented high spatial resolution and arbitrary view angles, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the vasculature. Other achievements extended to MRI and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques based on stimulated echoes - another invention from 1984.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} weeks of {{location}} shooting began in the Oise between the Marne and the Rhine and down the Ourcq canal to the harbor in La Villette. The harsh and early winter weather slowed down the shooting schedule and affected Vigo's health. Despite the cold weather, Vigo wanted to shoot at night more and more so as to use the artificial lights of the barge and houses along the canal. Vigo also needed to maintain continuity, and the cold weather was creating floating ice in the canal. In the middle of location shooting, Vigo moved the cast and crew to the replica set of the barge at Gaumont studios at La Villette, but would quickly change the day's shooting to on location whenever the weather permitted. Vigo left all transition shots to the very end of shooting, which became a major problem due to the ground then being covered with snow.

5000|$|Film {{communicates}} meaning denotatively and connotatively. What {{the audience}} sees and hears is denotative, {{it is what}} it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it. At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer. Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions. According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” [...] Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance. Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.|$|E
5000|$|The {{narrative}} style doesn't {{keep the}} audience at distance, {{so that it can}} reflect on the things that happened, but rather lets them experience the occurrences; so the plot is narrated linearly. Similar experiences of various characters, for instance, scenes in which students tell their parents about their day at school, are realized as cross-cutting and thus demonstrate the range of different perceptions of the day. The film is narrated {{from the perspective of a}} third person, although particular scenes provide individual characters' subjective points of view. An example for this is the scene in which Karo is in the schoolhouse at night, or the scene at the end when Wenger is arrested by the police and driven away. While on the one hand Wenger is filmed in <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> and sings rock music in the opening sequence, on the other hand he seems depressed in this last scene. [...] "Slow motion shots reflect his tormenting self-reproaches." [...] The change to the subjective view of the thoughtful character corresponds to the dramatic composition throughout the film. This change is meant to initiate reflections on the part of the audience. Gansel justifies the drastic end with the necessity of shocking the audience after the length of the film, of providing a counter-statement and of taking up a stance. A critic assumed that in this country you can’t say Adolf without having consequences. So triggering off fascism involves a couple of dead persons.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We propose DANTE (Delays Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation) moving fluid {{attenuation}} preparation pulse trains, {{in conjunction}} with T 1, T 2, and proton-density-weighted fast spin-echo (T 1 w-TSE, T 2 w-TSE and PDw-TSE) imaging readout, and three-dimensional fast <b>low</b> flip <b>angle</b> <b>shots</b> (3 D-FLASH) T 1 -weighted imaging readout to achieve CSF-suppressed high-spatial resolution multicontrast cervical spinal cord images. METHODS: DANTE pulse trains, consisting of a rapid series of <b>low</b> flip <b>angle</b> radiofrequency pulses interspersed with gradients, were used to substantially attenuate the longitudinal magnetization of flowing spins relative to static tissue/fluid, whose longitudinal magnetization is mostly preserved. We hypothesized that the contrast between spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be maximized due to moving CSF signal suppression. RESULTS: We demonstrate that metrics of contrast-to-noise ratio between spinal cord, nerve root, and CSF regions (CNRcord-CSF and CNRnerve-CSF) are improved by at least a factor of 2 when compared with images acquired with non-prepared approaches and with 2 D multiple-echo data image combination (MEDIC) imaging. In addition, we find that sagittal image quality can be significantly improved due to flow suppression effects from the DANTE preparation pluses. CONCLUSION: DANTE prepared imaging techniques for moving CSF signal attenuation are promising tools for cervical spinal cord imaging.

It {{consists of a}} series of anisotropic partial acquisitions with a reduced resolution in the read direction, which alleviates signal attenuation and still provides a high isotropic resolution. The advantages of SLASH imaging over conventional FLASH imaging are evaluated analytically, using numerical lattice calculations, and experimentally in phantom cells filled with hyperpolarised 3 He-N 2 gas mixtures. Low-field MRI is performed (here 2. 7 mT), a necessary condition to obtain long T 2 * values in lungs for slow acquisition. Two additional benefits of the SLASH scheme over FLASH imaging have been demonstrated: it is less sensitive to the artefacts due to concomitant gradients and it allows measuring apparent diffusion coefficients for an extended range of times...|$|E
40|$|Contrast-enhancing {{magnetic}} resonance mechanism, employing either {{positive or negative}} signal changes, has contrast-specific signal characteristics. Although highly sensitive, negative contrast typically decreases the resolution and spatial specificity of MRI, whereas positive contrast lacks a high contrast-to-noise ratio but offers high spatial accuracy. To overcome these individual limitations, dual-contrast acquisitions were performed using iron oxide nanoparticles {{and a pair of}} MRI acquisitions. Specifically, vascular signals in MR angiography were positively enhanced using ultrashort echo (UTE) acquisition, which provided highly resolved vessel structures with increased vessel/tissue contrast. In addition, fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> (FLASH) acquisition yielded strong negative vessel contrast, resulting in the higher number of discernible vessel branches than those obtained from the UTE method. Taken together, the high sensitivity of the negative contrast delineated ambiguous vessel regions, whereas the positive contrast effectively eliminated the false negative contrast areas (e. g., airways and bones), demonstrating the benefits of the dual-contrast method. close 0...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of an}} {{increasing}} number of publications that deal with functional mapping of the human amygdala using blood oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging, we reevaluated the underlying image quality of T 2 *-weighted echoplanar imaging (EPI) and fast <b>low</b> <b>angle</b> <b>shot</b> (FLASH) sequences at 2. 0 -T with regard to susceptibility-induced signal losses and geometric distortions. Apart from the timing of the gradient echoes, the degree of susceptibility influences is controlled by the image voxel size. Whereas published amygdala studies report voxel sizes ranging from 22 to 125 �l, the present results suggest that reliable imaging of the amygdala with BOLD sensitivity requires voxel sizes of 4 to 8 �l or less. Preferentially, acquisitions should be performed with a coronal section orientation. Although high-resolution BOLD MRI is at the expense of temporal resolution and volume coverage, it seems to provide the only solution to this physical problem. © 2001 Academic Pres...|$|E
