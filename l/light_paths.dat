25|$|Because {{every facet}} has the {{potential}} to change a light ray's plane of travel, every facet must be considered in any complete calculation of <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|E
25|$|The same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.2‑3b in {{the frame}} of {{observer}} O. The <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> have slopes=1 and−1 so that ΔPQR forms a right triangle. Since OP=OQ=OR, the angle between x′ and x must also be θ.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ship}} has reached its {{cruising}} speed of 0.8c, each twin would see 1second {{pass in the}} received image of the other twin for every 3seconds of his own time. That is, each would see {{the image of the}} other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ε factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3seconds pass in the image for every second of his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{equation}} is invalid, however, if the <b>light</b> source's <b>path</b> in space {{does not follow}} that of the light signals, for example in the standard rotating platform case (FOG) but with a non-circular <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> In this case the phase difference formula necessarily involves the area enclosed by the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> due to Stokes' theorem.|$|R
25|$|Path tracing, {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as Monte Carlo ray tracing, renders a 3D scene by randomly tracing samples of possible <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> Repeated sampling of any given pixel will eventually cause {{the average of the}} samples to converge on the correct solution of the rendering equation, {{making it one of the}} most physically accurate 3D graphics rendering methods in existence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} point {{to consider is}} that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we now know that a diamond's appearance is composed of many <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we can see that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E
30|$|The {{next step}} is {{alignment}} of the <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> After a contour of the target is estimated considering the visual hull of silhouettes from various views, the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> is aligned with the contour estimated and a sinogram is generated. The interior is reconstructed from the sinogram.|$|R
30|$|According to the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> model, {{the paths}} in the object are {{simplified}} as spreading straight rays. However, {{it is still}} insufficient to apply inverse Radon transform {{because they are not}} parallel. Here, we introduce <b>light</b> <b>path</b> alignment that converts these simplified paths to parallel paths.|$|R

2500|$|It may {{at first}} seem {{counterintuitive}} or [...] "backwards" [...] to send rays {{away from the}} camera, rather than into it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since {{the overwhelming majority of}} light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewer's eye, a [...] "forward" [...] simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> that are never recorded.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{facility}} at Paranal is the VLT, {{which consists of}} four nearly identical [...] unit telescopes (UTs), each hosting two or three instruments. These large telescopes can also work together in groups {{of two or three}} as a giant interferometer. The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than those seen with the individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI with a complex system of mirrors in underground tunnels, where the <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> must diverge less than 1/1000mm over 100 metres. The VLTI can achieve an angular resolution of milliarcseconds, equivalent to the ability to see the headlights of a car on the moon.|$|E

We propose <b>light</b> <b>path</b> alignment to deal with scattering rays. Each path of disturbed scattering light is approximated with a straight line. Then the <b>light</b> <b>path</b> in the object corresponding to a single incident ray is modeled as straight paths spreading from incident point.
