30|$|The general downsides {{of higher}} field {{strength}} {{are also more}} pronounced for CEST imaging. The susceptibility-related voxel-wise magnetic field shift is proportionally increased with field strength and hence places a more stringent requirement on the B 0 <b>correction.</b> <b>RF</b> homogeneity deteriorates severely at 7  T and, if not properly calibrated, a nonuniform saturation profile across the field-of-view may result [27, 72]. The SAR level also becomes a hazardous issue at ultra-high field. Due to the uncommonly long RF lengths needed by CEST, careful design of the RF saturation strategy is needed. Overall, at present, the benefits of 7  T (likely to become a clinically approved field strength in the near future) for diaCEST outweigh the shortcomings [17] and high field strengths are recommended, subject to hardware availability as well as regulations.|$|R

The field has seen significant advances in recent years and some topics were presented in a new way and other topics were added.
