50|$|Research {{has also}} {{examined}} whether non-human primates are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conserve.

They are also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> correctly conserve for solid quantities, {{but they are not}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete conservation of number tasks. Orangutans are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between same and different quantities of liquid but they are only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pseudoconserve, similar to children in the second stage of conservation development, and ultimately fail to correctly complete conservation of liquid tasks (see Age of conservation ability).|$|R
