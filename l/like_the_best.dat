25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of her novelist peers... she slides {{in and out}} of her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E

In gratitude, the miners give him the sacred stones that Wolf had been using them to dig for - the Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, which contain the final incantation to activate the Machine when all the pillars are placed. Jack and Pooh travel to their old farm in Kenya, finding Horus (Jack's falcon) and the Adamson twins waiting; they'd come to the farm because it seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> isolated safe place. They share with Jack {{the news that the}} Brotherhood has a mole in Wolf's unit, a marine code-named Switchblade, who plans to sabotage Wolf's effort to place the Second Pillar. Jack and the Adamsons head to Zanzibar, where an old friend of Jack's is hiding out, making a career after deserting the US army to attack gun-runners in Africa. Pooh leaves them at the airport to go north and rescue Stretch from the Mossad's torture chambers. Before he leaves, Jack gives him a GPS locator with which to signal Jack if he needs help.|$|E

It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> SF where a casual reference can imply a lot." [...] Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the movie frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the Metal Gear series. Solid Snake is partially influenced by Snake Plissken. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Snake actually uses the alias [...] "Pliskin" [...] to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film Cloverfield, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for Escape from New York.

Kotecha had already previously collaborated with Grande when producing the first, second, third and fourth single from My Everything.

[...] The film was ranked #15 in Empires 2010 list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema". In their rationale, the authors noted that, [...] "in these days where every second movie seems to feature vampires, it takes a very special twist on the legend to surprise us – but this one knocked us out and then bit us in the jugular", and found that the [...] "strange central friendship" [...] between the two lead characters was what made the film [...] "so frightening, and so magnetic". In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films; Let the Right One In placed at number 28 on their top 100 list. The film was later voted the 94th greatest film since 2000 in an international critics' poll conducted by BBC.|$|E

500|$|Khan {{starred in}} seven films in 1995, {{the first of}} which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most {{significant}} release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a [...] "romantic hero". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an [...] "all time blockbuster" [...] by Box Office India, with a gross of over [...] worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards.

Slezak, on the other hand, described the choreography as [...] "peculiar", and graded the song a [...] "B". Sullivan wrote, [...] "On paper {{it may not have}} seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> idea, but honestly, it kind of rocked." [...] Chaney noted that [...] "they were fun to watch", but gave the performance a [...] "C"; she said that [...] "something about this cover sucked all the cherry ice cream smile out of the originals", though she wondered whether she was biased by her [...] "lifelong appreciation of Duran Duran".

Both Chaney and Slezak gave the song a [...] Chaney said he sang the song [...] "with conviction" [...] and complimented the [...] "visually alluring" [...] boxing and shower scenes, as did Slezak. Strecker wrote that [...] "the energy and emotional punch totally resonated" [...] and gave the song an [...] though she also stated that [...] "the talk-singing at the beginning was a little weird". Votta said that [...] "vocally, Darren Criss embodies the song", but she characterized the staging as [...] "too jagged and haphazard to make an impact", and the transitions not [...] "as smooth as they could be". Flandez called the song choice [...] "unsuitable" [...] and [...] "puzzling", and VanDerWerff said the performance was [...] "completely ridiculous".|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller, also of TV Squad, {{called it}} one of the best episodes of the season, and that it {{provided}} each member of the ensemble cast moments to shine.

James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it a [...] "splendid" [...] episode that [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Punchline Magazine writer Megan Gilbert said the episode featured [...] "plenty of laugh-out-loud moments" [...] and particularly enjoyed the [...] "sweet non-aggressive fighting" [...] between April and Andy. Gilbert felt Adam Scott was underused, but praised the performances of Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari and Mo Collins. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook said the difficulties that plague the harvest festival were funny, [...] "but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of Parks, these hiccups are matched with acres of heart". He praised the growing romantic interest between Leslie and Ben, as well as the subplot about Andy and April. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette praised the show for being funny without resorting to cynicism or cruel jokes, and called the series [...] "one of the sharpest, smartest comedies on TV at the moment". He also called the Wamapoke curse subplot [...] "wildly politically incorrect, but funny".

Beyoncé's fashion efforts in 'Video Phone'— which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory— deserve a look-by-look analysis, because she tried really hard." [...] In another review, she said [...] "Together they play with colored fire-spitting water guns and look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of diva friends." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes". Spins Chris Zakorchemny felt that Gaga [...] "does her best Beyonce impression" [...] in the video for the song. However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer too much into the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe."
