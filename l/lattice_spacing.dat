5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise <b>lattice</b> <b>spacing</b> between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E

25|$|A common {{photonic}} crystal nanocavity design shown {{is essentially a}} {{photonic crystal}} with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The <b>lattice</b> <b>spacing</b> can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{behavior}} of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to try to solve it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller <b>lattice</b> <b>spacing)</b> is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each.
