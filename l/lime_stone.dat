25|$|Another early settler, Henry Cooper and his brothers, built two lime kilns at Mindarie in 1932 {{after the}} closure of their {{quarries}} in Wembley. The Cooper family produced and sold treated limestone in Perth and Fremantle as the Quinns Rocks <b>Lime</b> <b>Stone</b> Company, and {{were some of the}} first permanent residents of the nearby Quinns Rocks townsite. The kilns provided work for up to thirty-two labourers, who settled in Mindarie in makeshift jarrah shacks, and are commonly held {{as a symbol of the}} diversification of industry brought on by the Great Depression at the time. The Coopers ceased lime-burning operations in 1948 after exhausting good quality limestone supplies in the area.|$|E

25|$|Sekhemkhet´s pyramid {{was planned}} {{as a step}} pyramid from the first. Its base was a square {{footprint}} measuring 378ft x 378ft (220 x 220 cubits). If the pyramid had been completed, {{it would have had}} six or seven steps and a final height of 240.5ft (140 cubits). These proportions would have given the pyramid an angle of elevation of 51˚50', identical to the pyramid at Meidum and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Like Djoser´s pyramid, Sekhemkhet's was built of <b>lime</b> <b>stone</b> blocks. The monument was not finished, possibly because of the pharaoh´s sudden death.

25|$|The {{caves in}} the Bahamas were formed {{during the last}} ice age. With much of the Earth's water held {{in the form of}} glacial ice, the sea level fell {{hundreds}} of feet, leaving most of the Bahama banks, which are now covered in water, high and dry. Rain falling on the most porous limestone slowly filtered down to sea level forming a lens where it contacted the denser salt water of the ocean permeating the spongy <b>lime</b> <b>stone.</b> The water at the interface was acidic enough to dissolve away the limestone and form the caves. Then, as more ice formed and the sea level dropped even further, the caves became dry and rainwater dripping through the ceiling over thousands of years created the incredible crystal forests of stalagmites which now decorate the caves. Finally, when the ice melted and the sea level rose, the caves were reclaimed by the sea.|$|E
