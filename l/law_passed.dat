5|$|English Poor Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent poor, although there is much earlier Tudor legislation dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the Poor Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old Poor <b>Law</b> <b>passed</b> during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New Poor <b>Law,</b> <b>passed</b> in 1834, which significantly modified the existing system of poor relief. The later statute altered the Poor Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by Poor Law Unions.|$|E
5|$|As mayor, Newsom {{focused on}} {{development}} projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the state <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 2000.|$|E
5|$|By {{calling a}} federal referendum, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{language}} laws in Quebec, which overlap and in various areas conflict or compete with each other: the <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> by the Parliament of Canada and the <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> by the National Assembly of Quebec.|$|R
50|$|They {{have also}} criticized the {{enforcement}} of <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> by councils rather than the use of supposed voluntary custom or customary law which develops through mutual recognition rather than being enforced by an external authority, as they argue the <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> by such councils would need to be.|$|R

5|$|Cooper {{served on}} the board of {{trustees}} for the University of Kentucky from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory primary election <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a nominating convention, as was typical for the party. Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to King Swope, a Lexington circuit court judge and former congressman.|$|E
5|$|Divorce was legalized by a <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1987. The church opposed it, {{but it had}} huge {{popular support}} that {{included}} even Catholic factions, who reasoned that marital separation already existed, and divorce simply made it explicit. The church opposed Alfonsín after that point. The church successfully exerted pressure to prevent the abolition of religious education. In line with the teachings of Pope John Paul II, the Church criticized what it perceived as an increase in drugs, terrorism, abortion and pornography.|$|E
5|$|In {{a meeting}} near Bologna in October 43BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a junta called the Second Triumvirate. This {{explicit}} arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> by the plebs, unlike the unofficial First Triumvirate formed by Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Marcus Licinius Crassus. The triumvirs then {{set in motion}} proscriptions in which 300 senators and 2,000 equites allegedly were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism <b>Law,</b> <b>passed</b> in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives has {{the power}} to appoint the prime minister, make {{constitutional}} amendments, call for a vote of confidence on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic {{has the power}} to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. The General Assembly has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Taylor {{was elected}} Attorney General of Kentucky, and served until 1899. During his term, state senator William Goebel {{proposed}} an election law {{that created a}} state Board of Elections which was empowered to appoint all election officers in every county and certify all election results. The board was to be appointed by the General Assembly, {{and there were no}} requirements that its composition be bi-partisan. The law was widely seen as a power play by Goebel, designed to ensure Democratic victories in state elections, including Goebel's own anticipated run for governor. The <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> the General Assembly, but was vetoed by Republican governor William O. Bradley. The General Assembly promptly overrode the veto. As attorney general, Taylor opined that the bill was unconstitutional. The measure was adjudicated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals and found to be constitutional.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E

5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who had died in the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Sovereign appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Under the Congressional {{calendar}} of the 1860s, {{members of the}} 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863; by the time Blaine finally took his seat that month, the Union had turned the tide in the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. As a first-term congressman, he initially said little, mostly following the administration’s lead in supporting the continuing war effort. He did clash several times with {{the leader of the}} Republicans' radical faction, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, firstly over payment of states' debts incurred in supporting the war, and again over monetary policy concerning the new greenback currency. Blaine also spoke in support of the commutation provision of the military draft <b>law</b> <b>passed</b> in 1863 and proposed a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to impose taxes on exports.|$|E

50|$|Until recently, {{the use of}} this {{procedure}} was very rare. During 1993-2009, it was used for less than 0.5% of the draft laws discussed and voted in Parliament, however, following the 2009 election, this percentage increased to 3.73% and since 2012 to 4.91%. Given that around 40% of the <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> concern the enactment of international and bilateral treaties which are generally adopted by unanimity or broad consensus, the actual percentage of <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> using the urgent legislature procedure is 6.1% since 2009 and 9.4% since 2012. In other words, since 2012 one in every 10 <b>laws</b> <b>passed</b> by Parliament was debated and enacted within 2 days.|$|R
