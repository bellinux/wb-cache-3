Besides lighting, the advent of high-brightness, fast-switching LED lamps has facilitated <b>LED</b> <b>Communication</b> as {{a new form of}} Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) in the visible light spectrum. This thesis study model characteristics of <b>LED</b> <b>communication</b> for indoor optical environment. Based on Matlab and SPICE, an electrical and optical <b>LED</b> <b>communication</b> model is proposed to describe light power's conversion and propagation.

Moreover, a test and measurement platform for <b>LED</b> <b>communication</b> has been established to validate the proposed model. A case of study on light power distribution within 30 cmX 30 cmX 10 cm in line-of-sight was implemented by measuring for comparing the theoretical simulation and experimental results.

To facilitate our research, we have constructed a controlled environment where nodes and cameras can be deployed and potentially hazardous chemical or physical plumes can be introduced to simulate environmental pollution events in a controlled manner.

Spectrum scarcity of traditional radio communication has <b>led</b> <b>communication</b> engineers to find new alternatives. Indoor visible light communication is one alternative to solve this problem since its spectrum is not regulated and it has much wider bandwidth then traditional communication systems. This increased the research done in the field of visible light communications. However a proper indoor channel model is lacking and all previous studies assumes that only additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is present. Lack of proper channel model has motivated us to model a realistic indoor visible light channel. After modeling the indoor visible light channel, the performance of an asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACOOFDM) system which is suitable for optical communications is investigated and compared to that of the AWGN optical channels.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 91 - 94. The growing {{need for}} high-speed wireless communication systems has <b>led</b> <b>communication</b> engineers {{to design and}} implement communication systems at higher frequencies where more bandwidth is available, use digital modulation schemes with more complex constellations and place carriers closer together with little guard-band {{in the pursuit of}} designing communication systems closer to the channel capacity. These new designs have placed tighter constraints on the performance of oscillators and timing devices of transceivers. In this work, the effects of timing clock jitter on the receiver Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based communication systems are examined and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) effects are quantified in order to prevent unnecessary over designs in OFDM ADC circuitry. In this respect, a simulation tool that synthesizes jitter processes with defined spectral characteristics is prepared. The generated jitter processes are utilized in an OFDM simulation tool that quantifies the ICI levels caused by receiver ADC sampling jitter. Using these two tools, ICI levels of certain OFDM systems are examined and guidelines for OFDM ADC circuitry design are proposed. Tanyeri, H OnurM. S...|$|E

40|$|Smart {{cities are}} {{expected}} {{to improve the quality}} of life of citizens by relying on new paradigms, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and its capacity to manage and interconnect thousands of sensors and actuators scattered across the city. At the same time, mobile devices widely assist professional and personal everyday activities. A very good example of the potential of these devices for smart cities is their powerful support for intuitive service interfaces (such as those based on augmented reality (AR)) for non-expert users. In our work, we consider a scenario that combines IoT and AR within a smart city maintenance service to improve the accessibility of sensor and actuator devices in the field, where responsiveness is crucial. In it, depending on the location and needs of each service, data and commands will be transported by an urban communications network or consulted on the spot. Direct AR interaction with urban objects has already been described; it usually relies on 2 D visual codes to deliver object identifiers (IDs) to the rendering device to identify object resources. These IDs allow information about the objects to be retrieved from a remote server. In this work, we present a novel solution that replaces static AR markers with dynamic markers based on <b>LED</b> <b>communication,</b> which can be decoded through cameras embedded in smartphones. These dynamic markers can directly deliver sensor information to the rendering device, on top of the object ID, without further network interaction...|$|E
