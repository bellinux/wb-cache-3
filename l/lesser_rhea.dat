5000|$|The guanaco population, from 15 animals {{introduced}} in 1938-39, rapidly grew to around 275 by 1956, when culling began {{in order to}} replace them with sheep. By the early 1960s, they {{had been reduced to}} around 10-20 animals. The population oscillated between a few hundred and a few dozen, with repeated culling; as of 2004, the population had risen back to around 400 animals. Other introduced species in the 1930s included a pair of <b>lesser</b> <b>rheas</b> (known to Falklanders as [...] "ostriches") and a number of Humboldt's hog-nosed skunks; the rheas did not establish themselves, as their nests were raided by the foxes, but the skunks lasted until at least 1956.|$|R
2500|$|Based on {{artifacts}} {{found in}} the region, it appears that hunting of guanaco, and to a <b>lesser</b> extent <b>rhea</b> (ñandú), were the primary food sources of tribes living on the eastern plains [...] It is unclear whether the megafauna of Patagonia, including the ground sloth and horse, were extinct in the area {{before the arrival of}} humans, although this is now the more widely accepted account. It is also not clear if domestic dogs were part of early human activity. Bolas are commonly found and were used to catch guanaco and rhea. A maritime tradition existed along the Pacific coast; whose latest exponents were the Yámana to the south of Tierra del Fuego, the Kaweshqar between Taitao Peninsula and Tierra del Fuego and the Chono people in the Chonos Archipelago.|$|R
5000|$|The rheas [...] {{are large}} ratites (flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone) {{in the order}} Rheiformes, native to South America, related to the ostrich and emu. There were {{formerly}} two, but now three recognized extant species: the greater or American rhea (<b>Rhea</b> americana), the <b>lesser</b> or Darwin's <b>rhea</b> (Rhea pennata) and the puna rhea (Rhea tarapacensis). The greater and puna rheas are currently rated as near-threatened in their native ranges, while Darwin's rhea is of least concern; a feral population of the greater rhea in Germany appears to be growing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adults have}} an average weight of 20 - 27 kg and often measure 127 to 140 cm long from beak to tail; they usually stand about 1.5 m tall, with a typical range of 1.4 to 1.7 m, {{to the top of}} the head. The males are {{generally}} bigger than the females. Despite the delineation of this species as the [...] "greater rhea" [...] versus the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> some data on body masses indicates that both species average about 23 kg in weight, but even at mass parity that greater species appears larger and is taller due to its longer legs and neck, whereas the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> is more compact and more so resembles an outsized, long-necked turkey in build. [...] Elsewhere, the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> has been cited with a lower average weight of 16 kg. In some areas, male greater rheas weights of up to 35 kg are not uncommon and even females of up to 30 kg have been weighed, both weights higher than the maximum known mass for the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea.</b> Large males can weigh up to 40 kg, stand nearly 1.83 m tall and measure over 150 cm long, although this is uncommon.|$|E
50|$|The Darwin's rhea (Rhea pennata), {{also known}} as the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> is a large flightless bird, but the smaller of the two extant species of rheas. It is found in the Altiplano and Patagonia in South America.|$|E
50|$|The {{numbers of}} both the greater and puna rhea are {{decreasing}} as their habitats are shrinking. Both are considered near threatened by the IUCN. The IUCN also states that they are both approaching vulnerable status. The <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> is classified as least concern.|$|E
50|$|During the {{non-breeding season}} they may form flocks of between 20 and 25 birds, {{although}} the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> forms smaller flocks than this. When in danger they flee in a zig-zag course, using first one wing then the other, {{similar to a}} rudder. During breeding season the flocks break up.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> {{is mainly}} an herbivore, with the odd small animal (lizards, beetles, grasshoppers). It predominately eats saltbush and fruits from cacti, as well grasses. They {{tend to be}} quiet birds, except as chicks when they whistle mournfully, and as males looking for a female, when they emit a booming call.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the park}} is mostly low spiny shrubs adapted for living in arid environments; these include Caesalpinia gilliesii, Berberis microphylla, Arthrophyllum rigidum, Chiliotrichum diffusum, Mulinum spinosum and Fragaria chiloensis. The flightless <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> is known from the park and mammals present include the guanaco, the dwarf armadillo, the culpeo fox and the South American gray fox.|$|E
50|$|The Andean condor, {{the largest}} flying land-bird in the Western Hemisphere, occurs {{throughout}} much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Numerous other birds are found in open habitats of the Andes, including certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Andean goose, torrent duck, giant coot, flamingos, <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> Andean flicker, diademed sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the region}} is desert, and {{encompasses}} considerable mineral resources. Numerous flora and fauna species {{are found in the}} Atacama Region. One subspecies of the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> known by the scientific name Rhea pennata tarapacensis, is a notable large terrestrial bird in this region, which subspecies is considered endangered. The diminished numbers of this bird are due to prehistoric and modern hunting but more significantly due to agricultural land conversion in order to feed the expanding human population.|$|E
50|$|Rheas {{are from}} South America only and are limited within the {{continent}} to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. They are grassland birds and both species prefer open land. The greater rheas live in open grasslands, pampas, and chaco woodlands. They prefer to breed near water and prefer lowlands, seldom going above 1500 m. On the other hand, the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> will inhabit most shrubland, grassland, even desert salt puna up to 4500 m.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the harsh}} desert environment, {{a number of}} animals venture into {{and live in the}} Patagonian. Some only live on the more {{habitable}} and geographically-varied outskirts of the desert, where food is more abundant and the environment less hostile, but all are found within the region encompassing the Patagonian. The burrowing owl, <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> guanaco, tuco-tuco, mara, pygmy armadillo, Patagonian weasel, puma, Patagonian gray fox, desert iguana, western ribbon snake, and various species of eagle and hawk {{are a few of the}} variety of animals living in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Rheas are large, flightless {{birds with}} grey-brown plumage, long legs and long necks, similar to an ostrich. Large males of R. {{americana}} can reach 170 cm tall at the head, 100 cm {{at the back}} and can weigh up to 40 kg, [...] The <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> is somewhat smaller as they are only 90 cm tall at the back. Their wings are large for a flightless bird (250 cm) and are spread while running, to act like sails. Unlike most birds, rheas have only three toes. Their tarsus has 18 to 22 horizontal plates {{on the front of}} it. They also store urine separately in an expansion of the cloaca.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> {{stands at}} 90 to(-) 100 cm tall. Length is 92 to(-) 100 cm and weight is 15 to(-) 28.6 kg. Like most ratites, {{it has a}} small head and a small bill, the latter {{measuring}} 6.2 to 9.2 cm, but has long legs and a long neck. It has relatively larger wings than other ratites, enabling it to run particularly well. It can reach speeds of 60 km/h (37 mph), enabling it to outrun predators. The sharp claws on the toes are effective weapons. Their feathers {{are similar to those}} of ostriches, in that they have no aftershaft. Their plumage is spotted brown and white, and the upper part of their tarsus is feathered. The tarsus is 28 to 32 cm long and has 18 horizontal plates on the front.|$|E
50|$|The vicuña and guanaco can {{be found}} living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated llama and alpaca are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) chinchillas, two {{threatened}} members of the rodent order, inhabit the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean condor, the largest bird {{of its kind in}} the Western Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the huemul, cougar, foxes in the genus Pseudalopex, and, for birds, certain species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Andean goose, giant coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> Andean flicker, diademed sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches.|$|E
50|$|The fauna is {{characterized}} by the presence of species that have adapted to extreme living conditions in the region, some of them endangered. The reserve is home to 80 species of birds. Out of six flamingo species in the world, three species, namely the Chilean, Andean and James flamingos are found in very large numbers in the freshwater lakes and saltwater lagoons of the reserve; of the Phoenicopterus chilensis, Phoenicoparrus andinus and Phoenicoparrus jamesi flamingos in the reserve, their population recorded in 1994 as 26,600. In addition, the reserve is also the habitat for 80 more species of birds, which include the falcons, ducks, <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> (Pterocnemia pennata), puna tinamou (Tinamotis pentlandii) and Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera). Endemic birds found in this ecoregion also include the endangered Ash-breasted tit-tyrant (Anairetes alpinus); the critically threatened royal cinclodes (Cinclodes aricomae), the vulnerable Berlepsch’s canastero (Asthenes berlepschi); and species of least concern the line-fronted canastero (Asthenes urubambensis), scribble-tailed canastero (Asthenes maculicauda), short-tailed finch (Idiopsar bracyurus), and gray-bellied flower-piercer (Diglosa carbonaria).|$|E
5000|$|Novaro et al. (2000) {{assessed}} the potential ecological extinction of guanacos (Lama guanocoe) and lesser rheas (Pterocnemia pennata) as a prey source for native omnivores and predators in the Argentine Patagonia. These native species are {{being replaced by}} introduced species such as the European rabbit, red deer, and domestic cattle; the cumulative damage from the increased herbivory by introduced species has also served to accelerate destruction of the already dwindling Argentine pampas and steppe habitats. This was the first study {{to take into account}} a large number of diverse predators, ranging from skunks to pumas, as well as conduct their survey in non-protected areas that represent the majority of southern South America. Novaro and his colleagues found that the entire assemblage of native carnivores relied primarily on introduced species as a prey base. They also suggested that the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> and guanaco had already passed their ecological effective density as a prey species, and thus were ecological extinct. It is possible that the niches of introduced species as herbivores too closely mirrored those of the natives, and thus competition was the primary cause of ecological extinction. The effect of introduction of new competitors, such as the red deer and rabbit, also served to alter the vegetation in the habitat, which could have further pronounced the intensity of competition. Guanacos and rheas have been classified as a low risk for global extinction, but this simplistic view of their demography doesn’t take into account that they have already become functionally extinct in the Argentine Patagonia. Novaro and his colleagues suggest [...] "this loss could have strong effects on plant-animal interactions, nutrient dynamics, and disturbance regimes ..." [...] This {{is a prime example of}} how current conservation policy has already failed to protect the intended species because of its lack of a functionally sound definition for extinction.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Lesser</b> <b>Rhea</b> (Rhea pennata pennata) has {{suffered}} a marked decline in numbers over recent decades, probably mainly {{as a result of}} livestock production and overhunting. Our aim was to investigate the factors that determine the distribution of Lesser Rheas in southern Patagonia and to generate a predictive regional distribution map. We surveyed 8000 km of roads and sighted 795 <b>Lesser</b> <b>Rhea</b> individuals or ﬂocks. We also estimated environmental predictors from remotely sensed data and analysed the occurrence of Lesser Rheas in relation to these predictors. The predictors we examined were associated with four hypotheses explaining the distribution of Lesser Rheas: the persecution by ranchers, primary productivity, topography, and anthropogenic disturbance hypotheses. We built models for each hypothesis. Our results suggest that the distribution of Lesser Rheas is not negatively affected by persecution by ranchers, as the species is more abundant in areas with high stocking levels of sheep, but is positively inﬂuenced by primary productivity and negatively by the proximity of human habitation. The resulting distribution map {{can be used as a}} management tool for government agencies and highlights the conservation priorities for managing this declining and emblematic species.

40|$|Palaeognathous birds (Struthioniformes and Tinamiformes) have morphologically conserved karyotypes {{and less}} {{differentiated}} ZW sex chromosomes. To delineate interspecific chromosome orthologies in palaeognathous birds we conducted comparative chromosome painting with chicken (Gallus gallus, GGA) chromosome 1 - 9 and Z chromosome paints (GGA 1 - 9 and GGAZ) for emu, double-wattled cassowary, ostrich, greater rhea, <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> and elegant crested tinamou. All six species showed the same painting patterns: each probe was hybridized {{to a single}} pair of chromosomes with the exception that the GGA 4 was hybridized to the fourth largest chromosome and {{a single pair of}} microchromosomes. The GGAZ was also hybridized to the entire region of the W chromosome, indicating that extensive homology remains between the Z and W chromosomes on the molecular level. Comparative FISH mapping of four Z- and/or W-linked markers, the ACO 1 /IREBP, ZOV 3 and CHD 1 genes and the EE 0. 6 sequence, revealed the presence of a small deletion in the proximal region of the long arm of the W chromosome in greater rhea and <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea.</b> These results suggest that the karyotypes and sex chromosomes of palaeognathous birds are highly conserved not only morphologically, but also at the molecular level; moreover, palaeognathous birds appear to retain the ancestral lineage of avian karyotypes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{a private}} {{wildlife}} research facility and rhea farm of Argentina, artificially incubated eggs of putative hybrid origin between the Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) and the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Rhea</b> (Rhea pennata) hatched and {{gave birth to}} healthy chicks. Molecular genotyping by the analysis of mitochondrial Cytochrome b (Cyt b) and nuclear Chromo- Helicase DNA binding (CHD 1) gene sequences confirmed the hybrid origin of these chicks which were molecularly sexed as females. The possibility of hybridisation argues for careful management of captive populations of these species, especially if individuals are {{to be released in}} the wild for conservation purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} subspecies of the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> {{is distributed}} through the Argentine Patagonia and southern Chile. Habitat-loss and poaching {{were identified as}} the main threats to <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea</b> populations by the IUCN, which classified the species as ‘Least concern’ in 2014. Although Rhea pennata pennata {{is among the most}} conspicuous wildlife across the large Patagonian rangelands, the available estimates of abundance are scarce, mostly restricted to reports between 12 and 30 years old, and resulted from different surveying methods. Our purpose in this work was to obtain estimates of R. p. pennata abundance across different sites in the Argentine Patagonia, and to explore the main factors affecting the spatial variation in abundance. We surveyed over 4, 000 km of line transects across six sites and obtained abundance estimates using the Distance sampling analysis. Also, we fitted restricted mixed models to evaluate the effects of different factors on the variation in R. p. pennata encounter rates among sites. We found that the abundance of R. p. pennata was very low either in the encounter rate (taking until 113 km of survey to detect a group of rheas depending on the site) or population density (between 0. 0063 and 0. 28 individuals. km- 2). The occurrence of sheep ranching affected negatively the variation in the abundance of R. p. pennata among sites, whereas the availability of grassland habitat increased the chance of finding groups during the surveys. Line-transect surveys following the Distance sampling procedures are adequate to estimate encounter rates, although the low number of observations requires repeated surveys per site to obtain reliable estimates of animal density. Extended and sustained survey efforts and the implementation of a monitoring program are crucial to assess population trends of lesser rheas. Law enforcement to control poaching, increase in public awareness and an action plan to reduce threats are all necessary steps to conserve this emblematic species in Patagonia...|$|E
40|$|The ratites have stimulated {{much debate}} {{as to how}} such large flightless birds came to be {{distributed}} across the southern continents, and whether they are a monophyletic group or are composed of unrelated lineages that independently lost the power of flight. Hypotheses regarding the relationships among taxa differ for morphological and molecular data sets, thus hindering attempts to test whether plate tectonic events can explain ratite biogeography. Here, we present the complete mitochondrial DNA genomes of two extinct moas from New Zealand, {{along with those of}} five extant ratites (the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> the ostrich, the great spotted kiwi, the emu and the southern cassowary and two tinamous from different genera. The non-stationary base composition in these sequences violates the assumptions of most tree-building methods. When this bias is corrected using neighbour-joining with log-determinant distances and non-homogeneous maximum likelihood, the ratites are found to be monophlyletic, with moas basal, as in morphological trees. The avian sequences also violate a molecular clock, so we applied a non-parametric rate smoothing algorithm, which minimizes ancestor-descendant local rate changes, to date nodes in the tree. Using this method, most of the major ratite lineages fit the vicariance biogeography hypothesis, the exceptions being the ostrich and the kiwi, which require dispersal to explain their present distribution...|$|E
40|$|Large landscapes {{encompassing}} {{reserves and}} areas with other human uses {{are necessary for}} conservation of many species. Generating information for conservation planning over such landscapes may be expensive and time-consuming, though resources for conservation are generally limited and conservation is often urgent. We developed a sign-based occupancy survey to help prioritize conservation interventions by simultaneously assessing the distribution of 3 species, the <b>lesser</b> <b>rhea,</b> guanaco, and mara, and their association with human activities in a 20, 000 -km 2 landscape in the northern Patagonian steppe. We used a single-season occupancy model with spatial rather than temporal replication of surveys {{in order to reduce}} costs of multiple visits to sites. We used covariates related to detectability, environmental factors, and different human activities to identify the most plausible models of occupancy, and calculated importance weights of covariates from these models to evaluate relative impacts of human activities on each species. Abundance of goats had the strongest negative association with lesser rheas and guanacos, and road density with maras. With six months of fieldwork, our results provided initial hypotheses for adaptive conservation interventions for each species. Addressing high livestock densities for rheas and guanacos, poaching by urban hunters for all three species, and hunting by rural people for rheas are priorities for conservation in this landscape. Our methodology provided new insights into the responses of these species, although low detection probabilities for maras indicate that the sampling scheme should be altered for future monitoring of this species. This method may be adapted for any large landscape where a rapid, objective means for prioritizing conservation actions on multiple species is needed and data are scarce...|$|E
