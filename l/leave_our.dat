25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

500|$|As the {{government}} became increasingly harsh in its response to growing protests, the resistance shifted from being completely non-violent towards armed action. Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders founded the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a militant {{wing of the}} ANC, which began a campaign of sabotage. During this period, music was {{often referred to as}} a [...] "weapon of struggle." [...] Among MK members in training camps, a song called [...] "Sobashiy'abazali" [...] ("We Will <b>Leave</b> <b>Our</b> Parents") became very popular, invoking as it did the pain of leaving their homes. The Toyi-toyi chant also became popular during this period, and was frequently used to generate a sense of power among large groups to intimidate government troops.|$|E
500|$|The murder attempt {{received}} worldwide {{media coverage}} and produced {{an outpouring of}} sympathy and anger. Protests against the shooting were held in several Pakistani cities {{the day after the}} attack, and over 2 million people signed the Right to Education campaign's petition, which led to ratification of the first Right to Education Bill in Pakistan. Pakistani officials offered a 10 million rupee (US$105,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers. Responding to concerns about his safety, Yousafzai's father said, [...] "We wouldn't <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> country if my daughter survives or not. We have an ideology that advocates peace. The Taliban cannot stop all independent voices through the force of bullets." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the video, Beyoncé said: [...] "We all see the {{headlines}} and we think what can I really do to help?... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity {{for all of us to}} work together to make a difference. This is our time to <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> mark on the world and show that we were here and we care." [...] During another interview posted on the UN website, Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition: [...] "I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [...] I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else". Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her... We must kill [...] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E
500|$|From June to August 2003, {{the group}} {{was part of the}} Warped Tour. Reyes {{contacted}} his friend, Breaking Pangaea frontman Fred Mascherino, who auditioned for Nolan's place; on August 5, it was announced that Mascherino {{was a member of the}} band. Bassist Matt Rubano, who grew up with O'Connell, then joined the group. Rubano was asked to audition by O'Connell but was initially hesitant, since he was not a fan of emo music or aware of the band; however, he bought the album and learned Cooper's parts. On September 16, [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was released as a radio single. From September to November Taking Back Sunday co-headlined a tour with Saves the Day, supported by Moneen. In November, a music video for [...] "You're So Last Summer" [...] was filmed at Fulton State Park in New York. The video, directed by Winters, debuted on MTV on November 24. In the video, the band plays while Public Enemy vocalist Flavor Flav (in full regalia) jumps. According to Lazzara, {{the group was}} making fun of itself: [...] "We had two guys <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> band and there were two main singers, so we were trying to think of a way to bring the new band members into the video, but not have Fred singing the old guy’s part. And the funniest way to do that was to use Flavor Flav." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, Stewart made {{an impassioned}} plea in Congressional hearings, along with, among many others, Burt Lancaster, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, and film {{director}} Martin Scorsese, against Ted Turner's decision to 'colorize' classic {{black and white}} films, including It's a Wonderful Life. Stewart stated, [...] "the coloring of black-and-white films is wrong. It's morally and artistically wrong and these profiteers should <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> film industry alone".|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{one of his}} poems, [...] "Passers Between the Passing Words," [...] {{was cited}} in the Knesset by Yitzhak Shamir. Darwish was accused of {{demanding}} that the Jews leave Israel, although he claimed he meant the West Bank and Gaza: [...] "So <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> land/Our shore, our sea/Our wheat, our salt, our wound." [...] Adel Usta, a specialist on Darwish's poetry, said the poem was misunderstood and mistranslated. Poet and translator Ammiel Alcalay wrote that [...] "the hysterical overreaction to the poem simply serves as a remarkably accurate litmus test of the Israeli psyche ... (the poem) is an adamant refusal to accept {{the language of the}} occupation and the terms under which the land is defined".|$|E
2500|$|Just after 3pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, {{police were}} called to North Cronulla Beach {{following}} a report of an assault on two off-duty surf lifesavers by four {{members of a group}} of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now fuck off and <b>leave</b> <b>our</b> beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I come down here out of my own spare time to save you dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E

People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity[...] It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love."
