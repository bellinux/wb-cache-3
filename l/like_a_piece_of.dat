Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil {{can be found in}} some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E
25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E

All public transit buses in Chicago and suburbs allow up to two bikes at all times. The same is true of Grand River Transit buses in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Trains allow bikes with some restrictions. Where such services are not available, some cyclists get around this restriction by removing their pedals and loosening their handlebars as to fit into a box or by using folding bikes that can be brought onto the train or bus <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> luggage.

Muhney did not know the rationale for killing the character, but when he found out, he stated that [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> me was dying as well." [...] He also stated that he was also heartbroken because he had grown attached to the character over the course of three years playing him.

It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.|$|E
500|$|No further {{mention of}} William is made until the Siege of Antioch in 1098. The crusaders had {{successfully}} taken the city, but were then besieged themselves {{by a large}} Muslim army led by Kerbogha of Mosul. The crusaders suffered from lack of supplies, {{and there were many}} desertions; William fled Antioch in January 1098, along with the French monk Peter the Hermit, who had led his own army to Constantinople before the main crusaders arrived there. William was probably a member of Bohemond of Taranto's army at this point, because Bohemond sent his nephew Tancred to find them, and they were brought back to Bohemond's camp. Robert the Monk assumes that William fled because [...] "he had never before experienced such suffering from hunger." [...] William [...] "spent the whole of the night...in Bohemond's tent, lying on the ground <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> rubbish." [...] Bohemond rebuked him as a [...] "wretched disgrace to the whole Frankish army", and mentioned his desertion of the French army in Spain in 1087. The other leaders asked Bohemond to spare him and William suffered no further punishment. However, William was so ashamed that he deserted the army again.|$|E
500|$|International {{productions}} {{have opened}} to similarly ambivalent critical reception. The West End production opened to {{a slightly more}} upbeat response. The majority of critics have appreciated the spectacle of the lavish production, and the [...] "powerhouse" [...] performances of actors in {{the roles of the}} two witches. However, contemporaries have characterized the production as overblown, occasionally preachy, and suffering from more hype than heart. Although Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "at times ... a bit of a mess," [...] he praised Holzman's script, described Kenneth Posner's lighting design as [...] "magical" [...] and lauded Menzel's Elphaba and Helen Dallimore's Glinda. Michael Billington of The Guardian gave it three out of five stars and remarked on the competence of all the lead actors; however, he complained that Wicked was [...] "all too typical of the modern Broadway musical: efficient, knowing and highly professional but more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind". Paul Taylor of The Independent gave extremely negative remarks to his viewing of the London production, calling the attempt at topical political allegory [...] "well-meaning but also melodramatic, incoherent and dreadfully superficial" [...] while deploring the acting, songs and book, concluding that [...] "the production manages to feel at once overblown and empty." ...|$|E
