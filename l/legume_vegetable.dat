30|$|The {{findings}} {{established the}} potentiality of earthworm for quality vermicompost production from vegetable wastes. However, sole cow dung culture has emerged highly suitable substrate for vermicomposting considering earthworm biomass and cast recovery. Keeping {{in mind the}} decreasing livestock population and the scarcity of cow dung, vegetable waste {{can act as a}} potential substitute for cow dung where cow dung {{can be used as a}} starter material rather than sole growth medium. In organic vegetable cultivation, the emerging challenge is to supply the major nutrients through organic sources. The study demonstrated that by predetermined selection and judicious mixture of different vegetable wastes, the cast quality can be improved.
