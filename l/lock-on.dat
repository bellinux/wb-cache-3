5|$|According to Roger Hector, vice {{president}} and general manager of Sega Technical Institute, the <b>lock-on</b> technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of Sonic & Knuckles, between the releases of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Early development screenshots suggest Knuckles was planned to be playable in the first Sonic the Hedgehog via Sonic & Knuckles <b>lock-on</b> technology, but this feature was removed prior to release.|$|E
5|$|Sonic & Knuckles was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. Critics were impressed with the <b>lock-on</b> technology, though some made note of its similarity to its predecessor. It has since been re-released in various compilations and on digital platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade, Virtual Console, and Steam.|$|E
5|$|Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! is a {{spin-off}} of {{the original}} ToeJam & Earl where the player (as ToeJam) fires tomatoes at ToeJam & Earl series enemies for points as the screen scrolls. The scroll speed increases with game duration. The enemies—dentists, devils, and cupids—return fire throughout the ten levels. The game also features power-ups and <b>lock-on</b> targeting, to aid in player accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|Releasing Button 2 {{when any}} number of <b>lock-ons</b> are active deploys a number of homing lasers equal {{to the number of}} active <b>lock-ons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United States <b>lock-ons</b> {{are often}} {{referred}} to as lockdowns.|$|R
50|$|Faster {{and more}} {{accurate}} GPS <b>lock-ons</b> for {{applications such as}} Google Maps, geotagging for photographs, and various other GPS functions.|$|R
5|$|Echoes also {{features}} a multiplayer mode that allows up to four players to engage in combat using a split screen. It has six arenas and two modes: Deathmatch, in which players attempt to kill their opponents {{as many times as}} possible within a set amount of time; and Bounty, which focuses on collecting coins that injured characters drop. Multiplayer in Echoes features the same control scheme as the single-player mode, including the <b>lock-on</b> system for circle strafing while targeting.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a full, {{360-degree}} field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, {{and behind the}} dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the <b>lock-on</b> laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. IVA was {{modified}} into its improved Mk. V, the Mk. VI followed suit. But by early 1941 {{it was decided}} to make the Mk. VI an entirely new design, to more easily fit in small aircraft. EMI had already been awarded a contract for a dozen prototype units in October 1940 for delivery in February, but these continued changes made this impossible. Nevertheless, they presented a production contract for 1,500 units in December. Between December and March, production examples began arriving and displayed an enormous number of problems, which the engineers worked through one-by one. By July the systems were ready for use, and began being installed in the new Defiant Mk. II early in August, but these demonstrated a problem where the system would <b>lock-on</b> to transmissions from other AI aircraft in the area, which resulted in further modifications. It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the ship}} {{reaches the maximum}} number of allotted <b>lock-ons</b> (16 to start, but more after being powered up/entering Break or Double Break mode), a chime plays and the blue lines {{connecting}} the craft to its targets turns red.|$|R
5000|$|WR-02 - a ship {{resembling}} the R-Gray 2 from RayStorm. Uses a narrow-angled focused laser for its main gun {{and it has}} a max capacity of 16 <b>lock-ons</b> available to the player and uses a weapon called the [...] "thunder laser".|$|R
50|$|Warhawk is {{a vehicle}} {{simulation}} game {{built around a}} futuristic VTOL craft. The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through six levels. Weapons include fire-off <b>lock-ons,</b> rockets, multi-fire swarmers, and plasma cannons. The game has no multiplayer capabilities and does not feature DualShock or analog controller support.|$|R
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may <b>lock-on</b> after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5|$|Frog Fractions {{begins with}} a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player {{controls}} the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including <b>lock-on</b> targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, they can buy a warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for president in a music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes. The game takes about one hour to complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had {{transformed}} into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter , Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as if for the PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previous experimented with shooters with , but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the <b>lock-on</b> mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality. Nomura {{was among the first to}} suggest this feature originally.|$|E
5000|$|Lockdowns and <b>lock-ons</b> {{are a way}} to stop {{movement}} of an object, like a structure or tree and to thwart {{movement of}} actual protesters from the location. Users employ various chains, locks and even the sleeping dragon for impairment of those trying to remove them with a matrix of composted materials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lock-ons</b> were a {{particularly}} common technique, where a protester chained {{themselves to a}} solid object. Initially Kryptonite lock bike locks were used, and this developed into a range of more ingenious techniques, such as drain pipes in blocks of concrete. Camps were often in treetops or had tunnels, making arrest particularly difficult.|$|R
50|$|The Garda {{operation}} {{succeeded in}} {{its goal of}} breaking the blockades preventing work on the refinery site at Bellanaboy. Work there has continued (with brief pauses occasioned by site occupations and <b>lock-ons)</b> since. At times, hundreds of Gardaí have been deployed to facilitate the project. There have been many reports of intimidation of local people by Gardaí and Shell security. Allegations of intimidation by Shell to Sea supporters of Shell workers have also been made.|$|R
25|$|By the mid-1980s, Swedish Viggen fighter pilots, {{using the}} {{predictable}} patterns of Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird routine flights over the Baltic Sea, {{had managed to}} achieve missile <b>lock-on</b> with radar on the SR-71 on numerous occasions. Despite heavy jamming from the SR-71, target illumination was maintained by feeding target location from ground-based radars to the fire-control computer in the Viggen. The most common site for the <b>lock-on</b> to occur was the thin stretch of international airspace between Öland and Gotland that the SR-71 used on the return flight. The Viggen is the only aircraft to get an acknowledged radar lock on the SR-71.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as {{projectiles}} such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a <b>lock-on</b> system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the <b>lock-on</b> system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting reticule can be moved around the locked on target, allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight.|$|E
25|$|Sin and Punishment is an arcade-style rail shooter and {{shooting}} gallery video game. The player character is controlled from a behind-the-back perspective, and can strafe left and right, double-jump, and perform a roll dodge. The character progresses forward through the level automatically {{due to the}} rail shooter format which drew comparisons from critics to the Panzer Dragoon series, Star Fox series, and Space Harrier. A targeting reticle is used to aim shots on enemies and projectiles and has two modes that the player can freely alternate between, a <b>lock-on</b> mode and a free aiming mode. The <b>lock-on</b> mode will auto-lock onto visible targets, and the player can quickly move the reticle between targets. Alternatively, the free aiming mode gives the player full control of the reticle and a more powerful shot. The player character is also armed with a sword {{which can be used}} to damage or destroy nearby enemies, and redirect projectiles back at the enemies. The character can be controlled by a single player, or cooperatively between two players. In cooperative mode, one player controls the movement while the other is responsible for firing duties.|$|E
50|$|The F-104s were {{initially}} involved in escort missions {{in support of}} Republic F-105D Thunderchief strike aircraft hitting targets in North Vietnam. They were also involved in escorts of EF-105F Wild Weasel. One of the problems was that the F-104Cs were not initially equipped with electronic countermeasures (ECM) gear, and {{had to rely on}} F-105s for warnings of <b>lock-ons</b> from enemy radar facilities. However, the mere presence of these F-104Cs managed to keep enemy MiGs away from the strike packages.|$|R
40|$|Disobedient Objects {{is about}} out-designing authority. It explores the {{material}} culture of radical change and protest - from objects familiar to many, such as banners or posters, {{to the more}} militant, cunning or technologically cutting-edge, including <b>lock-ons,</b> book-blocs and activist robots. Where previous social movement histories have focused on large-scale events, strategies or biographies, this book - and the exhibition it accompanies - shows how objects themselves can be revolutionary. Focusing on social movements since 1980, the book features an introductory essay by the curators examining the history of objects in protest and activism, followed by six essays that look at particular objects, and the contexts {{in which they are}} used. Interspersed throughout are images of the objects at work, along with a selection of how-tos covering specific objects from a design perspective. This is a manifesto for experimental alternative design, showing how objects can define encounters and inspire activists. Accompanies the V&A exhibition Disobedient Objects, 26 July 2014 to 1 February 201...|$|R
500|$|These {{missions}} {{met with}} interference by the Soviets, {{in violation of}} the 1972 Incident at Sea agreement, and included false flag and fake light signals, sending an armed boarding party to threaten to board a U.S.-chartered Japanese auxiliary vessel (blocked by U.S. warship interposition), interfering with a helicopter coming off the USS Elliot (Sept. 7), attempted ramming of rigs used by the South Koreans in their quadrant search, hazardous maneuvering of the Gavril Sarychev and near-collision with the [...] (September 15, 18), removing U.S. sonars, setting false pingers in deep international waters, sending Backfire bombers armed with air-to-surface nuclear-armed missiles to threaten U.S. naval units, criss-crossing in front of U.S. combatant vessels (October 26), cutting and attempted cutting of moorings of Japanese auxiliary vessels, particularly the Kaiko Maru III, and radar <b>lock-ons</b> by a Soviet , the Petropavlovsk, and a , the Odarennyy, targeting U.S. naval ships and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Munro. , escorting , experienced all of the above interference and was involved in a near-collision with the Odarennyy (September 23–27).|$|R
25|$|The {{system was}} {{basically}} functional by {{the autumn of}} 1941, using the electronics from the Mk. VII and a new 50kW magnetron to produce the AI Mk. IX. This offered initial detection at ten miles, <b>lock-on</b> at five, {{and was able to}} track relative movements of up to 10 degrees per second, as well as angular accelerations of 10 deg/s2. In spite of this promising development, on 1 January 1942 Lovell was sent to work on the H2S system. The Mk. IX was then put under the direction of Arthur Ernest Downing, with the team still predicting it would be available in 1942.|$|E
25|$|The Mk. VIII {{spawned a}} number of variants, notably the AI Mk. IX which {{included}} a <b>lock-on</b> feature to ease interceptions. A series of events, including a deadly friendly fire incident, so greatly delayed the Mk. IX that it never entered service. During the late-war period, many UK aircraft adopted the US SCR-720 under the name AI Mk. X. This worked along the same general principles as the Mk. VIII, but used a different display system that offered several advantages. Development of the basic system continued, and the Mk. IX would eventually briefly re-appear in greatly advanced form as the AI.17 during the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|These {{limitations}} {{were made}} clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success {{rates on the}} order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was {{due to the fact that}} pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker might see the target's engine and send the growling signal that indicated <b>lock-on,</b> but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 September 2013, {{an empty}} F-16 jet tested by Boeing and US Air Force, two US Air Force pilots {{controlled}} the plane {{from the ground}} as it flew from Tyndall Air Force Base, Panama City, Florida. Boeing suggested that the innovation could ultimately {{be used to help}} train pilots, providing an adversary they could practice firing on. The jet - which had previously sat mothballed at an Arizona site for 15 years - flew at an altitude of 40,000 ft (12.2 km) and a speed of Mach 1.47 (1,119 mph/1,800 km/h). It carried out a series of maneuvers including a barrel roll and a [...] "split S" [...] - a move in which the aircraft turns upside down before making a half loop so that it flies the right-way-up in the opposite direction. This can be used in combat to evade missile <b>lock-ons.</b> The firm added that the flight attained 7 g of acceleration but was capable of carrying out maneuvers at 9 g - something that might cause physical problems for a pilot. Boeing was awarded the contract on 10 October 2013 for low-rate initial production (LRIP) Lot 1 of 13 QF-16s. A second award on 20 May 2014 covered production Lot 2, comprising a further 23 QF-16s. On 27 March 2015, Boeing received a US$24.46 million contract for 25 Lot 3 QF-16s and 25 four-year warranties of the QF-16 drone-peculiar equipment. The first production Lot 1 FSAT, QF-16C, 86-0233, 'QF-007', was delivered on 11 March 2015 to Tyndall Air Force Base. It was previously operated by the Michigan Air National Guard's 107th Fighter Squadron, 127th Wing and then stored at the 309th AMARG before being moved to Cecil Field in April 2013 for QF-16 configuring.|$|R
25|$|The game's combat had a generally-positive reception. Bloodworth found Geralt {{more mobile}} and agile {{with the new}} {{climbing}} and swimming mechanic. Carter {{said that it was}} significantly streamlined and its predecessors' strategic elements removed, but appreciated its action. Wallace wrote that with a simplified alchemy system, a decent user interface and diverse difficulty settings the combat was more accessible, although she disliked the disruptive weapon-degradation system and unrefined crossbow shooting mechanic. Leack thought the system lacked complexity and criticised its lack of polish, caused by the unreliable <b>lock-on</b> system, camera issues and excessively-long combat animation. Senior noted that some gameplay mechanics, such as rolling and dodging, were inconsistent and made the system feel unfair. Ingenito praised the combat, describing its fluidity as a significant improvement over its predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles {{debuted in}} the 1994 Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Knuckles joins the series' primary {{antagonist}} Dr. Robotnik after being tricked {{into thinking that}} Sonic is attempting to steal the Master Emerald; Knuckles fights Sonic at several points throughout the game. Robotnik's dishonesty is revealed late in Sonic & Knuckles when he steals the Master Emerald and attacks Knuckles. A similar plot follows in Sonic Triple Trouble. While Knuckles's canonical playable debut comes in Sonic & Knuckles, he is playable in Sonic 2 and 3 via the Genesis' <b>lock-on</b> technology. Knuckles starred in Knuckles' Chaotix for the Sega 32X, in which he serves as the guardian of an island amusement park and rescues his friends—collectively known as the Chaotix—from Robotnik in 1995. He teams up with them individually, creating an unusual gameplay style involving two characters being tethered together.|$|E
25|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Daniel Lamb in third-person {{perspective}} while at some points they instead control the villain Leo Kasper. Although different in appearance and personality, both have similar controls. As with the original game, the primary gameplay mechanic is stealth execution, whereby the player character must approach an enemy from behind, undetected, and kill them. There are three 'levels' of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last; Level 1 (Hasty) executions are quick and not very bloody, Level 2 (Violent) are considerably more gory, and Level 3 (Gruesome) are over-the-top. The player is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the <b>lock-on</b> reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). When playing on PC or Wii while doing the executions, there is a quick time event in which lists down certain moves that either the mouse or Wii Controller must move or by pressing a certain button at a specific time in order to finish the execution. If it does not finish in the specific time, it will stop the execution and skip the execution completely, although the player still kills the person.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} <b>lock-on</b> {{technology}} the game offered. Lucas Thomas of IGN {{said it was}} [...] "a great game on its own", but the <b>lock-on</b> feature completely revamped the overall experience. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer preferred Sonic & Knuckles to Sonic 3, stating {{that he could not}} fully appreciate its predecessor without its [...] "companion piece". Sega Powers review praised the game's harder difficulty in comparison to its predecessor and the new expansion of levels, admitting that the expansion {{would not have been possible}} had Sonic 3 been a single game. Sega Magazines review similarly praised the <b>lock-on</b> technology and the new innovation the unique cartridge offered, adding that Sonic & Knuckles hidden stages and bosses would strongly add to the replay value of the combined title.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the Virtual Console release, Nintendo Life writer James Newton praised {{its support}} for the old <b>lock-on</b> feature of the {{original}} release, claiming that the game does not truly shine without having purchased Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 to activate this feature. Thomas praised the game for [...] "impressive visuals that pushed the Genesis to its limits" [...] and for the value added in the content unlocked with the <b>lock-on</b> technology.|$|E
500|$|Sonic Jam, in {{addition}} to featuring the original release, included some new [...] "remix" [...] options to modify the game: [...] "Normal" [...] mode alters the layout of rings and hazards and [...] "Easy" [...] mode removes certain acts entirely from the game. The version in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection does not retain the <b>lock-on</b> feature included in other versions of the game, because of [...] "tight development times".|$|E
500|$|Comments about Renegade Squadron's {{controls}} were mostly negative, {{and they were}} typically described as clumsy or sluggish. GameZone referred to the space dogfights as [...] "unplayable" [...] and [...] Eurogamer called the <b>lock-on</b> feature [...] "a waste of time". One reviewer complained about the PSP's lack of a second analog nub. [...] Despite the criticism, a few reviewers were more favorable towards the controls, with GameSpot noting that they were an improvement over Battlefront II.|$|E
500|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{intended}} to be a single game, but were released separately due to time and financial constraints. The Sonic & Knuckles cartridge features a [...] "lock-on" [...] adapter that allows it to be physically attached to other Genesis cartridges. Connecting the Sonic 3 cartridge creates a combined game, Sonic 3 & Knuckles. The <b>lock-on</b> function is available in some digital releases of the games, such as the Virtual Console service for the Wii.|$|E
