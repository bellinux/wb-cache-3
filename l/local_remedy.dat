The Alchornea castaneifolia plant commonly is used with other plants during shamanistic training and, sometimes is an ingredient in ayahuasca (a hallucinogenic, multi-herb decoction used by South American shamans). Throughout the Amazon the bark or leaves of iporuro are tinctured (generally with the local rum, called aguardiente) as a <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> for rheumatism, arthritis, colds, and muscle pains. Iporuro (Alchornea castaneifolia) is well known to {{the indigenous}} peoples of Peru for relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and in aiding flexibility and range of motion. The Candochi-Shapra and the Shipibo Indian tribes use both the bark and roots of iporuro for rheumatism. To prevent diarrhea, members of the Tikuna tribe take one tablespoon of Alchornea castaneifolia bark decoction before meals. The pain-relieving properties of iporuru appear in topical treatments. Crushed leaves are rubbed on painful joints and are beaten into a paste to apply to painful stingray wounds.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{example of}} ISDS, {{which has been}} in {{existence}} for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international arbitral tribunal. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> rule, investors are not required to exhaust <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of <b>local</b> <b>remedies.</b> On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust <b>local</b> <b>remedies,</b> where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I closely scrutinize the legal {{relationships}} between investment arbitration and <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> {{procedures in the}} global "network" of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and free trade agreements (FTAs) /economic partnership agreements (EPAs), examining the desirable {{ways in which the}} two relationships should be regulated. When investors refer disputes to investment arbitration (procedures for international arbitration between investors and states) they are not required to exhaust local remedies, {{but on the other hand}} investment treaties contain certain restrictions on the simultaneous use of <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> procedures and investment arbitration. The extent to which investors are permitted procedural choices is a factor that determines whether foreign investment protection is effective, and with regard to cases of investment arbitration in recent years, the issue of whether "parallel proceedings" at both the domestic and international level by investors (and their subsidiaries) are allowed has been an important point of contention at the jurisdiction phase. An exhaustive study of the provisions of model BITs and of BITs/FTAs (EPAs) that have actually been concluded shows that, from the perspective of the relationship between investment arbitration and <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> procedures, arbitration clauses can be placed in five categories: (1) those that have no stipulations on this matter ("no reference" type), (2) those that offer a choice between the two ("fork in the road" type), (3) those that require investors to waive local remedies, in order to submit their claims to international arbitration ("no U turn" type), (4) those that permit parallel proceedings ("parallel proceedings" type), and (5) those that give priority to <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> procedures ("local remedy first" type). Under the "no reference" type and "parallel proceedings" type provisions, there are no restrictions as regards pursuing parallel proceedings. Also the procedural options for investors are quite broad under the "fork in the road" and "local remedy first" clauses, since, if the causes of action or the disputing parties are different at the domestic level and at the international level, the dispute at the former are distinguished from the disputes at the latter, and parallel proceedings are permitted. Under these provisions it is permissible for multiple parallel proceedings to be carried on simultaneously with regard to a series of situations relating to one particular foreign investment, raising the risk that investors may reap the "double benefit. " On the other hand, since no parallel proceedings whatever are allowed under the "no U-turn" clauses, there is no risk of double relief, but that also means that when investors file for international arbitration they have to waive all methods of obtaining local remedies, thereby severely limiting the procedural choices open to investors. However, if "no U-turn" clauses enable not only claims based on treaties, but also those based on investment agreements and/or investment authorizations, to be referred to international arbitration, they provide foreign investors with appropriate and fair protection, at the same time removing the legal uncertainty associated with parallel proceedings. Study should be pursued on the inclusion of arbitration provisions of this kind in EPAs and BITs concluded by Japan in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (International Law) This {{thesis is}} based on the {{jurisprudence}} of the International Court of Justice viz a viz the South African law and practices as it relates to diplomatic protection of nationals or corporate entities who encounter problem with the law in a foreign country. How the concept of diplomatic protection has assisted individuals and corporate entities who wish to go to a foreign country for whatever reason to feel free and relaxed knowing that their lives and property are protected. The expose examines the rights of individuals to diplomatic protection in international law in comparison with the rights of nationals to request for diplomatic protection in South Africa. The questions posed are; what is the liability of the state to its nationals, what level of responsibility is to be exhibited by the state when providing diplomatic protection and do such nationals have a right to demand to be protected in international law and or municipal law. Chapter one will examine the growth and historical development of diplomatic protection and the position as it is today. Chapter two will deal with nationality issues, this is because to determine who will be the beneficiary of diplomatic protection nationality must first be determined. The issues to be discussed in this chapter are: acquisition of nationality, double or multiple nationalities, continuity of nationality, loss of nationality, nationality of a Corporation and its shareholders, stateless persons and refugees, and the right to diplomatic protection. In answering the question of state responsibility, chapter three will examine the <b>local</b> <b>remedy</b> rules. This is because local remedies will have to be exhausted before the state can intervene.

40|$|The {{shaping of}} a modern {{intellectual}} property (IP) legal regime {{has been driven by}} the forces of globalisation and the respective regional conditions; nonetheless, the commands of globalisation have often conflicted with the requests from regional individualities. Bearing in mind the conflict of a global standard and a <b>local</b> <b>remedy,</b> this thesis uses Taiwan as an example for answering the following questions: 1. 	How does a country cope with international and national pressures in terms of IP rights and legal enforcement with particular regard to the establishment of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court? 2. 	What impact does the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court have upon specific categories of IP litigations, legal practices and legal professions? 3. 	What impact has the establishment of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court had in theory and in practice? The Taiwan Intellectual Property Court was inaugurated, on 1 July 2008, to face the international political and economic pressures, as well as the domestic needs of intellectual property (IP) litigation reforms. The aim of this research is to understand the theory and the practice of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court. To carry out this research, documentary evidence will be applied using a systematic approach to understand the theoretical framework and background of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court, and the gap between the theory and the actual practices will be analysed through the use of qualitative interviews with a number of the major players in IP litigations, including: the lawyers, the specialised judges and the technical examination officers. This first chapter of thesis will begin with an introduction which will provide an overview of this research. The second chapter will offer a global perspective of the different IP courts in the world, in order to examine their respective features, performances and justifications. Subsequently in the third chapter, the evolution of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court will be presented to determine whether the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court has unique settings when compared to the other parallel parties depicted in the previous chapters. In the fourth and fifth chapters, patent and copyright litigations will be identified as examples to explain how the various types of IP litigations have individual characteristics and how the performance of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Courts vary, due to the features of the category of litigations. After probing into the impact of the IP courts upon patent and copyright litigations, the sixth chapter will direct attention to the litigation practices and the legal professionals by discussing their views and perspectives on the impact of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court. Finally in the last chapter, an analytical conclusion of the thesis will be drawn, in order, to integrate the arguments and findings presented in previous chapters and to identify the actual impact of the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court in theory and in practice. ...|$|E

As has been the case in the rule 2 ̆ 7 s introduction to human rights proceedings in other settings, its application in ATS litigation could mean additional work for the courts in fashioning the right way to interpret and apply the rule. For victims of human rights abuse who are seeking justice in the United States, it may not herald a lot of changes, although it could still make their quest a little more difficult. However, it could be a harbinger of broad public policy changes if properly utilized. These changes could redound to the benefit of the countries where human rights abuses constantly take place and may also lead to a more progressive development of the international law of human rights. Part I discusses the <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> rule under general international law, while Part II undertakes a similar assignment with regard to international human rights law. In these two parts, the rationale and advantages of the rule are highlighted including the prevention of occasions for potential international irritation or interstate tension, promotion of peaceful co-existence of States, avoidance of counter-productivity, and facilitation of a higher or voluntary adherence to the relevant international instruments by States Parties.

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of resort to prior remedies {{has been a}} hot debate in some international investment proceedings in arbitration tribunals. Some groups argue that resort to prior remedies in international investment disputes under bilateral investment treaties is akin to exhaustion of <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> in diplomatic protection doctrine. Therefore failure to exhaust <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> before bringing the international investment claims to international plane leads to the case declared inadmissible before the international tribunals. The groups also further argue that {{in the event that}} the Bilateral Investment Treaty requires that disputes should be brought to local courts where the investment has been made, such requirement is jurisdictional. Therefore, failure to bring the disputes to <b>local</b> courts for <b>remedies</b> leads the tribunal in question lacks of jurisdiction to hear the case. Accordingly, this paper provides an in depth examination of whether or not a requirement of resort of prior remedies jurisdictional. The paper concludes that a requirement to resort to prior remedies in international investment disputes under international investment treaties is not a jurisdictional requirement because of two reasons. First, jurisdiction means that the tribunal has power and competent to hear the investment disputes. Such power extends to any legal disputes between contracting parties and national of another contracting parties and the availability of consent of Contracting Party and national of another contracting party to bring the disputes to the tribunal in question. Second, the issue of resort to prior remedies in international investment disputes does not relate at all to the jurisdiction of the tribunal to hear the disputes. The issue is related to the claims itself whether or not the claims is matured enough to be brought to the international tribunal. To add more benefit, this paper also considers impacts of the issue of resort to prior remedies on Indonesian law. Such consideration is important as there is an aspiration among the Indonesian government officials to include provisions on exhaustion of <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> in the BITs. In reaching a conclusion on the (un) feasibility of the inclusion of exhaustion of <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> in the BITs, investigation has been made on two issues, namely, an availability of Indonesian court remedies to deal with international investment disputes and an analysis on ASEAN Australia New Zealand Free Trade Agreement on Investment Chapter where Indonesia is a party, {{and its impact on the}} Indonesia’s aspiration...|$|R

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolHuman rights appear to have different implications amongst different peoples predicated upon their particular political, religious, social, and cultural settings. The European Court of Human Rights in Lautsi and Others v Italy propounded that to establish a uniform application of human rights would be against the foundational purpose of those human rights it seeks to protect as it would purport to impose a uniform culture and thus freeze cultural practices in status quo. It is against the backdrop of this realisation that the margin of appreciation was introduced by the European Commission and later adopted by the African Commission, in order to accommodate such diversities by providing for a ‘contextualised implementation’ of human rights. The margin of appreciation refers to the leeway that International organisation grant national authorities, in fulfilling their obligations under Human Rights Conventions. This approach has since been acknowledged to be manifested, cardinally, in the duty to exhaust <b>local</b> <b>remedies</b> under article 56 (5) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.

However, the European Court of Human Rights in particular has accentuated the human rights standards and has admonished states parties to take these rights seriously...|$|R
