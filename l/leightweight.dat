40|$|This paper {{presents}} a blind decoding watermarking scheme that {{takes advantage of}} two basic properties of the Fourier transform: The image information is transformed into frequency bands centered around {{the origin of the}} coordinate system and the image information, the latter beeing independent from shifts in the original image. (i. e. pixel domain). These properties are exploited to embed a watermark that is inherently robust against translation an rotation in the pixel domain and shows considerable robustness against cropping and scaling as well. The amplitude part of the Fourier representation of the image is divided into rings, and each ring is subdivided into sections. A pair of sections is used to embed one bit of watermark information with the bit value being represented´by a predifined difference between the mean power values of the sections. The playload of the presented watermarking scheme strongly depends {{on the size of the}} image. Tests based on a <b>leightweights</b> implementation of the presented scheme were run with a watermark playload of 16 bits for an image of 512 by 512 pixels...|$|R

It poses the question whether the use of lightweight materials in electric vehicles can reduce the vehicles’ environmental impact and compares the environmental performance of a lightweight electric vehicle (LEV) to other types of vehicles. The topical approach focuses on methods from life cycle assessment (LCA), and the book concludes with a comprehensive concept on the environmental assessment of LEVs. The target audience primarily comprises LCA practitioners from research institutes and industry, but it may also be beneficial for graduate students specializing in the field of environmental assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} warm hydroforming, special with oil, is {{researched}} in detail, for example by the Fraunhofer Institut Chemnitz. The reason {{of this research}} is the improvement of formability of <b>leightweight</b> alloys. Especially magnesium shows a great rise of formability at elevated temperaturs. For that, the matrice of oil limits the use of this method in relation to the temperature. Gaseous mediums, special nitrogen, is able to break this barrier. In this diploma safety instructions in relation to operators and the system are mentioned by calculating the sound level respective the behaviour of nitrogen by elevated temperatures at first. The feasibility of this method is proven by the produced parts...|$|E

The {{processes such as}} light absorption and excitation of electrons to a higher energy level and generation of highly mobile charge carriers are achieved by mixing two organic semiconductors. An organic solar cell is composed of a carrier substrate and a photoactive layer embedded between a transparent and a reflective electrode. Organic solar cells can attain the same efficiency as inorganic solar cells by optimizing one semiconductor component. The vacuum coating processes for manufacturing organic solar cells based on small molecules is identified.

Storage- and transportation of these fuels {{is part of}} these activities. <b>Leightweight</b> vessels of fibre composites are promissing candidates. Their disadvantage might be the gas permeation, especially when exposed to mechanical and thermal cycling. For several applications of superconducting magnets (pulsed magnets; SQUID-detectors) non-metallic and non-magnetic cryostats are required. Fibreglass composites are promissing candidate materials, but again a sufficient low helium gas permeation is required. The permeation of helium-, hydrogen- and methane gas has been investigated. The principal arrangement for measuring gas permeation through polymers, fibreglass and -carbon reinforced epoxy resins will be described. The behaviour of coating materials or organic and metallic liners are further topics of these measurements.

40|$|The MEMS Phase Former Kit {{developed}} by the Fraunhofer IPMS is a complete Spatial Light Modulator system based on a piston-type Micro Mirror Array (MMA) for the use in high-resolution, high-speed optical phase control. It has been designed for an easy system integration into an user-specific environment to offer a platform for first practical investigations to open up new applications in Adaptive Optics. The key component is a fine segmented 240 x 200 array of 40 µm piston-type mirror elements capable of 400 nm analog deflection for a 2 pi phase modulation in the visible. Each mirror can be addressed and deflected independently {{by means of an}} integrated CMOS backplane address circuitry at an 8 bit height resolution. Full user programmability and control is provided by a newly developed comfortable driver software for Windows XP based PCs supporting both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for stand-alone operation with pre-defined data patterns as well as an open ActiveX programming interface for a closed-loop operation with real-time data from an external source. An IEEE 1394 a FireWire interface is used for high-speed data communication with an electronic driving board performing the actual MMA programming and control allowing for an overall frame rate of up to 500 Hz. Successful proof-of-concept demonstrations already have been given for eye aberration correction in ophthalmology, for error compensation of <b>leightweight</b> primary mirrors of future space telescopes and for ultra-short laser pulse shaping.

40|$|Future {{adaptable}} applications require electro-mechanical actuators {{with a high}} weight-related en-ergy. Among modern multi-functional materials carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have some}} special char-acteristics which give them the potential to solve this demand. On the one hand raw CNTs have excellent mechanical properties like their low density (1330 kg/m^ 3) and very high estimated stiffness of about 1 TPa. On the other hand CNTs have the ability under presence of ions, wired like a capacitor and activated by a charge injection to perform a dimension-change (length of C-C bondings). Calculations and experiments present achievable active strains of 1 % at low voltage of ± 1 V what qualifies CNT-based materials for <b>leightweight</b> powerful actuators. In this paper the former work done with actuators using CNT-containing mats and Nafion as solid electrolyte is evaluated by analyzing the two main-components in more detail. On the one hand the CNT-based model-material SWCNT-mats called Bucky-paper (BP) {{and on the other}} hand ion do-nating electrolytes in liquid-phase like a NaCl-solution and its solid equivalent Nafion as thin-foils are tested. Additional methods of fabrication, preparation and characterization of the CNT-powder and the manufactured BPs containing randomly oriented single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are presented which provide a deeper system-understanding. Both materials (BPs and Nafion-foils) are intensively investigated in different deflection-test-rigs due to their structural as-sembly. This paper presents a method for electro-mechanical measurements of BPs in an in-plain test set-up which avoids sensing secondary effects like thermal expansion or mass-transport and confirm that BP-deflection should only be a capacity-driven effect. Nafion as solid electrolyte will be tested in an out-of-plane facility to measure its possible actuation within the lamellar-direction. With this approach the dependencies of each component and their individual characters on the deflec-tion can be estimated. The active response can be referred to the internal structure of both compo-nents as well as of the whole structural assembly. The results give a certain direction to a BP-optimization referring to active strain, density, structural integrity and conductibility. In addition to these facts the active character of BPs using CNTs of different suppliers and Nafion is analyzed. These investigations are of particular importance for detection of global dependencies and using both materials in a hybrid-assembly like solid actuators which are needed for structural applications. ...|$|E
