40|$|Background: Random serial {{sampling}} {{is widely}} used in population pharmacokinetic studies and may have advantages compared with conventional fixed time-point evaluation of iron fortification. Objective: Our objective was to validate random serial sampling to judge the efficacy of iron fortification of a <b>low-fat</b> <b>margarine.</b> Design: We conducted a 32 -wk placebo-controlled, double-blind, iron-intervention trial in 18 – 40 -y-old Swiss women (n = 142) with serum ferritin (SF) concentration...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} seven specific dietary phytosterols (PS) (campesterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, brassicasterol, 5 -avenasterol, β-sitostanol and campestanol) in fatty foods. Gas-liquid chromatography procedure was applied to 87 items of Swedish and Dutch origin. In general, β-sitosterol was the dominating phytosterol (60 % represented the median total concentration), followed by campesterol (24 %), stigmasterol (7 %) and 5 -avenasterol (5 %), brassicasterol (3 %), β-sitostanol (1 %) and campestanol (< 0. 1 %). The median total content of PS for the 42 fat spreads and margarines was 204 mg/ 100 g with minimum 73 mg/ 100 g in a <b>low-fat</b> <b>margarine</b> and maximum 775 mg/ 100 g in a polyunsaturated fat spread. Among 19 plant oils, median total PS content was 348 mg/ 100 g, with minimum 39 mg/ 100 g in palm oil and maximum 978 / 100 g in corn oil. Median value for 12 nuts and seeds was 144 mg/ 100 g, with minimum 68 mg/ 100 g in coconut rasps and maximum 404 mg/ 100 g in sesame seeds. Median value for total PS was 100 mg/ 100 g among 14 miscellaneous fatty foods with minimum 11 mg/ 100 g in Dutch non-dairy ice cream and maximum 484 mg/ 100 g in mayonnaise. The results are discussed against a background of methodological aspects with the chosen analytical procedure and the importance of setting up valid PS databases for epidemiological studies. © 2006...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Only a few {{consistent}} {{findings on}} individual foods or nutrients that influence {{breast cancer risk}} have emerged thus far. Since people do not consume individual foods but certain combinations of them, the analysis of dietary patterns may offer an additional aspect for assessing associations between diet and diseases such as breast cancer. It {{is also important to}} examine whether the relationships between dietary patterns and breast cancer risk are consistent across populations. Methods: We examined {{the risk of breast cancer}} with two dietary patterns, identified as "Vegetables" (VEG) and "Pork, Processed Meat, Potatoes" (PPP), common to all cohorts of the DIETSCAN project. During 7 to 13 years of follow-up, three of the cohorts - the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer (NLCS), the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC), and the Ormoni e Dieta nella Eziologia dei Tumori (Italy-ORDET) - provided data on 3271 breast cancer cases with complete information on their baseline diet measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, VEG was not associated with the risk of breast cancer across all cohorts. PPP was also not associated with the risk of breast cancer in SMC and ORDET, but a high PPP score tended to be inversely associated with breast cancer in the NLCS study (RR = 0. 69; 95 % CI, 0. 52 - 0. 92, highest versus lowest quartile). PPP differed in one aspect between the cohorts: butter loaded positively on the pattern in all cohorts except NLCS, in which butter loaded negatively and appeared to be substituted by <b>low-fat</b> <b>margarine</b> loading positively. Conclusion: In general, the dietary patterns showed consistent results across the three cohorts except for the possible protective effect of PPP in the NLCS cohort, which could be explained by a difference in that pattern for NLCS. The results supported the suggestion derived from traditional epidemiology that relatively recent diet may not have an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. © Springer 2005...|$|E

40|$|Background: A farming {{environment}} confers strong {{protection against}} allergy development. We have previously shown that farming mothers consume more full-fat dairy than control mothers, who instead consume more <b>low-fat</b> dairy, <b>margarine,</b> and oils; margarine and oil intake {{was associated with}} increased risk of allergy development in their children. Objectives: The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the differences in diet between children in farming and control families at 1 year of age, to investigate the relation between the diets of the mothers and their children, and to relate the children's diet to allergy development. Design: The diet of 1 -year-old children from dairy farming families (n= 28) and from control families in the same rural area (n= 37) was assessed by 24 -h dietary recalls, followed by 24 -h food diaries. Allergy was diagnosed by pediatricians at 3 years of age using strict predefined criteria. Results: Farm children had a higher intake of farm milk, whole cream, cholesterol, saturated fat, and fat in total and tended to eat more butter, while controls consumed more carbohydrates and poultry and tended to eat more margarine. Farm children also had higher intakes of homemade porridge/gruel, oily fish, and iodine. The intake of butter and whole milk in children and mothers correlated significantly in farm families but not in controls. A weak negative association was found between seafood intake and allergy development, while allergy was positively associated with the intake of pork as well as zinc in the control group; these intakes also correlated with each other. Conclusions: Consistent with mothers in farming families, the children consumed more full-fat dairy and saturated fat than did controls, but this could not be linked to the low risk of allergy in the farming group. Seafood intake might protect against allergy development, in accordance with earlier findings...|$|R
