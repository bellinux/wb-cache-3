25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature <b>collectors.</b> <b>Low-temperature</b> <b>collectors</b> are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|R
40|$|Solar {{collectors}} are {{the engines}} that drive all solar energy heating systems. Although solar heating collectors have settled upon {{a few basic}} designs, they are still manufactured {{in an array of}} configurations. Solar collectors are generally classified by the temperatures that can be produced under normal amounts of solar radiation. The collector’s end-use application can be determined by their temperature classification such as <b>Low-temperature</b> <b>collectors,</b> Medium-temperature collectors and High-temperature concentrators that track the sun and produces the highest temperatures. Reflectorsthat are axially symmetrical and shaped like a parabola, has the property of bringing parallel rays of light (such as sunlight) to a pointfocus and so any object that is located at its focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for high solar energy generation. Energy supply for domestic activities had been a major problem faced by both rural and city dwellers {{for a long time now}} in Africa. It was therefore desirable to design and construct a solar Fresnel reflector and a tracking stand that can be used to generate heat from the sun for cooking, baking and distillation purposes. The reflector and the tracking stand designed and constructed was able to concentrate solar energy within a regional diameter of 10 cm and could be used to raise the temperature of any object placed at its focal region. It was discovered that the heat generated is directly proportional to both the perfection of the collector design, its construction, the quality of the reflectors e. g plain mirror, the area exposed to the sun and the solar intensity of the day...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{complete}} performance evaluation {{is playing a}} major role in the further development of concentrating solar collectors. To ensure dependable test results, an appropriate testing and evaluation procedure is required. Moreover, the selection and installation of suitable measurement instrumentation are essential for obtaining reliable data for the performance evaluation. The quality of the measurement instrumentation greatly influences the representativeness of the test results. Details on the measurement instrumentation recommended for the testing of <b>low-temperature</b> solar <b>collectors</b> have already been provided in the testing standard EN ISO 9806 : 2013. Due to the larger dimensions of concentrating collectors and thus different working temperatures and mass flow rates, these recommendations cannot be directly applied for the testing of concentrating solar collectors...|$|R
40|$|Technical {{performance}} and economy of <b>low-temperature</b> solar <b>collector</b> systems are investigated {{with regard to}} their possible application for the LT-heat supply in the FRG. The systems consist of a flat plate collector system, including storage, and a conventional back-up system and may be assisted by an electrically driven heat pump. The analysis is carried out by computer simulation based on a mathematical model of the different kinds of LT-system-components. The seperate modelling of collector, heat exchanger, storage facility, heat pump, etc. makes the various composition of components possible. Four types of LT-collector systems are investigated in detail: - domestic hot water supply system - house heating system - combined house heating and hot water supply system - solar assisted heat pumps for heating and hot water supply. Simulations are based upon hourly data of total insolation and ambient temperature measured at Hamburg and Munich in 1973. The systems are supplying heat for a typical German 1 + 2 -family house which is constructed following the guidelines of DIN 41 O 8. This house, supplied by a conventional central heating system (oil), is taken as a reference for comparison...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of an unglazed solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collector to a ground source coupled {{heat pump system}} {{has the potential to}} increase the heat pump performance to a minimal SPF of 6 by providing higher average source temperature. Furthermore the {{integration of}} a PV/T collector increases the system stability and introduces new degrees of freedom in the design of renewable and zero emission energy supply for buildings. This study shows the design of a low exergy (LowEx) solar building system and its potential for the total solar energy building supply in moderate climates as in the EU and northern China. The collector array is dimensioned according to the building heat load. The area can be maximized to provide the entire yearly heat demand, without the problem of excess collector heat in summer, by employing solar ground regeneration. The <b>low-temperature</b> thermal <b>collector</b> supplies the heat needed by the heat pump to provide hot water and heating of the building, while the PV production exceeds the annual electricity demand of the heat pump and auxiliary pumps. Different hydronic circuit layouts and controls have been evaluated by simulation according to reference buildings of SHC IEA task 44 with regard to the criteria of simplicity and reliability in order to realize LowEx solar buildings. An implementation of a system that maximizes the thermal system input considering minimal internal exergetic losses is presented. A PV/T collector has been realized as prototype, installed and tested in LowEx building systems...|$|R
40|$|A large {{research}} {{program in the}} field of solar-coupled heat pumps with seasonal storage in the ground, using vertical pipes to a depth of 10 - 40 m, {{has been going on for}} several years in Sweden. In this paper, some main results from two experimental plants are presented. As well, results from a technical-economical optimization study are discussed. In these calculations comparisons are made among systems using ambient-air natural convection heat exchangers, lowtemperature solar collectors, and II conventi ona 111 amb i ent-a i r heat pumps wi thout storage. One of the experimental plants heats a school and consists of <b>low-temperature</b> solar <b>collectors</b> on the roof, four diesel-driven heat pumps, and a storage system with vertical pipes in clay, depth 35 m. Seasonal performance factors (SPF's) are 3. 6 (heat pumps) and 1. 7 (total system). The other plant is an experimental one for a single-family house with an electrically driven heat pump, natural convection heat exchangers on the roof, and a storage system in clay, depth 10 m. Annual SPF's are 3. 0 (heat pump) and 2. 5 (including all auxiliary electricity consumption). Systems evaluation calculations indicate optimal sizes of the three main components, although the optimas are flat. The differences in economy between systems with solar collectors and with natural convection heat exchangers are small. However, systems with solar or ambientair heat collectors and storage systems cannot today compete economically with ambient-air heat pumps without storage systems, at least if Swedish conditions are assumed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the use of low and medium temperature active solar energy systems for the disinfestation of greenhouse soils. Four flat plate solar <b>collectors</b> (<b>low-temperature</b> solar thermal energy devices) and six parabolic trough concentrators (medium-temperature solar thermal energy devices) were used to heat water, which, via a buried heat exchange system, was used to heat the soil of greenhouse plots. These treatments were compared to no solar (control) and solarized (using a 50 µm-thick transparent polyethylene sheet) plots. Experiments performed in the summers of 2004 and 2005 showed that: 1) the temperatures reached and the energy accumulated in the soil- and therefore the disinfestation capacity- were greater with either of the active solar treatments (40 - 60 ºC and 10. 222. 438 – 18. 102. 054 J, respectively) than with solarization (< 40 ºC and 6. 628. 760 J, respectively) and 2) the tem-peratures reached using the parabolic trough concentrators (50 - 60 ºC) were higher than those achieved with the flat plate solar collectors (40 - 50 ºC). The soil temperatures reached suggest these systems could be used to disinfest green-house soils. Additional key words: soil heating, soil treatment, solarization.

40|$|Solar {{heating and}} cooling (SHC) systems are {{currently}} under rapid development and deployment due to their potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. Absorption chiller technology (traditionally powered by natural gas in large buildings) can be retrofitted to run fully, or in part, on solar energy. The majority of solar absorption chillers installed {{around the world are}} based on single-effect chillers and <b>low-temperature</b> solar thermal <b>collectors.</b> Benefiting from higher coefficients of performance (COPs), multi-effect absorption chillers can operate more efficiently than single-effect chillers when coupled with high-temperature solar thermal collectors, thereby requiring less solar thermal energy (and potentially less collector area) to supply a given amount of cooling. Although multi-effect absorption chillers have been on the market for a while, experimental testing, standardization, and systematic comparative investigations of their performance and viability are lacking in the literature. In fact, there has been no comprehensive comparison between solar-assisted single-, double-, and triple-effect absorption chillers against a common set of energetic, economic, and environmental metrics from a holistic perspective. Motivated by this research gap, this thesis aims to systematically investigate the techno-economic feasibility of this technology, incorporating realistic, optimized configurations to supply air-conditioning (both cooling and heating) demand for large buildings. This analysis is based on coupling LiBr-H 2 O single-, double-, and triple-effect absorption chillers with solar thermal collectors. Based on manufacturer rated performance curves for real chiller and collector products on the market, simulation models of each SHC absorption chiller configuration with different design options are developed in a transient system simulation environment (TRNSYS 17). Different control scenarios and operational modes of the system are proposed and investigated in order to identify the optimum control logics and designs for these systems. To achieve the highest primary energy savings, a detailed evaluation of alternative backup options is conducted – a subject that has been rarely discussed in the literature. It was found that due to the complexity of these types of system, the present numerous non-intuitive design choices must be analyzed to achieve the best techno-economic performance in these systems. In addition, a parametric study of the proposed SHC configurations is performed to investigate the effect of key design variables such as the storage tank volume and the solar collector area on the plants’ performance. Furthermore, this dissertation takes a unique, comprehensive perspective by investigating the impact of characteristic solar beam radiation to global radiation ratios {{on the size of the}} solar field of the proposed SHC plants for a wide variety of climatic conditions. The occupant thermal comfort and the influence of the latent loads on the system performance are also discussed. A detailed multi-objective optimization model using a genetic algorithm is formulated to optimize the performance of the most promising configurations of SHC absorption chillers by minimizing their primary energy consumption and total levelized cost simultaneously. This provides a clear comparison of the energy, environmental, and economic performance of the best alternative configurations at their optimal designs. Finally, experimental tests were conducted on a solar cooling double-effect chiller prototype to gain insight into the real-world performance of multi-effect chillers when coupled with high-temperature concentrating solar thermal collectors. Overall, this thesis provides clear techno-economic guidance/advice on energy-efficient, sustainable and cost-effective design of SHC absorption chiller systems for air-conditioning applications, thereby providing a pathway to greater utilization of this technology. The findings of this research will also contribute to the International Energy Agency (IEA) SHC Program Task 48 (Quality Assurance and Support Measures for Solar Cooling Systems), whose main objective is to assist with developing a strong and sustainable market for solar thermally-driven cooling and heating systems – a subject that has not been studied prior to other IEA SHC Tasks...|$|R
