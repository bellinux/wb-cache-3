5000|$|Popmatters' Joseph Carver {{praised the}} album's narrative, writing [...] "Once again, a record {{made up of}} {{relatively}} unlikeable characters becomes a fixture in your psyche thanks to Will Sheff’s ability to find the humanity in their stories." [...] Pitchfork Media also praised the album's lyrics, with reviewer Stephen Deusner calling Sheff [...] "...one of the best <b>lyric-writers</b> going in indie rock." [...] Deusner continued: [...] "Song for song, he can jerk a tear with a carefully observed detail or turn of phrase... but it's the way those songs {{talk to one another}} that makes Okkeril River albums so durable and fascinating." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{twenty-five years}} of theatergoing one learns {{that there are two}} kinds of musical comedies—the [...] "low-brow" [...] sort, and those in which the girls aren't seen for ten minutes after the curtain rises. The exclamatory school {{presented}} at the Princess runs to cleverness rather than to comeliness, but the cleverest of librettists, <b>lyric-writers</b> and composers grow weary and a trifle stale, and so it happens that [...] "Oh, My Dear!" [...] lacks some of the freshness and sparkle of [...] "Oh, Boy!" [...] and [...] "Oh, Lady! Lady!!" [...] Guy Bolton's book is rather more frankly than usual of the scrap variety; P. G. Wodehouse's rhymes are not so startlingly felicitous; and Louis A. Hirsch's music, though pleasant to take, has a somewhat familiar flavor.The story concerns the stock mild-and middle - aged married man who hasn't kicked over the traces since he sneaked off [...] "to a Burton Holmes Travelogue in 1916," [...] and who gets himself into the stock complications by inducing someone to pass himself off as someone he isn't.Then the wife of the someone he isn't turns up, and we come to the stock situation in which a man and a woman who have been but casually acquainted are assigned to occupy the same chamber.This tangle is unraveled by a company including Frederic Graham, Roy Atwell, Joseph Allen, Ivy Sawyer, Joseph Santley, Georgia Caine and Juliette Day. [...] "I Wonder Whether," [...] "Our City of Dreams" [...] and [...] "You Never Know" [...] are the best of the song numbers.In comparison, [...] "Oh, My Dear!" [...] suffers chiefly by being set beside its predecessors at the Princess—it is announced as [...] "the sixth annual New York Princess Theater musical comedy production." ...|$|R
50|$|Holtei was {{not only}} a stage-poet but, a <b>lyric-writer</b> of great charm. Notable among such {{productions}} are Schlesische Gedichte (1830; 20th ed., 1893), Gedichte (5th ed., 1861), Stimmen des Waldes (2nd ed., 1854). Mention ought also to be made of Holtei's interesting autobiography, Vierzig Jahre (8 vols., 1843-1850; 3rd ed., 1862) with the supplementary volume Noch ein Jahr in Schlesien (1864).|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, {{musician}}s {{broke through}} the barrier, when the young, English-speaking Jewish musician and composer, Charles Segal collaborated with the older Afrikaans <b>lyric-writer,</b> Anton Dewaal, to write songs. Segal's songs like [...] "Die Ou Kalahari" [...] became highly popular with the Afrikaans-speaking public. However, there was tight censorship over all broadcasts, particularly of pop music, with, for example, the music of The Beatles being banned by the SABC between 1966 and March 1971.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 Anand Thakore {{presented}} Sabadpiya Ki Khoj, {{a concert}} and {{presentation at the}} National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai, [...] focusing on {{his work as a}} composer of bandish-es composed under the Takhallus or pseuodonym Sabadpiya (sabadpiya implying lover of the word and reminiscent of Agra gharana pen-names like Ustad Khadim Hussain Sajan piya etc.) The event brought together his work both as a composer in Hindustani Raga and Tala and as a <b>lyric-writer</b> in Hindi.

50|$|Dik Dik is an Italian beat-pop-rock band, {{named for}} the {{antelope}} Dik-dik, established in the 1960s and still in activity. They were most popular in the late 1960s, when they released a string of hit singles with the contribution of renowned <b>lyric-writer</b> Mogol and songwriter Lucio Battisti, their greatest successes being Sognando la California and Senza luce, respectively covers of California Dreamin' by The Mamas and Papas and A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum. While their early production is mostly inspired by The Beatles, in the 1970s they also experimented in other genres, including progressive rock. They went on hiatus in the 1980s but later returned to the scenes, mostly in revival television shows and live performances.|$|E
5000|$|Colin Harper {{described}} the album in Mojo in 2002, [...] "...the glorious simplicity of this release {{feels like a}} homecoming in every sense. Backed by three superb musicians, the live-in-home-studio performances are beautifully restrained, and the vibe of both writing and sound has a warmth and contentedness redolent of gazing through rain-lashed stone-cottage windows in Wexford - which is, as it happens, pretty much how it was. (pg. 101) In its review, Allmusic suggests that McEvoy's range as a <b>lyric-writer</b> is limited, stating that she [...] "seems to write about only two subjects, lost love and found love, and she tends to rely on well-worn clichés" [...] but notes that her [...] "melodies are easily strong enough to stand on their own", stating overall that [...] "the purity of the arrangements" [...] of the music on this album [...] "is indeed wonderful." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sheet {{music from}} the 20th and 21st century {{typically}} indicates {{the title of the}} song or composition on a title page or cover, or {{on the top of the}} first page, if there is no title page or cover. If the song or piece is from a movie, Broadway musical, or opera, the title of the main work from which the song/piece is taken may be indicated. If the songwriter or composer is known, her or his name is typically indicated along with the title. The sheet music may also indicate the name of the <b>lyric-writer,</b> if the lyrics are by a person other than one of the songwriters or composers and the name of the arranger, if the song or piece has been arranged for the publication. No songwriter or composer name may be indicated for old folk music, traditional songs in genres such as blues and bluegrass, and very old traditional hymns and spirituals, because for this music, the authors are often unknown; in such cases, the word [...] "Traditional" [...] is often placed where the composer's name would ordinarily go. Black market sheet music, such as illegal jazz fake books may or may not indicate the songwriter or composer.|$|E
40|$|When Little Shop of Horrors {{opened in}} a small theatre off-Broadway in 1982, it caused quite a stir among the critics. No one could agree on {{what to make of}} this joyous off-beat lampoon of the ‘B’ movie genre… but {{everyone}} had to agree that they loved it. It won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Musical and was transferred uptown to the big and swanky Schubert Theatre on Broadway where it enjoyed a respectable ‘legitimate’ run. This ‘little show that grew’ is important in that it marked the first collaboration of book and <b>lyric-writer</b> Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken. The stage musical is based on the 1960 horror film directed by ‘B’ movie mogul Roger Corman. The film’s outlandishly improbable plot, its over-wrought acting, its quick and exploitative filming and rushed editing and its darkly macabre humour are all exemplary hallmarks of the ‘B’ movie genre and have made it something of a cult favourite. These are the very qualities that the musical stage version celebrates. Book and lyrics by Howard Ashman. Music by Alan Menken. Based on the film by Roger Corman.
