5|$|Betances died at 10:00a.m., local time, in Neuilly-sur-Seine on Friday, September 16, 1898. His {{remains were}} cremated soon after and entombed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery of Paris on Monday, September 19. He had {{requested}} that no formal ceremony {{be made for}} his funeral. His common law-wife Simplicia survived him for over 20 years. A <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> will implies that, besides a life insurance policy payout and two parcels {{of land in the}} Dominican Republic, Betances died almost in poverty.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, it is Casual Friday {{and most}} people dress too loosely at the office. Angela (Angela Kinsey) {{complains}} to Toby (Paul Lieberstein) about Oscar (Oscar Nunez) wearing sandals to work and having to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet. Meredith (Kate Flannery) disgusts {{the rest of the}} employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing herself {{to the rest of the}} office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests. Toby calls a meeting with everyone regarding Casual Friday. When Dwight tries to take charge of the meeting, Toby is finally stern with him and cancels Casual Friday, much to everyone's disappointment.|$|E
5|$|At the {{election}} party, Lana arrives with Chloe, but she once again leaves again when Lex calls. This time Lex kisses {{her when he}} learns of her break up, which causes Lana to leave. Like before, Lex pursues Lana, but this time Clark arrives in time to stop the bus. Jonathan goes to the farm after receiving a mysterious call during the party, and is greeted by Lionel Luthor (John Glover). Lionel insinuates he knows Clark's secret and shows a picture to Jonathan, which causes Jonathan to begin punching Lionel in anger. Jonathan dismisses Lionel and laboriously walks away, breathing heavily. Martha and Clark drive up and catch him as he has a heart attack, and, after taking a final <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> family, Jonathan dies {{in the arms of}} Martha and Clark. At Jonathan's funeral, all of Clark's close friends attend, as well as the Luthors. When the funeral is over, Clark picks up a handful of dirt and sprinkles it into his father's grave.|$|E

5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the {{description}} of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.|$|E
5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E

Sheffield states in his book, Inside Power, {{that he had no}} knowledge of the cream containing steroids, and had no reason to assume so at the time. He goes on to say in his book that the cream did nothing to strengthen his knee, and also states that a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> numbers shows no improvement after the incident.|$|E

25|$|Determined to trap Cafferty {{once and}} for all, Rebus uses his {{contacts}} {{to set up a}} sting operation, with child molester Andrew McPhail being used as the unwitting bait. Cafferty is caught red-handed attacking McPhail outside the Operation Moneybags surveillance, and is arrested. With Cafferty in jail, the police are able to take a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> operation. A farm in the Borders is raided, where Cafferty used to personally execute his enemies. Deek Torrance is amongst those arrested there. In exchange for leniency, Eddie Ringan agrees to testify against Cafferty.|$|E
25|$|Champions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray {{have each}} offered fairly precise tales of a {{contrivance}} whereby Bell actively stole {{the invention of}} the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> rival's designs before final submission.|$|E
25|$|Mining in Rana {{has taken}} place since it was {{established}} at Ormlia in 1799. Ole Tobias Olsen discovered iron ore on his farm of Nord-Dunderland, for which he registered a mining claim in 1879. Since 1872, Olsen {{had been working on}} promoting the construction of the Nordland Line northwards from Trondheim. In 1891, he petitioned the government to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> claim as a source of national wealth and requested that the Nordland Line be built via the Dunderland Valley to allow shipment of the ore to the coastal port of Mo. He received a grant to carry out technical investigations for a railway.|$|E

25|$|Cao Cao {{had stayed}} in Wan for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu {{suddenly}} rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao's camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen. Dian Wei stood guard {{at the entrance to}} the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu's soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao's camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu's forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long ji, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei's men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to approach him. Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, he was still glaring and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei's head was passed around for Zhang Xiu's men to see. They also came to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> headless body.|$|E

In the second verse, the line [...] "People think he's loopy loo when they <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> shoes" [...] refers to the comedian's unusual dress sense, which included [...] "toy cows grazing on his shoes", according to Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, while [...] "rocking sausage roll" [...] was Smith's phrase for rock 'n' roll.|$|E

500|$|Also in October, a biographical film, , {{directed}} by Ian Darling, was released. Darling {{had worked on}} the project {{for two years and}} it included [...] "insights from family, friends, musicians and music journalists, as well as Kelly himself". The Australian Financial Reviews Katrina Strickland described the documentary as [...] "not a critique of his music, nor an intrusive <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> personal life" [...] which uses a [...] "much less linear approach to the life of a musician whose career has spanned four decades". After it appeared on ABC-TV in October of the following year, Andrew P. Street of The Guardian noted it [...] "brings an ambitious, complex young Kelly to life – making a relisten of his work essential".|$|E
500|$|Rehman caused {{controversy}} in 2007 when {{in an interview}} with the British weekly newspaper the Eastern Eye he said that players of Asian descent should consider sticking to their roots rather than dreaming of playing for England. Rehman pointed to Michael Chopra and David Nugent, who both were top scorer in the Championship, but Nugent was called up for England while Chopra was not. Rehman claimed [...] "Why wasn't (Chopra) picked ahead of Dave Nugent? He's the top goal scorer in the Championship but he can't get in (the England set-up). So he needs to maybe <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> decision and go play for India instead of hanging on to the dream of playing for England, because it's not going to happen, end of discussion." ...|$|E

Chambers explained: [...] "It's serious, but Sam's playing it down. Of course he's scared but he deals with it by just wanting to laugh it off and make jokes about it". He speculated that the experience would force Sam to grow up and appreciate life more, as well as seriously consider the future of his daughter, Grace, and cease his philandering way with female staff.
