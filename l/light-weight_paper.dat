50|$|During the event, kite {{markets are}} set up {{alongside}} food stalls and performers. The kites are usually made with materials such as plastic, leaves, wood, metal, nylon and other scrap materials but the ones for Uttarayan are made of <b>light-weight</b> <b>paper</b> and bamboo and are mostly rhombus shaped with central spine and a single bow. Dye and paint are also added to increase the glamour of the kite. The lines are covered with mixtures of glue and ground glass which when dried, rolled up and attached to the rear, also known as firkees, become sharp enough to cut skin. These types of sharp lines are used on fighter kites known in India as patangs to cut down other kites during various kite fighting events. During the night, {{on the second day}} of the festival, illuminated kites filled with lights and candles known as tukals or tukkals are launched creating a spectacle in the dark sky.In Gujarat kites are made up of two types of paper that is :-1.Simple paper kites &2.Butter paper kites.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, book {{papers are}} off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to {{minimise}} the show-through of text {{from one side}} of the page to the other, and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Typically, books <b>papers</b> are <b>light-weight</b> <b>papers</b> 60 to 90 g/m² and often specified by their caliper/substance ratios (volume basis). For example, a bulky 80 g/m² paper may have a caliper of 120 micrometres (0.12 mm) which would be Volume 15 (120×10/80), whereas a low bulk 80 g/m² may have a caliper of 88 micrometres, giving a volume 11. This volume basis then allows the calculation of a book's PPI (printed pages per inch), which is an important factor for the design of book jackets and the binding of the finished book.|$|R

40|$|With {{the current}} {{advances}} in semiconductor physics, material science, and material engineering, some developments {{have been reported}} in the performance and fabrication of cheap light weight electronic components. These electronic components include those made from organic material driven electronic devices such as organic thin film transistors, organic diodes, etc. all having a wide range of applications in various fields including science, technology, engineering, and entertainment. Large area organic thin film transistors can be fabricated on various substrates such as glasses, flexible and rigid plastics, thin-films, etc. to suit different design applications. This thesis work describes the fabrication of organic thin film transistors on biodegradable <b>light-weight</b> flexible <b>paper</b> substrates, and some basic electronic circuitries made from this environmental friendly paper based transistors. This work also highlights possible future work that can be carried out for achieving better performance in some of the circuit applications reported in this thesis. Current research in the performances and characteristics of the environmental friendly transistors has shown that it possesses strong potential for direct applications in biosensors, food technology, histology, biophysics, electrotherapy, computing and electronics. With the light weight paper technology, these devices can be engineered at a low cost into any form and shape to suit design and thus have strong commercial potential that can drive future electronics...|$|R
5000|$|John Bellows was a keen traveler. His {{younger brother}} Ebenezer {{had settled in}} Brussels in 1861 and John visited his brother {{frequently}} {{by the standards of}} the times. In 1863, while distributing bibles at the docks in Gloucester, he met the daughter of a Norwegian ship's captain to whom he later became engaged: unfortunately his fiancée died before they could be married. [...] On one of his hasty trips abroad he became acutely aware of a gap in the market for dictionaries small enough to be portable by travelers. His original idea was for portable dictionary involving Norwegian, but he quickly came to the realisation that market demand for such a lexicon would be very small. [...] He persisted, however, and succeeded in obtaining a substantial quantity of high strength <b>light-weight</b> <b>paper</b> from a Scots firm that had intended to supply bank notes to the Confederate side in the American Civil War. The effectiveness with which Charleston was blockaded by the northern navy made it impossible to deliver bank notes, however, leaving the Glasgow firm with more high grade paper than they could use.|$|E
40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDAA ([URL] audienceWith the advent of multi-processor systems on a chip, the {{interest}} for message passing libraries has revived. Message passing helps in mastering the design complexity of parallel systems. However, to satisfy the stringent energy-budget of embedded applications, the message passing overhead should be limited. Recently, several hardware extensions have been proposed for reducing the transfer cost on a distributed memory architecture. Unfortunately, they ignore the synchronization cost between sender/receiver and/or require many dedicated hardware blocks. To overcome the above limitations, we present in this <b>paper</b> <b>light-weight</b> support for message passing. Moreover, we have made our library as flexible as possible such that we can optimally match the application with the target architecture. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by means of representative benchmarks from the multimedia domain. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the development of}} climbing robots is growing rapidly. Motivations are typically to increase the operation efficiency by obviating the costly assembly of scaffolding or to protect human health and safety in hazardous tasks. Climbing robots are starting to be developed for applications ranging form cleaning to inspection of difficult to reach constructions. These robots should be capable of travelling on different types of surfaces, with varying inclinations, such as floors, walls, ceillings, and to walk between such surfaces. Furthermore, these machines should be capable of adapting and reconfiguring for various environment conditions and to be self-containde. Regarding the adhesion to the surface, {{they should be able to}} produce a secure gripping force using a <b>light-weight</b> mechanism. This <b>paper</b> presents a survey of different appplications and technologies proposed for the implementation of climbing robots. N/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Ray tracing {{efficiently}} models complex illumination {{effects to}} improve visual realism in computer graphics. Typical modern GPUs use wide SIMD processing, and have achieved impressive performance {{for a variety}} of graphics processing including ray tracing. However, SIMD efficiency can be reduced due to the divergent branching and memory access patterns that are common in ray tracing codes. This paper explores an alternative approach using MIMD processing cores custom-designed for ray tracing. By relaxing the requirement that instruction paths be synchronized as in SIMD, caches and less frequently used area expensive functional units may be more effectively shared. Heavy resource sharing provides significant area savings while still maintaining a high MIMD issue rate from our numerous <b>light-weight</b> cores. This <b>paper</b> explores the design space of this architecture and compares performance to the best reported results for a GPU ray tracer and a parallel ray tracer using general purpose cores. We show an overall performance that is six to ten times higher in a similar die area. I...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional triaxially braided {{composites}} (2 DTBCs) {{are attractive}} in crashworthiness design because their fracture can dissipate a significantly larger amount of impact energy than other <b>light-weight</b> materials. This <b>paper</b> aims at predicting the fracture energy, Gf, and the effective {{length of the}} fracture process zone, cf, of 2 DTBC composites. Since the fracture parameters are best manifested in the scaling properties and are the main parameters in the size effect law, the nominal strengths of three geometrically similar notched beams of three different sizes are simulated in a 3 D finite element framework. The simulations are run for three different bias tow angles: 30 º, 45 º and 60 º. Continuum beam elements {{in front of the}} notch are replaced with repetitive unit cells (RUCs), which represent the 2 DTBC’s mesostructure, and are located in the region of potential cracking. Multiscale simulations, incorporating damage mechanics, are used to predict the pre- and post-peak response from three-point bending tests. Nominal stresses are calculated from the predicted peak loads and used to fit the size effect law. The dimensionless energy release rate function g(a) is determined from the J-integral. The values of Gf and cf are then determined using g(a) and the size effect law. With some exceptions, the results in general match well with the results of size effect experiments, and particularly the strong size effect observed in the tests.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{implementation}} of environmental protection, sustainable development and conservation-oriented policies, components and parts of thin-walled welded tubes have gained increasing application in the aircraft and automotive industries because of their advantages: easily achieving forming and manufacturing process at low cost and in a short time. The current research on welded tube plastic forming is mainly concentrated on tube internal high-pressure forming, tube bending forming, and tube spinning forming. The focuses are on the material properties and characterization of welded tubes, finite element modeling for welded tube forming, and inhomogeneous deformation behavior and the mechanism and rules of deformation coordination in welded tube plastic forming. This paper summarizes the research progress in welded tube plastic forming from these aspects. Finally, {{with a focus on}} the urgent demand of the aviation, aerospace and automotive industries for high-strength and <b>light-weight</b> tubes, this <b>paper</b> discusses the development trends and challenges in the theory and technology of welded tube plastic forming in the future. Among them, laser tailor-welded technology will find application in the manufacture of high-strength steel tubes. Tube-end forming technology, such as tube flaring and flanging technology, will expand its application in welded tubes. Therefore, future studies will focus on the FE modeling regarding how to consider effects of welding on residual stresses, welding distortions and microstructure, the inhomogeneous deformation and coordination mechanism of the plastic forming process of tailor-welded tubes, and some end-forming processes of welded tubes, and more comprehensive research on the forming mechanism and limit of welded tubes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the addition of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) for efficient use on pigment coating of paper substrates with low grammage and {{the goal was to}} achieve high optical response by using low amount of FWAs. A commercial <b>light-weight</b> coated (LWC) <b>paper</b> grade was provided by Stora Enso Corbehem Mill and isotropic laboratory sheets were produced at Stora Enso Research Centre using PFI sheet former. Optical properties such as brightness, whiteness and L, a* and b* colour space values were evaluated using Minolta spectrophotometer with D 65 illuminant for both types of substrate using different types and amounts of FWA while the effect of the addition of dye was evaluated in both isotropic sheets and {{as well as in the}} coating. The results showed that brightness and whiteness of double-coated paper increased by increasing the amount of fluorescent whitening agent in the coating layer. Also, higher brightness and whiteness was achieved by introducing a higher amount of fluorescent whitening agent in the top coating rather than in a pre-coating. The addition of a shading colorant in the paper substrate had a positive influence not only on the brightness but also on the whiteness of coated paper. Syftet med denna studie var att studera tillsatsen av fluorescerande vitmedel (FWA) för att effektivisera användningen i pigmentbestrykning av papper med låg ytvikt. Målet var att nå en hög optisk respons men ändå använda en låg mängd FWA. Ett kommersiellt LWC-papper erhölls från Stora Enso, Corbehems pappersbruk, och isotropa laboratorieark tillverkades med PFI-arkformerare på Stora Enso Research Centre. Optiska egenskaper, såsom ljushet, vithet och färgrymd (L, a* och b* värden), hos samtliga prover med varierande mängd och typ av FWA uppmättes med hjälp av en Minolta spektrofotometer med D 65 ljuskälla. Effekten av färgnyanstillsats utvärderades både hos handgjorda ark och hos bestrykningslager. Resultaten visade att både ljushet och vithet hos dubbelbestrukna ark ökade med ökad mängd FWA i bestrykningslagren. Högre ljushet och vithet nåddes också när FWA placerades i toppbestrykningen. Tillsats av nyanseringsfärg i papperssubstratet ökade både ljushet och vithet hos de bestrukna arken...|$|R
