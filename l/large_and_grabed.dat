40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite, infecting a {{broad range}} of warm-blooded hosts, including humans. T. gondii infection is a relapsing infection and causes encephalitis especially in immunocompromised patients. Miscarriage is another form of severe sequela resulting from primary T. gondii infection in pregnant women during early pregnancy. T. gondii infection occurs in livestock as well, contributing to great economic loss in the food industry. As such, it is essential to develop a vaccine to confer long-term protection from the infection. The T. gondii dense granule antigen 2 <b>and</b> 5 (<b>GRA</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>GRA</b> 5) have been targeted in this study because these proteins are essential to the development of parasitophorous vacuole (PV), a specialized compartment formed within the infected host cell.

Within Plasmodium spp., cleavage of the HT/PEXEL motif by the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protease Plasmepsin V precedes trafficking to and export across the PVM of proteins involved in pathogenicity and host cell remodelling. Here, we have functionally character-ized the T. gondii aspartyl protease 5 (ASP 5), a Golgi-resident protease that is phylogeneti-cally related to Plasmepsin V.

40|$|Dense {{granules}} are Apicomplexa specific secretory organelles. In Toxoplasma gondii, {{the dense}} granules proteins, named GRA proteins, are massively secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) shortly after invasion. Despite {{the presence of}} hydrophobic membrane segments, they are stored as both soluble and aggregated forms within the dense granules and are secreted as soluble forms into the vacuolar space where they further stably associate with PV membranes. In this study, we explored the unusual biochemical behavior of GRA proteins during their trafficking. Conventional chromatography indicated that the GRA proteins form high globular weight complexes within the parasite. To confirm these results, DeltaGRA knocked-out parasites were stably complemented with their respective HA-FLAG tagged GRA 2 or GRA 5. Purification of the tagged proteins by affinity chromatography showed that within the parasite and the PV soluble fraction, both the soluble <b>GRA</b> 2 -HA-FLAG <b>and</b> <b>GRA</b> 5 -HA-FLAG associate with several GRA proteins, the major ones being GRA 3, <b>GRA</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>GRA</b> 7.
