5|$|The {{game was}} very popular during the three-day exhibition, with players <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> see the game, {{especially}} high school students. It was shown again {{the following year}} with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels. It was then dismantled and largely forgotten until the late 1970s when Higinbotham testified in court about the game during lawsuits between Magnavox and Ralph H. Baer over video game patents. Since then, it has been celebrated {{as one of the}} earliest video games, and Brookhaven has made recreations of the original device. Under some definitions Tennis for Two is considered the first video game, as while it did not include any technological innovations over prior games, it was the first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product rather than for academic research or commercial technology promotion.|$|E
5|$|Sue Ellen {{has become}} a {{powerful}} woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for Governor of Texas, with campaign backers already <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> support her. But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising John Ross and {{will do anything to}} make things right for him. Upon seeing J.R. {{for the first time in}} years, there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when Cliff Barnes returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into a spot of submission.|$|E

25|$|The Cave 11 is {{a monastery}} (19.87 X 17.35 m) from the later 5th century. The cave veranda has pillars with {{octagonal}} shafts and square bases. The {{ceiling of the}} veranda shows evidence of floral designs and eroded reliefs. Only the center panel is discernible wherein the Buddha is seen with votaries <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> pray before him. Inside, the cave consists of a hall with a long rock bench opening into six rooms. Similar stone benches are found in Nasik caves. Another pillared verandah ends in a sanctum with seated Buddha against an incomplete stupa, and has four cells.|$|E

He began making {{plans for a new}} arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the League, which chose the Philadelphia group – including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman – over the Baltimore group.|$|E

25|$|Back Seat Dodge ’38 (1964), by Edward Kienholz, is a {{sculpture}} portraying a couple engaged {{in sexual activity}} {{in the back seat}} of a truncated 1938 Dodge automobile chassis. The piece won Kienholz instant celebrity in 1966 when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors tried to ban the sculpture as pornographic and threatened to withhold financing from LACMA if it included the work in a Kienholz retrospective. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture's car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, Back Seat Dodge ’38 has drawn crowds.|$|E
25|$|The {{guns were}} still {{operable}} so Brooke had his men return the pirates' fire. No hits were made but near hits forced the pirates {{to leave their}} wounded and abandon ship without fighting. Brooke then decided on rescuing the survivors {{though most of the}} Sulus took their weapons into the water and continued to fight. The captain also had his men refloat the steamer which was done somewhat easily. Few pirates were recovered according to McDougall and when they saved all that could be, the Rainbow and the Jolly Bachelor continued on slowly down the coast. During this time one of the pirates said that there were three more prahus nearby which were waiting for the three already engaged to rejoin them. After an hour the weather was very calm and a lookout at the masthead spotted the three enemy ships to the starboard, <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> bear their bow guns on the approaching steamers. However, when the wind picked up again the pirates changed their tactics and hoisted sail to move their ships into broadside position. As the Sarawakians neared the pirates they opened up with their swivels but Brooke waited until his ships were 250 yards away before he gave his men the order to return the fire.|$|E
25|$|Most {{aircraft}} arriving into Manchester Airport use the Instrument Landing System, {{which in}} line with most other airports has a glide slope of 3 degrees equal to descending 318 feet per nautical mile. The prevailing wind direction is westerly, so normally aircraft fly from northeast to southwest. In practice this means that normally aircraft land from the northeast over Stockport, Cheadle and Heald Green and takeoff towards Knutsford. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 1 (23R) and depart from Runway 2 (23L). When the wind direction changes, usually affecting 20% of movements per annum, operations are reversed with aircraft landing from the southwest, <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the south over Northwich and over Knutsford and taking off towards Stockport. In dual runway operations aircraft will usually land on to Runway 2 (05R) and depart from Runway 1 (05L). Sometimes, aircraft arriving into Manchester Airport are held in stacks, usually in poor weather when the movement rate decreases. The airport has 3 stacks: DAYNE, MIRSI and ROSUN, each located approximately 15/20 miles from the airport. DAYNE serves arrivals from the south, ROSUN {{from the north and}} east and MIRSI from the west. If you live within 20 miles of the airport, you will likely see and hear aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known publicly demonstrated {{electronic game}} {{was created in}} 1950. Bertie the Brain was an arcade game of tic-tac-toe, built by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. To showcase his new miniature vacuum tube, the additron tube, he designed a specialized computer to use it, which he built {{with the assistance of}} engineers from Rogers Majestic. The large metal computer, which was four meters tall, could only play tic-tac-toe on a lightbulb-backed display, and was installed in the Engineering Building at the Canadian National Exhibition from August 25 to September 9, 1950. The game was a success at the two-week exhibition, with attendees <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> play it as Kates adjusted the difficulty up and down for players. After the exhibition, Bertie was dismantled, and [...] "largely forgotten" [...] as a novelty. Kates has said that he was working on so many projects {{at the same time that}} he had no energy to spare for preserving it, despite its significance.|$|E

500|$|Dreaming of Yous U.S. {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} on June 10, 1995 to be July 18 that year. The album's release in European and Asian countries was delayed when EMI Records feared Selena's murder—rather than her music—would become {{the focal point}} of the recording. Adam Sexton, Vice-president of EMI Records, [...] announced on August 5, 1995 that the album would be released in Germany on August 14 and in the rest of Europe in September. The album's release in Asia was set for October. Fans began <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> purchase Dreaming of You hours before stores were due to open; within twenty-four hours 75% of all available copies of the album were sold. Although initial predictions placed Dreaming of You first sales at 400,000 copies, the album sold 331,000 units its first week and debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first and only predominately Spanish-language album to do so. This was the second-biggest release sales for a 1995 album, behind Michael Jackson's , and the second-largest first-week sales for a female musician, behind Janet Jackson's janet. (1993) since Nielsen Soundscan began monitoring album sales in 1991. Dreaming of You displaced Hootie & the Blowfish's Cracked Rear View from the top spot on the Billboard 200. The recording debuted atop the U.S. Billboard Top Latin Albums and the U.S. Billboard Latin Pop Albums charts, displacing Selena's 1994 album Amor Prohibido and the Gipsy Kings' Best of album, respectively.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the third}} season of Ellen, {{producers}} were becoming frustrated by the series' lack of focus and the lack of interest that the character Ellen Morgan displayed toward the standard sitcom tropes of dating and relationships. Disney boss Michael Eisner suggested that since the character showed no inclination toward dating, she should get a puppy. [...] "It was an indication of just how lost the show was that network executives would be excited by Ellen buying a puppy", said executive producer Mark Driscoll. It was this suggestion that gave writer Jonathan Stark the idea to give that working title to the episode, and it stuck. In the summer of 1996 DeGeneres and the show's other writers opened negotiations with ABC and its parent company, Disney, to have Ellen Morgan come out during season four. Word of the secret negotiations leaked in September of that year, sparking a storm of speculation as to whether the character, the actress, or both would come out. The LGBT media watchdog group Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) launched a [...] "Let Ellen Out!" [...] campaign, including an [...] "Ellen Watch" [...] website. Disney rejected the first draft of the script, with Disney executive Dean Valentine stating that it did not go far enough. Director Junger reported that Valentine said [...] "'If we're going to do it, let's do it.' Once he said to go as far as we could, it became great fun to write." [...] Once final approval from Disney was secured, ABC announced on March 3, 1997, that Ellen Morgan would be coming out. [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] went into production on March 7. Guest stars sought to be a part of the project. According to writer/producer Driscoll, [...] "Suddenly all these talented actors were <b>lining</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be in the episode. It had a buzz around it that it would be an historic episode. When Oprah came on—and she was so wonderful and open and giving—it suddenly had this great weight to it." ...|$|E
