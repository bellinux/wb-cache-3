5|$|By1929, the {{construction}} had reached Lawrence Township, where another <b>long</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> highway was built. During1930, {{the construction}} had reached Clinton, Glen Gardener, and Washington. Construction {{of the highway}} progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October1931. Construction of the highway northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in1932. The route, although the construction had reached its northern end, was not complete due to bypasses around Clinton and Pennington were proposed to be built. These bypasses were never constructed, and during1934, more portions of the highway in Hunterdon County were finished. The route was completed in1935, providing an uninterrupted route from {{the capital city of}} Trenton to northern Warren County.|$|E

More precisely, we establish a general large deviation principle for the longest success run in a two-state (success or failure) Markov chain. Our tool is based on a recent result regarding a general large deviation for the longest success run in Bernoulli trails. It turns out that the main ingredient in the proof is to implement several global and local estimates of the cumulative distribution function of the longest success run...|$|R
