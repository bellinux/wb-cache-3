5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E

5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion}} of their first New Year in 1386, {{he gave her a}} red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil to live with his step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where {{in the early years of}} their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E
5|$|Everton were {{a declining}} force, and {{finished}} 12th {{in the league}} in 1991–92 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992–93 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993–94 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker – Southall later described Walker as a man who <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3–2 after turning round a 2–0 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty.|$|E

5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, he <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort {{because of his}} love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|Two of Rainilaiarivony's cousins {{urged him}} to take his elder brother's place in order to end the shame that Rainivoninahitriniony's {{behavior}} was bringing upon their family. After weighing the idea, Rainilaiarivony approached Rasoherina with the proposal. The queen readily consented and lent her assistance in rallying {{the support of the}} nobles at court. On 14 July 1864, {{little more than a year}} after the coup, Rasoherina deposed and divorced Rainivoninahitriniony, then exiled the fallen minister the following year. Rainilaiarivony was promoted to Prime Minister. The arrangement was sealed when Rainilaiarivony took Rasoherina as his bride and demoted his longtime spouse Rasoanalina to the status of second wife. Rainilaiarivony confided in a friend shortly before his death that he deeply <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> first wife and came to share the same degree of feeling toward Rasoherina as well, but never developed the same affection for the subsequent queens he married. None of his royal spouses bore him any children.|$|E

25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, but because he <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E
