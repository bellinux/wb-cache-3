25|$|The team {{started with}} a win against {{defending}} champions Rajasthan Royals but quickly went on to <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> games under the captaincy of Kevin Pietersen. However, {{he had to leave}} for national duty and captaincy was taken over by former Indian Test captain Anil Kumble. The team fortunes reversed and they beat Deccan Chargers to secure a 3rd place after the round robin stage. At the end of round robin stage RCB had played 14 matches out of which they won 8 and lost 6 with total points of 16. In the semi final they beat the Chennai Super Kings convincingly, who were led by M S Dhoni and crushed their hopes of winning the title. However they lost the final by 6 runs, in a close match to Deccan Chargers. Also Manish Pandey became the first Indian to score a century in IPL when he made 114* (73) against Deccan Chargers in their last match in the league phase. Anil Kumble also had a very good economy rate in the tournament which was held in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|In January 2014, Stanford Corp. said {{it would}} spend $30 million {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 2014 to renovate all meeting space and the fitness facility, lobby, pool, and restaurants at the facility. The company said the hotel might <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rooms if expansion of the concierge space or fitness facility warranted it. The goal is to bring the facility up to a four-diamond status. The company also said it might lease the facility to Hilton, Marriott, or Starwood, and had not yet decided whether to retain [...] "L'Enfant Plaza" [...] as part of the name or seek a new moniker relevant to some other part of the nearby National Mall.|$|E

[...] Kyle said he responded by punching Ventura.|$|E

2500|$|A Senate {{report on}} {{intelligence}} failures would later detail the intense debate {{that went on}} behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, [...] "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> points." [...] Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to [...] "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (A PT is {{a patrol}} torpedo boat and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of obvious import were {{steps taken}} to {{preserve}} the best programming the network had, and make improvements; these were happening in the period immediately prior to, and following, {{the sale of the}} network. [...] While the Blue Network did <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> programs to NBC, such as Quiz Kids and Duffy's Tavern (more shows that debuted or had a previous run on the Blue; see Lackmann, op. cit.) and the NBC Symphony Orchestra (Lackmann, op. cit.), it did retain one highly rated show, the Jergen's Journal with Walter Winchell, which managed to compete successfully with NBC's powerhouse Sunday night lineup (it was the 11th-ranked program for all of 1943–1944, and Blue's only program in the top 20). [...] The Blue Network also retained the rights to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; Milton Cross was the host for NBC, Blue, ABC, CBS, and the opera's own broadcasts from 1931 through 1975. [...] This was {{in spite of the fact}} that NBC did not want to assign the rights to either the Town Meeting of the Air or the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts to the Blue Network.|$|E

I'd show 'em what drive was, if I had to <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of them. And when they grow weak off the Horn what'll we do? It'll be both watches all the time, which will weaken them just that much the faster." ...|$|E
60|$|Jacob spent a {{pleasant}} and a harmless evening wandering about the Sporting Club, winning and <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> five-louis plaques, and sitting {{for a while}} outside the Café de Paris.

[...] "But the more I thought over the matter the more I became convinced that something was wrong; but {{in a different way}} from what you think. I imagined your uncle had found other speculators to go in with him and they had persuaded him to cut me off. That is why I started off, after settling my other business in California, to find your uncle and learn the truth. I was willing to <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks' time out here looking around, even if it didn't pay." ...|$|E
60|$|Brooke sat silent a space. He had {{discovered}} {{by this time}} {{that it is not}} advisable to expect any excess of probity in a mining deal, and that it is the speculator, and not the men who face the perils of the wilderness (which are many, prospecting), who usually takes the profit. A handful or two of dollars for them, and a big bank balance for the trickster stock manipulator appeared to be the rules of the game. Still, nobody can expect to acquire riches without risk or labor, and it seemed no great wrong to him that the men with the dollars should <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of them occasionally. Granting that, he did not, however, feel it warranted him in taking any active part in fleecing them.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Goddard was the {{mistress}} of a School--not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent {{to be out of}} the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sixpences by his fireside.|$|E
50|$|SUVs {{became popular}} in the United States, Canada, India, and Australia in the 1990s and early-2000s. U.S. {{automakers}} could enjoy profit margins of $10,000 per SUV, while <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred dollars on a compact car. For example, the Ford Excursion could net the company $18,000, while they could not break even with the Ford Focus unless the buyer chose options, leading Detroit's big three automakers to focus on SUVs over small cars.|$|R

60|$|But {{since that}} {{peaceful}} day {{we have had}} desultory picket firing, and the great guns in the naval battery have spoken whenever an opportunity presented itself. The opposing outpost lines are drawn so far apart that with the best intentions they can scarcely harm each other. But the long range of the smallbore rifles encourages fancy shooting, {{so that there is}} often a brisk fusillade and no one any the worse. On our side we have only had one infantry soldier wounded. We do not know what the fortunes of the Boers may have been, but it is probable that they <b>lose</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> men every day from the bombardment, and certain that on Monday last there were three burghers killed and several wounded and one horse. It happened in this wise: beyond the strong Infantry pickets which remain in position always, there is a more or less extended line of cavalry outposts, which are sprinkled all along the kopjes to the east and west of the camp, and are sometimes nearly three miles from it. On the Monday in question--New Year's Day to wit--200 Boers set forth and attacked our picket on the extreme right. The picket, which was composed of the South African Light Horse, fell back with discretion, and the Boers following without their usual caution did not observe that eight troopers had been dropped behind among the rocks and ledges of a donga; so that when twelve of them attempted to make their way up this natural zigzag approach in order to fire upon the retiring picket they were themselves received at 400 yards by a well-directed sputter of musketry, and were glad to make off with five riderless horses, two men upon one horse, and leaving three lying quite still on the ground. Thereafter the picket continued to retreat unmolested.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{assassination}} of the Tulunid ruler Khumarawayh in 896, Muhammad was among those members of the court who tried to assassinate Khumarawayh's successor, Jaysh. The plot was betrayed to Jaysh, and on the very same day, they fled into the desert, leaving their families and property behind. The party crossed the Syrian Desert, <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> to thirst, and arrived in Kufa, from where they sought asylum with al-Mu'tadid. The Caliph welcomed them and allowed them to enter his service (July 896).|$|R
50|$|The Ontario Conservative Party, led by George Howard Ferguson, was re-elected for {{a second}} term in government, despite <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seats in the Legislative Assembly. The {{principal}} issue of the campaign was the government's proposal to repeal the Ontario Temperance Act and replace prohibition with government control of liquor sales. The Opposition Liberal and Progressive parties both campaigned against repeal and one of Ferguson's ministers, William Folger Nickle, resigned from the cabinet and ran for re-election against the government as a Prohibitionist candidate.|$|R
