40|$|Discarding {{occurs because}} most methods of fishing catch more fish than the {{fisherman}} can <b>legally</b> <b>land</b> and sell. Therefore any commercial fishing activity {{will result in}} discarding of unwanted catch. Discards {{can be defined as}} that portion of the total weight of undersized, un-saleable or otherwise undesirable whole fish discarded at the time of capture or shortly afterwards.

2500|$|The {{department}} {{stated that}} [...] "the land {{in question is}} in course of expropriation [...] which was expropriated by Government Notice 498 dated July 29, 1975. As such, <b>legally</b> <b>land</b> in question is still owned since deed of transfer is not finalised." [...] However, a ministerial declaration in 2006, by Tonio Borġ, who was then Minister of Justice and Home Affairs, concluded that [...] "areas {{that have been taken}} over by Government through a President's proclamation prior to 1994, even though not paid for by the Government, such as Ras ir-Raħeb, can be legally accessed by the public and not even the owner can prohibit access." [...] The Punic-Roman remains were officially scheduled in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{improving}} cross-strait relations, the first cross-strait charter flights between Taiwan and China {{were introduced in}} 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to <b>legally</b> <b>land</b> in China. (The aircraft took off from Taoyuan Airport, stopped over at Hong Kong Airport, and landed at Shanghai Pudong Airport.) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 (Taoyuan Airport to Beijing Capital Airport) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year. In 2009, regularly scheduled cross-strait flights were finally introduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{founders of}} the mill of Port Gamble, however, were {{not the first to}} occupy the Gamble Bay, the S'Klallams, or Nux Sklai Yem, had been living in the Puget Sound basin since 2400 B.C. <b>Legally,</b> <b>land</b> wasn't {{available}} for non-Native settlement until March 8, 1859, when Congress ratified the Treaty of Point No Point, which was signed January 26, 1855 by representatives of the United States and the Chemakum, S'Klallam and Skokomish nations. But by that time, S’Klallam people had moved across the bay to Point Julia. As part of an agreement between them and the mill company, the S’Klallams were given jobs at the mill and lumber to build their new homes, community facilities, and a new school. The new little town across Gamble Bay became known as Little Boston.|$|R

50|$|In November 1847, Charbonneau {{accepted}} an appointment from Colonel John D. Stevenson as alcalde (mayor) at Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. This position {{made him the}} only civilian authority, a combined sheriff, lawyer and magistrate, in a post-war region covering about 225 sq mi. From 1834-50, the lands were owned by rancheros through <b>legally</b> questionable <b>land</b> grants.|$|R
50|$|The {{expansion}} of China Airlines international presence {{has long been}} limited by the political status of Taiwan. Currently, the carrier is still unable to offer flights to destinations such as Paris. Flights to Mainland China were also not permitted until 2003, when the carrier's Chinese New Year charter flight 585 from Taipei-Taoyuan to Shanghai-Pudong via Hong Kong made China Airlines the first Taiwanese carrier to <b>legally</b> <b>land</b> in Chinese mainland and the first carrier to legally fly between the two areas after their split during the civil war. The carrier operated occasional cross-strait charter flights for another few years until 2008, when regular charters flights started. In 2009, a new air service agreement allowed China Airlines to start regularly scheduled flights to the Mainland. Since then, China has quickly become the second largest market for China Airlines, with over 130 flights to 33 destinations across the Mainland.|$|R
50|$|Influx control {{regulation}} {{was active}} in South Africa until 1986/90, while {{in the rest of}} Africa they were more or less abandoned or without effect. However, even the remnants of these regulations could have an effect on how the cities grew, since they made it difficult to get hold of <b>legally</b> owned <b>land.</b> This again led to the illegitimate occupation of land.|$|R

5000|$|The {{future of}} Malmi Airport is uncertain, as the City of Helsinki has plans for housing {{construction}} on the site. The City's activity in the matter, which increased substantially in the late 1990s, has since diminished with the ongoing big area building projects and the large land annexation from Sipoo's Östersundom in 2009. The State of Finland has a <b>legally</b> valid <b>land</b> cession agreement with the City of Helsinki until 2034.|$|R
40|$|Seminar {{organised}} by Dr Jeremie Gilbert, Centre for Human Rights in Conflict. Land {{rights are}} not typically {{perceived to be}} a human rights issue. <b>Legally,</b> <b>land</b> rights usually fall within the categories of land laws, land tenure agreements or planning regulations, but are rarely associated with human rights law. There is also very little interaction between land law and human rights. Internationally, no treaty or declaration specifically refers to a human right to land. Despite the lack of a coherent conceptual and legal framework at international level, land rights are often a key human rights issue. In many countries, access to land rights and security of tenure constitute the basis for access to food, livelihoods, housing and development for {{a large percentage of the}} population, and are an important source of national food security. Without access to land many people find themselves in a situation of great economic insecurity. Access and rights over lands are also frequently stratified on a hierarchical and segregated system where the poorest, less educated, and otherwise disadvantaged do not hold security of land tenure...|$|R

25|$|A {{minimum size}} for catch led to {{fishermen}} dumping dead fish {{that were too}} small to <b>land</b> <b>legally,</b> so a minimum mesh size was introduced, which let small fish escape to replenish stocks.
