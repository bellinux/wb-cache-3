50|$|Numerous {{books have}} been {{suppressed}} “because of language, racial characterization, or depiction of drug use, social class, or sexual orientation of the characters, or other social differences that the challengers viewed as harmful to the readers.” There are many examples of books being suppressed <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>grounds</b> in the United States. Dawn Sova authored Literature Suppressed <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Grounds,</b> a novel that lists books that have been banned or challenged on the preceding grounds {{to raise awareness of}} why books are censored. A few examples of this type of censorship are J. D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel), and Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. All of these stories have main characters who disrespect authority and live not according to societal norms and social rules. Holden Caulfield, Randle McMurphy, and Huck Finn are similar in their use of vulgar language and anti-traditionalist world views. All of these books have themes of characters who are idolized for breaking the rules and living life that is full of pleasures instead of listening and adhering to traditional order. Sova suggests that censors have sought to ban these books because they fear that the rebellious nature of the characters will lead children to follow them, meaning they will have no respect for their parents, the law or teachers.|$|R

40|$|Well-established internationally, {{the current}} {{development}} {{of social work}} in UK accident and emergency (A&E) departments {{is part of a}} conjoint health/social care policy drive to divert older people from 'unnecessary' admission to acute hospital care <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>grounds.</b> However, from older service users' standpoint, the prime criterion for assessing A&E social work is not its powers of diversion, but its contribution to optimum health and social care. Our account indicates that A&E based social work can provide important benefits, including help with negotiating the A&E environment and readier access to social services. Nevertheless, continuing professional-service user power imbalances, together with shortages in health and social care services, undermine its positive contribution both within A&E and following discharge. Notably, underresourced community based health and social care can lead to services implemented through A&E, swiftly unravelling. This has serious consequences for older service users facing interlinked health and social problems, and may be implicated in re-attendance at AE...|$|R
40|$|Mainly in {{response}} to the policy drive to avoid unnecessary acute hospital admissions and delayed discharge <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>grounds,</b> there has been a gradual development of social work services attached to emergency departments (EDs) in the UK. In the absence of a clearly articulated evidence base or debate about the roles of ED attached social workers, a model of ED based social work practice and indicative supporting evidence is presented. It is argued that social workers may be able to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital services while providing a key point of access to social care services. A number of obstacles remain to the implementation of this model of service, including the narrow focus of current social care practice, the hours that a social work service is normally provided, chronic under-funding, and continuing perverse incentives in the health and social care system. More systematic evidence in the UK context is needed to support the case for change...|$|R
