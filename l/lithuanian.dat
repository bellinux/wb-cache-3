5|$|After the uprising, Poland {{repressed}} <b>Lithuanian</b> {{cultural life}} in Sejny. <b>Lithuanian</b> schools in Sejny (which had some 300 pupils) and surrounding villages were closed. The local <b>Lithuanian</b> clergy were evicted, and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated. According to Lithuanians, the repressions {{were even more}} far-reaching, including a ban on public use of the <b>Lithuanian</b> language and the closing of <b>Lithuanian</b> organizations, which had a total of 1,300 members. The New York Times, reporting on renewed hostilities a year later, described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles, in which the <b>Lithuanian</b> inhabitants, teachers, and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled. Polish historian Łossowski notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: the <b>Lithuanian</b> press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the <b>Lithuanian</b> National Revival, and a sense of the <b>Lithuanian</b> national identity continued to grow. The first <b>Lithuanian</b> political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and <b>Lithuanian</b> Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in <b>Lithuanian</b> {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the <b>Lithuanian</b> participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. The memories of that time and the discussion of those events in Jewish and <b>Lithuanian</b> historiographies are quite different, although <b>Lithuanian</b> historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to <b>Lithuanian</b> historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the <b>Lithuanian</b> Activist Front, the <b>Lithuanian</b> Provisional Government and participation of <b>Lithuanian</b> civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{orders of}} Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Polish forces took Augustów from <b>Lithuanians</b> in a {{surprise}} attack on August 28. Confused and disoriented, <b>Lithuanians</b> retreated from Suwałki and Sejny on August 30 and 31. The <b>Lithuanians</b> reorganized, gathered their forces (11 battalions with 7,000 soldiers), and organized a counterattack to [...] "defend their border" [...] on September 2. The {{goal was to}} take and secure the Augustów-Lipsk-Hrodna line. The <b>Lithuanians</b> succeeded in taking Sejny and Lipsk and by September 4 reached the outskirts of Augustów. On September 5, the Poles counterattacked and forced the <b>Lithuanians</b> to retreat. On September 9, the Polish forces recaptured Sejny, but the <b>Lithuanians</b> pushed back and regained Sejny and Giby on September 13 and 14. Pending direct negotiations, hostilities were ceased on both sides.|$|R
50|$|In 1708, the Kingdom of Prussia {{was devastated}} by plague, {{especially}} its easternmost part, where Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> lived. About 50% of Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> died. To {{compensate for the}} loss, King Frederick II of Prussia invited settlers from Salzburg, the Palatinate, and Nassau to repopulate the area. Many of these Lutherans {{were members of the}} Pietism movement, which then spread among Prussian <b>Lithuanians.</b> In 1811 a teacher's seminary for Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> was established in Karalene near Insterburg, which remained open until 1924. From the mid-18th century, a majority of Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> were literate; in comparison, the process was much slower in the Grand Duchy.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems likely}} that the <b>Lithuanians</b> mustered an army near Vilnius as a {{strategic}} maneuver, since <b>Lithuanians</b> could use the downstream flow of the Neris River to transport artillery and military provisions from Vilnius; the Knights were forced to use overland or upstream transport. During the 1384 assault, the <b>Lithuanians</b> deployed cannons and trebuchets; the besieged Teutonic Knights had also installed cannons in the castle, which apparently destroyed the Lithuanians' trebuchet. Nevertheless, the castle was retaken by the <b>Lithuanians.</b>|$|R
5|$|According to <b>Lithuanian</b> {{historian}} Lesčius, {{the first}} Polish assault of about 300 PMO members on August 22 was repelled, {{but the next}} day Lithuanians were forced to retreat towards Lazdijai. Over 100 Lithuanians were imprisoned in Sejny when their commander Bardauskas sided with the Poles. The Polish insurgents also attacked Lazdijai and Kapčiamiestis, towns on the <b>Lithuanian</b> side of the Foch Line.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{statistics}} of 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate. It is {{generally agreed that}} Lithuanians formed the majority population in the northern Suwałki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in south. But, <b>Lithuanian</b> and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over {{the location of the}} line that separated the <b>Lithuanian</b> from the Polish majorities. Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was <b>Lithuanian.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Suwałki Region had {{strategic}} {{importance in the}} Polish–Soviet War.

50|$|Latvians, {{like their}} Balts neighbors <b>Lithuanians,</b> also began playing {{basketball}} in 1920s. Though, {{they were much}} more advanced back then than their frequent rivals <b>Lithuanians.</b> On 13 December 1925 in Riga, <b>Lithuanians</b> played their first international game. Latvians easily swept them with result 41-20. Later on, Latvians were crushing the future three-times European champions <b>Lithuanians</b> as well (41-29 or even 123-10). In fact, Latvia {{had one of the}} world's strongest national basketball teams. The first Latvians teams consisted of students and pupils, who were trained by coaches of American YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association).|$|R
50|$|In 2001, a {{documentary}} Eldorado: <b>Lithuanians</b> in Brazil or (Portuguese title: Eldorado: Lituanos no Brasil), by Fabiano Canosa and Julius Ziz was released {{about the story}} of <b>Lithuanians</b> in Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the <b>Lithuanian</b> Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The <b>Lithuanian</b> people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from <b>Lithuanian</b> farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite <b>Lithuanian</b> requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized <b>Lithuanian</b> ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to <b>Lithuanian</b> proposals and demands.|$|E
5|$|By faith, {{nineteen}} of the signatories were Roman Catholics, although Jonas Basanavičius was not practicing. Jokūbas Šernas was {{the only}} professed Protestant Reformer. At {{the time of the}} Act of Independence, six of the signatories were officially nonpartisan, seven were members of the conservative <b>Lithuanian</b> Christian Democratic Party, two were affiliated with the <b>Lithuanian</b> National Union and the Social Democratic Party, and Jonas Vileišis was affiliated with the Party of National Progress and the left-wing <b>Lithuanian</b> Popular Socialist Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|During 1988, {{when the}} <b>Lithuanian</b> {{movement}} towards independence was gaining strength, the <b>Lithuanian</b> Supreme Soviet again recognized the tricolor {{as the national}} flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the <b>Lithuanian</b> SSR. The flag was defined as rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of Soviet flags). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the <b>Lithuanians</b> in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The <b>Lithuanians</b> claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the <b>Lithuanians</b> had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused the <b>Lithuanians</b> of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{boundaries}} of Prussia (from 1871, {{part of the}} German Empire), having remained unchanged since the Treaty of Melno in 1422, became a matter of discussion following World War I, as the newly independent states of Poland and Lithuania emerged. The separatist Act of Tilsit was signed by few pro-Lithuanian oriented Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> in 1918, demanding the unification of Prussian Lithuania with Lithuania proper. It is traditionally viewed by <b>Lithuanians</b> as expressing the desire of Lithuania Minor to unite with Lithuania - {{but the majority of}} Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> did not want to join with Lithuania and the Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> did not make up a majority of the population.|$|R
50|$|Communities of Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> have {{developed}} in Canada, the United States, Sweden and Australia. However, a separate {{ethnic and cultural}} identity for Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> is {{not as strong as}} it once was, and cultural differences are gradually vanishing.|$|R
5|$|During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany {{maintained}} a relatively normal relationship {{as they were}} united by anti-Polish sentiment. In January 1928, after long and difficult negotiations, Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty, which left Klaipėda on the <b>Lithuanian</b> side. However, tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany. An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the <b>Lithuanian</b> government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists. In response to these arrests and trials, Germany declared a boycott of <b>Lithuanian</b> agricultural imports. The boycott caused an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), where farmers organized violent protests. However, after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro-Nazi prisoners received amnesty. In {{the wake of the}} amnesties, <b>Lithuanian</b> prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda, allowing Germany to strengthen its influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{disagree}} about who initiated {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the <b>Lithuanian</b> Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the <b>Lithuanian</b> press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the <b>Lithuanian</b> people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} the <b>Lithuanian</b> state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of <b>Lithuanian</b> autonomy.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, two {{separate}} teams, one German and one <b>Lithuanian,</b> announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team {{pointed to a}} silver mine while the <b>Lithuanian</b> team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two suggestions turned out to hold the Amber Room.|$|E
50|$|While other {{immigrant}} {{ethnic groups}} in Baltimore founded numerous ethnic {{building and loan associations}} between the 1860s and the 1910s, <b>Lithuanians</b> only founded one. This is because many <b>Lithuanians</b> shared the associations of other ethnic groups, especially those of the Polish.|$|R
50|$|Kęstutis and Algirdas led their army, {{composed}} of <b>Lithuanians,</b> Samogitians, Ruthenians, and Tatars, to Prussia earlier than anticipated by the Knights. The <b>Lithuanians</b> took and burned Rudau Castle. Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode {{decided to take}} his army from Königsberg to meet the <b>Lithuanians</b> near Rudau. Contemporary Teutonic sources do not give details about {{the course of the}} battle, which is somewhat unusual. Details and battle plans were later provided by Jan Długosz (1415-1480), but his sources are unknown.|$|R
50|$|While most {{linguists}} {{agree that}} Nadruvians {{were one of}} the Prussian clans, some historians argue that they were a separate tribe, more closely related to western <b>Lithuanians</b> than to Prussians. The matter is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the area was largerly depopulated by the crusades against Prussians and <b>Lithuanians.</b> It was repopulated by bringing colonists from Germany and Lithuania (see Lithuania Minor). Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether <b>Lithuanians</b> originally lived there or migrated later on.|$|R
5|$|In {{early morning}} of August 25, Lithuanians counterattacked and recaptured Sejny. Polish sources claim that Lithuanians there were {{aided by a}} company of Germans volunteers, but <b>Lithuanian</b> sources assert {{that it was an}} excuse used by Rudnicki to explain his defeat. The <b>Lithuanian</b> forces {{recovered}} some important documents and property, freed <b>Lithuanian</b> prisoners and, according to Mańczuk, executed several of the PMO fighters they found wounded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the <b>Lithuanian</b> {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated <b>Lithuanian</b> border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that {{would serve as a}} rationale for a full-scale military attack.|$|E
5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, <b>Lithuanian</b> Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and <b>Lithuanian</b> identity in the fifteenth century.|$|E
50|$|In July 1273 the <b>Lithuanians</b> invaded Lublin. In retaliation, Leszek II the Black {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to Yotvingia in December of that year. In 1278 the <b>Lithuanians</b> again invaded Lublin, and they clashed with Leszek II's army at the Battle of Łukow.|$|R
50|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that Prussian <b>Lithuanians</b> were autochthones to East Prussia. The base for it was A. Bezzenberger's line of Prussian-Lithuanian {{language}} limit. The theory proposed that Nadruvians and Scalovians were western <b>Lithuanians</b> and ancestors of Lietuvininks. It was prevalent until 1919.|$|R
50|$|Lithuania {{is one of}} {{the most}} pro-American nations in Europe and the world, with 73% of <b>Lithuanians</b> viewing the U.S. {{positively}} in 2011. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 48% of <b>Lithuanians</b> approve of U.S. leadership, with 20% disapproving and 32% uncertain.|$|R
5|$|Postwar {{assessments}} of the Home Army's activities in Lithuania have been controversial. In 1993, the Home Army's activities there were investigated by a special <b>Lithuanian</b> government commission. Only {{in recent years have}} Polish and <b>Lithuanian</b> historians been able to approach consensus, though still differing in their interpretations of many events.|$|E
5|$|Romualdas Marcinkus (22 July 1907 – 29 March 1944) was a <b>Lithuanian</b> pilot. Marcinkus {{participated in}} an early trans-European flight on 25 June 1934, and was the only <b>Lithuanian</b> pilot {{to serve in the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. In his youth Marcinkus was a <b>Lithuanian</b> multifold {{football}} champion and a playing coach for the Lithuania national football team.|$|E
5|$|Shurna {{was born}} in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, to Tony and Suzy Shurna. At Northwestern, he was a double major in {{sociology}} and learning and organizational change. On July 11, 2014, Shurna acquired <b>Lithuanian</b> citizenship per <b>Lithuanian</b> nationality law.|$|E
50|$|A {{distinctive}} practice dominated in {{the ethnic}} region of Lithuania Minor, then {{being a part}} of East Prussia, where Lithuanized German personal names were common, such as Ansas (Hans), Grėtė (Gretchen), Vilius (Wilhelm) among Prussian <b>Lithuanians.</b> Some of them are still in use among <b>Lithuanians</b> at present.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lithuanians</b> {{helped the}} {{children}} of East Prussia commuting to Lithuania to find nourishment and called them vokietukai (little Germans). They adopted {{some of the younger}} ones, even though <b>Lithuanians</b> risked severe treatment by the Soviet authorities should it be detected that they sheltered wolf children.|$|R
50|$|Year later, <b>Lithuanians</b> {{participated in}} the 1998 FIBA World Championship. Despite {{successful}} European competition, <b>Lithuanians</b> lost the quarter-finals game to 1994's World champions, Brazil's national team, 70-72 and had to play for fifth place. There they lost to Spain's national team 59-70 and took only 8th place.|$|R
