5|$|All {{his adult}} life, Pflueger {{maintained}} his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown {{late into the}} evening, {{he was known to}} spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> on his arm. Pflueger never married and left no children. His brother Milton, fifteen years younger, had been working with the firm since the 1930s and, at Tim's death, Milton reorganized and headed the company, doing business as Milton T. Pflueger, Architect.|$|E
25|$|Randolph Churchill {{alleged that}} Macleod almost {{resigned}} on 4 November. Nigel Fisher wrote {{that this was}} not so, but that Macleod would have resigned if Butler had done so. Robert Carr, junior minister at the Ministry of Labour, wrote that Macleod had doubts but was not especially morally outraged, and saw no evidence that he planned to resign. William Rees-Mogg claimed that Butler persuaded Macleod not to resign, while a <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> of Macleod’s recorded him turning up at her flat, demanding a drink, and declaring {{that he would have to}} resign having learned that Eden had deceived the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|On the French Riviera, Andrew {{lived in}} a small apartment, or hotel rooms, or on board a yacht with his <b>lady</b> <b>friend,</b> Countess Andrée de La Bigne. His {{marriage}} to Alice was effectively over, and after her recovery and release, she returned to Greece. In 1936, his sentence of exile was quashed by emergency laws, which also restored land and annuities to the King. Andrew returned to Greece for a brief visit that May. The following year, his daughter Cécile, son-in-law and two of his grandchildren were killed in an air accident at Ostend; he met Alice {{for the first time in}} six years at the funeral, which was also attended by Hermann Göring.|$|E

25|$|In 1766, he was {{expelled}} from Warsaw following a pistol duel with Colonel Franciszek Ksawery Branicki over an Italian actress, a <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> of theirs. Both duelists were wounded, Casanova on the left hand. The hand recovered on its own, after Casanova refused the recommendation of doctors that it be amputated. From Warsaw, he traveled to Breslau in the Kingdom of Prussia, then to Dresden, where he contracted yet another venereal infection. He returned to Paris for several months in 1767 and hit the gambling salons, only to be expelled from France by order of Louis XV himself, primarily for Casanova's scam involving the Marquise d'Urfé. Now known across Europe for his reckless behavior, Casanova would have difficulty overcoming his notoriety and gaining any fortune. So he headed for Spain, where he was not as well known. He tried his usual approach, leaning on well-placed contacts (often Freemasons), wining and dining with nobles of influence, and finally arranging an audience with the local monarch, in this case Charles III. When no doors opened for him, however, he could only roam across Spain, with little to show for it. In Barcelona, he escaped assassination and landed in jail for six weeks. His Spanish adventure a failure, he returned to France briefly, then to Italy.|$|E
500|$|For {{the album}} cover, Barrett painted {{the floor of}} his bedroom in Wetherby Mansions orange and purple. The nude woman {{appearing}} {{on the back of the}} record sleeve was an acquaintance of his known as [...] "Iggy the Eskimo". Photographer Mick Rock says, [...] "When I arrived for 'The Madcap Laughs' photo session, Syd was still in his underpants [...]. His <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> of two weeks, 'Iggy the Eskimo', was naked in the kitchen [...]." [...] Iggy met Barrett in March 1969, through Barrett's then-girlfriend, Jenny Spires. Barrett had moved into Wetherby Mansions, and Jenny took Iggy there one evening. Iggy stayed on at the flat when Jenny left for The States a couple of weeks later. Iggy didn't know who Barrett was or that he was previously in Pink Floyd. Iggy heard Barrett play several songs that would later appear on the album, one being [...] "Terrapin", which she called [...] "quite catchy". In October 2010 she was interviewed, revealing that her name was Evelyn. The album was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The original sleeve featured no musician credits, barring producer credit; later issues contain musician credits. On the original release, track 10 is listed as [...] "She Took a Long Cold Look", although on the 2010 remaster the track is re-titled to [...] "She Took a Long Cool Look", in similar vein to An Introduction to Syd Barrett.|$|E
2500|$|Walken is {{also known}} {{for his part in}} one of Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch's [...] "The Lovers" [...] skits. His {{character}} brought a <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> to meet The Lovers, and she is subjected to learning the past history that Walken's character shares with The Lovers. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror ("She was willing to accept her lover's body in places no one had ever trespassed...specifically, the ear canal").|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then {{owner of}} the Boston Red Sox, sold a group of his star players to the New York Yankees. Amongst them was George Herman Ruth, known affectionately as [...] "Babe". The story that Frazee did so in order to fund {{theatrical}} shows on Broadway for his actress <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> is unfounded. No, No, Nanette was indeed first produced in 1925 by Harry Frazee, though the sale of baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees had occurred five years earlier. In the lore of the Curse of the Bambino, Frazee supposedly needed to sell Ruth among other reasons to make up for his lack of financial success up to that point in making Broadway shows, and it was hitting it big with No, No, Nanette in 1925 that paid off the loan.|$|E
2500|$|Whelan, who {{had just}} left the house of Richard Quinn where he had {{mentioned}} that his boss Mr. Eagleson {{had been arrested for}} the murder, was found in a tavern belonging to Michael Starr at 9:30pm. He was searched. A Sgt. Davis produced from Whelan's front right pocket a [...]32 Smith & Wesson pistol, serial #50847, with all six rounds still loaded. The other officers present took from his pocket a box of cartridges, some papers, the Irish American newspaper from a month earlier, a green silk badge of the Toronto Hibernian Benevolent Society, a membership card for the St. Patrick's Benevolence Society, a photograph of a lady, a ticket from the St. Patrick's Literary Society, two tickets the shamrock Quadrille Club inviting Whelan and a <b>lady</b> <b>friend.</b> By 9 April, the 28-year-old Whelan was considered the prime suspect and charged with the murder.|$|E

2500|$|He {{offered her}} a lift back to her home on the Crumlin Road and they drove away from the pub at about 11:30 in Wilson's red mini. The couple never arrived at their destination. At 1:30, the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), using their codename [...] "Captain Black", called the Belfast News Letter advising them that, [...] " [...] tonight we have got Senator Paddy Wilson and a <b>lady</b> <b>friend.</b> Their bodies are lying in the Hightown Road." [...] The UFF had been founded that same year by John White, who {{employed}} the pseudonym [...] "Captain Black". The UFF was a cover name to claim attacks {{carried out by the}} then-legal Ulster Defence Association to avoid the latter's proscription by the British Government. [...] "Captain Black" [...] furthermore claimed that the killings were in retaliation for the shooting death of a mentally-retarded Protestant teenager the previous summer by the Provisional IRA.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin paid a {{visit to}} his brother Erasmus's <b>lady</b> <b>friend</b> the {{literary}} Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological [...] "process of world making" [...] that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. He sat there for almost an hour. [...] "She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman." [...] In her autobiography, she later recalled Charles as being [...] "simple, childlike, painstaking, effective".|$|E
