[...] Of treasure bindings from this period, only the <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of the Lindau Gospels (750–800, Morgan Library) now survives complete, though there are several references to them, most famously {{to that of the}} Book of Kells, which was lost after a theft in 1007. [...] Various metal fragments of what were probably book-mounts have survived, usually adapted as jewellery by Vikings. [...] In the context of the cult of Cuthbert, the lavishly illuminated Lindisfarne Gospels were made at Lindisfarne, probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel, with covers involving metalwork, perhaps entirely made in it, which are also now lost. [...] Plainer, very early bindings in leather are almost as rare as treasure bindings, as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed, and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining.|$|E

However the designs may well have been very similar; the best surviving Insular example, the <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of the Lindau Gospels in the Morgan Library in New York, is also centred on a large cross, surrounded by interlace panels.

5000|$|Seeding {{especially}} with native seed mixes is increasingly being proposed to recover post wildfire plant species, manage invasive non-native plant populations and establish valued vegetation compositions. Compared to seeding for soil stabilization, ecosystem recovery and restoration {{is far more}} complex and take several decades to fully evaluate. Some recent comparison studies provide early evidence on seeding’s contribution to overall post wildfire recovery. A study at Mesa Verde National Park compared seeded burned areas with unseeded burned areas and unburned areas and found that seeded burned areas had significantly less non-native plants than unseeded burned areas but significantly more than unburned areas except {{there was no significant}} difference in cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) between seeded or unseeded burned areas. [...] In northwestern Nevada from 1984-1997 cheatgrass density was altered by changing the seeding rates of a variety of native and non-native perennial grass and forb seed mixes. Cheatgrass densities were reduced to 2.6 plants per sq. m with seeding rates of 22.5 - 25 PLS per sq ft. Cheatgrass densities of 4.07 and 3.58 plants per sq. m were obtained with seeding rates of 10 and 35 PLS per sq. ft., respectively. [...] On three burned areas in Colorado and New Mexico where native grass seeding was hand, drilled or aerially applied, there was a positive relationship between native species richness and non-native species cover and negative relationship between dominant native plant cover and non-native species cover. [...] In a Utah study, all native perennial seeded plots had <b>lower</b> <b>cover</b> of annual species than unseeded plots; however, by the third year following seeding there was little change in seeded native species density, but the density of annuals more than doubled with cheatgrass and three annual forbs making up the majority of plant density. A California grassland study found that regardless of the treatment, exotic annual and native perennials were able to coexist; neither extirpated the other: exotic annuals persisted in plots to which native perennials had been added and vice versa.|$|E
