50|$|The front brakes were double <b>leading</b> <b>shoes,</b> and {{the rear}} {{had a single}} <b>leading</b> <b>shoe.</b> By modern standards, they were not good brakes. Tires, front and rear, were {{interchangeable}} in 3.50 inch by 18 inch size.|$|R
50|$|The twin-leading-shoe brake (2LS) {{is a type}} of {{drum brake}} that has two <b>leading</b> <b>shoes,</b> rather than the single <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> and a single {{trailing}} shoe of a single-leading shoe (SLS) drum brake. A <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> has a self-servo effect, so an advantage of a 2LS is that it provides the maximum retardation in its intended direction of travel, i.e. forwards. 2LS brakes are fitted on the front axle of automobiles, or the front wheel of a motorcycle. A 2LS brake is more powerful than an SLS design.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "leading/trailing" [...] {{means that}} only one shoe is [...] "leading", moving into the {{rotation}} of the drum and thus exhibiting a self-servo (or self-applying) effect. The <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> is [...] "dragged" [...] into the friction surface of the drum and thus achieving greater braking force. [...] The other shoe is [...] "trailing", moving against the direction of rotation, is thrown away from the friction surface of the drum and is far less effective. An advantage of an SLS brake is that is equally effective whether the vehicle is travelling forwards or in reverse. [...] When the vehicle is moving in reverse, the role of the <b>leading</b> and trailing <b>shoes</b> is switched. What would be the <b>leading</b> <b>shoe</b> when the vehicle is travelling forwards becomes the trailing shoe, and vice versa.|$|R
