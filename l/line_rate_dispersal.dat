We find conflicting results regarding the relationship between local extinction rate and evolutionarily stable (ES) <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> depending on which principal mechanism causes extinction: if extinction is caused by environmental catastrophes eradicating local populations, we observe a positive correlation between extinction and ES dispersal rate; if extinction is a consequence of stochastic local dynamics and environmental fluctuations, the correlation becomes ambiguous; and in cases where extinction is caused by dispersal mortality, a negative correlation between local extinction <b>rate</b> and ES <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> emerges.

30|$|For the two-species {{competition}} mode, given a {{fixed length}} of the habitat, there is a living interval (d, d) containing d_ 0 as an interior point, such that a species adopting the diffusion strategy and <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> in this interval will replace its competitor with its <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> outside the interval (Theorem  2.2).

40|$|International audienceA Markovian {{extinction}} {{model that}} takes into account age structure of local populations allows consideration of the effects of demography and successional dynamics on the evolution of migration. Analytical expressions for the evolutionarily stable (ES) <b>rates</b> of <b>dispersal</b> are given for cases in which newly recolonized sites attain carrying capacity within a single season. Using a low-fecundity numerical model, we find that an increase of the level of site saturation increases the <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate.</b> Ecological successions and unequal local extinction rates between newly colonized sites and established populations strongly affect the ES <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate.</b> The frequency of genetic modifiers that enhance the <b>rate</b> of <b>dispersal</b> evolves negative correlations with deme age, with high-migration genotypes predominant among colonizers while progressively declining in frequency as a deme ages. This suggests that between-deme selection (colonization) favors migrants while within-deme selection favors low dispersers, which allows the coexistence of types with different <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates.</b> Because of the interaction between the two levels of selection, the relation between the ES <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> and the deme maximal lifetime is nonmonotone. We suggest that life-history traits other than dispersal might also experience antagonistic selective forces at the between- and within-deme levels...|$|R

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that diffusive dispersal can permit persistence in an advective environment. This paper studies {{in some sense}} the optimal diffusion rate of species in a flowing habitat with hostile downstream boundary conditions. Firstly, we study the dependence of the critical length of the habitat on the <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> d. It is shown that the critical length first decreases and then increases and asymptotically tends to infinity. Then there is a unique optimal diffusion rate d_ 0 for a single species to evolve. Then, by using this observation, we study the competition system of two species which are the same but only with different <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates.</b> We get an open finite interval, which is a neighborhood of d_ 0, such that, {{if one of the}} <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> lies within the interval but the other rate falls outside, then competition exclusion occurs.

40|$|Based on a {{marginal}} value approach, we derive a nonlinear expression for evolutionarily stable (ES) <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> in a metapopulation with global dispersal. For the general case of density-dependent population growth, our analysis shows that individual <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> should decrease with patch capacity and-beyond a certain threshold-increase with population density. We performed {{a number of}} spatially explicit, individual-based simulation experiments to test these predictions and to explore further the relevance of variation {{in the rate of}} population increase, density dependence, environmental fluctuations and dispersal mortality on the evolution of <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates.</b> They confirm the predictions of our analytical approach. In addition, they show that <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> in metapopulations mostly depend on dispersal mortality and inter-patch variation in population density. The latter is dominantly driven by environmental fluctuations and the rate of population increase. These conclusions are not altered by the introduction of neighbourhood dispersal. With patch capacities in the order of 100 individuals, kin competition seems to be of negligible importance for ES <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> except when overall <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> are low...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> in a two patch metapopulation model. The local dynamics in each patch are given by difference equations, which, together with the <b>rate</b> of <b>dispersal</b> between the patches, determine the ecological dynamics of the metapopulation. We assume that phenotypes are given by their <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate.</b> The evolutionary dynamics in phenotype space are determined by invasion exponents, which describe whether a mutant can invade a given resident population. If the resident metapopulation is at a stable equilibrium, then selection on <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> is neutral if the population sizes in the two patches are the same, while selection drives <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> to zero if the local abundances are different. With non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics, non-zero <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> can be maintained by selection. In this case, and if the patches are ecologically identical, <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> always evolve to values which induce synchronized metapopulation dynamics. If the patches are ecologically different, evolutionary branching into two coexisting dispersal phenotypes can be observed. Such branching can happen repeatedly, leading to polymorphisms with more than two phenotypes. If there is a cost to dispersal, evolutionary cycling in phenotype space can occur due to the dependence of selection pressures on the ecological attractor of the resident population, or because phenotypic branching alternates with the extinction {{of one of the}} branches. Our results extend those of Holt and McPeek (1996), and suggest that phenotypic branching is an important evolutionary process. This process may be relevant for sympatric speciation...|$|R

40|$|A prey species using crypsis {{to avoid}} predators has the {{opportunity}} to evolve polymorphic crypsis when it is being exposed to two (or more) habitats with different backgrounds. Here, we investigate when this phenomenon can occur, in a simulation study with a sexually reproducing prey and a predator that can learn to find hiding prey, represented by an artificial neural network. Initially, the prey is well adapted to one habitat, but tries to expand its range by invading another, different, habitat. This can cause the prey to evolve toward an intermediate phenotype, equally cryptic in both habitats. The prey can also fail in adapting to its new environment, and stay the same. Alternatively, it can evolve polymorphic crypsis. We find that the evolutionary outcome depends on the amount of dispersal between the habitats, with polymorphic crypsis evolving for low <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates,</b> an intermediate phenotype will evolve for intermediate <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates</b> and no adaptation to the new habitat will occur for high <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates.</b> The distribution of phenotypes of the prey will also vary for different <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates,</b> with narrow distributions for low and high <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> and a wide distribution for intermediate <b>dispersal</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{relationship}} between the <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> and the conditions for invasion of a rare allele that improves performance in a marginal sink habitat at the expense of reducing fitness in the main source habitat.

Precisely the opposite prediction was reached in demographic fitness-sensitivity studies. This study reconciles those contradictory predictions and identifies the assumptions responsible for the discrepancy. I show that whether a lower <b>dispersal</b> <b>rate</b> makes the conditions for the invasion of the allele more or less stringent depends on the magnitude {{of the effects of the}} allele.
