Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

25|$|Following World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 He Who Gets Slapped was {{the first}} film {{released}} by MGM; in 1925 Sally of the Sawdust (remade 1930), Variety, and Vaudeville were produced, followed by The Devil's Circus in 1926 and The Circus starring Charlie Chaplin, Circus Rookies, 4 Devils; and Laugh Clown <b>Laugh</b> <b>in</b> 1928.

He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and [...] "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as [...] "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that [...] "he was loud in every possible way—in his voice, in his <b>laugh,</b> <b>in</b> his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life".

Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil <b>laugh.</b> <b>In</b> a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying [...] "his voice is so rich." [...] Writer George Meyer commented that [...] "writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing." ...|$|E

500|$|Ling Bouvier, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is Selma Bouvier's adopted daughter. She shares Selma' s <b>laugh.</b> <b>In</b> [...] "Goo Goo Gai Pan", Selma discovers {{that she has}} reached {{menopause}} and adopts Ling in China, after lying that she is married to Homer, to fool the Chinese authorities into thinking that Ling {{would be part of}} a traditional family as opposed to being raised by a single mother. The authorities briefly reclaim Ling, but the adoption agent Ms. Woo relates to her experiences of her childhood with her single mother and allows Selma to adopt Ling. Ling has since become a recurring character and has appeared in several episodes. She seems to get along well with her cousin Maggie. Since Patty told Selma to give up smoking once the baby came home, Selma claimed she would switch to chewing tobacco, although it is not clear if she has followed through with this.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} SpongeBob was {{originally}} used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use.

When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob."

After a brief frolic with prostitutes and a period of reflection, Pike and the gang try to forcibly persuade Mapache to release Angel, who by then was barely alive after the torture. The general appears to comply; however, as they watch, the general instead cuts Angel's throat. Pike and Engstrom angrily gun Mapache {{down in front of}} his men. For a moment, the federales are so shocked that they fail to return fire, causing Engstrom to <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> surprise. Pike calmly takes aim at Mohr and kills him, too. This results in a violent, bloody shootout—dominated by the machine gun—in which Pike and his men are killed, along with most of Mapache's present troops and the remaining German adviser.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that dirty little Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's the pity, for together if they were together they might do a great deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain {{is a man of}} rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create its personality. Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. Tom had already worked on lots of other animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice.

[...] He dropped out of an MFA program at Syracuse University when in 1968 he felt a [...] "call to arms" [...] to move to San Francisco, where the nascent [...] scene was blossoming amid the counterculture there. [...] That year Green introduced a religion-obsessed character in the strip [...] "Confessions of a Mad School Boy", published in a periodical in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1968.

Reitman {{emerges as a}} modern-day Frank Capra, {{capturing}} the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." [...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, {{it would be hard}} to <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenny voices SpongeBob SquarePants and {{a variety}} of other characters, {{including}} SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life and, when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the main character. Kenny originally used the voice of SpongeBob for a minor character on Rocko. He forgot how to perform the voice initially and did not intend to use it afterwards. Hillenburg, however, used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny perform the voice, he immediately knew he wanted it for his character. He said to Nickelodeon executives, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] The network insisted on auditioning more actors, but Hillenburg turned them down; in the words of Tom Kenny, [...] "one of the advantages of having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'" [...] While Kenny was developing SpongeBob's voice, the show's casting crew wanted him to have a unique, high-pitched <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.|$|E
500|$|Fuse writer Jason Newman {{called the}} clip an ode to D'Angelo {{and went on}} to state it worked as part {{underwear}} commercial, part shower commercial. Writing for the Italian edition of Vogue, Valentina Veneziano concluded that the video showcased Beyoncé's positive attitude portrayed through her <b>laugh</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Rocket". Meghan O'Keefe from VH1 argued that the video was the first to focus on Beyoncé's [...] "voluptuous curve, toned muscle, raised goosebumps and bleached strands of bed head". Brent DiCrescenzo from the magazine Time Out found influences by Madonna from her work on the album Erotica (1992) and the book Sex (1992). Vanity Fair reviewer Michelle Collins opined that the video opened with shots of Beyoncé on a bed to slightly change the overall feeling present on the album. Insanul Ahmed writing in Complex remarked that things [...] "get sensual" [...] in [...] "Rocket"'s clip. Whitney Phaneuf of the website HitFix was more critical towards the visual, saying that it [...] "may be the sexiest video of the bunch, but it's achieved in such a conventional way that it ends up being boring". On December 21, 2013, eight days following the release of the video for [...] "Rocket", CTV News reported that the hotel where the clip was filmed would earn profit from the exposure in the album.|$|E
