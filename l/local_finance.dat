The fungibility of aid need not translate into resource flows to fill the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap. Indeed, project aid can widen the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap. To augment direct <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> of development, aid must be nonproject aid that can generate local currency. In the longer term, project aid's effect on <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> lies in its impact on growth and on expanding the base for tax revenues, seigniorage, and borrowing. When inadequate <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> limits project implementation and effective use of aid, local currency funds are more valuable than project aid, at the margin [...] and it becomes important to reallocate local funds, to leverage project aid, and to raise the quality of investment projects. A persistent gap in <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> complicates programs of fiscal reform. For such programs to be effective, the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap has to be confronted directly by matching planned local fund expenditures against expected local fund receipts. This requires a transparent database to develop indicators and to monitor the allocation and use of local resources.

Local authorities - city councils and mayors – must manage in the name and interest of local collectivities the public business and resources. Many responsibilities were transferred to local administration, getting the first base with financial decentralization, trying to get administration next to citizens, as much as possible. Local authorities have a lot of responsibilities managing <b>local</b> <b>finances.</b> <b>Local</b> <b>finances</b> represent the process of constitution, distribution and utilisation of local incoming funds.

40|$|Inadequacy of <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> {{has been}} a major {{development}} financing problem in most low income economies, and is cited as a major factor undercutting aid absorption and “sustainability ” of development projects. When inadequate <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> limits project implementation and effective aid absorption, it means that local currency funds are more valuable than project aid at the margin. Allocating local funds to leverage project aid resources becomes critical for aid productivity. Project screening and reviews of development expenditure programs need to pay as much attention to assessing the quality of projects <b>financed</b> fully by <b>local</b> funds, as those which are aided. Resource shifts from fully locally-funded projects that enhance the overall quality of public investments should be emphasized. A fiscal adjustment program focused on matching aggregate resources against aggregate expenditures, while glossing inner <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> imbalances, stands to undercut the execution of the development expenditure program and to frustrate observance of other fiscal and financial benchmarks.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accelerating}} accumulation {{and risk}} concentration of Chinese <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> platforms debts have attracted wide attention throughout the world. Due {{to the network}} of financial exposures among institutions, the failure of several platforms or regions of systemic importance will probably trigger systemic risk and destabilize the financial system. However, the complex network of credit relationships in Chinese <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> platforms {{at the state level}} remains unknown. To fill this gap, we presented the first complex networks and hierarchical cluster analysis of the credit market of Chinese <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> platforms using the “bottom up” method from firm-level data. Based on balance-sheet channel, we analyzed the topology and taxonomy by applying the analysis paradigm of subdominant ultra-metric space to an empirical data in 2013. It is remarked that we chose to extract the network of co-financed financing platforms in order to evaluate the effect of risk contagion from platforms to bank system. We used the new credit similarity measure by combining the factor of connectivity and size, to extract minimal spanning trees (MSTs) and hierarchical trees (HTs). We found that: (1) the degree distributions of credit correlation backbone structure of Chinese <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> platforms are fat tailed, and the structure is unstable with respect to targeted failures; (2) the backbone is highly hierarchical, and largely explained by the geographic region; (3) the credit correlation backbone structure based on connectivity and size is significantly heterogeneous; (4) key platforms and regions of systemic importance, and contagion path of systemic risk are obtained, which are contributed to preventing systemic risk and regional risk of Chinese <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> platforms and preserving financial stability under the framework of macro prudential supervision. Our approach of credit similarity measure provides a means of recognizing “systemically important” institutions and regions for a targeted policy with risk minimization which gives a flexible and comprehensive consideration to both aspects of “too big to fail” and “too central to fail”...|$|R
