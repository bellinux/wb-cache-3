50|$|In the 1960s, {{a regular}} non-pedigreed white {{domestic}} <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> <b>cat</b> named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical kittens, {{was injured in}} a car accident and taken to a laboratory at the University of California. After she recovered, her next litter produced exceptionally friendly kittens. When the subsequent litter produced more of the same, Mrs. Ann Baker (an established cat breeder) purchased several kittens from the owner and set out to create what is now known as the (original) Ragdoll.|$|E
40|$|Chronic feline upper {{respiratory}} disease remains {{a challenge to}} diagnose and treat. This {{is a case of}} a four year-old, female, spayed domestic <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> <b>cat</b> presented to the Internal Medicine Service with a complaint of chronic {{upper respiratory}} disease characterized by copious bilateral mucoid to mucopurulent discharge from both nares with productive sneezing and no ocular discharge. Her referring veterinarian had attempted repeated courses of antibiotic therapy without success in abatement of clinical signs. A full work-up for diagnosis of chronic upper respiratory disease was completed to eliminate the many differential diagnoses for this disease including bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, foreign body, neoplasia, dental disease, nasopharyngeal polyp, nasopharyngeal stenosis, and inflammatory rhinitis. With the results of advanced diagnostics such as serology, computed tomography, rhinoscopy, culture, histopathology, and cytology a diagnosis was eventually made of inflammatory rhinosinusitis. The patient was successfully treated with pulse antibiotic therapy and intranasal NeoPolyDex ophthalmic drops every other day, though finding a successful treatment regimen can be challenging in many cases...|$|E

50|$|In {{the spirit}} of bettering the breed's genetic health, {{personality}} and temperament, the group out-crossed to Persians, Himalayans, and domestic <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> <b>cats.</b> The group also allowed some out-crossing to original Ragdolls (which ended in 2010 for ACFA-recognized Ragamuffins). Only cats {{with at least one}} Ragamuffin parent and an ACFA-accepted out-cross currently qualify to be called Ragamuffins. Cat Fanciers' Association Ragamuffins may only have Ragamuffin parents.|$|R
5000|$|The Ragdoll is a cat breed {{with blue}} eyes and a {{distinct}} colorpoint coat. It is a large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and silky coat. Like all <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> <b>cats,</b> Ragdolls need grooming to ensure their fur does not mat. Developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, it {{is best known for}} its docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name [...] "Ragdoll" [...] is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as [...] "dog-like cats" [...] or [...] "puppy-like cats" [...] due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other pets.|$|R

After the couple unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to send the cat back to its home, Edward decides that if the cat does not leave by the coming afternoon, he will ask the police to make sure it is returned home.|$|R
5|$|The Maine Coon is a <b>long</b> {{or medium}} <b>haired</b> <b>cat.</b> The coat {{is soft and}} silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Peter Simon Pallas had {{advanced}} {{the hypothesis that}} the manul (also known as Pallas's cat) might be the ancestor of the <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> domestic <b>cat.</b> He had anecdotal evidence that established even though the male offspring would be sterile hybrids, the female offspring could again reproduce with domestic cats and pass on a small proportion of the manul's genes. In 1907, zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock refuted this claim, citing his work on the skull differences between the manul and the Angoras or Persians of his time. This early hypothesis overlooked the potential for cross breeding within the family Felidae. For example, the Savannah Cat is a cross-breed between a DSH-Bengel and a wild African Serval—both of which have different skulls and evolutionary lineage. Furthermore, hybrid females in the related Panthera genus, such as ligers and tigons, have successfully mated in many documented cases, producing liligers and titigons.|$|R
5000|$|The Monterey pines {{were for}} many years {{the site of a}} rookery. A number of robin territories were present in the garden; the {{breeding}} season boundaries plotted using red wool [...] "male substitutes" [...] with careful observation of the defending males. Thrush [...] "anvils" [...] were mostly present on larger stones bordering the front drive and starlings were a frequent visitor to the raspberry beds and to the thatch, stealing straw for their nests. This necessitated the use of chicken-wire to protect the thatch. Wrens were common, often lining their nests with the fur from the family pet, a <b>long</b> <b>haired</b> silver Persian <b>cat.</b> Blackbirds are common and redwings (Turdus iliacus) are an occasional visitor.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A nine-month-old {{domestic}} short <b>haired</b> <b>cat</b> {{was admitted}} {{with the history}} of acute vomiting, depression and shivering. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed minimum enlargement of the right uterine horn filled with anechoic fluid. On excretory urography, functionally and anatomically normal, enlarged left kidney was found, but right kidney was absent. It was preliminary diagnosed as hydrometra with right renal agenesis. Aiming at the correction of hydrometra, we performed ovariohysterectomy. During spaying, we found a missing segment of distal part of the right uterine horn and absence of ipsilateral kidney and ureter. Compressed uterine structure and segmental aplasia of right uterine horn were found in histopathological investigation. Taken together, it was diagnosed as a seg-mental aplasia of uterine horn with ipsilateral renal agenesis. KEY WORDS: feline, renal agenesis, uterine segmental aplasia. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 70 (6) : 641 – 643, 2008 A nine-month-old, intact female, domestic short <b>haired</b> <b>cat</b> was admitted {{with the history of}} acute vomiting, depres-sion and shivering for three days.
