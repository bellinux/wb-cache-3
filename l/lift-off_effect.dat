A {{major problem}} for crack or {{electromagnetic}} property measurement in eddy current detection technique is the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect.</b> The nonzero value of lift-off distance tends to smear out the discontinuity in the detected signal, causing errors detection. The paper shows the test results of <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> in normalized impedance plane. Curves are transformed to Hough plane by Hough transform and consequently the liftoff effect is suppressed effectively. The method is convenient to distinguish different electromagnetic characteristic of material {{which can be used}} to detect crack or other flaws in material...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing {{a surface}} defect is very crucial in {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT). We employ an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) {{to detect the}} surface defect of a nonmagnetic material. An appropriate feature that can avoid the interference of the human factor is vital for evaluating the crack quantitatively. Moreover, it can also reduce the influence of other factors, such as the lift-off, during the testing. In this paper, we conduct experiments at various depths of surface cracks in an aluminum plate, and a new feature, lift-off slope (LOS), is put forward for the theoretical and experimental analyses of the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> on the receiving signals. Besides, by changing the lift-off between the receiving probe and the sample for testing, a new method is adopted to evaluate surface defects with the EMAT. Compared with other features, the theoretical and experimental {{results show that the}} feature lift-off slope has many advantages prior to the other features for evaluating the surface defect with the EMAT. This can reduce the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> of one probe. Meanwhile, it is not essential to measure the signal without defects...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} know the effect of surface {{irregularity}} in the detection of local wall thinning of pipeline using pulsed eddy current (PEC), the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> on PEC signal have been investigated. Three kinds of parameters in the PEC signal, which is “peak amplitude”, “time to peak amplitude ” and “time to zero crossing ” are analyzed to separate the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> in the PEC signal. The distance from sensor {{to the bottom of}} sample which is the total thickness of combined insulator and sample is kept constant. The magnitude of the differential peak amplitude is increased with increasing sample thickness, the time to peak amplitude is increased with increas-ing the sample thickness.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} acoustic transducer (EMAT), a non-contact NDT tool {{with large}} lift-off, {{is becoming an}} attractive method for detecting {{the cracks in the}} metal parts. However, the lift-off of the transducer has a direct effect on the feature that is used to characterize the defects. A detailed investigation on the relationship between the feature and the lift-off of the EMAT is crucial in the detection process. This paper investigates the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> on the feature, cut-off frequency of EMAT in the Rayleigh wave. The study can be divided into two parts. Firstly, with a multi-field coupling environment, 2 -D electromagnetic and wave generation EMAT models are built to simulate the interaction of the Rayleigh wave with the surface crack. Then, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> on the cut-off frequency is investigated through simulation and experiment. Compared to the previous studies, it is found that lift-off would cause a negative result when the lift-off varies in the testing process. Besides, the calibration obtained from the tests at a random lift-off value can be used in other tests with any different lift off value provided that the lift-off is kept as a constant during the detection process...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparent}} {{relation between}} the lift-off length under diesel conditions and the ignition quality of a fuel has previously been reported. To cast light on the underlying mechanism, the current study aims to separate flame <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> of the chemical ignition delay from those of other fuel properties under diesel conditions. Flame lift-off was measured in an optical diesel engine by high-speed video imaging of OH-chemiluminescence. Fuel and ambient-gas properties were varied during the experiment. Only a weak correlation was found between ignition delay and lift-off length. The data indicate that this correlation {{is due to a}} common, stronger correlation with the ambient oxygen concentration. The chemical ignition delay and the fuel type had similar, weak <b>effects</b> on the <b>lift-off</b> length. A recently proposed mechanism for lift-off stabilization was used to interpret the results. It assumes that reactants approaching the lift-off position of the jet are mixed with high-temperature products found along the edges of the flame, which trigger autoignition. In this picture, the fuel effect is most likely due to differences in the amount of mixing with high-temperature products that is required for autoignition. In the current experiment, all <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> seem to arise from variations in the reactant and product temperatures, induced by fuel and ambient properties.

Consequently, the ability to determine the thickness of coated metals is important for both process control and in-service inspection of parts. Presently ultrasonic, thermal, and eddy current inspection methods are used, depending on the circumstances. A number of commercial instruments for determining the thickness of nonconducting coatings on metal substrates are {{based on the fact that}} the impedance change of the coil decreases exponentially with the distance of the coil from the metal (the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect).</b> However, these instruments are not suitable for determining the thickness of metal layers on conducting substrates...|$|E

Experimental testing on the proposed technique and results are presented in this report.

40|$|The {{crystalline}} {{texture of}} a sheet metal strongly affects its formability, so having {{knowledge of this}} texture is of great industrial relevance. The texture of rolled sheet metals, such as aluminium and steel, may be determined by ultrasonic measurement of the velocity of the zero order symmetric (S- 0) Lamb wave {{as a function of}} angle to the rolling direction. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) may perform this measurement without contacting the sample, therefore reducing perturbation to the plate wave system, as they are electromagnetically coupled to the sheet. The EMAT system measurements are non-destructive and may be made in real time, therefore offering advantages over the conventional techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction. It has been noticed that in the two EMAT pitch-catch system, the apparent arrival times of the ultrasonic waves change with variation in lift-off (distance between sample and transducer) due to impedance and aperture effects. For precise and accurate texture parameters to be obtained, accurate absolute ultrasonic velocity measurement is required and hence lift-off must be compensated for. This is of particular importance to online inspection systems where constant lift-off may be difficult to maintain. The impedance behaviour of various coil geometries has been investigated as a function of lift-off and frequency and compared to the received ultrasonic signal and the drive current pulse pro. le. Theoretical models have been used to explain the observed behaviour, and hence a scheme has been proposed for the compensation of <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> in real time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{lift-off}} {{of a single}} circular particle in an Oldroyd-B fluid by two-dimensional direct numerical simulation. A heavy particle, placed {{on the bottom of}} the channel, is driven forward by a plane Poiseuille flow. At a certain critical shear Reynolds number the buoyant weight of the particle just balances the upward thrust from the hydrodynamic force. As the Reynolds number is increased beyond the critical value, the particle attains an equilibrium position away from the wall. The aim of the calculation is to study the critical condition of lift-off. A correlation for the critical condition of liftoff is obtained assuming a surface roughness (or the particle separation from the wall) of 0. 001 d. It is seen that the fluid elasticity reduces the critical shear Reynolds number for <b>lift-off.</b> The <b>effect</b> of the gap size between the particle and the wall, on the lift force, is also studied. The lift force on the particle is seen to be singular as the gap size approaches zero.

30|$|The {{most popular}} {{features}} {{to be used}} in order to minimize the effects of lift-off is called lift-off point of intersection (LOI), which is a point at which PEC signals intersect when only lift-off distance varies. Therefore, LOI is inherently immune to lift-off variations, which makes a LOI point one of desirable features to remove <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> for PEC evaluation. LOI phenomenon was originally observed in experiments and proposed to avoid false indication due to <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> when material loss in a two-layer assembly was evaluated by PEC technique [65], [66]. It is reported that the signals of LOI points have been successfully adopted to measure the thickness of a plate [67] and quantify defects and their locations in a layered sample [68]. To enable the interpretation of LOI signals, the characteristics of LOI signals in terms of time and amplitude were revealed under a wide variety of conditions. The results demonstrate that LOI signals including both the time and amplitude follow a unique curve against thickness and conductivity [69]. At the early stage, LOI phenomenon could only exist when a PEC probe using a coil as the receiver is placed above a nonferrous sample. Tian, et al [70] obtained LOI points by doing the derivative of the output of a Hall-based probe, and Li [71] extended the method to a PEC probe in which a solid-state magnetic field sensor could be placed at arbitrary positions. Further, Lefebvre and Mandache [72] recorded LOI phenomenon by covering a conductive but nonferrous layer on a ferromagnetic substrate. Also, Mandache and Lefebvre [73] made an attempt to disclose the physics of the LOI phenomenon. It is found that the LOI phenomenon is a general characteristic of the eddy currents, not only to transient eddy currents. Kral, et al [74] presented a linear transformer model to investigate the origin of LOI phenomenon, and obtained LOI points from the time derivatives of the output of a GMR-based probe. Interestingly, a LOI point is recently observed in the spectral PEC signals [67].|$|E

An absolute eddy current probe rotates in the hole. The impedance of each angular position is acquired and input to the computer for integration and analysis.

40|$|Film cooling is the {{introduction}} of secondary fluid (coolant) at one or more discrete locations along a surface exposed to a high temperature environment to protect that surface {{not only in the}} immediate region of injection but also in the downstream region," (Goldstien, 1971). The secondary air which is cool air were extracted from the compressor and injected near the blade surface (through holes or slots) to provide a layer of cool fluid between the hot gases and the blade surface thus reducing the heat transfer to the surface. Enormous numbers of experimental and computational investigations dealing with both the aerodynamic and the thermal aspect of film cooling have been made available ever since. At the early stage of its introduction, the experimental investigations were usually focused on either thermal or aerodynamic aspect of the study. However, with {{the introduction}} of the laser based measurement (PIV and LDV), which reduce the complexity of aerodynamic measurements, most of current literature involving film cooling will have both, the thermal and the aerodynamic aspect of the study. Most of the available literature involved a discrete hole or single row cooling hole with common hole inclination angle towards the streamwise direction at 30 " and 35 ". Although earlier researches have proved that decreasing the hole inclination angle could provide better film cooling performance, there are very few literature available with regards the hole inclination angle lower than 30 ". Based on these facts, the present study intended to investigate the aero-thermal interaction of a multiple shallow hole angle. In addition to the experiments, computational investigation has been extensively used in particular to explore the potential of new hole geometries and configurations. The computational investigation has also been manipulates to provide the physical insight of the aero-thermal interaction of the study. The present study involves thermal and aerodynamic investigations of multiple cooling holes with shallow hole angle. Total of three test models are considered in the present study namely TMA, TMB and TMG. The base line test model; TMB is design to justify the commonly used cooling hole having 35 " hole angle. The other two test models; TMA and TMG, are having a shallow hole angle of 20 " with different lateral pitch distance of 6 D and 3 D, respectively. Total of twenty conventional cylindrical holes constituting a matrix composed of four rows with five holes in each row. Thermal and aerodynamic investigations are carried out involving all of the test models. The thermal investigations involve temperature measurement of test model surface by infrared thermography; NECIAvio H 2640. The surface temperature is converted to film cooling effectiveness to represent the thermal performance of the given test model. In addition to the surface temperature measurements, the thermal investigations also involve measurement of thermal field downstream of each row cooling hole. The thermal fields are measured by a thermocouple rig which is mounted on a 2 -D traverse system. The traverse system will navigate the rig according to a designated measurement grid to enable thermal field contour plot. 3 -D Laser Doppler Velocimetry has been utilized for the aerodynamic measurements. The laser probes are mounted on a 3 -D traverse system which will navigate the probes according to a designated measurement grid to enable velocity field contour plot. The measurements are carried out at single Reynolds number base on the hole diameter of 6200 at three different blowing ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0. The present study also includes the numerical investigation of the above mentioned cases. Simplified computational domains are constructed to include only single lateral pitch based on the test models. The meshes are generated by ANSYS ICEMCFD ver. 12. The analyses are carried out by ANSYS CFX ver. 12 with the employment of steady and unsteady Reynolds Average Navier Stokes analyses using the shear stress transports turbulence model. The experimental aerodynamic results are presented in the form of contour plot of various variables including film cooling effectiveness, normalized u, v, and w velocities. The velocity distributions show that at BR = 1. 0, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> are more apparent in the case of TMB in comparison with the TMA. The vector plots between the two test models also reveals the different in terms of the positioning of the counter rotating vortex core which is observed to be further away from the wall surface in TMB. The velocity plots also reveal that downstream of the cooling hole at the centerline, TMA is having higher streamwise velocity in comparison with TMB. These observations can be directly associated with the different in the inclination angle of the cooling hole. Steeper angle in the case of TMA allowed more streamwise momentum component to be ejected through the cooling hole in comparison with the case of TMB. The computational fluid dynamics investigation also reveals the occurrence of different flow structure inside the cooling hole between TMA and TMB. In the case of TMB, the separation which occurs at the inlet of the cooling hole triggers the formation of counter rotating vortex inside of the cooling hole and persists through the cooling hole. An accomplish counter rotating vortices can be observed at various plane inside the cooling hole. The same observation cannot be made for TMA, where the vector plot reveals that the secondary air which has been separated at the cooling hole inlet then reattached to the downstream wall of the cooling hole. This phenomenon hinders the formation of counter rotating vortex inside of the cooling hole which will only be completed by the cross-flow phenomena after the secondary air exiting the cooling hole. In comparison between TMA and TMG, both the experimental and computational results reveal that the shorter lateral pitch in TMG allows the secondary air to dominate the lateral space between cooling hole. The domination of the secondary air within the lateral space leads to greater blockage not only at the hole vicinity but also at the lateral space. The numerical results also show that the greater blockage which occur in TMG resulting a different interaction between the upcoming and the concurrent vortex cores in comparison with TMA. At wider lateral pitch of TMA, the upcoming vortex cores diffuse directly into the concurrent vortex cores keeping the secondary air in-line. At shorter lateral pitch of TMG, the upcoming vortex cores are deflected in the lateral direction before diffuse at further downstream of the cooling hole. The deflection cause the secondary air to disperses at the lateral space. The velocity plots also confirmed the interaction between the neighboring counter rotating vortices in the case of TMG which hindering it own growth and leads to lesser <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects.</b> The thermal investigations results are presented in terms of the contour plot of film cooling effectiveness, distribution of laterally average film cooling effectiveness and area average film cooling effectiveness along the x-axis. Benchmarking between the present and previous study are made to validate the present measurement and analysis approach. Good agreement has been achieved between the present and previous study. The film cooling effectiveness provided by TMA is higher at all blowing ratio in comparison with TMB particularly at BR= 1. 0 and 2. 0. The thermal fields show that at BR= 1. O, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effects</b> are more evident in the case of TMB in comparison with TMA. At BR= 2. 0, the thermal fields show complete detachment of the secondary air from the wall for the case of TMB leaving no trace of film cooling coverage on the surface. The thermal fields also indicate a lesser dispersion of the thermal field in the case of TMA in comparison with TMB which can directly be associated with the interaction rate between the secondary air and the mainstream air. In comparison between TMA and TMG, similar distribution of film cooling coverage can be observed downstream the first and second row cooling hole. Downstream the third and fourth row cooling hole, TMG start to provide better film cooling coverage. The contour plot shows an establishment of full coverage film cooling effectiveness region accommodating the lateral space between the cooling hole centerline. This observation serves the flow phenomena which have been describe earlier in the writing. The thermal fields also show the domination of the secondary air in the lateral space which is more apparent downstream of the third and fourth row cooling hole. Conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows; a) shallow hole angle configurations are definitely improving the film cooling coverage in comparison to the commonly used hole angle at 30 " or 35 ". The superiority of the shallow hole angle is more apparent at higher blowing ratio cases in which the cooling protection provided at BR = 2. 0 of shallow hole angle is a match to the result of BR = 2. 0 of the 35 " hole angle; b) at shorter lateral pitch distance, full coverage film cooling effectiveness were prevail indicating the benefit of the interaction between the secondary air of the neighboring cooling holes; c) the superposition effect induces by the in-line hole arrangement of the present study help to improve the film cooling performance with greater benefit were obtained by the shallow hole angle in comparison to the 35 degree hole angle; d) the CFD results confirm the formation of a counter rotating vortex pair inside of the cooling hole which perseveres until downstream of the cooling hole in all cases. Increase in the length of the cooling hole will allow the separated secondary air to reattach thus hindering the formation of the kidney vortices so as to better the film cooling effectiveness in the case of TMA and TMG; e) the domination of the mainstream air at the lateral space between the cooling hole in the case at longer lateral pitch distance kept the secondary jet in-line as it travel towards the downstream direction. It will cause the upcoming vortex core to directly infuses thus amplify the jetting effect of the downstream vortices which will ultimately minimizing the utilization of the secondary air; f) at the shorter lateral pitch distance, the narrow lateral space between the cooling hole enables the secondary air jet to interact with each other and prevent the mainstream air to dominating the lateral space resulting the upcoming vortices to be deflected while it approaching the downstream cooling hole. At the same time, the deflection helps to spread the secondary air laterally hence to better the film cooling effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{friction}} and film thickness in elastohydrodynamic contacts of machined, rough surfaces, where roughness {{is dominated by}} longitudinal ridges parallel to the rolling/sliding direction. A ball-on-disc tribometer was used to simultaneously measure {{friction and}} film thickness in rough contacts {{as well as with}} nominally smooth specimens for comparison. The studied rough surfaces were selected so that the influence of the root-mean-square roughness and roughness wavelength can be assessed. Friction and film measurements were taken over a range of slide–roll ratios and speeds and with two lubricating oils with different viscosities, hence covering a wide range of specific film thicknesses. The measurements with the nominally smooth specimens show that friction is strongly influenced by thermal effects at high SRRs and that the transition from mixed/boundary to full EHD lubrication occurs at lambda ratios greater than three. At low speeds, the rough specimens are found to generate higher friction than the smooth ones for all the roughness structures considered, and this is shown {{to be related to the}} thinner minimum film thickness. Comparison of friction in rough and smooth contacts shows that the total friction in rough contacts can be divided into two components: one that is equivalent to friction in smooth contacts under the same conditions and is dependent on the slide–roll ratio, and the other that is due to the presence of roughness and is independent of the slide–roll ratio under the conditions tested. Further analysis of the minimum film thickness on tops of roughness ridges indicates that even after the full <b>lift-off,</b> an <b>effect</b> of the roughness on friction persists and is most likely related to the local shear stress in the micro-EHD contacts on the top of roughness ridges. At even higher speeds, the difference in friction between the rough and smooth specimens vanishes...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a novel film-cooling scheme for a high temperature gas turbine application is introduced. The new jet, with both forward and laterally diffused exit, enables the coolant to spread wider and more uniform over the downstream surface, {{when compared with the}} traditional circular hole. As a result, the coolant momentum is reduced in the normal direction, and thus the occurrence of jet lift-off is avoided. This novel film-cooling scheme is superior to traditional cooling scheme since less amount of coolant can provide the same protection under the same conditions, making more efficient use of the coolant air. Systematic simulations have been carried out on two benchmark cases. The performances of different turbulence models as well as different wall treatments have been isolated and evaluated. Turbulence was modeled using four classes of turbulence models, namely k-[varepsilon] (including its 3 variants), k-}, Reynolds-Stress, and Spalart-Allmaras. Three-dimensional simulations were carried out by numerically solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. For the first time, to the best of author's knowledge, the jet <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> is clearly captured in the simulations at high blowing ratios, and the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data.

40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, a novel {{method for}} the {{automatic}} evaluation of flaws during a manual Eddy Current (EC) inspection procedure is presented. Algorithms were especially designed {{with respect to}} characteristics typical for a hand-held EC testing procedure. In manual scanning, a signal related to impedance change in the complex plane is affected by large and unpredictable variations of scanning speed and alternations of the probe position. The detection of flaws in the object tested is also affected by the imperfections of device electronics, mainly of null drift. The <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> of the inspection probe is required for consideration as well. This contribution describes an algorithm implementing an event detection method for event detection in a complex eddy current signal insensitive {{to some of the}} effects listed above. The paper mainly introduces a robust EC signal normalization procedure using non-linear filtration based on the evaluation of the distance between consecutive samples in the complex plane and median based tracking of the EC signature. A normalized EC signature was used to classify flaws in a tested object. A feature extraction was performed using Modified Fourier coefficients. The classification was performed by using three different methods: nearest-mean classifier, k-nearest neighbourhood classifier and back-propagation neural network. The methods were tested on a single frequency instrument with an absolute probe...|$|E
40|$|Two {{arrays of}} {{permalloy}} parallel wires, 20 nm thick, {{having the same}} width of 175 nm and different spacing of 35 and 175 nm were prepared by means of deep ultraviolet lithography and <b>lift-off</b> process. The <b>effect</b> of magnetostatic interaction on both the static and dynamic magnetic properties of arrays of wires has been investigated by means of magneto-optic and Brillouin light scattering techniques, respectively. In particular, the magnetization switching of the samples, measured by vectorial magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry and microscopy shows the effects of dipolar interaction {{in the case of}} 35 nm spaced wires, while in the other sample the measurements show that the wires are substantially noninteracting. The Brillouin light scattering measurements showed that for the sample with interwire spacing of 35 nm, dipolar coupling between magnetic wires leads to the formation of a collective mode which has a continuous spectrum and exists in a range of frequencies, while for the 175 nm spaced wires the spin modes are dispersionless. To quantify the investigated effects, a theory developed earlier for an isolated wire has been extended to the case of a one-dimensional array of ferromagnetic wires...|$|R
40|$|Strong shaking of {{structures}} during large earthquakes {{may result in}} some cases in partial separation of {{the base of the}} structure from the sail. This phenomenon of uplifting, which can affect the dynamic behavior of the structure significantly, even if the amount of uplift is small, is examined in this thesis. First the case of a rocking rigid block is investigated and then more complicated, flexible superstructures are introduced. Two foundation models which permit uplift are considered: the Winkler foundation and the much simpler "two-spring" foundation. Several energy dissipating mechanisms are also introduced into these models. It is shown that an equivalence between these two models for the foundation can be established, so that one can always work with the much simpler two-spring foundation. In this way complete analytical solutions can be derived in most cases. Moreover, simple approximate methods for the calculation of the apparent fundamental period of the rocking system are developed and simplified methods of analysis are proposed. In general, uplift leads to a softer vibrating system which behaves nonlinearly, although the response is composed of a sequence of linear responses. As a result, the apparent fundamental resonant frequency of the uplifting system is always less than the fundamental resonant frequency of both the soil-structure interacting system, in which lift-off is not allowed, and the superstructure itself. The second and higher resonant frequencies of the superstructure, however, are not affected significantly by lift-off. For damped foundations, the ratio of critical damping associated with the apparent fundamental mode decreases, in general, with the amount of <b>lift-off.</b> These <b>effects</b> of uplift on the dynamic properties of the rocking system can alter the response of the structure significantly during an earthquake. Nevertheless, it cannot be said a priori whether they are favorable to the behavior or not; this depends on the parameters of the system and the time history of the excitation...|$|R
40|$|Single {{molecule}} detection {{is limited}} by the small scattering cross-section of molecules which leads to weak optical signals that can be obscured by background noise. The combination of plasmonics and nanofluidics in an integrated nano-device has the potential to provide the signal enhancement necessary for the detection of single molecules. The purpose of this investigation was to optimize the fabrication of an optofluidic device that integrates a nanochannel with a plasmonic bowtie antenna. The fluidic structure of the device was fabricated using UV-nanoimprint lithography, and the gold plasmonic antennas were fabricated using a shadow evaporation and <b>lift-off</b> process. The <b>effect</b> of electron beam lithography doses on the resolution of antenna-nanochannel configurations was studied to minimize antenna gap size while maintaining the integrity of the imprinted features. The smallest antenna gap size that was achieved was 46 nm. The antennas were characterized using dark field spectroscopy to find the resonance shift, which indicated the appropriate range for optical signal enhancement. The dark field scattering results showed antennas with a broad and well-defined resonance shift that ranged from 650 - 800 nm. The Raman scattering results showed the highest enhancement factor (EF = 2) for antennas with an 2 ̆ 2 inverted configuration, 2 ̆ 2 which involved having the triangles of the antenna facing back-to-back rather than the more conventional tip-to-tip bowtie arrangement...|$|R
40|$|AC bridge {{techniques}} {{commonly used}} for precision impedance measurements have been adapted {{to develop an}} eddy current sensor for rail defect detection. By using two detection coils instead of just one as in a conventional sensor, we can balance out the large baseline signals corresponding to a normal rail. We have significantly enhanced the detection sensitivity of the eddy current method by detecting and demodulating the differential signal of the two coils induced by rail defects, using a digital lock-in amplifier algorithm. We have also explored compensating for the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> of the eddy current sensor due to vibrations by using the summing signal of the detection coils to measure the lift-off distance. The dominant component of the summing signal is a constant resulting from direct coupling from the excitation coil, which can be experimentally determined. The remainder of the summing signal, which decreases as the lift-off distance increases, is induced by the secondary eddy current. This dependence on the lift-off distance is used to calibrate the differential signal, allowing for a more accurate characterization of the defects. Simulated experiments on a sample rail have been performed using a computer controlled X-Y moving table with the X-axis mimicking the train’s motion and the Y-axis mimicking the train’s vibrational bumping. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new detection method. Key words: AC bridges; demodulation; digital lock-in amplifier; Eddy current rail inspection...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: One of {{the areas}} in the {{continuous}} casting process {{that has not been}} definitively instrumented is a method for reliably locating the part of a continuously cast strand that remains liquid for a period after the outer portion has solidified. Therefore, this paper is focused on the measurement of the solidification point made by a through transmission technique based on the relationship between ultrasonic speed and measured temperature using an EMAT sensor. Design/methodology/approach: An EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) has been designed and fabricated with an elongated spiral coil and a permanent magnetic core. Al 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mm holes were produced and demonstrated that the location of the final solidification point during the continuous casting process can be monitored using a 1. 0 MHz frequency. Findings: The solidification point in a continuous casting bloom could be detected through a series of tests {{with the use of a}} fabricated probe and the amplitude extent of ultrasonic wave decreases as the hole diameter of the simulators increases. Furthermore, through a test of <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> it was found that the extent of amplitude decreases as lift-off increases, thus one of the most important factors for a field application. Research limitations/implications: As cutting speed and cutting length can be predicted from a miniaturization of the sensor and construction of an on-line system for a field installation, a considerable amount of time and energy can be saved by reducing mistake ratio and curtailing unnecessary processes. Originality/value: The measured ultrasonic waves allow for prediction of the casting speed necessary to correctly locate the liquid core and thereby maximize the benefits of soft reduction and the productivity of the machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetostrictive}} {{guided wave}} technology as a non-contact measurement can generate and receive guided waves {{with a large}} lift-off distance up to tens of millimeters. However, the lift-off distance of the receiving coil would affect the coupling efficiency from the elastic energy to the electromagnetic energy. In the existing magnetomechanical models, the change of the magnetic field in the air gap was ignored since the permeability of the rod {{is much greater than}} that of air. The lift-off distance of the receiving coil will not affect the receiving signals based on these models. However, the experimental phenomenon is in contradiction with these models. To solve the contradiction, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> of receiving the longitudinal mode guided waves in pipes is investigated based on the Villari effect. A finite element model of receiving longitudinal guided waves in pipes is obtained based on the Villari effect, which takes into account the magnetic field in the pipe wall and the air zone at the same time. The relation between the amplitude of the induced signals and the radius (lift-off distance) of the receiving coil is obtained, which is verified by experiment. The coupling efficiency of the receiver is a monotonic decline with the lift-off distance increasing. The decay rate of the low frequency wave is slower than the high frequency wave. Additionally, the results show that the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the air zone and in the pipe wall is the same order of magnitude, but opposite. However, the experimental results show that the error of the model in the large lift-off distance is obvious due to the diffusion of the magnetic field in the air, especially for the high frequency guided waves...|$|E
40|$|Graphene is a two {{dimensional}} material which has combination of unique mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Due {{to the unique}} properties of graphene, it has potential for several applications such as radio frequency applications and ultrafast photodetectors. Reducing contact resistance of metal-graphene is important for further improvement of graphene devices and for realization of graphene based electronics. Contact between graphene and metal can be improved by edge contact length. Edge contact length improves coupling between metal and graphene; therefore, contact resistance is reduced. Edge contact length can be introduced by generating nanostructures under metal. Fabrication of graphene based devices requires special treatment due to graphene‟s {{two dimensional}} natures. In this thesis, fabrication process for graphene devices is discussed in details. Main attention is given to reducing contact resistance. The fabrication process includes e-beam lithography; choosing right metals and metallization techniques; etching of graphene; lift-off issues; and reducing resist residues. In this research, graphene under the metal contacts was patterned by electron beam lithography with series of holes of 100 nm to 300 nm radius etched by oxygen plasma etching. The holes were patterned by electron beam lithography, and metallization {{was carried out by}} electron beam evaporation followed by <b>lift-off</b> process. The <b>effects</b> of the geometrical parameters of the holes and different graphene length under the metal are investigated experimentally. This research can be used as source of graphene device fabrication for the beginners...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of tribological processes is presently very different for nano-scale and micro-scale phenomena. This is mainly {{related to the}} presence of adhesive forces, which are not negligible at the nano-scale and, in some cases, dominate the tribological behaviour of the system. The morphological characteristics of sliding surfaces have been demonstrated to strongly influence both the nano-scale and the micro-scale tribology [1 - 4]. The phenomena which rule these properties are different depending on the dimensions of surface micro/nano-structures, on the contact area and on the applied load. At the micro-scale the presence of a regular array of micro-cavities could lead to the reduction of friction and wear, due to the enhancement of the hydrodynamic <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> and to the role played by the micro-cavities as lubricant reservoir and debris pocket [1, 2]. At the nano-scale parallel nano-grooves induce a hydrophobic character to the surface, resulting in a reduction of the coefficient of friction and adhesion [3, 4]. The aim of the present study is to determine the critical size at which the transition from nano- to micro-scale regimes occurs, investigating the effect of surface patterning on the tribological properties of Si(100). With this purpose the Si flat surface have been patterned by means of Focused Ion Beam with regular arrays of parallel grooves 50 nm wide and 4 nm deep, varying the pitch from 125 nm to 1 m. Adhesion and friction have been studied {{as a function of the}} pitch by means of AFM in air and in vacuum, using a dedicated flat tip sensitive to the integrated effect of the nano-structures on the tribology of the system. The hydrophobicity of 125 nm pitch array, already described in ref. 4, decreases between 400 and 500 nm pitch, resulting almost absent for larger values. This finding identifies 400 - 500 nm pitch interval as the threshold between nano- and micro-scale regimes.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the film stiffness of dry gas seal, and keep a low leakage rate at the same time, {{a great deal of}} numerical and experimental study on groove structure and parameter optimization of DGS under varying operation conditions have been carried out. The effect of geometry parameters of groove, such as spiral angle, groove-dam ratio and groove depth, on the performance of a S-DGS, such as opening force, film stiffness, leakage rate and stiffness-leakage ratio, are numerically analyzed by Zirkelback et al. [8], Liu et al. [9], Peng et al. [10]. The optimum structural parameters of groove with different objective functions in different operating conditions are presented. In recent years, the effect of groove structural optimization on performance improvement of DGS has attracted more and more researchers’ attention because the limitation of performance enhancement by optimum design of groove geometry parameters of S-DGS simply. Recently, a parametric study and performance evaluation of typical bidirectional dry gas seals with modified surface were presented by Su et al. [11, 12] and Blasiaka and Zahorulko [13]. Hashimoto and Ochiai [14 – 16] presented an entirely new optimum design methodology, in which the groove geometry can be flexibly changed by using the spline function, {{to maximize the}} stiffness of gas films for grooved thrust bearings. The film stiffness and load-capacity of the optimized bearing are higher than that of common spiral groove bearing and herringbone bearing, which were both theoretically and experimentally verified. The sealing performance of the spiral groove DGS with an inner annular groove (AS-DGS) [17] was numerically analyzed by Peng et al. [18], which was invented by Flowserve Corporation. The results show that the opening force and film stiffness of AS-DGS is larger than that of the common S-DGS at the condition of low-speed and high-pressure, while the leakage is a little larger. Dresser-Rand Corporation presented a patented pattern of short grooves in combination with the longer grooves to provide excellent <b>lift-off</b> <b>effect</b> and optimum gas film stiffness at low speed as well as high speed. During operation, the short grooves could create obvious high pressure to separate the mating rings at slow speed, while the longer grooves contribute to creating a stable gas film between the two rings at high speed. The uni-directional V groove with the combined radial-circumferential tapered groove bottom [19], which was invented by Burgmann Corporation, causes a reduction in the opening force and leakage rate. Despite that there are only few researchers pay attention to the experiment of the sealing performance test of DGS, most of the researchers only focus on the numerical simulation and analysis of groove structure and geometry parameters optimization as the subject to improve the gas film stiffness and reduce the fluid leakage of DGS.|$|E
