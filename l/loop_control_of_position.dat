40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to use}} fast-switching valves in close-loop pressure and position control loop. Many valves have been analysed to choose the best. Pulse width modulation showed best behaviour among analysed modulation types. Close <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> and pressure is precisely described and connections between parameters (e. g. pulse frequency, sampling time) and properties of analysed actuators (e. g. precision, bode diagram) are presented. Life-time analysis and reduction of noise level were also important working points. Finally, a digitally controlled steering mechanism for cars has been developed. Aim was to extend digital signal circuit in combination with using cheap switching valves. Good precision can be reached, but noise production remains a problem. Actuators using fast switching valves {{will be good for}} noise-insensitive applications with low demands in frequency responseSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1269 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|For the {{problems}} of buffeting and phase delay in traditional rotor detection in sensorless vector <b>control</b> <b>of</b> permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), the Sigmoid function is proposed to replace sign function and the approach of piecewise linearization is proposed to compensate phase delay. To the problem that the output of traditional low pass filter contains high- order harmonic, two-stage filter including traditional low-pass filter and Kalman filter is proposed in this paper. Based on the output of traditional first-order low-pass filter, the Kalman filter is used to get modified back-EMF. The phase-locked <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> rotor <b>position</b> is adopted to estimate motor position and speed.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> a two-joint, two-link flexible arm. Our purpose has been to build an efficient arm {{in the sense that}} most of the energy provided by the motors is spent in doing the task (moving the tip mass) instead of moving the arm structure. In order to achieve that, we designed a flexible arm that has most of its mass concentrated on the tip. We also wanted to decouple radial tip motions from angular tip motions. The special mechanical configuration that fulfills all these specifications is described in Section 2. Section 3 {{describes the}} <b>control</b> scheme <b>of</b> this arm. An important problem with controlling it was the large Coulomb friction of the motors. A two-nested-loop multivariable controller has been used.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of the “flexure based microgap rheometer” (FMR) has been developed which is also capable of measuring, {{in addition to the}} shear stress, the first normal stress difference of micrometer thin fluid films. This microgap rheometer with a translation system based on compound spring flexures measures the rheological properties of microliter samples of complex fluids confined in a plane couette configuration with gap distances of h = 1 – 400 µm up to shear rates of 3000 s- 1. Feed back <b>loop</b> <b>controlled</b> precise <b>positioning</b> <b>of</b> the shearing surfaces with response times < 1 ms enables to control the parallelism within 1. 5 µrad and to maintain the gap distance within 20 nm. This precise gap control minimizes squeeze flow effects and allows therefore to measure the first normal stress difference N 1 of the thin film down to a micrometer gap distance, with a lower limit of [...] . that depends on the shear viscosity η and the squared inverse gap. Structural development of complex fluids in the confinement can be visualized by using a beam splitter on the shearing surface and a long working distance microscope. In summary, this new instrument allows to investigate the confinement dependent rheological and morphological evolution of micrometer thin films. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{master project}} is a further {{investigation}} of the topics covered in the specializa- tion project Laboratory platform for PM machine drive study - Adaptive Torque Estimation. Permanent magnet synchronous machines have seen an increased popularity in recent years. Some market analyses indicate that the industry is experiencing a gradual shift from induction machines to permanent magnet machines. The ma- chine offer several advantages over the inductions machine. The rotor losses are minimal, {{as there is no}} excitation current in the rotor. Thus the overall efficiency is improved. The machine offers higher torque density, lower weight, and higher torquetoinertiaratio,whichmayimprovethedynamicperformance. Althoughthe permanentmagnetmaterialsareexpensive,thelowoverallmaterialusagesuggests lower production costs. In order to obtain the aforementioned advantages a power electronic converter is required to control the machine. Although many of the induction machines found in industry are supplied by direct grid connection, the cost savings associated with the increased efficiency of applying a motor drive is changing this trend. Thus the requirement of a motor drive should no longer be considered a disadvantage of the synchronous machine alone. A lot of research effort has been put into developing control algorithms for electri- cal machines. In many cases the induction machine has been the initial study case, and later on the algorithms have been adapted to suit different machines. In order to accurately evaluate the performance <b>of</b> various motor <b>control</b> algo- rithms, a laboratory platform of a permanent magnet synchronous motor drive has been designed in this project. Several practical aspect regarding cooling require- ments, safety functions, gate driver design, controller and measurement interface have been considered. The platform is also intended as a base for future research and development. Three different control algorithms, field oriented control, direct torque control, and model predictive control have been evaluated. Additionally different modula- tion techniques for the inverter switches are covered. Theoretical derivations and practical implementation is considered. The operation is evaluated by simulation and laboratory experiments. Regardless <b>of</b> which motor <b>control</b> algorithm is selected, knowledge of the rotor flux position is required for efficient closed <b>loop</b> <b>control.</b> The use <b>of</b> <b>position</b> sen- sors on the motor shaft increases the cost of the drive, and reduces the reliability. In order to address this issue, several position estimation algorithms for sensorless control have been evaluated...|$|R
