40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate at the Ames Research Center has been {{conducting}} tests on isolated hingeless rotors in hover and forward flight. The primary objective is to generate a database on aeroelastic stability in trimmed flight for torsionally soft rotors at realistic tip speeds. The rotor test model has four soft inplane blades of NACA 0012 airfoil section with low torsional stiffness. The collective pitch and shaft tilt are set prior to each test run, and then the rotor is trimmed in the following sense: the longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> controls are adjusted through a swashplate to minimize the 1 /rev flapping moment at the 12 percent radial station. In hover, the database comprises lag regressive-mode damping with pitch variations. In forward flight the database comprises cyclic pitch controls, root flap moment and lag regressive-mode damping with advance ratio, shaft angle and pitch variations. This report presents the predictions and their correlation with the database. A modal analysis is used, in which nonrotating modes in flap bending, lag bending and torsion are computed from the measured blade mass and stiffness distributions. The airfoil aerodynamics {{is represented by the}} ONERA dynamic stall models of lift, drag and pitching moment, and the wake dynamics is represented by a state-space wake model. The trim analysis of finding, the cyclic controls and the corresponding, periodic responses is based on periodic shooting with damped Newton iteration; the Floquet transition matrix (FTM) comes out as a byproduct. The stabillty analysis of finding the frequencies and damping levels is based on the eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis of the FTM. All the structural and aerodynamic states are included from modeling to trim analysis. A major finding is that dynamic wake dramatically improves the correlation for the <b>lateral</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> control. Overall, the correlation is fairly good...|$|E

The analysis tasks include performance and the required power estimation. In helicopter design, those are usually carried out by adopting the momentum theory. In this paper, an explicit form of computational analysis based on the blade element theory and uniform/non-uniform inflow model is developed. The other motivation of the present development is to obtain trim and required power estimation for various helicopter configurations.

40|$|Several {{research}} {{studies have indicated}} that pitch link loads for various rotorcraft types can reach high or even unacceptable values, both in steady state and manoeuvring flight. This is especially the case for high-speed aggressive manoeuvres. An investigation into the nature of the pitch link loads for the FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft has been conducted and the model is expanded with a dynamic stall component and a flexible pitch link component to improve its fidelity. The investigation also shows that steady state pitch link loads are large for high-speed flight and they are amplified significantly whilst executing aggressive manoeuvres at high-speed flight. An active controller is designed to alleviate these loads for longitudinal manoeuvres at high- speed. A new structural load severity scale is defined in this paper to evaluate structural loads in combination with the load quickness parameter. The pitch link loads of the non-linear FLIGHTLAB Generic Rotorcraft simulation model can be reduced effectively with the controller but the agility of the aircraft is consequently reduced. The structural load metrics are shown to be effective in evaluating the controller.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} centre of gravity location on reducing cyclic pitch control for helicopter UAV's (unmanned air vehicles) and MAV's (micro air vehicles). Low cyclic pitch is a necessity to implement the swashplateless rotor concept using trailing edge flaps or active twist using current generation low authority piezoceramic actuators. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis of the helicopter rotor with elastic blades is used to perform parametric and sensitivity studies {{of the effects of}} longitudinal and lateral center of gravity (cg) movements on the main rotor cyclic pitch. An optimization approach is then used to find cg locations which reduce the cyclic pitch at a given forward speed. Findings – It is found that the longitudinal cyclic pitch and <b>lateral</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> can be driven to zero at a given forward speed by shifting the cg forward and to the port side, respectively. There also exist pairs of numbers for the longitudinal and lateral cg locations which drive both the cyclic pitch components to zero at a given forward speed.

Originality/value – The reduction in the cyclic pitch due to helicopter cg location is found to significantly reduce the maximum magnitudes of the control angles in flight, facilitating the swashplateless rotor concept.

40|$|Helicopter {{aeroelastic}} {{analysis is}} highly complex and multidisciplinary in nature; {{the flexibility of}} main rotor blades is coupled with aerodynamics, dynamics and control systems. A key component of an aeroelastic analysis is the vehicle trim procedure. Trim requires calculation of the main rotor and tail rotor controls and the vehicle attitude which cause the six steady forces and moments about the helicopter center of gravity to be zero. Trim simulates steady level flight of the helicopter. The trim equations are six nonlinear equations which depend on blade response and aerodynamic forcing through finite element analysis. Simulating {{the behavior of the}} helicopter in flight requires the solution of this system of nonlinear algebraic equations with unknowns being pilot controls and vehicle attitude angles. The nonlinear solution procedure is prone to slow convergence and occasional divergence causing problems in optimization and stochastic simulation studies. In this thesis, an attempt is made to efficiently solve the nonlinear equations involved in helicopter trim. Typically, nonlinear equations in mathematical physics and engineering are solved by linearizing the equations and forming various iterative procedures, then executing the numerical simulation. Helicopter aeroelasticity involves the solution of systems of nonlinear equations in a computationally expensive environment. The Newton method is typically used for the solution of these equations. Due to the expensive nature of each aeroelastic analysis iteration, Jacobian calculation at each iteration for the Newton method is not feasible for the trim problems. Thus, the Jacobian is calculated only once about the initial trim estimate and held constant thereafter. However, Jacobian modifications and updates can improve the performance of the Newton method. A comparative study is done in this thesis by incorporating different Jacobian update methods and selecting appropriate damping schemes for solving the nonlinear equations in helicopter trim. A modified Newton method with varying damping factor, Broyden rank- 1 update and BFGS rank- 2 update are explored using the Jacobian calculated at the initial guess. An efficient and robust approach for solving the strongly coupled nonlinear equations in helicopter trim based on the modified Newton method is developed. An appropriate initial estimate of the trim state is needed for successful helicopter trim. Typically, a guess from a simpler physical model such as a rigid blade analysis is used. However, it is interesting to study the impact of other starting points on the helicopter trim problem. In this work, an attempt is made to determine the control inputs that can have considerable effect on the convergence of trim solution in the aeroelastic analysis of helicopter rotors by investigating the basin of attraction of the nonlinear equations (set of initial guess points from which the nonlinear equations converge).
