25|$|Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector on 26 June 1657 at Westminster Hall, sitting upon King Edward's Chair, {{which was}} moved {{specially}} from Westminster Abbey for the occasion. The event in part echoed a coronation, using {{many of its}} symbols and regalia, such as a purple ermine-lined robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre (but not a crown or an orb). But, most notably, the office of Lord Protector was still not to become hereditary, though Cromwell was now able to nominate his own successor. Cromwell's new rights and powers were {{laid out in the}} Humble Petition and Advice, a <b>legislative</b> <b>instrument</b> which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers (in place of the House of Lords). In the Humble Petition it was called the Other House as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created two baronages after the acceptance of the Humble Petition and Advice—Charles Howard was made Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July 1657 and Edmund Dunch was created Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658.|$|E

2500|$|In the GCHQ case, Lord Diplock {{described}} the third broad head {{of judicial review}} – procedural impropriety – as including both [...] "a failure... to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the <b>legislative</b> <b>instrument</b> by which [...] jurisdiction is conferred" [...] and a [...] "failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who {{will be affected by}} the decision".|$|E

An example was provided by the Court of Appeal of Singapore in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011). The Court said if there was conclusive evidence that the Cabinet had not complied with the procedure set out in Article 22P(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore for determining if the President should grant a pardon to a person sentenced to death– for example, if it had not met to consider the issue, or had tossed a coin to decide– this was a breach of law that the courts could intervene to correct.|$|E

40|$|The legal {{framework}} and legislation governing {{the rights of}} the children have become of great concern in modern societies, particularly, in the area of criminal justice and human rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child are basic international and regional conventions regulating {{the rights of the}} children and include how to deal with children in conflict with the law. States parties to these conventions are required to take appropriate measures, which includes enactment of legislation to give effect to these rights. <b>Legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> must address the following issues: The principle of {{the best interest of the}} child; the age of criminal responsibility; restorative justice; diversion; and the trials of children in conflict with the law. The above-mentioned instrument require and emphasise the use of an alternative approach in respect of the children who are in conflict with law. In this research a comparative approach is used to compare the South African and South Sudanese child justice <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments.</b> The <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> pertaining to child justice in both countries are set out and compared. It is concluded that the South African <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> are more aligned to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Recommendations and proposals are made to enact to adopt in South Sudan new legislative measures and provisions aim to afford more protection to children in conflict with the law and to strike a better balance between rights of a child and victim of crimes...|$|R

The agents are a politician and the voters; the <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> available to the legislator are ordinary and executive laws, which differ according to their visibility.

Scandalous decisions, moreover, tend to be implemented by means of less visible executive legislation, while ordinary acts are mainly used to implement non scandalous decisions.

5000|$|Enforcing {{environmental}} {{laws and regulations}} is an important ingredient in protecting the environment and reducing environmental harm. This is generally achieved by various environmental law enforcement agencies operating at an International, Regional, National, State and Local level. For instance, to some extent environmental law enforcement agencies operate only at an international level whereas others only operate at the local level. Furthermore, environmental law enforcement agencies utilise various enforcement methods to ensure compliance to environmental legislation. In some cases enforcement agencies rely on coercive powers to demand compliance to {{environmental laws}}, generally labelled “command and control” strategies, while others rely on conciliatory and educational strategies to persuade individuals, organisations and governments to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, it has increased the need for cooperation between different policing institutions.Environmental law enforcement agencies and police services do not operate in a vacuum; the <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> that political systems implement govern their activities and responsibilities within society. However, ostensibly it is the <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> implemented by governments that determine many of the strategies utilised by police services in protecting the environment. Generally these International, Regional, National and State <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> are designed to ensure industries, individuals, and governments comply with the various environmental obligations embedded in national statutes and laws. There are also international legal instruments and treaties that also affect the way that sovereign states deal with environmental issues [...]|$|R
