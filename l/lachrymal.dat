The orbit of Chenoprosopus milleri is nearly round and is about 32 mm. in diameter. It is smaller than Nigerpeton ricqlesi. The orbits are positioned midway along the skull length and widely spaced. The plane of the orbit is parallel with the lateral margin of the skull and is directed out and slightly upward. The orbit depression extends back and slightly down for {{a short distance from}} the middle of the posterior border and lies a little behind the naris and in a line with the orbit and the naris. The naris has a rounded and is approximately 10 mm wide and 7 mm long. The shape of nasals are large, rectangular, and about three times as long as wide. It is placed near the lateral margin of the skull and about 50 mm behind the tip of the rostrum. Its plane is directed out and upward. The otic notch is deep, open fully posteriorly and separated from the supratemporal and squamosal. The jugal is a large element extending from the anterior border of the orbit back at least as far as the ear opening. The upper side of the quadrate is thin, with plate-like bone extending up and forward as if to connect with the skull just above the otic notch. The septomaxillae are small, triangular elements, fully twice as long as wide, and form nearly the entire posterior border of the naris. It extends back between the nasals and the maxilla, but are apparently separated from the <b>lachrymals</b> by a considerable space.|$|R
6000|$|SIR: In {{the course}} of a tour which I made in Sicily, in the days of my juvenility, I passed some little time at the ancient city of Catania, at the foot of Mount Ætna. Here I became acquainted with the Chevalier L----, an old Knight of Malta. It was not many years after the time that Napoleon had {{dislodged}} the knights from their island, and he still wore the insignia of his order. He was not, however, one of those reliques of that once chivalrous body, who had been described was [...] "a few worn-out old men, creeping about certain parts of Europe, with the Maltese cross on their breasts;" [...] on the contrary, though advanced in life, his form was still light and vigorous; he had a pale, thin, intellectual visage, with a high forehead, and a bright, visionary eye. He seemed to take a fancy to me, as I certainly did to him, and we soon became intimate, I visited him occasionally, at his apartments, in the wing of an old palace, looking toward Mount Ætna. He was an antiquary, a virtuoso, and a connoisseur. His rooms were decorated with mutilated statues, dug up from Grecian and Roman ruins; old vases, <b>lachrymals,</b> and sepulchral lamps. He had astronomical and chemical instruments, and black-letter books, in various languages. I found that he had dipped a little in chimerical studies and had a hankering after astrology and alchymy. He affected to believe in dreams and visions, and delighted in the fanciful Rosicrucian doctrines. I cannot persuade myself, however, that he really believed in all these: I rather think he loved to let his imagination carry him away into the boundless fairy land which they unfolded.|$|R
6000|$|I would but turn these <b>lachrymals</b> to use, [...] And pour {{fresh oil}} {{in from the}} olive-grove, [...] To furnish them as new lamps. Shall I say [...] What made my heart beat with exulting love [...] A few weeks back?-- [...] The day was such a day [...] As Florence owes the sun. The sky above, [...] Its weight upon the {{mountains}} seemed to lay, [...] And palpitate in glory, like a dove [...] Who has flown too fast, full-hearted--take away [...] The image! for the heart of man beat higher [...] That day in Florence, flooding all her streets [...] And piazzas with a tumult and desire. [...] The people, with accumulated heats [...] And faces turned one way, as if one fire [...] Both drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats [...] And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall [...] To thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course, [...] Had graciously permitted, at their call, [...] The citizens to use their civic force [...] To guard their civic homes. So, one and all, [...] The Tuscan cities streamed up to the source [...] Of this new good at Florence, taking it [...] As good so far, presageful of more good,-- [...] The first torch of Italian freedom, lit [...] To toss in the next tiger's face who should [...] Approach too near them in a greedy fit,-- [...] The first pulse of an even flow of blood [...] To prove the level of Italian veins [...] Towards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed [...] From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains [...] Of orderly procession--banners raised, [...] And intermittent bursts of martial strains [...] Which died upon the shout, as if amazed [...] By gladness beyond music--they passed on! [...] The Magistracy, with insignia, passed,-- [...] And all the people shouted in the sun, [...] And all the thousand windows which had cast [...] A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down [...] (As if the houses overflowed at last), [...] Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes. [...] The Lawyers passed,--and still arose the shout, [...] And hands broke from the windows to surprise [...] Those grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out. [...] The Priesthood passed,--the friars with worldly-wise [...] Keen sidelong glances from their beards about [...] The street to see who shouted; many a monk [...] Who takes a long rope in the waist, was there: [...] Whereat the popular exultation drunk [...] With indrawn [...] "vivas" [...] the whole sunny air, [...] While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk [...] A cloud of kerchiefed hands,--"The church makes fair [...] Her welcome in the new Pope's name." [...] Ensued [...] The black sign of the [...] "Martyrs"--(name no name, [...] But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed [...] The Artists; next, the Trades; and after came [...] The People,--flag and sign, and rights as good-- [...] And very loud the shout was for that same [...] Motto, [...] "Il popolo." [...] IL POPOLO,-- [...] The word means dukedom, empire, majesty, [...] And kings in such an hour might read it so. [...] And next, with banners, each in his degree, [...] Deputed representatives a-row [...] Of every separate state of Tuscany: [...] Siena's she-wolf, bristling on the fold [...] Of the first flag, preceded Pisa's hare, [...] And Massa's lion floated calm in gold, [...] Pienza's following with his silver stare, [...] Arezzo's steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,-- [...] And well might shout our Florence, greeting there [...] These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent [...] The various children of her teeming flanks-- [...] Greeks, English, French--as if to a parliament [...] Of lovers of her Italy in ranks, [...] Each bearing its land's symbol reverent; [...] At which the stones seemed breaking into thanks [...] And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof [...] Arose; the very house-walls seemed to bend; [...] The very windows, up from door to roof, [...] Flashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend [...] With passionate looks the gesture's whirling off [...] A hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end [...] While all these passed; and ever in the crowd, [...] Rude men, unconscious of the tears that kept [...] Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud, [...] And none asked any why they laughed and wept: [...] Friends kissed each other's cheeks, and foes long vowed [...] More warmly did it; two-months' babies leapt [...] Right upward in their mother's arms, whose black [...] Wide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed [...] Each before either, neither glancing back; [...] And peasant maidens smoothly 'tired and tressed [...] Forgot to finger on their throats the slack [...] Great pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest, [...] But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes [...] Along the stones, and smiled as if they saw. [...] O heaven, I think that day had noble use [...] Among God's days! So near stood Right and Law, [...] Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise [...] Nor Right deny, and each in reverent awe [...] Honoured the other. And if, ne'ertheless, [...] That good day's sun delivered to the vines [...] No charta, and the liberal Duke's excess [...] Did scarce exceed a Guelf's or Ghibelline's [...] In any special actual righteousness [...] Of what that day he granted, still the signs [...] Are good and full of promise, we must say, [...] When multitudes approach their kings with prayers [...] And kings concede their people's right to pray [...] Both in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs, [...] So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay [...] When men from humble homes and ducal chairs [...] Hate wrong together. It was well to view [...] Those banners ruffled in a ruler's face [...] Inscribed, [...] "Live freedom, union, and all true [...] Brave patriots who are aided by God's grace!" [...] Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew [...] His little children to the window-place [...] He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest [...] They too should govern as the people willed. [...] What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best, [...] Declared his eyes filled up and overfilled [...] With good warm human tears which unrepressed [...] Ran down. I like his face; the forehead's build [...] Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps [...] Sufficient comprehension,--mild and sad, [...] And careful nobly,--not with care that wraps [...] Self-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad, [...] But careful with the care that shuns a lapse [...] Of faith and duty, studious not to add [...] A burden in the gathering of a gain. [...] And so, God save the Duke, I say with those [...] Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign, [...] May all wear in the visible overflows [...] Of spirit, such a look of careful pain!

60|$|The last skull which I need {{describe}} is {{a unique}} one, lent to me by Mr. Tegetmeier: it resembles a Polish skull in most of its characters, but has not the great frontal protuberance; it has, however, two rounded knobs of a different nature, which stand more in front, above the <b>lachrymal</b> bones. These curious knobs, into which the brain does not enter, are separated from each other by a deep medial furrow; and this is perforated by a few minute pores. The nasal bones stand rather wide apart, with their inner processes, and the ascending branches of the premaxillary, upturned and shortened. The two knobs no doubt supported the two great horn-like projections of the comb.|$|E

60|$|Section 114. Certain small {{muscles in}} the orbit (eye-socket) move the eye, and by their action {{contribute}} to our perception of the relative position of objects. There is a leash of four muscles rising from a spot behind the exit of the optic nerve from the cranium to the upper, under, anterior, and posterior sides of the eyeball. These are the superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior recti. Running {{from the front of}} the orbit obliquely to the underside of the eyeball is the inferior oblique muscle. Corresponding to it above is a superior oblique. A <b>lachrymal</b> gland lies in the postero-inferior angle of the orbit, and a Handerian gland in the corresponding position in front. In addition to the upper and lower eyelids of the human subject, the rabbit has a third, the nictitating lid, in the anterior corner of the eye.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this brings}} us back to that {{debatable}} thing--the pathos of Dickens--from which one has been withdrawn by the attractions of his boys. Little Dombey is a prize example of his pathos. Little Nell is another. Jeffrey, of the Edinburgh Review, who criticised [...] "Marmion" [...] and the [...] "Lady of the Lake" [...] so vindictively, shed tears over Little Nell. It is a matter of taste, or, as Science might say, of the <b>lachrymal</b> glands as developed in each individual. But the <b>lachrymal</b> glands of this amateur are not developed in that direction. Little Dombey and Little Nell leave me with a pair of dry eyes. I do not [...] "melt visibly" [...] over Little Dombey, like the weak-eyed young man who took out his books and trunk to the coach. The poor little chap was feeble and feverish, and had dreams of trying to stop a river with his childish hands, or to choke it with sand. It may be very good pathology, but I cannot see that it is at all right pathos. One does not like copy to be made out of the sufferings of children or of animals. One's heart hardens: the object is too manifest, the trick is too easy. Conceive a child of Dombey's age remarking, with his latest breath, [...] "Tell them that the picture on the stairs at school is not Divine enough!" [...] That is not the delirium of infancy, that is art-criticism: it is the Athenaeum on Mr. Holman Hunt. It is not true to nature; it is not good in art: {{it is the kind of}} thing that appears in Sunday-school books about the virtuous little boy who died. There is more true pathos in many a page of [...] "Huckleberry Finn." [...] Yet this is what Jeffrey gushed over. [...] "There has been nothing like the actual dying of that sweet Paul." [...] So much can age enfeeble the intellect, that he who had known Scott, and yet nibbled at his fame, descended to admiring the feeblest of false sentiment. As for Little Nell, who also has caused floods of tears to be shed, her case is sufficiently illustrated by the picture in the first edition ("Master Humphrey's Clock,", 1840, p. 210): ...|$|E
60|$|The world, to {{tell the}} private truth, cares but little for their loss, and, if left to itself, would soon forget to grieve; and though a nation has often been figuratively drowned in tears {{on the death of}} a great man, yet it is ten to one if an {{individual}} tear has been shed on the occasion, excepting from the forlorn pen of some hungry author. It is the historian, the biographer, and the poet, who have the whole burden of grief to sustain; who, kind souls! like undertakers in England, act the part of chief mourners; who inflate a nation with sighs it never heaved, and deluge it with tears it never dreamt of shedding. Thus, while the patriotic author is weeping and howling in prose, in blank verse, and in rhyme, and collecting the drops of public sorrow into his volume, as into a <b>lachrymal</b> vase, it is more than probable his fellow-citizens are eating and drinking, fiddling and dancing, as utterly ignorant of the bitter lamentations made in their name as are those men of straw, John Doe and Richard Roe, of the plaintiffs for whom they are generously pleased to become sureties.|$|E
60|$|Section 62. Similar from a {{physiological}} point of view, to the secretory glands which form the digestive fluids are those which furnish lubricating fluids, the <b>lachrymal</b> gland, and Harderian glands in the orbit internally to the eye, and posterior and anterior to it respectively, the sebaceous glands (oil glands) {{connected with the}} hair, and the anal and perineal glands. The secretions of excretory glands are removed from the body; chief among them are the sweat glands and kidneys. The sweat glands are microscopic tubular glands, terminating internally in a small coil (Figure VIII. s.g.) and are scattered thickly over the body, the water of their secretion being constantly removed by evaporation, and the small percentage of salt and urea remaining to accumulate as dirt, and the chief reasonable excuse for washing. The kidney structure is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5, Sheet 7. A great number of branching and straight looped, tubuli (little tubes) converge on an open space, the pelvis. Towards the outer layers (cortex) of the kidney, these tubuli terminate in little dilatations into which tangled knots of blood-vessels project: the dilatations are called Bowman's capsules (B.c.), and each coil of bloodvessel a glomerulus (gl.). In the capsules, water is drained from the blood; in the tubuli, urea and other salts in the urine are secreted from a branching network of vessels.|$|E
60|$|The skulls of {{the several}} breeds differ {{from each other and}} from the skull of the wild duck in very little except in the {{proportional}} length and curvature of the premaxillaries. These latter bones in the Call duck are short, and a line drawn from their extremities to the summit of the skull is nearly straight, instead of being concave as in the common duck; so that the skull resembles that of a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (figure 39), these same bones as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable manner, as represented. In the Labrador duck the premaxillaries are rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this breed the vertical ridges {{on each side of the}} supra-occipital bone are very prominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are relatively shorter than in the wild duck; and the inferior points of the paramastoids more prominent. In a Dutch tufted duck, the skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and was perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the <b>lachrymal</b> bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a different shape and nearly to touch the post. lat. processes of the frontal bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and stand in relation with so many other bones, I carefully compared them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they presented no difference.|$|E
6000|$|In these days, when [...] "Imperial cement" [...] is at a premium, {{who would}} dare {{suggest that the}} {{emotions}} of a parlour can by any possibility {{be the same as}} those exhibited in a salon furnished in the style of Louis Quatorze; that the tears of Bayswater can possibly be compared for saltness with the <b>lachrymal</b> fluid distilled from South Audley Street glands; that the laughter of Clapham can be as catching as the cultured cackle of Curzon Street? But we, whose best clothes are exhibited only in parlours, what are we to do? How can we lay bare the souls of Duchesses, explain the heart-throbs of peers of the realm? Some of my friends who, being Conservative, attend Primrose [...] "tourneys" [...] (or is it [...] "Courts of love"? I speak as an outsider. Something mediaeval, I know it is) do, it is true, occasionally converse with titled ladies. But the period for conversation is always limited owing to the impatience of the man behind; and I doubt if the interview is ever of much practical use to them, as conveying knowledge of the workings of the aristocratic mind. Those of us who are not Primrose Knights miss even this poor glimpse into the world above us. We know nothing, simply nothing, concerning the deeper feelings of the upper ten. Personally, I once received a letter from an Earl, but that was in connection with a dairy company of which his lordship was chairman, and spoke only of his lordship's views concerning milk and the advantages of the cash system. Of what I really wished to know--his lordship's passions, yearnings and general attitude to life--the circular said nothing.|$|E
60|$|Several breeds, differing in the {{proportions}} of the body, in {{the length of the}} ears, {{in the nature of the}} hair, in colour, etc., come under the S. indicus type. Nor is this surprising, considering how ancient the domestication of this form has been both in Europe and in China. In this latter country the date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar (3/7. Stan. Julien quoted by de Blainville 'Osteographie' page 163.) to go back at least 4900 years from the present time. This same scholar alludes to the existence of many local varieties of the pig in China; and at the present time the Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and tending their pigs, not even allowing them to walk from place to place. (3/8. Richardson 'Pigs, their Origin' etc. page 26.) Hence these pigs, as Nathusius has remarked (3/9. 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 47, 64.), display in an eminent degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race, and hence, no doubt, their high value in the improvement of our European breeds. Nathusius makes a remarkable statement ('Schweineschadel' s. 138), that the infusion of the 1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part of the blood of S. indicus into a breed of S. scrofa, is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the latter species. This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the chief distinctive characters of S. indicus, such as the shortness of the <b>lachrymal</b> bones, etc., being common to several species of the genus; for in crosses characters which are common to many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those appertaining to only a few species.|$|E
60|$|The tendency, however, acts under {{limiting}} conditions; {{and recognition}} of them will explain some apparent exceptions. In the human foetus, as in the lower vertebrata, the eyes are placed {{one on each side}} of the head. During evolution they become relatively nearer, and at birth are in front; though they are still, in the European infant as in the adult Mongol, proportionately further apart than they afterwards become. But this approximation shows no signs of further increase. Two reasons suggest themselves. One is that the two eyes have not quite the same function, since they are directed to slightly-different aspects of each object looked at; and, since the resulting binocular vision has an advantage over monocular vision, there results a check upon further approach towards identity of function and unity of structure. The other reason is that the interposed structures do not admit of any nearer approach. For the orbits of the eyes to be brought closer together, would imply a decrease in the olfactory chambers; and as these are probably not larger than is demanded by their present functional activity, no decrease can take place. Again, if we trace up the external organs of smell through fishes,[7] reptiles, ungulate mammals and unguiculate mammals, to man, we perceive a general tendency to coalescence in the median line; and on comparing the savage with the civilized, or the infant with the adult, we see this approach of the nostrils carried furthest in the most perfect of the species. But since the septum which divides them has the function both of an evaporating surface for the <b>lachrymal</b> secretion, and of a ramifying surface for a nerve ancillary to that of smell, it does not disappear entirely: the integration remains incomplete. These and other like instances do not however militate against the hypothesis. They merely show that the tendency is sometimes antagonized by other tendencies. Bearing in mind which qualification, we may say, that as differentiation of parts is connected with difference of function, so there appears to be a connexion between integration of parts and sameness of function.|$|E
6000|$|Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold {{stepped on}} to the {{scaffold}} in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate--short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate {{of the land of}} song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religi{{on to the}} hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers' association as a token of his regard and esteem. The nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their <b>lachrymal</b> ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and {{it is safe to say}} that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the ster provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: ...|$|E

50|$|His earlier {{writings}} largely {{dealt with}} themes involving anatomy, pathology and general surgery. Around 1853, his focus turned to ophthalmology, {{of which he}} was the author numerous articles on glaucoma, iridectomy, accommodation, retinal haemorrhage and treatment of diseases of the <b>lachrymal</b> passages.|$|E
50|$|The Harderian gland {{was first}} {{described}} in 1694 by Swiss anatomist Johann Jacob Harder (1656-1711). He documented his findings {{in a paper}} titled Glandula nova lachrymalis una cum ductu excretorio in cervis et damis, ("A new <b>lachrymal</b> gland with an excretory duct in red and fallow deer", English translation).|$|E

His tenth work for the Stuttgart Ballet, Nightlight, premiered in March 2010. Following his choreographic success in Stuttgart, he became a freelance choreographer working internationally.|$|E
50|$|Koskinonodon bakeri: The <b>lachrymal</b> {{does not}} contact the orbit, {{as it does}} in K. perfectus. In fact, it evolves to be even father from the orbit {{than it was in the}} pair’s most recent common ancestor. This is one of the only {{characteristics}} that distinguish it from K. perfectus. It was named in 1931 by Case.|$|E
50|$|Pliny {{reports about}} the Lemnian earth:if rubbed under the eyes, it moderates pain and {{watering}} from the same, and prevents the flow from the <b>lachrymal</b> ducts. In cases of haemorrhage it should be administered with vinegar. It is used against complaints of the spleen and kidneys, copious menstruation, also against poisons, and wounds caused by serpents.|$|E
50|$|The {{lacrimal}} sac or <b>lachrymal</b> sac is the upper dilated {{end of the}} nasolacrimal duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. It connects the lacrimal canaliculi, which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the nasolacrimal duct, which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity.|$|E
