5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to have been from a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E

5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed into the central Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} is the general path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper <b>level</b> <b>winds,</b> which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|R

25|$|On March 21, 1952, a {{significant}} surface low progressed across Oklahoma and Arkansas. Southerly winds transported dewpoints {{in excess of}} 64°F across portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee.

500|$|A {{tropical}} wave developed scattered convection in {{the central}} Caribbean Sea on June 24, while interacting with an upper-level low. It moved slowly northwestward, and remained disorganized due to strong upper <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear. Late on June 27, the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area, though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The {{area of low pressure}} became better defined over the central Yucatán Peninsula, and after the system turned to the northwest, convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. On June 29, following the development of a closed circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about [...] north of Progreso, Yucatán.|$|E
500|$|A gustnado, or {{gust front}} tornado, is a small, {{vertical}} swirl {{associated with a}} gust front or downburst. Because they are not connected with a cloud base, there is some debate {{as to whether or}} not gustnadoes are tornadoes. They are formed when fast moving cold, dry outflow air from a thunderstorm is blown through a mass of stationary, warm, moist air near the outflow boundary, resulting in a [...] "rolling" [...] effect (often exemplified through a roll cloud). If low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear is strong enough, the rotation can be turned vertically or diagonally and make contact with the ground. The result is a gustnado. They usually cause small areas of heavier rotational wind damage among areas of straight-line wind damage.|$|E

Strong upper <b>level</b> <b>winds</b> weakened the storm, and as {{a break in the}} subtropical ridge brought the storm northward, upper <b>level</b> <b>winds</b> from Typhoon Clara weakened Bill to a tropical storm on the 18th.

500|$|Convective rainbands {{can form}} {{parallel}} to terrain on its windward side, due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. [...] Their spacing is normally [...] to [...] apart. [...] When bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and {{just prior to}} the mountain ridge, which slows down the frontal rainband {{just prior to the}} mountain barrier.

[...] Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening. [...] The edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface.

500|$|The {{large scale}} {{synoptic}} scale flow determines 70 to 90 {{percent of a}} tropical cyclone's motion.

[...] Knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone, since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere due to differences in the coriolis force around the cyclone. [...] For example, the beta effect will allow a tropical cyclone to track poleward and slightly {{to the right of the}} deep layer steering flow while the system lies the south of the subtropical ridge. [...] Northwest moving storms move quicker and left, while northeast moving storms move slower and left. [...] The larger the cyclone, the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be.|$|E
500|$|Once a cyclone occludes, a trough of {{warm air}} aloft, or [...] "trowal" [...] for short, will {{be caused by}} strong southerly winds on its eastern {{periphery}} rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also {{be the focus of}} locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection. Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain. Behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter, rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. Downwind of islands, bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> convergence downwind of the island edges.

500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} African coast on June 4 showing some cyclonic curvature {{in the low}} clouds. It passed Barbados six days later, where a low-to-mid wind shift was detected. The wave {{was followed by a}} low <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> surge which was observed in Curaçao on June 12. Most of the shower activity associated with the wave moved westward over South America, and then over Panama on June 14. The convection became organized and developed into Tropical Depression Three-E on June 16 while it was located 348miles (560km) south of Salina Cruz. It became a tropical storm one day later. Carlos reached minimal hurricane strength on June 18. Two days later, Carlos was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status. A strong high pressure system forced Carlos to move over warmer waters and Carlos began to reintensify. Carlos regained hurricane status and developed a well-defined eye and excellent upper level outflow. On June 24, Carlos peaked at [...] central pressure and 115mph (185km/h) maximum sustained winds. The hurricane then weakened when it moved west over colder waters and encountered upper level shear. Carlos dissipated on June 27. The National Hurricane Center received no reports of impact due to this tropical cyclone.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Eastern Micronesia, Bavi {{continued}} to move westwards {{and threatened to}} impact the Mariana Islands as a typhoon. As a result the Guam Weather Forecast Office issued a typhoon watch and a tropical storm warning for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan during March 13. The islands were also placed in Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1 by Governors Eddie Calvo, Eloy Inos and Rear Admiral Bette Bolivar. The Guam Waterworks Authority advised residents on the island stock up on water ahead of the system, in case Bavi disrupted the island's water service. United Airlines, Cape Air and United Express all cancelled flights that departed from Guam, while schools were shut on the island during March 15. However, as Bavi approached the islands, upper <b>level</b> <b>wind</b> shear caused the system to decouple and start to gradually weaken. Bavi's circulation subsequently passed over Guam during March 15, with winds on the island barely reaching gale force on the island. Within Guam, sporadic power outages and minor tree damage were reported, while waves on the uninhabited northeastern coast of Guam reached [...] and were the highest waves recorded on the island in a decade. A band of showers associated with the system and a pressure gradient, between Bavi and an area of high pressure, brought winds of up to [...] to Saipan and Tinian. As a result several trees and power lines were brought down across the islands, which resulted in Saipan having sporadic power outages and temporarily losing all electric. Around 65 homes which were primarily constructed with wood and tin were affected by the winds, with 5 destroyed while a further 52 sustained some damage. The local Red Cross chapter subsequently provided tarpaulins, cleaning materials and over $25,000 in assistance to 252people, while total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150thousand.|$|E
