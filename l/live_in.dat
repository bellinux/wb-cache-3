5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} <b>live</b> <b>in</b> fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to <b>live</b> <b>in</b> freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can <b>live</b> <b>in</b> up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can <b>live</b> <b>in</b> salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
