30|$|Thus, {{it seems}} that at least the lower layers are on a good path towards the envisioned Gbps speeds. But {{how much of this}} {{capacity}} is available at the application level? The protocol overhead of the current Internet stack accumulates for roughly 50 % of the capacity, implying that an approximate of 30 [*]Mbps can be achieved. But are these the numbers we see in today's wireless networks? Fortunately, the MagNets outdoor network in Berlin shows link speeds of 30 [*]Mbps on one link, over 500 [*]m with directional antennas [6]. However, out of the 6 links in the testbed, only one link achieves this throughput because multiple conditions must be fulfilled to achieve this high throughput: perfect <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> directional <b>antennas,</b> and no interference. In fact, the link is based on 802.11 a technology, and the number of interfering networks in the 5 [*]GHz frequency band is still low. The other links in the MagNets testbed achieve between 16 and 18 [*]Mbps. Unfortunately, the MagNets backbone is an exception in terms of performance, as many other deployed networks achieve only single-digit throughputs; for example, the TfA network has a throughput of 6 – 8 [*]Mbps.|$|R

40|$|A {{matched pair}} of {{computer}} algorithms determines whether <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (LOS) is obstructed by terrain. These algorithms were originally {{designed for use}} in conjunction with combat-simulation software in military training exercises, but {{could also be used}} for such commercial purposes as evaluating <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> for <b>antennas</b> or determining what can be seen from a "room with a view. " The quadtree preparation algorithm operates on an array of digital elevation data and only needs to be run once for a terrain region, which can be quite large. Relatively little computation time is needed, as each elevation value is considered only one and one-third times. The LOS assessment algorithm uses that quadtree to answer LOS queries. To determine whether LOS is obstructed, a piecewise-planar (or higher-order) terrain skin is computationally draped over the digital elevation data. Adjustments are made to compensate for curvature of the Earth and for refraction of the LOS by the atmosphere. Average computing time appears to be proportional to the number of queries times the logarithm of the number of elevation data points. Accuracy is as high as is possible for the available elevation data, and symmetric results are assured. In the simulation, the LOS query program runs as a separate process, thereby making more random-access memory available for other computations...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is {{the observation of}} rapid fluctuations of the radio signal from an astronomical compact source as the signal passes through the ever-changing density of the solar wind. Cross-correlation of simultaneous observations of IPS from a single radio source, received at multiple sites of the European Incoherent SCATter (EISCAT) radio antenna network, is {{used to determine the}} velocity of the solar wind material passing over the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>antennas.</b> Calculated velocities reveal the slow solar wind to contain rapid velocity variations when viewed on a time-scale of several minutes. Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations of white-light intensity have been compared with EISCAT observations of IPS to identify common density structures that may relate to the rapid velocity variations in the slow solar wind. We have surveyed a one-year period, starting in April 2007, of the EISCAT IPS observing campaigns beginning shortly after the commencement of full science operations of the STEREO mission in a bid to identify common density structures in both EISCAT and STEREO HI datasets. We provide a detailed investigation and presentation of joint IPS/HI observations from two specific intervals on 23 April 2007 and 19 May 2007 for which the IPS P-Point (point of closest approach <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> to the Sun) was between 72 and 87 solar radii out from the Sun?s centre. During the 23 April interval, a meso-scale (of the order of 105 km or larger) transient structure was observed by HI- 1 A to pass over the IPS ray path near the P-Point; the observations of IPS showed a micro-scale structure (of the order of 102 km) within the meso-scale transient. Observations of IPS from the second interval, on 19 May, revealed similar micro-scale velocity changes, however, no transient structures were detected by the HIs during that period. We also pose some fundamental thoughts on the slow solar wind structure itself. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{temperature}} profiles at densities {{above the}} electron cyclotron emission (ECE) cutoff are {{measured at the}} W 7 -AS stellarator by a novel diagnostic based on black body emission and Bernstein-extraordinary-ordinary mode conversion of electron Bernstein waves (EBWs). The radiation is collected along a special oblique <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> by an <b>antenna</b> with gaussian optics. This was optimized for maximal conversion efficiency and minimal Doppler broadening by means of EBW ray tracing calculations in full stellarator geometry. The elliptical O-mode polarization detected along the oblique <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> is changed into a linear polarization by a broadband quarter wave shifter, namely an elliptical waveguide. The signal is spectrum analyzed by an heterodyne radiometer and temperature profiles are derived from spectra by means of ray tracing. The diagnostic was applied to measurements of edge-localized modes to illustrate its advantages in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Moreover, for the first time, the heat wave propagation method for the determination of local heat transport coefficients was extended beyond the ECE cutoff density by combining EBW emission measurements at the first harmonic (f = 66 – 78 GHz) with modulated EBW heating at the second harmonic (140 GHz) ...|$|R
40|$|To improve desktop {{wireless}} internet access, two patch antenna configurations were investigated {{in order to}} find an alternative for a dipole antenna, which is commonly used for Wi-Fi access. A Linksys WMP 54 G pci-card wireless adapter was used to test three antennas for 802. 11 g communications. The standard WMP 54 G dipole antenna and two patch antenna configurations were tested for Wi-Fi signal strength. The antennas were also tested in Cal Poly’s anechoic chamber to obtain resonant frequency and gain measurements. A 2. 437 GHz center frequency, 72 MHz bandwidth antenna consisting of a single microstrip patch was constructed. After the patch antenna was determined to operate over the frequency range, an array of four patch elements on a single substrate was constructed. Although the patch array did not match the calculated gain, beamwidth and sidelobe radiation level improvements over a single patch design were achieved. Both patch antenna configurations had greater gain over the WMP 54 G dipole antenna, however improved Wi-Fi signal strength was only accomplished when used in direct <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> communications.

As Project Scientist of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Hawaii he was closely involved with the design and operation of this highly successful telescope. For his outstanding contribution to this project he was awarded the Jacksonian Gwilt Medal and Gift of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1989. From 2007 to 2012 he was Project Scientist of the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) in Chile. The first scheduled observations at 345 GHz using 16 of the planned 66 antennas took place in September 2011. These demonstrated the full angular resolution obtained by phase-coherent aperture synthesis which requires continuous monitoring of atmospheric absorption along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> above each <b>antenna.</b> The outstanding scientific leadership shown by Richard Hills undoubtedly played a major part in the success of this challenging international project.|$|R
40|$|The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) {{makes use}} of water vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the {{atmospheric}} water vapour line at 183 GHz along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> above each <b>antenna</b> to correct for phase delays introduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application of WVR derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the 39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a few to ~ 30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is improved: 6 by 450 GHz) and long-baseline (> 5 km) observations. These inherently have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (< 1 mm) conditions for which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the scaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data. Comment: 27 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables - Accepted to A&...|$|R

To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions mediate the relationship between <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators.
