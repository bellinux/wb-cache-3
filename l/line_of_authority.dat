25|$|Opponents of the Treaty {{refused to}} {{recognise}} either the Provisional Government or, {{when it was}} established, the Irish Free State, insisting that the Irish Republic continued to exist as a de jure entity. Their <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> included some TDs but also the Army Executive of the IRA which decided in early 1922 that it, and no longer the Dáil, was the only body loyal to the republic. In August 1920 it had sworn allegiance to both the Dáil and the republic, and felt that the Dáil had broken its oath when it voted to approve the Treaty. Arguments about abandoning the republic had, however, been very fully discussed during the Treaty Debates.|$|E
25|$|Under the City of Rahway's form of government, all {{executive}} and administrative authority is vested {{in the office}} of the mayor, who appoints the Business Administrator and department directors. The Business Administrator develops an annual budget for the city, manages the city's departments and oversees its employees. This form of government gives citizens a centralized <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> for the efficient management of the city's business. There are nine members of the Municipal Council, all elected to four-year terms of office. Six members of the council are elected from each of six wards. The other three members are elected to represent the entire city at large, and come up for election at the same time as the mayor two years after the ward seats are up for election.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, by a {{majority}} of five to two, decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings. This reversed a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> dating back 400 years. The case considered the narrow issue, namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit, and the wider public policy issue of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for breach of duty. There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings, although judges {{on both sides of the}} decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point. [...] Lord Phillips, a member of the majority, compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates, on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court. [...] Advocates' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons. [...] The change, he said, had not led to an increase in vexatious claims or a reduction in the performance of duties owed by advocates to the court. [...] Lord Hope, in the minority, said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison. He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{according}} to Scalia, Thomas is {{more willing to}} overrule constitutional cases than he was: [...] "If a constitutional <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> is wrong, he would say let's get it right. I wouldn't do that." [...] Law professor Michael Gerhardt, however, says that Scalia's characterization of Thomas may be incorrect, given that Thomas has supported leaving {{a broad spectrum of}} constitutional decisions intact. Thomas's belief in originalism is strong; he has said, [...] "When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution's original meaning." [...] Thomas believes that an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, no matter how old it is.|$|E
2500|$|Classical [...] {{refers to}} a {{specific}} type of ordination that, according to traditional Jewish teaching, traces a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> back to Moshe ben Amram, The Men of the Great Assembly, and the Great Sanhedrin. The line of classical [...] died out in the 4th or 5th century CE but it is widely held that a line of Torah conferment remains unbroken. Some believe evidence existed that classical [...] was existent during the 12th century when [...] from Lebanon and Syria were traveling to Israel in order to pass on Torah conferment to their students. [...] Others, such as Rav Yisroel of Shklov (1770–1839), believed [...] may not have been broken at all but that it continued outside of the land of Israel. Today many believe in the existence of an unbroken chain of rabbinical tradition dating back to the time of Moshe ben Amram ("Moses") and Yehoshua ben Nun ("Joshua") [...] (See [...] "The Unbroken Chain of Torah" [...] below).|$|E
2500|$|Harper gave {{special status}} in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> to members of his cabinet: under an order-in-council issued by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on February 6, 2006—the day Harper was {{appointed}} prime minister—when [...] "the prime minister is unable to perform the functions of his office", Lawrence Cannon, then Jim Prentice, then {{the balance of the}} Cabinet by order of precedence, were [...] "authorized to act for the prime minister". This order was followed by a number of others updating the list; in each case, the status as the top person on that list was accorded to the vice-chair of the cabinet's Priorities and Planning Committee. Previous prime ministers have had similar orders-in-council, under which the deputy prime minister and then the balance of the Cabinet, in order of precedence, have been authorized to act for the prime minister. Media analysts generally credited the top person on these lists as being the de facto deputy prime minister, although the title was never conferred. These [...] "order of precedence" [...] lists have no status as a formal line of succession, however, and would carry no special weight in determining who would take over as the new prime minister if an incumbent died in office or was forced to suddenly resign in advance of a leadership convention.|$|E

2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|E
