5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
25|$|They also acid-dipped {{the body}} on the Camaro and had to caution people not to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> it, for fear it would dent. The {{lightweight}} car was featured on an episode of Dream Car Garage on Speed TV in 2005.|$|E
25|$|A myotonic goat, {{otherwise}} known as the fainting goat, is a domestic goat that freezes for roughly 3 seconds when it feels panic. Though painless, this generally results in the animal collapsing on its side. The characteristic {{is caused by a}} hereditary genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. When startled, younger goats will stiffen and fall over. Older goats learn to spread their legs or <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> something when startled, and often they continue to run about in an awkward, stiff-legged shuffle.|$|E

25|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Madagascar, social life among the Bara is strongly guided by fady, ancestral taboos that often vary by class, by village, or even by family. In some Bara villages, it is forbidden {{to carry a}} load alone; {{at least two people}} must carry it together. A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another. It is also fady to step over someone seated or lying on the ground, lift or carry an item over another person's head or body, brush another person with one's lamba, or sit on or <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> another's bed.|$|E
25|$|The alley scene {{had to use}} a lot of computer-generated imagery to {{accomplish}} the look that the team needed. The entire alley had to be tracked by the computer in order {{to make sure that the}} digital raindrops hit all the objects in the frame, including dumpsters that were visible. In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

500|$|Wells Cathedral {{has one of}} {{the finest}} sets of misericords in Britain. Its clergy has a long {{tradition}} of singing or reciting from the Book of Psalms each day, along with the customary daily reading of the Holy Office. In medieval times the clergy assembled in the church eight times daily for the canonical hours. As the greater part of the services was recited while standing, many monastic or collegiate churches were fitted with stalls in which the seats tipped up to provide a convenient ledge for the monk or cleric to <b>lean</b> <b>against.</b> They were called [...] "misericords" [...] because their installation was an act of mercy. Misericords typically have a carved figurative bracket beneath the ledge framed by two floral motifs known, in the heraldic manner, as [...] "supporters".|$|E
500|$|Male giraffes {{use their}} necks as weapons in combat, a {{behaviour}} known as [...] "necking". Necking {{is used to}} establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on {{the weight of the}} skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: [...] "He's just super bland. Like, how could you possibly be a fan of Patrick Duffy?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It {{looks as though}} they're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!". With Alex Catarinella of Paper saying [...] "she belts out soaring vocals, is further proof that she's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1901, {{he married}} Mathilde Zemlinsky, {{the sister of}} the {{conductor}} and composer Alexander von Zemlinsky, with whom Schoenberg had been studying since about 1894. He and Mathilde had two children, Gertrud (1902–1947) and Georg (1906–1974). Gertrud would marry Schoenberg's pupil Felix Greissle in 1921 [...] During the summer of 1908, his wife Mathilde left him for several months for a young Austrian painter, Richard Gerstl. This period marked a distinct change in Schoenberg's work. It was during the absence of his wife that he composed [...] "You <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> a silver-willow" [...] (...) , the thirteenth song in the cycle Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten, Op. 15, based on {{the collection of the}} same name by the German mystical poet Stefan George. This was the first composition without any reference at all to a key [...] Also in this year, he completed one of his most revolutionary compositions, the String Quartet No.2, whose first two movements, though chromatic in color, use traditional key signatures, yet whose final two movements, also settings of George, daringly weaken the links with traditional tonality. Both movements end on tonic chords, and the work is not fully non-tonal. Breaking with previous string-quartet practice, it incorporates a soprano vocal line.|$|E
