40|$|A <b>locking</b> <b>fastener</b> {{assembly}} comprising {{a fastener}} having a shaft (12) {{and a head}} (14 or 114) and first threads (16) for placing the shaft (12) in tension to clamp a part (18). A threaded washer (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between the head (14 or 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) for urging the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) to rotate in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by the}} first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually rotates the washer (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12). To assemble the components, the hex head (14 or 114) is first torsionally loaded against the washer (20) utilizing the torsional spring (24) such that the components would rotate apart if the pre-load was removed. The hex head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are of the same polygonal (hexagonal) shape and are rotated together with a conventional socket type wrench disposed over both at the same time. The <b>locking</b> <b>fastener</b> assembly is then tightened as the head (14 or 114) and washer (20) are rotated together or in unison to the desired torque...|$|E
40|$|Screw {{fasteners}} {{are undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most important machine elements due to their outstanding characteristic to provide a high clamping force just with a simplified design. However, the loosen vibration is their inherent and inevitable fault. The friction locking approach is one of the basic <b>locking</b> <b>fastener</b> categories by enhancing the bearing load on the contact surface of thread by applying a locking force on an antiloosening nut. This locking force may cause more severe deformation in the nut. The contact stress distribution on the nut would be changed and that can cause the variation of the friction torque for the bolt joint. However, there exists no established design calculation procedure that accounts for the rotation deformation and its stiffness of the antiloosening nut under the locking force. The main objective of the work is to develop an analytical solution to the rotation deformation problem encountered in the antiloosening nut. The proposed model is supported by comparison with numerical finite element analysis of different sizes of joint elements and different applied forces...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{much needed}} representative sample data for reuse life of fully seated and torqued locknuts. Most national requirements for prevailing torque <b>locking</b> <b>fasteners</b> only specify unseated reuse life. This {{could create a}} potentially dangerous situation if unseated is misinterpreted for seated. This thesis provides comparative data for seated verses unseated configuration. Six aerospace, 3 all-metal and 3 nylon insert, and one non-aerospace locknuts were tested at preloads levels of unseated, 66...|$|R
40|$|Crushable washers {{proposed}} {{for use in}} protecting composite-material (matrix/fiber) panels against overloads applied by nut-and-bolt fasteners. Intended for use at drilled holes, where strengths of composite panels reduced by exposure of ends of fibers. Washer consists of metal skin filled with microcapsules of epoxy resin and hardener. Alternatively, filled with fibers collapsing under given load. Crushing action simultaneously fractures microcapsules (if used), releasing components of epoxy. These components mix and fill bolthole and fiber-reinforcement interstices. Epoxy then hardens, <b>locking</b> <b>fasteners</b> in place...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of the end distance of cam <b>lock</b> <b>fasteners</b> on the bending moment resistance of knock-down corner joints. The preliminary study of knock-down furniture assembly plans was done in order to discover the manufacturers’ fastener typical usage in case construction. Laminated particleboard, cam fasteners and wooden dowels were used for specimen construction. L-shaped joint specimens 760 mm in length were tested by pressing the joint members together – also called a compression test in the angle plane. The study results showed that cam fasteners with end distance of 60 mm from the member edges perform the best...|$|R

5000|$|Fingleton {{emphasizes}} {{the degree to}} which Japan and other advanced manufacturing nations such as Germany have established global monopolies - in his terms [...] "chokepoints" [...] - in supplying little-noticed but vital materials, components, and production machinery without which less advanced manufacturing nations such as China could not manufacture consumer goods. Writing in the New Republic in 2011, he commented: [...] "As world manufacturing has become more technologically advanced, {{it is more likely that}} a single supplier, or even a single factory, can be critical to a whole industry. And we know that, in this vein, Japanese corporations enjoy monopolies or oligopolies in a host of crucial niches in supplying advanced materials, components and production machinery for industries like electronics, cars, and aerospace. In two books in the 1990s, I made a sustained effort to track Japan's more important manufacturing ‘chokepoints,’ as they are known to customers. I succeeded in identifying close to 100. Some are well known, such as the YKK Company's global <b>lock</b> on zip <b>fasteners</b> and Shimano's dominance in bicycle gears. Many have hitherto gone largely unnoticed, but are actually much more important to the smooth functioning of the world economy. A good example is semiconductor-grade silicon—a highly purified not-an-atom-out-of-place material that only a couple of companies worldwide can make. The leading suppliers, Shin-Etsu and Sumco, are both Japanese and, as far as I can tell, there are no significant suppliers left in either Europe or America." ...|$|R
