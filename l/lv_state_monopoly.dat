40|$|This paper {{compares the}} prices charged {{and the quality}} of service {{provided}} by <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> and private insurance companies on the property insurance market. Both the cross-section data from Switzerland and the time-series evidence from Germany strongly suggest that in this specific market the presence of <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> is very advantageous for the customers. This raises the question why German academic economists made practically no effort to defend their <b>state</b> insurance <b>monopolies</b> in the debate about the 3 rd EU directive on property insurance. Is it possible that peer pressure prevents academic economists from standing up to defend <b>state</b> <b>monopolies,</b> even if these are clearly to the benefit of consumers...|$|R

40|$|In Switzerland {{there are}} seven cantons where the housing {{insurance}} market is competitive, while in the 19 others there are local <b>state</b> <b>monopolies.</b> This paper compares the price/performance relationship of these different market forms. It is shown that for a very similar product the <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> charge 70 % lower prices, that they spend substantially more on fire prevention, {{and that they have}} much lower damage rates. One of the main reasons for the higher prices of the private insurance companies is the fact that they spend considerably more on sales and administrative costs. The housing insurance market is thus a classic example of a situation where <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> outperforms private sector competition...|$|R

40|$|The {{flexible}} regulations, {{which could}} be adaptable to the volatile socio-economic conditions, have been taken {{the place of the}} strict and restrictive regula- tions in the working life since the 1990 ’s. The searching for flexibility in the working life has also affected the employment services; the private employment agencies have been getting more effective in the working life while leaving the case of the <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> both in the national and the international regulations concerning the employment services. There had been a <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the employment services for more than a half of a cen- tury in Turkey, but with the introduction of the new legal regulations since 2000, a new era has begun in which the private employment agencies has also come into effect in the employment services.
