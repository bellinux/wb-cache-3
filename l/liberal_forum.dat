25|$|A {{legislative}} {{snap election}} for the National Council in Austria {{was held on}} 28 September 2008. The previous election was held on 1 October 2006. The election (the 24th in Austrian history) {{was caused by the}} withdrawal of Austrian People's Party leader Wilhelm Molterer from the governing grand coalition (led by the Social Democratic Party of Austria) on 7 July 2008. Due to dissatisfaction with the grand coalition and the two main parties, it was widely expected to be a realigning election, with gains for the opposition and up to seven parties expected to be in the National Council after the election. The losses for the government parties (both the SPÖ and the ÖVP had the worst election result in history) resulted in strong gains for the far right, while neither the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Forum</b> nor the Citizens' Forum Austria (both of which were considered to have chances of gaining seats) gained as much as 2% of the vote, defying earlier expectations. The result of the election was seen as strong for the far-right and in support of Eurosceptics.|$|E

500|$|While Haider often {{employed}} controversial rhetoric, his expressed {{political goals}} included small government with more direct democracy rather than centralized totalitarianism. Following the increasing importance of immigration {{as a political}} issue, in 1993 the party decided to launch the [...] "Austria First!" [...] initiative (calling for a referendum on immigration issues). The initiative was controversial and five FPÖ MPs, including Heide Schmidt, left the party and founded the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Forum</b> (LiF). The FPÖ's relations with the Liberal International also became increasingly strained, and later that year the FPÖ left the LI (which was preparing to expel it). In turn, the LiF soon joined the Liberal International instead. In 1999, Haider was again elected Governor of Carinthia.|$|E
500|$|The FPÖ {{was founded}} in 1956 as the {{successor}} to the short-lived Federation of Independents (VdU), representing the [...] "Third Camp" [...] of Austrian politics, i.e. pan-Germanists and national liberals opposed to both socialism and Catholic clericalism. The party's first leader was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi functionary and SS officer. The FPÖ, a third party with modest support, {{was admitted to the}} Liberal International (LI) in 1979 and participated in a government led by the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), following the 1983 legislative election. When Jörg Haider was chosen as new FPÖ leader in 1986, the party started an ideological turn towards right-wing populism. This new political course soon resulted in a strong surge in electoral support, although it also led the SPÖ to break ties. In 1993, after a controversial proposal on immigration issues, the adherents of a position closer to classical liberalism broke away from the FPÖ and formed the <b>Liberal</b> <b>Forum</b> (LiF), which took over the FPÖ's membership in the LI (since the FPÖ considered itself forced to leave) and would later eventually merge into NEOS.|$|E
