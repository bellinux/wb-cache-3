5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes {{that we know of}} and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere and he was a servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E
5|$|The war {{convinced}} most Swiss of {{the need}} for unity and strength towards its European neighbours. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged.|$|E
5|$|The Almanac of American Politics rates congressional votes as <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> {{conservative}} on {{the political}} spectrum, in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Kennedy's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative, the social rating was 89 percent liberal and 5 percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 96 percent liberal and 0 percent conservative.|$|E

5|$|A {{break from}} the studies came {{in the second half}} of 1892. After his father's death, he could not afford to attend {{university}} that semester. He worked briefly as a private tutor in the Skien district, and was paid to write in the newspaper Varden. On returning to his studies he worked as a Kristiania correspondent for the newspaper; eventually he also worked for Päivälehti. In 1901 he took over from Erik Vullum as obituarist and anniversary writer in Verdens Gang. In the next years he would contribute extensively to publications such as Den 17de Mai, Nationalbladet, Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift, Syn og Segn, Samtiden, Unglyden, Dagbladet, Verdens Gang and Tidens Tegn; these were mostly <b>Liberal</b> <b>or</b> Norwegian nationalist publications.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Willkie {{made two}} wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's {{informal}} envoy, and as nominal {{leader of the}} Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> internationalist causes. Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either <b>Liberal</b> <b>or</b> Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E

5|$|Increased support also materialised {{when the}} Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp, the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought {{financial}} aid from Nasjonal Samling, {{who in turn}} gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, {{in part because of}} competition from the Conservative Party for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of Nasjonal Samling's existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the October elections, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, <b>Liberal</b> <b>or</b> Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, <b>Liberal</b> <b>or</b> Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in the U.S. Senate, Feingold gained a {{reputation}} as a political maverick with an independent streak. When he broke with his own party, it was often because he was taking a more <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> populist position than other Democrats. Throughout his congressional tenure, several ranking systems placed Feingold among the nation's most <b>liberal</b> <b>or</b> progressive senators.|$|E

50|$|By the 1980s, the Union Nationale {{no longer}} could rely on a {{significant}} get-out-the-vote organization or attract any media attention.
