40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> and oral health care among Mexican-origin children. Using the 2001 – 2014 California Health Interview Surveys, the objectives are: (1) to demonstrate population-level changes in the <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> <b>of</b> parents, the <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> <b>of</b> children, {{and the likelihood of}} receiving dental care; (2) to reveal how the roles <b>of</b> <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> boundaries in dental care are changing; and (3) to determine whether the salience of these boundaries is attributable to <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> per se. The results reveal increases in the native-born share and dental care utilization for the total Mexican-origin population. Although dental care was primarily linked to parental citizenship early in this period, parental <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> are no longer a unique source of variation in utilization (despite the greater likelihood of insurance among citizens). These results imply that future gains in utilization among Mexican-origin children will mainly come from overcoming barriers to care among the native born...|$|R

5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a marriage license {{on the grounds that}} India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics of colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many families from starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

5|$|Slavery {{existed in}} China since ancient times, {{although}} during the Han dynasty {{the proportion of}} slaves to the overall population was roughly 1%, far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco-Roman world (estimated at about 15% of the entire population). During the Tang period slaves {{were not allowed to}} marry a commoner's daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female member of their master's family, and although fornication with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master's son, which allowed for her elevation to the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> a commoner, yet she could only live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master.|$|E
5|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin {{are listed}} as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed {{by the government to}} take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E

5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|E
5|$|Peasant {{society is}} much less {{documented}} than the nobility. Most of the surviving information available to historians comes from archaeology; few detailed written records documenting peasant life remain from before the 9th century. Most of the descriptions of the lower classes come from either law codes or writers from the upper classes. Landholding patterns in the West were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented landholding patterns, but in other areas large contiguous blocks of land were the norm. These differences allowed {{for a wide variety}} of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others having a great deal of autonomy. Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements that numbered as many as 700 inhabitants. Others lived in small groups of a few families and still others lived on isolated farms spread over the countryside. There were also areas where the pattern was a mix of two or more of those systems. Unlike in the late Roman period, there was no sharp break between the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the free peasant and the aristocrat, and it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise into the aristocracy over several generations through military service to a powerful lord.|$|E
5|$|RKO, and {{the movie}} {{industry}} as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best Years of Our Lives, was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade. But the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO {{that the company was}} liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent movie house access to first run films—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40% of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dore Schary, who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.|$|E
