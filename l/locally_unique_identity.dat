40|$|Place identities {{have become}} contested {{subjects}} in contemporary tourism place promotion. The growing importance of difference and uniqueness {{in an increasingly}} competitive global tourism environment has made it more pressing than ever that tourism places brand globally recognisable, yet <b>locally</b> <b>unique,</b> place <b>identities.</b> A tension exists between this need to be globally recognisable and <b>locally</b> <b>unique,</b> however. Risks of increasing homogenisation and of alienation of local residents have led to increasing calls {{for the inclusion of}} local residents' values in tourism place promotion. The realities of the international tourism marketing context, by contrast, necessitate the creation and maintenance of internationally competitive, demand-oriented place products. This tension inherent in place making leads to a more fundamental theoretical question {{at the heart of the}} structure-agency debate in the social sciences generally and the space-place debate in geography in particular: how best to conceptualise the relationship between structure and agency in general and in contemporary tourism-based place making in particular? In this thesis, I explore and compare two different theoretical attempts to conceptualise this structure-agency relationship using two case studies of tourism place making in Queenstown and Glenorchy in the South Island of New Zealand. I explore both Lefebvre's (1991 a) The Production of Space and two spatial applications of Habermas' critical theory (critical regionalism and communicative planning theory) in order to establish how they contribute to an understanding of the tension inherent in place making evidenced in the Queenstown and Glenorchy case studies. I conclude by suggesting that a synthesis of Lefebvrian understandings of power and material spatial practice with the normative, guiding stance drawn from critical theory may provide direction for the design of planning tools that support the development of critical versions of local place identity...|$|R

Sufficient conditions are also given for local uniqueness of solutions of the nonlinear complementarity problem...|$|R

As stated above, in a regular economy equilibria will be finite, hence <b>locally</b> <b>unique.</b> One reassuring result, due to Debreu, is that [...] "most" [...] economies are regular.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to explore approaches to create <b>unique</b> <b>identities</b> by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics. Various government sectors in the world provide different services and welfare schemes for the beneffit {{of the people in}} the society using an <b>identity</b> number. A <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> (UID) number assigned for every person would obviate the need for a person to produce multiple documentary proofs of his/her identity for availing any government/private services. In the process of creating <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> of a person, there is a possibility of duplicate identities as the same person might want to get multiple identities in order to get extra beneffits from the Government. These duplicate identities can be eliminated by the de-duplication process using multi-modal biometrics, namely, iris, ngerprint, face and signature. De-duplication is the process of removing instances of multiple enrollments of the same person using the person's biometric data. As the number of people enrolledinto the biometric system runs into billions, the time complexity increases in the de duplication process. In this thesis, three different case studies are presented to address the performance issues of de-duplication process in order to create <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> of a person...|$|R

40|$|Human cloning until {{recently}} {{has been considered}} {{to belong to the}} domain of science fiction; now it is a tangible possibility, a hopeful as well as a fearsome one. One of the fears that necessarily come along with it is about the peril cloning might represent for human uniqueness, since the clones are expected to be identical to their prototypes; this would unavoidably compromise moral agents’ right to a <b>unique</b> <b>identity.</b> In this paper I will put under examination the argument against cloning that is based upon the right to a unique identity; I will argue that cloning represents no actual threat for anybody’s <b>unique</b> <b>identity,</b> therefore this argument is futile. I will also support the view that the so-called right to a <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> is not as indisputable as to serve as the basis of a moral argument against human reproductive cloning...|$|R

A functor F:1→Set maps the unique object of 1 to some set S and the <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> arrow of 1 to the identity function 1S on S. A subfunctor G of F maps the unique object of 1 to a subset T of S and maps the <b>unique</b> <b>identity</b> arrow to the identity function 1T on T. Notice that 1T is the restriction of 1S to T. Consequently, subfunctors of F correspond to subsets of S.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} sensor networks {{the small}} data rate, generally 16 bytes per packet, makes the overhead of globally unique network and MAC addresses, which is typically {{as much as the}} payload itself, undesirable [12]. We present a node address naming scheme that assigns <b>locally</b> <b>unique</b> addresses, which could be spatially reused, to nodes in an energy efficient manner and reduces the address size by a factor of 3. 6. The focus of our work is solely on clustering routing approaches [8]. Further, we question the need of separate MAC and network addresses and show how our spatially reused <b>locally</b> <b>unique</b> node address could be used in both contexts, leading to greater energy efficiency.

40|$|Globally unique ID {{allocation}} {{is usually}} not applicable in a sensor network due to the massive production of cheap sensor nodes, the limited bandwidth, {{and the size of}} the payload. However, <b>locally</b> <b>unique</b> IDs are still necessary for nodes to implement unicast communications to save power consumption. Several solutions have been proposed for <b>locally</b> <b>unique</b> ID assignment in sensor networks. However, they bring much communication overhead, which is not desirable due to the limited power supply in a sensor node. Combined with a directed diffusion communication paradigm, a reactive ID assignment scheme with security mechanisms is proposed in this paper. It defers ID conflict resolution until data communications are initiated and thus saves communication overhead. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
