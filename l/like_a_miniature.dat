5|$|The Baltimore Sun writer Tamara Ikenberg equated {{the episode}} {{as both a}} parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils, particularly through in its portrayal of the giant mutant Stan wreaking havoc through South Park. This episode marked the first appearances of the characters Shelley and Sharon Marsh, Stan's sister and mother respectively, {{as well as that}} of Dr. Mephesto. Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which is based on the 1896 H. G. Wells novel of the same name. Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles, the demon in the Faust legend. Kevin, the companion of Dr. Mephesto, is based on the small creature who resembles and dresses <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> version of Brando's character in the 1996 film The Island of Dr. Moreau.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

2500|$|The {{function}} of genes {{is to provide}} the information needed to make molecules called proteins in cells. Cells are the smallest independent parts of organisms: the human body contains about 100 trillion cells, while very small organisms like bacteria are just one single cell. A cell is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> and very complex factory that {{can make all the}} parts needed to produce a copy of itself, which happens when cells divide. There is a simple division of labor in cells—genes give instructions and proteins carry out these instructions, tasks [...] like building a new copy of a cell, or repairing damage. Each type of protein is a specialist that only does one job, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein to do this job. Similarly, if a cell needs to do something faster or slower than before, it makes more or less of the protein responsible. Genes tell cells what to do by telling them which proteins to make and in what amounts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} Japanese-style (和式, washiki) toilet is a squat toilet—also {{known as}} the 'Asian Toilet,' as squat toilets of somewhat similar design are common all over Asia. A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., {{the wall in the}} back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right. A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: [...] "small" [...] (小) and [...] "large" [...] (大). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally [...] "small excretion") and the latter for feces ("large excretion"). The lever is often pushed to the [...] "small" [...] setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Pioneer {{encounters}} and in {{the lead}} up to the Voyager fly-bys in 1979, interest in Io and the other Galilean satellites grew, with the planetary science and astronomy communities {{going so far as}} to convene a week of dedicated Io observations by radio, visible, and infrared astronomers in November 1974 known as [...] "Io Week." [...] New observations of Io from Earth and by the Pioneers during the mid-1970s caused a paradigm shift in thinking about its surface chemistry and formation. The trend in the densities of the four Galilean satellites found by Pioneer10 suggested that the satellites formed as part of a collapsing nebula, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> version of what took place in the Solar System as a whole. The initial hot Jupiter prevented the condensation of water at the orbits of Io and Europa, leading those bodies to have higher densities than the outer two moons. Spectroscopic measurements of the light reflected from Io and its surrounding space were made with increasing spectral resolution during the 1970s, providing new insights into its surface composition. Other observations suggested that Io had a surface dominated by evaporites composed of sodium salts and sulfur. This was consistent with Io lacking water ice either on its surface or in its interior, in contrast with the other Galilean satellites. An absorption band near 560nm was identified with the radiation-damaged form of the mineral halite. It was thought that deposits of the mineral on Io's surface were the origin of a cloud of sodium atoms surrounding Io, created through energetic-particle sputtering.|$|E
50|$|When {{feeding on}} larger prey, schools tend {{to break down}} into shoals and {{individuals}} find food on their own.

Spaced only about the diameter of a single fish's mouth apart, this formation greatly reduces the ability of plankton to evade capture, as a plankton darting {{out of the way}} of one fish is likely to end up in the jaws of another. Copepods make up the majority of the Atlantic mackerel's diet, Calanus finmarchicus being the most abundant.|$|R

2500|$|Saffron {{is not all}} of {{the same}} quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors {{including}} the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram, because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from Iran, Spain and Kashmir is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: [...] "sargol" [...] (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), [...] "pushal" [...] or [...] "pushali" [...] (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), [...] "bunch" [...] saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>miniature</b> wheatsheaf) and [...] "konge" [...] (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are [...] "coupé" [...] (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), [...] "mancha" [...] (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength [...] "rio", [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "sierra" [...] saffron. The word [...] "mancha" [...] in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has PDO protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as [...] "Spanish Mancha saffron" [...] were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where Imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as ‘Kashmir brand’ at a higher price. In Kashmir, saffron is mostly classified into two main categories called 'Mongra' (stigma alone) or [...] 'Laccha' (stigmas attached with parts of the style). Countries producing less saffron do not have specialised words for different grades and may only produce one grade. Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high grade saffron.|$|E

5000|$|Eastern screech owls are {{strictly}} nocturnal, roosting {{during the day}} in cavities or next to tree trunks. They are quite common, and can often be found in residential areas. However, due to their small size and camouflage, {{they are much more}} frequently heard than actually seen. These owls are frequently heard calling at night, especially during their spring breeding season. Despite their name, this owl doesn't truly screech.
