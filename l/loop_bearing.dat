40|$|AbstractThe {{substrate}} specificity of Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase 10 A (TAX) {{has been investigated}} both biochemically and structurally. High resolution crystallographic analyses at 291 K and 100 K of TAX complexes with xylobiose show that the ligand is in its α anomeric conformation and provide a rationale for specificity on p-nitrophenyl glycosides at the − 1 and − 2 subsites. Trp 275, which is disordered in uncomplexed structures, is stabilised by its interaction with xylobiose. Two structural subsets in family 10 are identified, which differ by {{the presence or absence}} of a short helical stretch in the eighth βα-loop of the TIM barrel, the <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> Trp 275. This structural difference is discussed in the context of Trp 275 mobility and xylanase function...|$|E
40|$|Several {{parameters}} {{of a small}} region of a muscle tissue or other object, can be simultaneously measured using with minimal traumatizing or damage of the object, a trifunctional transducer which can determine the force applied by a muscle fiber, the displacement of the fiber, and the change in thickness of the fiber. The transducer has three legs with inner ends joined together and outer ends formed to piece the tissue and remain within it. Two of the legs are relatively stiff, to measure force applied by the tissue, and a third leg is relatively flexible to measure displacement of the tissue relative to one or both stiff legs, and with the three legs lying in a common plane so that the force and displacement measurements all relate to the same direction of muscle movements. A flexible loop is attached {{to one of the}} stiff legs to measure changes in muscle thickness, with {{the upper end of the}} loop fixed to the leg and the lower end of the <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> against the surface of the tissue and being free to slide on the leg...|$|E
40|$|A popular {{approach}} to nano-positioning requirements in precision engineering {{in general and}} micro-lithography in particular is to subdivide the stage positioning architecture into a coarse positioning module with micrometer accuracy (Long Stroke), onto which a fine positioning module (Short Stroke) is cascaded. The latter is responsible for correcting the residual error of the coarse positioning module to the last nanometers. High accuracy positioning in 6 Degrees Of Freedom put severe constraints on the actuators and/or bearing systems. Actuators are used for generating a varying force {{being part of a}} control <b>loop.</b> <b>Bearing</b> systems should generate a force as constant as possible in the bearing direction, but the force perpendicular to that direction should be as low as possible. Actuators could serve as a bearing system, but on the one hand this would require the actuators to be large and thus heavy {{and on the other hand}} a substantial amount of heat is continuously dissipated in order to generate the static forces. Such heat generation does not contribute to the positioning performance of the actuators, but significantly affects the thermal stability of the application. The latter implication will be overcome if the bearing system is established by a system with permanent magnets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Methionine {{aminopeptidase}} is {{a potential}} target of future antibacterial and anticancer drugs. Structural analysis of complexes of the enzyme with its inhibitors provides valuable information for structure-based drug design efforts. Results Five new X-ray structures of such enzyme-inhibitor complexes were obtained. Analysis {{of these and other}} three similar structures reveals the adaptability of a surface-exposed <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> Y 62, H 63, G 64 and Y 65 (the YHGY loop) that {{is an integral part of}} the substrate and inhibitor binding pocket. This adaptability is important for accommodating inhibitors with variations in size. When compared with the human isozymes, this loop either becomes buried in the human type I enzyme due to an N-terminal extension that covers its position or is replaced by a unique insert in the human type II enzyme. Conclusion The adaptability of the YHGY loop in E. coli methionine aminopeptidase, and likely in other bacterial methionine aminopeptidases, enables the enzyme active pocket to accommodate inhibitors of differing size. The differences in this adaptable loop between the bacterial and human methionine aminopeptidases is a structural feature that can be exploited to design inhibitors of bacterial methionine aminopeptidases as therapeutic agents with minimal inhibition of the corresponding human enzymes. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{location}} of the active site of the rapid enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, {{near the bottom of}} a deep and narrow gorge indicates that alternative routes may exist for traffic of substrate, products or solute {{into and out of the}} gorge. Molecular dynamics suggest the existence of a shutter-like back door near Trp 84, a key residue in the binding site for acetylcholine, in the Torpedo californica enzyme. The homology of the Ω <b>loop,</b> <b>bearing</b> Trp 84, with the lid which sequesters the substrate in neutral lipases displaying structural homology with acetylcholinesterase, suggests a flap-like back door. Both possibilities were examined by site-directed mutagenesis. The shutter-like back door was tested by generating a salt bridge which might impede opening of the shutter. The flap-like back door was tested by de novo insertion of a disulfide bridge which tethered the Ω loop to the body of the enzyme. Neither type of mutation produced significant changes in catalytic activity, thus failing to provide experimental support for either back door model. Molecular dynamics revealed, however, substantial mobility of the Ω loop in the immediate vicinity of Trp 84, even when the loop was tethered, supporting the possibility that access to the active site, involving limited movement of a segment of the loop, is indeed possible...|$|E
40|$|Phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (PPDC) of Azospirillum brasilense, {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole- 3 -acetic acid and the antimicrobial compound phenylacetic acid, is a thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyses the nonoxidative decarboxylation of indole- and phenylpyruvate. Analogous to yeast pyruvate decarboxylases, PPDC is subject to allosteric substrate activation, showing sigmoidal v versus [S] plots. The present paper reports the crystal structure of this enzyme determined at 1. 5 A resolution. The subunit architecture of PPDC is characteristic for {{other members of the}} pyruvate oxidase family, with each subunit consisting of three domains with an open alpha/beta topology. An active site <b>loop,</b> <b>bearing</b> the catalytic residues His 112 and His 113, could not be modelled due to flexibility. The biological tetramer is best described as an asymmetric dimer of dimers. A cysteine residue that has been suggested as the site for regulatory substrate binding in yeast pyruvate decarboxylase is not conserved, requiring a different mechanism for allosteric substrate activation in PPDC. Only minor changes occur in the interactions with the cofactors, thiamine diphosphate and Mg 2 +, compared to pyruvate decarboxylase. A greater diversity is observed in the substrate binding pocket accounting for the difference in substrate specificity. Moreover, a catalytically important glutamate residue conserved in nearly all decarboxylases is replaced by a leucine in PPDC. The consequences of these differences in terms of the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of PPDC are discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC; EC 4. 1. 1. 31) {{has been determined}} by x-ray diffraction methods at 2. 8 -Å resolution by using Escherichia coli PEPC complexed with l-aspartate, an allosteric inhibitor of all known PEPCs. The four subunits are arranged in a “dimer-of-dimers” form with respect to subunit contact, resulting in an overall square arrangement. The contents of α-helices and β-strands are 65 % and 5 %, respectively. All of the eight β-strands, which are widely dispersed in the primary structure, participate {{in the formation of}} a single β-barrel. Replacement of a conserved Arg residue (Arg- 438) in this linkage with Cys increased the tendency of the enzyme to dissociate into dimers. The location of the catalytic site is likely to be near the C-terminal side of the β-barrel. The binding site for l-aspartate is located about 20 Å away from the catalytic site, and four residues (Lys- 773, Arg- 832, Arg- 587, and Asn- 881) are involved in effector binding. The participation of Arg- 587 is unexpected, because it is known to be catalytically essential. Because this residue is in a highly conserved glycine-rich loop, which is characteristic of PEPC, l-aspartate seemingly causes inhibition by removing this glycine-rich loop from the catalytic site. There is another mobile loop from Lys- 702 to Gly- 708 that is missing in the {{crystal structure}}. The importance of this loop in catalytic activity was also shown. Thus, the crystal-structure determination of PEPC revealed two mobile <b>loops</b> <b>bearing</b> the enzymatic functions and accompanying allosteric inhibition by l-aspartate...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{vertical}} reference system being considered utilizes a two-degree-of-freedom gyroscope configured as a vertical gyro. Each gimbal erection circuit forms a second-order feedback control system. Gyros are susceptable {{to a number}} of error sources. In view of the closed loop application being considered, all error sources are of negligible consequence with the exception of friction. With friction included in the gyro model, the inner and outer gimbal erection circuits cease to exist as independent second-order systems. Friction couples the gimbal erection circuits together in a type of algebraic <b>loop.</b> <b>Bearing</b> friction is a random phenomenon best described by a Gaussian distribution. Slip-ring friction is best categorized as a sliding friction. For simulation purposes, slip-ring friction is conveniently handled using the Amontons-Coulomb description. The digital technique is better suited to this simulation problem primarily because of the many decision making elements required. The Gaussian distribution needed to produce the random bearing torques is generated by sampling from the more easily produced uniform distribution. The simulation program is written in the FORTRAN IV programming language. Because of the special features required in simulating the {{vertical reference}} system, it was more feasible to develop the simulation program as a self-contained package complete with an integration routine.

40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} 5 A (eIF 5 A) is a protein ubiquitously present in archaea and eukarya, which undergoes a unique two-step post-translational modification called hypusination. Several {{studies have shown}} that hypusination is essential for a variety of functional roles for eIF 5 A, including cell proliferation and synthesis of proteins involved in cell cycle control. Up to now neither a totally selective inhibitor of hypusination nor an inhibitor capable of directly binding to cIF 5 A has been reported in the literature. the discovery of such an inhibitor might be achieved by computer-aided drug design based on the 3 D structure of the human eIF 5 A. in this study, we present a molecular model for the human eIF 5 A protein based on the crystal structure of the eIF 5 A from Leishmania brasiliensis, and compare the modeled conformation of the <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> the hypusination site with circular dichroism data obtained with a synthetic peptide of this loop.

40|$|International audienceNeuroglobin (Ngb) is a globin {{present in}} the brain and retina of mammals. This hexacoordinated hemoprotein binds small {{diatomic}} molecules, albeit with lower affinity compared with other globins. Another distinctive feature of most mammalian Ngb is their ability to form an internal disulfide bridge that increases ligand affinity. As often seen for prosthetic heme b containing proteins, human Ngb exhibits heme heterogeneity with two alternative heme orientations within the heme pocket. To date, no details are available on the impact of heme orientation on the binding properties of human Ngb and its interplay with the cysteine oxidation state. In this work, we used (1) H NMR spectroscopy to probe the cyanide binding properties of different Ngb species in solution, including wild-type Ngb and the single (C 120 S) and triple (C 46 G/C 55 S/C 120 S) mutants. We demonstrate that in the disulfide-containing wild-type protein cyanide ligation is fivefold faster for one of the two heme orientations (the A isomer) compared with the other isomer, which is attributed to the lower stability of the distal His 64 -iron bond and reduced steric hindrance {{at the bottom of the}} cavity for heme sliding in the A conformer. We also attribute the slower cyanide reactivity in the absence of a disulfide bridge to the tighter histidine-iron bond. More generally, enhanced internal mobility in the CD <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> the disulfide bridge hinders access of the ligand to heme iron by stabilizing the histidine-iron bond.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{inhibitor}} of cysteine peptidases (PA-ICP) is {{a potent}} protein inhibitor of papain-like cysteine peptidases (CPs) identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogenic bacteria that can cause severe infections in human. It belongs to the newly characterized natural CP inhibitors of the I 42 family, designated the ICP family. The members of this family are present in some protozoa and bacterial pathogens. They can inhibit both parasite and mammalian CPs with high affinity and specificity. Whether the main biological function of the proteins in the pathogens is to regulate the hydrolytic activity of the organisms’ endogenous CPs or exogenous CPs so as to facilitate the pathogens’ invasion or survival is still under investigation. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains a CP inhibitor, no CP genes are found in its genome, suggesting that the targets of PA-ICP may be exogenous. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} presence of a putative secretion signal peptide at the N-terminus of PA-ICP which may be involved in exporting the protein to target exogenous CPs. In order to shed light on the biological function and inhibitory specificity of PA-ICP, the structure and backbone dynamics of this protein were characterised using NMR spectroscopy. In this project, the inhibitory activity of PA-ICP to a range of mammalian model CPs was also studied. Like its previously studied homologs, PA-ICP adopts an immunoglobulin fold comprised of seven β-strands. Three highly conserved sequence motifs located in mobile loop regions form the CP binding site. The inhibitor exhibits higher affinity toward the mammalian CP cathepsin L than cathepsins H and B. Homology modelling of the PA-ICP-cathspin L interaction based on the crystal structure of the chgasin-cathpsin L complex shows that PA-ICP may inhibit the peptidases by blocking the enzyme’s active site and that the interactions between chagasin and CPs may be conserved in PA-ICP-peptidase complexes. The specificity of the inhibitors may be determined by the relative flexibility of the <b>loops</b> <b>bearing</b> the binding site motifs and the electrostatic properties of certain residues near the binding sites.

SpGCF 1 might therefore be able to <b>loop</b> DNA molecules <b>bearing</b> its target sites at distant locations. We demonstrate this prediction by electron microscopy, and using the well-characterized cis-regulatory domain of the CyIIIa cytoskeletal actin gene, we show that the loop conformations predicted from the known SpGCF 1 target site locations are actually formed in vitro.

40|$|Fernando D. Gonzalez-Nilo and Wendy Gonzalez. Centro de Bioinformatica, Universidad de Talca, Talca, Chile. The {{family of}} K {{channels}} presents a highly conserved structural motif (TVGYG), {{known as the}} selectivity filter. Despite {{the fact that the}} selectivity filter is conserved in all K channels, they show different conductances. We observed that the number of negative charged aminoacids in the outer vestibule of BK (high conductance), KvAP (medium conductance) and Shaker (low conductance) K channels, is proportional to the conductance of each channel. In particular, BK channel has a <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> two charged aminoacids in the outer vestibule. These negative charges would increase the local K ion concentration in the outer vestibule of the pore, diminishing the required energy to access the selectivity filter. To verify experimentally this hypothesis a series of BK channel mutants were constructed and the single channel conductances were measured. In agreement with our predictions, the removal of the loop charges (D 261 N/E 264 Q) leads to a reduced inward conductance. Deleting the outer loop does not affect inward conductance unless another charge is removed (Δloop/E 276 Q). This suggests that E 276 can compensate the electrostatic contribution of the loop charges when the loop is deleted. The results are in agreement with electrostatic potential calculations (Poisson-Boltzmann) carried out on a molecular model of the BK channel pore. In conclusion, we have identified residues involved in the electrostatic tuning of the BK channel inward conductance. Acknowledgment: FONDECYT 1040254 (FG) and 1030830 (RL).

These viroporin features render p 7 an attractive target for antiviral drug development. In this study, p 7 from strain HCV-J (genotype 1 b) was chemically synthesized and purified for ion channel activity measurements and structure analyses. p 7 forms cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers {{and at the}} single-channel level by the patch clamp technique. Ion channel activity was shown to be inhibited by hexamethylene amiloride but not by amantadine. Circular dichroism analyses revealed that the structure of p 7 is mainly α-helical, irrespective of the membrane mimetic medium (e. g. lysolipids, detergents, or organic solvent/water mixtures). The secondary structure elements of the monomeric form of p 7 were determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR in trifluoroethanol/water mixtures. Molecular dynamics simulations in a model membrane were combined synergistically with structural data obtained from NMR experiments. This approach allowed us to determine the secondary structure elements of p 7, which significantly differ from predictions, and to propose a three-dimensional model of the monomeric form of p 7 associated with the phospholipid bilayer.

Nevertheless, each lipases group possesses its characteristic 3 -D structure and catalytic properties. The purified N-terminal truncated forms of a pancreatic (from ostrich) and a fungal (from Rhizopus oryzae, ROL 32) (sayari et al., 2005) lipases displayed much lower activities {{as compared to}} the native proteins. The aim {{of this study is to}} explain this common functional feature on a structural basis. The molecular modelling showed that the N-terminal peptide of the fungal lipase displays an extended "V" shaped structure motif (sayari et al., 2005). We observed that the N-terminal peptide of a pancreatic lipase shares the same extended structure with that of the ROL 32, despite the low sequence homology between the two peptides. Upon superimposition of the 3 -D structure of the N-terminal catalytic domain of the pancreatic lipase with the model of the ROL 32, we have shown that the N-terminal peptide and the open lid domain, of each lipase, are located distally within the putative interfacial binding surface. In particular, two hydrophobic residues, Leu and Ile belonging to the N-terminal peptide of each lipase are well placed to interact with the lipidic substrate. Furthermore, the N-terminal peptide of each lipase seems to be well placed to interact with the <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> the catalytic aspartic acid. All these observations might explain the fact that the loss of the N-terminal peptide affects the lipase activity.

In these conditions A is markedly more reactive than any other nucleic acid bases. A reactivity is higher in ribo (r) than in deoxyribo (d) species [pA>pdA and (pA) n>>(pdA) n]. Base pairing decreases A reactivity in corresponding duplexes but much less in r than in d. In linear single and paired dCAG or dGAC loci, base stacking inhibits A reactivity even if A is bulged or mispaired (A.

In d hairpins the solvent-exposed A residues are reactive in CAG and GAC triloops and even more in ATC loops.

The chicken sarcomeric muscle mitochondrial isoenzyme Mib-CK contains several histidine residues that are conserved throughout the family of creatine kinases. By X-ray crystal structure analysis, three of them (His 61, His 92, and His 186) were recently shown to be located close to the active site of the enzyme. These residues were exchanged against alanine or aspartate by in vitro mutagenesis, and the six mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. Structural integrity of the mutant proteins was checked by small-angle X-ray scattering. Kinetic analysis showed the mutant His 61 Asp to be completely inactive in the direction of ATP consumption while exhibiting a residual activity of 1. 7 % of the wild-type (wt) activity in the reverse direction. The respective His to Ala mutant of residue 61 showed approximately 1 % wt activity in the forward and 10 % wt activity in the reverse reaction. All other mutants showed near wt activities. Changes in the kinetic parameters K(m) or Vmax, as well as a significant loss of synergism in substrate binding, could be observed with all active mutants. These effects were most pronounced for the binding of creatine and phosphocreatine, whereas ATP or ADP binding were less severely affected. Based on our results, we assume that His 92 and His 186 are involved in the binding of creatine and ATP in the active site, whereas His 61 is of importance for the catalytic reaction but does not serve as an acid-base catalyst in the transphosphorylation of creatine and ATP. In addition, our data support the idea that the flexible <b>loop</b> <b>bearing</b> His 61 is able to move towards the active site and to participate in catalysis...|$|E

Single crystal microspectrophotometric measurements demonstrated the presence of a functionally competent protein conformation in the crystal grown in the presence of Mn 2 and IPM.

A detailed analysis of the atomic contacts of the conserved amino acid side chains suggests a possible operational mechanism of these molecular hinges upon the action of the substrates.
