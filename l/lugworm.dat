25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, <b>lugworm</b> and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{freshwater}} seepage on benthic macrofauna were investigated on the sandy tidal flats near {{the island of}} Sylt (German Wadden Sea) in 2002. Several permanent seepage areas (50 to 200 m offshore; up to 200 m 2 in area) were examined, in which salinity ranged from 22 - 29 outside to 0 - 16 psu inside seepage areas in the upper 20 cm of sediment during summer low tides. The freshwater seepage areas were characterised by an absence of <b>lugworms</b> (Arenicola marina) and a twelve-fold increase in nereid polychaetes (Nereis diversicolor and N. virens) relative to non-seepage areas. <b>Lugworms</b> and ragworms were scarce in a transition zone, which was colonised by juvenile <b>lugworms.</b> We suggest that nereid polychaetes avoid competition with bioturbating <b>lugworms</b> by adapting to areas of low salinity (freshwater seepage).

40|$|When {{males and}} females come in {{distinct}} sizes and shapes they often forage at different sites, selecting different prey. In the sexually dimorphic bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica, females generally forage along the tideline, whereas the smaller (and subordinate) males generally forage across dry mudflats. On this basis we predicted that interference competition would occur within, rather than between, the sexes. We tested whether density-dependent aspects of foraging behaviour are indeed sex specific and additionally examined the roles of sex-specific prey types. With increasing conspecific densities, intake rates levelled off in females, but not in males. At increasing densities, both sexes engaged in more agonistic interactions, but females more than males. Consequently, females lost more foraging time than males. However, time lost to interactions could not explain the density-dependent decrease in their intake rate. As <b>lugworms,</b> Arenicola marina, contributed 71 % to the energy intake of females and 18 % in males, we experimentally tested whether the burying behaviour of <b>lugworms</b> explained the sex difference in interference. Both {{in the field and}} in the laboratory, <b>lugworms</b> responded to probes. In experimentally probed plots in the field, <b>lugworms</b> produced fewer casts per unit time, indicating a decrease in near-surface presence. In laboratory settings, increased experimental probing intensity resulted in deeper burying by <b>lugworms.</b> We therefore argue that prey depression is responsible for most of the reduction in intake rates of females foraging at high conspecific densities. The search for undisturbed shallow-living <b>lugworms</b> would explain why female bar-tailed godwits tend to forage along the moving tidelin...|$|R

50|$|A <b>lugworm</b> {{lives in}} a U-shaped burrow in sand. The U is made of an L-shaped gallery lined with mucus, from the toe of which a {{vertical}} unlined shaft runs up to the surface. This is a head shaft. At the surface the head shaft {{is marked by a}} small saucer-shaped depression. The tail shaft, 2 to 3 in from it, is marked by a highly coiled cast of sand. The <b>lugworm</b> lies in this burrow with its head {{at the base of the}} head shaft, swallowing sand from time to time. This makes the columns of sand drop slightly, so there is a periodic sinking of the sand in the saucer-shaped depression. When it first digs its burrow the <b>lugworm</b> softens the sand in its head shaft by pushing its head up into it with a piston action. After that the sand is kept loose by a current of water driven through the burrow from the hind end by the waves of contraction passing along the worm's body. It weighs 2 to 5 oz. Lugworms also have hairs on the outside of their bodies that act as external gills. These can rapidly increase its uptake of oxygen.|$|E

40|$|Human {{exploitation}} of bivalve populations has changed intertidal landscapes worldwide. Many bivalves are ecosystem engineers that modify the physical environment, affecting {{the conditions for}} their survival. Here we argue that lack of recovery of overexploited intertidal bivalve beds may be partly caused {{by the loss of}} important biological feedbacks from depleted populations. In a large-scale experiment we investigated engineering effects of cockles (Cerastoderma edule L.) and <b>lugworms</b> (Arenicola marina L.) on juvenile cockles by adding high densities of either species to 5 × 5 m plots in areas with different hydrodynamic and sediment conditions in the intertidal flats of the Wadden Sea. We hypothesized that cockles would facilitate the new generations by increasing sediment stability, while <b>lugworms</b> would have negative effects on juvenile cockles through sediment disturbance. We found that in sandy areas with high wave and current energy cockles enhanced sediment accumulation and promoted local densities of young cockles, while <b>lugworms</b> did not have any effect on juvenile cockles. In muddy sites sheltered from the tidal currents by mussel reefs (Mytilus edulis L.), juvenile cockle densities were generally high, demonstrating the general importance of biological engineering for recruitment processes in the intertidal. We suggest that the acknowledgement of positive feedbacks between bivalves and sediment stability is essential to achieve long-term restoration goals in coastal ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of {{positive effects of}} ecosystem engineers on associated communities is predicted to increase with environmental stress. However, incorporating such non-trophic interactions into ecological theory is not trivial because facilitation of associated species is conditional on both the type of engineer {{and the type of}} abiotic stress. We tested the influence of two allogenic ecosystem engineers (<b>lugworms,</b> Arenicola marina L. and cockles, Cerastoderma edule L.) on the main primary producers (microphytobenthos) of the tidal flats, under different abiotic stresses controlled by reefs of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.). We added 25, 000 cockles or 2, 000 <b>lugworms</b> to 5 × 5 m plots, both in a muddy site with high sedimentation rates located coastward of a mussel bed, and in a sandy site without mussels and characterized by high hydrodynamic stress. After a year, cockles increased algal biomass in the sandy area, but not in the mussel bed site, where high values were measured in all plots. However, <b>lugworms</b> did not affect algal biomass in any of the sites. Field measurements suggest that cockles outweighed negative effects of water currents in the site without mussels by locally increasing sediment stability, whereas mussels overruled the effects of cockles {{in the wake of the}} reefs through hydrodynamic stress alleviation and/or biodeposition. Our results suggest that non-trophic interactions by ecosystem engineering bivalves control primary production of intertidal areas, and that the sediment-stabilizing effect of cockles plays a crucial role where the overruling effects of mussel beds are not present. ...|$|R

40|$|We apply new {{perspectives}} on how organisms burrow {{by examining the}} association of in situ variation in sediment mechanical properties with burrowing ability and species distribution of two sympatric <b>lugworms,</b> Abarenicola pacifica and Abarenicola claparedi. We quantified the sediment 2 ̆ 7 s resistance to penetration and its grain size distribution at sites inhabited by each species. Abarenicola pacifica individuals were found in significantly harder to penetrate, more heterogeneous sediments. We compared worm burrowing ability using reciprocal transplant experiments. Worms from firmer sediments, A. pacifica, {{were able to make}} successful steep burrows in sediments characteristic of either species. In contrast, A. claparedi individuals often failed to complete successful burrows in the firmer A. pacifica sediment. To examine how morphological differences could explain these patterns, we compared body wall musculature and measured how well individuals support their own bodies when draped over a cantilever. <b>Lugworms</b> from the firmer sediment had thicker body wall musculature and held their bodies more rigidly than did worms from softer sediments. Additionally, we observed subtle differences in the papillae on the proboscises 2 ̆ 7 surfaces, which could affect worm–sediment interactions, but we found no differences in the chaetae of the two species. Abarenicola claparedi produced more mucus, which could be important in shoring up burrow walls in their shifting, sandy habitat. This study presents the first example of using field-based experiments to determine how sediment mechanical properties and worm burrowing ability could act to determine organismal distribution. Our findings have broader ecological implications because of the role of <b>lugworms</b> as ecosystem engineers...|$|R
