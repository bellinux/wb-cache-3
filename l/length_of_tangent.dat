40|$|Abstract: A {{class of}} quasi-cubic B-spline base {{functions}} by trigonometric polynomials are established which inherit properties {{similar to those}} of cubic B-spline bases. The corresponding curves with a shape parameter α, defined by the introduced base functions, include the B-spline curves and can approximate the B-spline curves from both sides. The curves can be adjusted easily by using the shape parameter α, where dpi(α,t) is linear with respect to dα for the fixed t. With the shape parameter chosen properly, the defined curves can be used to precisely represent straight line segments, parabola segments, circular arcs and some tran-scendental curves, and the corresponding tensor product surfaces can also represent spherical surfaces, cylindrical surfaces and some transcendental surfaces exactly. By abandoning positive property, this paper proposes a new C 2 continuous blended inter-polation spline based on piecewise trigonometric polynomials associated with a sequence of local parameters. Illustration showed that the curves and surfaces constructed by the blended spline can be adjusted easily and freely. The blended interpolation spline curves can be shape-preserving with proper local parameters since these local parameters can be considered to be the magnifica-tion ratio to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tangent</b> vectors at the interpolating points.

40|$|The aim of {{research}} {{is the study of}} driving behavior in relation to the geometric characteristics of the urban road infrastructure. This study allows the identification of factors which influence driving speed. The purpose is realizing mathematical models which link the driving behavior with the geometric characteristics of the infrastructure. Up to now, the research has focused mostly on suburban roads but the models about the suburban roads are not applicable to Italian urban roads because you must consider many factors. For example, in urban roads there are several factors that affect speed such as road characteristics, car parks {{on the edge of the}} road, weather conditions, pedestrians, bicycles, vehicles and their category. The parameter used to describe driving behavior is space mean speed. This is very important because it considers the speed of vehicles traveling a given segment of roadway during a specified period of time and it is calculated using the average travel time and length for the roadway segment. Furthermore, this speed is used to understand the behavior of driving in two scenarios: normal traffic and under free flow conditions when vehicles are isolated. Particular attention was given to define the isolated vehicle. In the literature the definition of isolated vehicle does not exist for urban roads. For this reason, the time intervals were defined. The application of statistical techniques has shown that a vehicle is isolated when the vehicle ahead is at a temporal distance greater than or equal to six seconds and the vehicle following it is at a temporal distance greater than or equal to four seconds. Therefore the mathematical model construction includes the following phases. First of all, accidents analysis was carried out in order to identify the roads of interest. This analysis performed for Cagliari’s city has revealed that the streets most affected by this phenomenon are urban roads with two lanes in each direction. In particular for these urban roads, the portion of the studied tangent. Then, surveys campaign was conducted in daylight and with two instruments: radar EasyData, used to detect vehicular traffic variables, and digital cameras, useful to analyze the driver behaviors and to identify any external or internal traffic factors able to affect driver behavior. Afterwards data were processed and analyzed. Finally predictive models were constructed and validated in two traffic conditions. In both cases we used a multiple linear regression. In the normal traffic condition, two models were developed and validated to predict speed, statistically significant variables include traffic characteristics (flow, number of vehicles entering and leaving traffic stream) and geometric design attributes (width of lines, type of median, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tangent,</b> presence of sidewalk, type of obstacle left-lateral). Under free flow conditions, three models were developed but only two were validated.

40|$|Highway design which {{ensures that}} {{successive}} elements are coordinated {{in such a}} way as to produce harmonious and homogeneous driver performances along the road is considered consistent and safe. On the other hand, an alignment which requires drivers to handle high speed gradients and does not meet drivers' expectancy is considered inconsistent and produces higher crash frequency. To increase the usefulness and the reliability of existing safety performance functions and contribute to solve inconsistencies of existing highways as well as inconsistencies arising in the design phase, we developed safety performance functions for rural motorways that incorporate design consistency measures. Since the design consistency variables were used only for curves, two different sets of models were fitted for tangents and curves. Models for the following crash characteristics were fitted: total, single-vehicle run-off-the-road, other single vehicle, multi vehicle, daytime, nighttime, non-rainy weather, rainy weather, dry pavement, wet pavement, property damage only, slight injury, and severe injury (including fatal). The design consistency parameters in this study are based on operating speed models developed through an instrumented vehicle equipped with a GPS continuous speed tracking from a field experiment conducted on the same motorway where the safety performance functions were fitted (motorway A 16 in Italy). Study results show that geometric design consistency has a significant effect on safety of rural motorways. Previous studies on the relationship between geometric design consistency and crash frequency focused on two-lane rural highways since these highways have the higher crash rates and are generally characterized by considerable inconsistencies. Our study clearly highlights that the achievement of proper geometric design consistency is a key design element also on motorways because of the safety consequences of design inconsistencies. The design consistency measures which are significant explanatory variables of the safety performance functions developed in this study are: (1) consistency in driving dynamics, i. e., difference between side friction assumed with respect to the design speed and side friction demanded at the 85 th percentile speed; (2) operating speed consistency, i. e., absolute value of the 85 th percentile speed reduction through successive elements of the road; (3) inertial speed consistency, i. e., difference between the operating speed in the curve and the average operating speed along the 5 km preceding the beginning of the curve; and (4) <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>tangent</b> preceding the curve (only for run-off-the-road crashes) ...|$|E
