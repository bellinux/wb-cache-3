5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the large gay populations in port cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years of consideration, McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E

25|$|While not {{on or near}} any {{fault line}} <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> or Los Angeles, Mexico City is {{vulnerable}} to earthquakes. The main {{reason for this is}} the surface geology of the area, especially the downtown area. The city was originally built on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, and Aztec rulers built dikes to prevent flooding while Spanish colonial rulers later drained the lakes in response to major flooding. The near surface geology of this area is classified into three sections: the old lake bed which is soft clay from volcanic ash with a high water content, a piedmont area, much of which is capped by 5 to 30 meters of lava less than 2,500 years old, and an old river delta area.|$|E
25|$|California {{is a very}} geologically diverse {{region and}} varies greatly {{in the range of}} climates and terroirs that can be found. Most of the state's wine regions are found between the Pacific coast and the Central Valley. The Pacific Ocean and large bays, <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> Bay, serve as {{tempering}} influences to the wine regions nearby providing cool winds and fog that balance the heat and sunshine. While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat of frost damage though springtime. To curb the threat of frost, vineyard owners will often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and smudge pots to protect the vines.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Goodlife, a {{professor}} of geological sciences at the University of Alabama, believes the state is at [...] "high" [...] risk from earthquakes. He claims that [...] "If there is an earthquake {{in one of the}} zone areas, North Alabama is certainly going to feel it. There's going to be damage and some perhaps major. If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis, it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes. Places <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them." [...] By his definition, the state's earthquakes are [...] "insignificant". Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. You could have a No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E
500|$|A fare for {{one trip}} {{was set at}} $2.75, the same as on other modes of {{transportation}} in New York City. Free transfers would be offered only to other NYC Ferry lines, meaning that riders would pay another fare if they transferred {{to one of the}} city's other mass-transit systems. Transfers to other lines would be issued on request. Prior to the implementation of NYC Ferry, other ferry lines in the city had weekday and weekend fares of $4 and $6, respectively. The relatively low fare of NYC Ferry was made in contrast to some other major cities <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> and Sydney, where ferry fares are higher than the fares of other modes of mass transit in these cities. The city said that the low ferry fares were intended to make the ferries affordable, while de Blasio stated that it is intended to promote [...] "transit equity". Assuming that the ferry system met the projection of 4.5 million annual riders, the city would pay a subsidy of $6.60 per rider, making the ferry the third-most subsidized form of transportation in the city.|$|E

2500|$|Central and {{southern}} California were thinly populated {{at the time}} and this likely helped limit the damage from the earthquake, but the lack of people present also reduced the number of perspectives to use in determining intensity estimates. Areas with the highest population density <b>like</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> Stockton, and Los Angeles provided enough information about the effects of the earthquake to provide the best estimates of intensity. At downtown Los Angeles, with a maximum perceived intensity of VI, some homes and buildings [...] were cracked, but no major damage was reported. In Ventura (MM VII) the roof of Mission San Buenaventura collapsed and the bell tower was damaged, and farther north, the front wall of the old adobe Mission Santa Cruz chapel collapsed.

2500|$|Duluth's {{topography}} {{is dominated}} by a steep hillside that climbs from Lake Superior to high inland elevations.

The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The weather station at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).|$|R
