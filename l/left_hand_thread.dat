50|$|The American Standard Safety System, or ASSS, is a {{connection}} system for gas cylinders with a volume exceeding 25 cubic feet. The connections differ in thread type and size, right and <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>threading,</b> internal and external threading, and nipple-seat design. This variability {{reduces the risk of}} errors such as administering the wrong gas to a patient, or utilizing equipment calibrated for one gas with another. However, as there are only 26 connections for the 62 gases and mixtures recognized by the CGA, connections are not unique.|$|R
5000|$|Left {{side drive}} {{introduced}} {{a different type}} of flip flop hub for BMX. This hub is a Right Hand/Left Hand flip flop hub. One side of the hub allows the use of normal right hand freewheels, while the other side is <b>threaded</b> with <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>threads</b> (1.375" [...] x 24L tpi) and accepts the new <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> drive freewheels. The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T. Later, a version of this hub was made with small metric BMX (30 mm x 1 mm) <b>threads,</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> on one side and right hand on the other side. These hubs accepted either Left or right side drive freewheels in the smaller 13T-15T sizes.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{preceded by}} an arm wrench, the wrestler grasps the opponent's hand and twists backwards, placing {{pressure}} on the wrist. While this can inflict pain on its own, it is most often used as a transition hold, leading into either a hammer lock, an elbow to the held arm, or kicks to the opponent's abdominal area. Another form of wrist lock sometimes known as a figure four wristlock involves the wrestler (after applying the initial wrist lock with the <b>left</b> <b>hand)</b> <b>threading</b> their right arm through the gap the two arms provide, forming a 4, and providing leverage on the wristlock.|$|R
50|$|The {{barrel length}} of the Iraqi Tabuk rifle is 23.6 inches - {{slightly}} longer and thinner than a Yugoslavian M72 barrel, but much longer than a traditional AKM or the M70 (16.25 inches). The Tabuk, like the M72, has a provision for muzzle attachments in the typical Russian thread pattern of 14×1mm <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>thread,</b> which means that it can accept several variations of Soviet flash hiders and muzzle brakes, as well as Soviet-designed sound suppression devices.|$|E

If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> for a special freewheel must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the wheel and two mating cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|E

50|$|The buckle or a coupler is a {{mechanical}} joint used to connect two members which {{are subjected to}} tensile loading which require slight adjustment of length or tension under loaded conditions. It consist of central hexagonal nut called coupler and tie rod having right <b>hand</b> and <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>threads.</b> A coupler of hexagonal shape is to facilitate the turning of it with a spanner or sometime a hole is provide in the nut so that tommy bar can be inserted for rotating it.

2500|$|In response, HK {{developed}} the USP Tactical pistol {{based on the}} original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose, the Tactical retains much {{of the performance of}} the MK 23 without the bulky size. It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> <b>threading,</b> as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is [...] capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has {{developed the}} HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.|$|R

5000|$|The smaller {{diameter}} thread on {{the fixed}} side has reverse/left <b>hand</b> <b>threads</b> {{to accept a}} lockring. The lockring is reverse threaded to prevent the cog from coming loose when applying reverse/braking power to the pedals. There are also different sized <b>threads</b> for the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> lockring (English/ISO 1.29" [...] x 24 TPI), Campagnolo/Phil Wood (1.32" [...] x 24 TPI) and Old French (33 mm x 1.0 mm). The first two are the most common, with the French threading being older, and a little less common. It is advisable to check with the manufacturer of the hub for lock ring compatibility. Wrong thread type lockrings may easily thread onto the wrong hub, but over time, the poorly-mating thread interface will cause the threads on the hub to become damaged or destroyed.|$|R

50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.|$|R
