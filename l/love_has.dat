5|$|Courtney Michelle Love (born Courtney Michelle Harrison; July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, {{and visual}} artist. A notable {{presence}} in the punk and grunge scenes of the 1990s, <b>Love</b> <b>has</b> enjoyed a career that spans four decades. She rose to prominence as the frontwoman of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989. <b>Love</b> <b>has</b> drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, {{as well as her}} highly publicized personal life following her marriage to Kurt Cobain.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Love {{and husband}} Kurt Cobain {{performed}} an acoustic set {{together at the}} Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse. <b>Love</b> <b>has</b> also contributed to amfAR's AIDS research benefits and held live musical performances at their events. In 2009, Love performed a benefit concert for the RED Campaign at Carnegie Hall alongside Laurie Anderson, Rufus Wainwright, and Scarlett Johansson, with proceeds going to AIDS research. In May 2011, she attended Mariska Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation event for victims of child abuse, rape, and domestic violence, donating six of her husband Kurt Cobain's personal vinyl records for auction.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Tokyopop {{announced}} that it had licensed The One I Love for an English-language translation, along with four other manga by Clamp; it published The One I Love on October 12, 2004.

50|$|Going {{into the}} 2008 season, <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> {{recorded}} 2,318 receiving yards {{in three years}} to become the second leading Ball State receiver behind only Dante Ridgeway. He was also the leading Ball State kick return specialist with 1,862 yards. <b>Love</b> <b>had</b> played in all 36 games during his career and made at least one reception in 35 of them.|$|R
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and <b>Love</b> <b>Has</b> Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|Speed Racer is an 18-year-old {{whose life}} and <b>love</b> <b>has</b> always been {{automobile}} racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, {{in which his}} brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible), a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill {{behind the wheel of}} his brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.|$|E
5|$|While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself {{directly}} {{claim to}} be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and <b>love</b> <b>has</b> been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Bahá'u'lláh {{is believed to be}} a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.|$|E
