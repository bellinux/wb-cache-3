2500|$|Due to {{the heavily}} scaled {{skin of the}} <b>Longnose</b> <b>gar,</b> some of the {{mechanical}} properties differ from [...] model of describing how eel skin adds movement. The scale row resists longitudinal forces, which unlike eel skin, makes the skin stiffer in the longitudinal direction, providing myomeres with leverage and anchorage for pulling tendons.

40|$|Plasma {{corticosteroid}} {{concentrations were}} measured in 14 {{species of fish}} immediately after they were electrofished from reservoirs on the Alabama River and after they had been transported for 2 h. There was no corticosteroid response in spotted gars Lepisosteus oculatus. Bowfins Amia calva, <b>longnose</b> <b>gars</b> Lepisosteus osseus, and freshwater drums Aplodinotus grunniens had only small corticosteroid increases (14 - 39 ng/mL) during transportation. Corticosteroids increased by intermediate amounts (59 - 184 ng/mL) during transportation in blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, paddlefish Polyodon spathula, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, river carpsuckers Carpiodes carpio, white bass Morone chrysops, striped bass Morone saxatilis, and crappies Pomoxis sp. The greatest increases were 223 ng/mL in gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and 286 ng/mL in common carp Cyprinus carpio. Spotted and <b>longnose</b> <b>gars,</b> largemouth bass, and common carp also were held in tanks for about 2 months at 21 ░C and then stressed by confinement in a dip net for 30 min. The confinement caused significant increases (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) of plasma corticosteroid concentration in all four species. Dip-net confinement {{appears to be a}} useful method for comparing corticosteroid responses among species of warmwater fish...|$|R
50|$|Fossils {{have been}} found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America dating back 100 million years. Currently, <b>longnose</b> <b>gar</b> are found in Central America, Cuba, North America, and the Isles of Pines. <b>Longnose</b> <b>gar</b> are {{frequently}} found in fresh water in the eastern half of the United States, but some gar were found in salinities up to 31 ppt. Their microhabitats consist of areas near downed trees, stone outcrops, and vegetation. The decline of their population is mainly due to human manipulation of aquatic systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} prey of the <b>longnose</b> <b>gar</b> is small fish and {{occasionally}} insects and small crustaceans, and mostly feed at night. Their main competitors are other gar {{of their own}} species, {{as well as other}} types of gar. Larger gar have been known to feed on smaller gar, as well. <b>Longnose</b> <b>gar</b> were a main source of food for Native Americans and early colonists. The first settlers at Jamestown, Virginia, dined on this fish through their harsh early years. Today, gar is more of sport fish, but their meat is surprisingly tasty. Predation is not a problem on adult <b>longnose</b> <b>gar,</b> but they are vulnerable to other gar predation when they are young, including adult <b>longnose</b> <b>gar.</b> L. osseus is carnivorous; for example, their diet consists of sunfish, catfish, and crayfish in their Texas range. Sexual maturity for males is reached between three and four years of age, and females at six years of age. Sex ratios are in favor of the males in the early life stages until about 10 years, then switches in favor of females. Females hold an average clutch size of about 27,000 eggs. Their eggs are very toxic to terrestrial vertebrates, but other piscivorous fish could tolerate the toxins.|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} also very fishable. A large number of species inhabit the river, among them: sunfishes (largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass bluegill, crappie, pumpkinseed, and warmouth), bowfin, brown bullhead, minnows (common carp, chub, dace, and shiner), suckers (white sucker and redhorse), perches (yellow perch, walleye, darter), brook stickleback, {{northern}} pike, <b>longnose</b> <b>gar,</b> trout (brown trout, brook trout, and rainbow trout), and lampreys (American brook lamprey and chestnut lamprey).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Longnose</b> <b>gar</b> have {{an average}} {{lifespan}} of 15-20 years with a maximum reported age of 39. This long lifespan allows the female to sexually mature around six years old. Males mature sexually as soon as two years of age. Longnose gars are sexually dimorphic; the females are larger than the males in body length, weight, and fin length. They generally have a clutch size close to 30,000, depending on the weight to length ratio of the females; larger females bear larger clutch sizes. They spawn in temperatures close to 20 °C in late April and early July. [...] Eggs have a toxic, adhesive coating to help them stick to substrates, and they are deposited onto stones in shallow water, rocky shelves, vegetation, or smallmouth bass nests. Their hatch time is seven to 9 days; young gar stay in vegetation during the first summer of life. <b>Longnose</b> <b>gar</b> reach an average length of 28-48 in (0.71-1.2 m) with a maximum length of about 6 ft (1.8 m) and 55 lb (25 kg) in weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{tropical}} gar (Atractosteus tropicus) is a fish {{found in}} freshwaters from southern Mexico to Costa Rica, reported to reach lengths {{of up to}} 1.25 m in the wild (albeit often much smaller in captivity).

5000|$|There is no {{standard}} list of rough fishes. A fish {{that is considered}} a rough fish in one region may be considered a desirable game and food fish in another, often due to cultural differences or simply tradition. For example, the common carp is considered an undesirable rough fish in the United States and Australia, but is the premier game fish of Europe and the most valuable food fish across most of Asia. Likewise, the <b>longnose</b> <b>gar</b> is considered a rough fish and undesirable nuisance in Ohio. In Louisiana, though, it is considered tasty by certain ethnic groups and, due to the many small bones, is rarely filleted, but rather is usually rolled with seasonings into [...] "gar balls" [...] and fried.|$|E
5000|$|One {{piece of}} evidence, {{though not a}} [...] "sighting" [...] per se, is the {{recording}} of sounds from within the lake by the Fauna Communications Research Institute in 2003, working {{as part of a}} Discovery Channel program. The group described the sounds as being similar to those produced by Beluga whales or dolphins—neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain. An article describing the recordings has been published to scientific literature. Based upon appearance and [...] "mysterious alligatorlike tracks" [...] found near Lake Champlain, cryptozoologists Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall suggested in 2016 that [...] "Champ" [...] could {{be a member of the}} Crocodylidae family (crocodiles). Researcher Scott Mardis explains that the tracks were likely the tracks of a large snapping turtle and also mentions the <b>Longnose</b> <b>Gar</b> or the Lake Sturgeon as more probable candidates for [...] "Champ." ...|$|E
5000|$|Shortnose gar have a prehistoric-looking appearance. Like {{many other}} [...] "lie-in-wait" [...] predators, {{they have an}} {{elongated}}, torpedo-like body with an elongated head containing one row of sharp, conical teeth. Similar to many Paleozoic and Mesozoic actinopterygians, their bodies are covered in rows of interlocking, rhomboidal ganoid scales that create an exceptionally protective, yet flexible armor around the fish. [...] The dorsal fin is located posterior nearly directly above the anal fin and very near the large caudal fin. Shortnose gar vary in color, changing from brown/olive green on the dorsal surface to yellow on the sides and white on the underbelly. Shortnose gar can be discerned from other gar species in that they lack the upper jaw of the alligator gar, the long snout of the <b>longnose</b> <b>gar,</b> and the markings of the spotted gar. The shortnose gar reaches up to 88 cm, but a more common length is 62.5 cm.|$|E
50|$|Currently, no {{management}} {{of this species}} is being conducted, nor is it federally listed as endangered, although some states have reported it as threatened (South Dakota, Delaware, and Pennsylvania). In the early 1900s, <b>longnose</b> <b>gar</b> were considered as destructive and worthless predators. Many people feared them based on their spooky appearance of a long mouth filled with teeth and armor-like scales, {{as well as their}} diet of anything that would fit in their mouths. Soon after this characterization, gar population reduction methods were established. Their declining populations are due to overfishing, habitat loss, dams, road construction, pollution, and other human-caused destruction of the aquatic systems. Overfishing is more of a trophy fish than for food; people find their meat to have a mild but tasty flavor. Because of their long lifespans and older sexual maturity age, factors affecting their reproduction is an issue in preserving them. Overfishing is a large issue for this fish, especially when the fish have not reached sexual maturity due to the female not peaking sexual maturity until about six years of age.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 1982 {{study by}} Burr, the {{quantitative}} diet of the brindled madtom was determined via dissection of stomach contents which [...] "… contained mostly dipteran larvae and pupae, ephemeropteran naiads, trichopteran larvae and adult isopods, …, chironomids and simuliids were most frequently eaten. Ephemeropteran larvae, including the genera Potamanthus and Stenonema, were second in frequency, and trichopteran larvae, primarily the genus Chematopsyche, were third in frequency. Among crustacea, Lirceus {{and a variety}} of copepods were next in importance in the diet. Worms, other microcrustaceans, other aquatic insects and fish and plant material made only small contributions to the total diet,". Predation upon adult brindled madtoms is primarily from upper trophic level aquatic predators such as the <b>longnose</b> <b>gar.</b> Brindled madtom egg clutches are a viable food source for multiple opportunistic species including crustaceans, insects, and other fishes. Although most other Noturus species occur primarily in riffles, the brindled madtom occurs primarily in moderately silted pools with heavy texture and mild currents. The brindled madtom thrives in clean, benthic regions of pools in swift streams and rivers that have moderate siltation over a cobble or heavily textured bottom. The species thrives in water with consistent temperatures around 25 to 27 C. Temperatures above 30 C are not well tolerated, and mass mortalities observed at temperatures above 33 C.|$|E
5000|$|Like most Texas Hill Country rivers, the San Gabriel {{west of the}} Balcones Fault is {{characterized}} by limestone river bottoms, some moderate rapids, small canyons, and muddy bottoms along slower-moving stretches; east of the Balcones Fault, the San Gabriel flows through the Blackland Prairie where rock features at the surface are more rare and the deep, clay soils are rolling to level and support dryland farms and more lush pastures than the thin soils to the west. Given the past tendency toward periodic large-scale but short-lived floods before construction of the large impoundments, much of the bottomland along the river banks east of Georgetown is forested {{with a mix of}} native oak and pecan plus other varieties, though in some locations pecan orchards with grafted varieties have been established as commercial enterprises. Recreational activities include canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. Typical fish species found in the river are catfish, largemouth bass, sunfish, carp, <b>longnose</b> <b>gar,</b> and various species of bait fish. However, many game fish and introduced species are found in the impoundments at Lake Georgetown and Granger Lake. The river runs through the Apache Pass Amphitheater and Festival Groundshttp://www.apachepass.com/ near Thorndale, south of the town of San Gabriel. Apache Pass features a cantilevered stage that projects out over the river and is used for major concerts and other events.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} divided into two valves that are hinged. Shell is thick and {{rectangular}} in shape and can be compressed or inflated; umbos do not extend above the hinge line (Cicerello, R. and Schuster, G. 2003). The cardinal teeth are large and serrated, while the lateral teeth are long and curved. Shell color ranges from dark brown to black and is covered with small bumps and has fluted ridges: nacre is white to gray color.Life Cycle:Megalonaias nervous mussels are sexually mature around 8 years of age, they are late tachytictic breeders. From July to October the males are mature, while they female contain eggs from August through October (Hollandbartels, L. 1993). Megalonaias nervosa males release sperm and the females collect the sperm through the incurrent siphon. The eggs are fertilized internally. Megalonaias nervosa has a parasitic larva stage called glochidia, the mussel uses a lure to attract fish and then releases the glochidia when the fish is close enough. The glochidia latch onto the gills or fins of the fish and remain there feeding of the blood of the fish until the glochidia reach the juvenile stage. Known host species for Megalonaias nervosa include <b>longnose</b> <b>gar</b> (Lepisosteus ossues), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), slender-head darter (Percina phoxocephala), and log perch (Percina caprodes) (O’Dee, S. and Watters, T. 1998). Parent mussel provides no care once the glochidia are released. Megalonaias nervosa are filter feeders, waste is released through the excurrent siphon. They are sedentary creatures and are anchored to the substrate or buried in the substrate. Studies had shown water temperature plays a role in reproduction, if the water temperature is too low, the mussels will not reproduce.|$|E
40|$|Lepisosteus osseus (<b>Longnose</b> <b>Gar)</b> is a large-bodied predator, whose Florida {{distribution}} {{remains unclear}} {{at the southern}} edge of its range.

Instead, records south of the lake are from canals, and most are recent (since 2000), including our own southernmost 2011 record. No records from Everglades natural habitats have been collected. Previous studies have shown native range expansions in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. We suggest that the <b>Longnose</b> <b>Gar</b> is expanding its range southward in Florida using canals as dispersal vectors and/or suitable habitat...|$|E
