40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} I am {{dealing with a}} general {{analysis}} of problems burning of <b>lean</b> hydrogen <b>mixtures</b> in combustion engines. During burning of very <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> burning procedure is over lasted with characteristic features. They need to be removed or reduced. One of these features is low power of engines operating by <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures,</b> which can be partially removed {{with the help of}} supercharging such engines. In {{the second part of the}} paper I am dealing with a design of supercharging system for a three- cylinder engine with volume 1, 2 dm 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigations}} of a production engine fed with <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> are presented. The {{results show that the}} use of <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> for such an engine allows to increase a little the engine efficiency but it is followed by the significant lowering of the engine torque and therefore it makes it impossible to take the practical advantage of it. The analysis of cylinder pressure cyclic variations was also performed for the lean burn engine operation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{improve the}} fuel economy but also cause sharp {{rises in the}} amount of {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOX). If the <b>mixture</b> becomes too <b>lean,</b> the engine may fail to ignite, causing misfire and a large increase in unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. <b>Lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> burn hotter and may cause rough idle, hard starting and stalling, and can even damage the catalytic converter, or burn valves in the engine. The risk of spark knock/engine knocking (detonation) is also increased when the engine is under load.|$|R
50|$|The mixture {{can also}} be judged by {{removing}} and scrutinizing the spark plugs. Black, dry, sooty plugs indicate a mixture too rich; white or light gray plugs indicate a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture.</b> A proper mixture is indicated by brownish-gray/straw-coloured plugs.|$|E
50|$|Porsche 962C cars {{suffered}} from piston failure {{due to the}} wrong microchip fitted for fuel management, causing a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> and burned pistons.

5000|$|In 1984, Toyota {{released}} the 4A-E engine. This {{was the first}} engine {{in the world to}} use a lean-burn combustion control system with a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> sensor, Toyota called [...] "TTC-L" [...] (Toyota Total Clean-Lean-Burn). It was used in Japan on Toyota Carina T150 replacing the TTC-V (Vortex) exhaust gas recirculation approach used earlier, Toyota Corolla E80, and Toyota Sprinter. The <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> sensor was provided in the exhaust system to detect air-fuel ratios leaner than the theoretical air-fuel ratio. The fuel injection volume was then accurately controlled by a computer using this detection signal to achieve lean air-fuel ratio feedback.For optimal combustion, the following items were applied: program independent injection that accurately changed the injection volume and timing for individual cylinders, platinum plugs for improving ignition performance with lean mixtures, and high performance igniters.|$|E
40|$|From a {{theoretical}} viewpoint, a <b>lean</b> or ultra-lean <b>mixture</b> improves thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines when operating at partial loads. This is confirmed is current practice with compression-ignited motors. However, spark-ignited engines actually reach the lowest specific fuel consumptions at air-fuel ratios {{not very far}} from the stoichiometric when the fuel is gasoline, since with <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures</b> combustion becomes too slow and erratic. Stratified-charge engines allow <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures,</b> but they require combustion chamber designs that penalize efficiency. The presence of hydrogen in the mixture increases combustion speed and reduces misfiring. As a result, the lowest specific fuel consumptions are obtained with <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{as a whole and}} are reduced in amounts, as the ratio of hydrogen to the total amount of fuel supplied is increased. In this work, a new system of hydrogen enrichment is presented: a small amount of hydrogen is stratified around the spark-plug in an open combustion chamber, in order to combine stratified-charge and hydrogen-enrichment benefits. An experimental prototype is described in detail and the first experimental results are reported...|$|R
50|$|Air-fuel {{equivalence}} ratio, λ (lambda), is {{the ratio}} of actual AFR to stoichiometry for a given mixture. λ = 1.0 is at stoichiometry, rich mixtures λ < 1.0, and <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> λ > 1.0.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuel type}} and the fuel/air mixture {{must also be}} considered. The greater the {{nitromethane}} content in the fuel, the hotter the fuel will burn; high [...] "nitro" [...] fuels require cooler glow plugs. <b>Lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> (low fuel-to-air ratio) burn hotter than rich mixtures (higher fuel-to-air ratio) and operating temperatures can be raised to levels that can prematurely destroy the glow plug if too <b>lean</b> a <b>mixture</b> is used ("over-leaning").|$|R
50|$|The sensor {{does not}} {{actually}} measure oxygen concentration, {{but rather the}} difference between the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas and the amount of oxygen in air. Rich mixture causes an oxygen demand. This demand causes a voltage to build up, due to transportation of oxygen ions through the sensor layer. <b>Lean</b> <b>mixture</b> causes low voltage, since there is an oxygen excess.|$|E
50|$|Combustion can be {{problematic}} if a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> is {{present at the}} spark plug. However, fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber. This results in a stratified charge: {{one in which the}} air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber, but varies in a controlled (and potentially quite complex) way across the volume of the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with its}} N52 {{predecessor}} which was port-injected, the N53 uses direct injection (consisting of Piëzo-electric injectors {{directly in the}} cylinder) with a stratified <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> operation. The N53 has variable valve timing on both camshafts (called double vanos by BMW) and a magnesium alloy block. Unlike the N52, the N53 does not contain variable valve lift (called valvetronic by BMW), due to space limitations in the cylinder head.|$|E

50|$|This {{combination}} of a rich mixture near the spark plug, and a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> in the cylinder allowed stable running, yet complete combustion of fuel, thus reducing CO (carbon monoxide) and hydrocarbon emissions. This method allowed the engine to burn less fuel more efficiently {{without the use of}} an exhaust gas recirculation valve or a catalytic converter, although those methods were installed later to further improve emission reduction.|$|E
50|$|In a {{homogeneous}} charge system, the air/fuel ratio is kept {{very close to}} stoichiometric, meaning it contains the exact amount of air necessary for a complete combustion of the fuel. This gives stable combustion, but it places an upper limit on the engine's efficiency: any attempt to improve fuel economy by running a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> with {{a homogeneous}} charge results in unstable combustion; this impacts on power and emissions, notably of nitrogen oxides or NOx.|$|E
50|$|The ADI system adds {{cooling water}} to the {{fuel-air}} mixture to prevent pre-ignition (detonation) in the engine cylinders when the mixture is leaned to a more powerful - yet engine damaging - mixture that adds considerable power to the engine. The supply of ADI liquid is limited so that the system runs out of liquid before the engine is damaged by the very high cylinder head temperatures caused by the very <b>lean</b> <b>mixture.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If the {{efficiency}} is high, then combustion temperatures must be high, {{as required by}} the Carnot cycle, and the air fuel <b>mixture</b> must be <b>lean.</b> High combustion temperatures and <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> cause nitrogen dioxide to be formed.|$|R
40|$|Under light-load {{conditions}} in early-injection stratified-charge compression-ignition (SCCI) engines, excessive premixing {{can lead to}} undesirable levels of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Optimal stratification can reduce these emissions. In this work, the effects of changes in swirl, injection pressure, injector hole-size and number of holes, injection timing, and piston geometry on stratification are computationally investigated. It is shown that these parameters affect the stratification through their influence on the rate of spray penetration, drop vaporization, and fuel/air mixing. The outcome is characterized by examining {{the evolution of the}} spatial distribution of the fuel vapor in the chamber and its mass-based distribution function. All other parameters remaining the same, decreasing drop size leads to faster vaporization and richer mixtures. Increasing penetration leads to greater spreading and <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Increasing spray included-angle leads to greater spreading and <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Increasing injection pressure leads to increased mixing and <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Increasing injector hole-size leads to richer mixtures at lighter loads because the duration of injection is reduced and the fuel is confined closer to the axis. Increasing swirl leads to faster breakup of the head-vortex and confinement of the fuel closer to the axis, and hence richer mixture. J. Abraha...|$|R
50|$|The engines {{designed}} for lean-burning can employ higher compression ratios and thus provide better performance, efficient fuel use and low exhaust hydrocarbon emissions than {{those found in}} conventional Gasoline engines. Ultra <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures</b> with very high air-fuel ratios can only be achieved by direct injection engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel-air}} mixture {{can only}} burn in slow-moving air, so {{an area of}} reverse flow is maintained by the fuel nozzles for the approximately stoichiometric burning in the primary zone. Further compressor air is introduced which completes the combustion process and reduces {{the temperature of the}} combustion products to a level which the turbine can accept. Less than 25% of the air is typically used for combustion, as an overall <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits.|$|E
5000|$|On its {{downward}} stroke it compresses {{the rich}} mixture to about 70 psi {{at which time}} the rising pressure raises a spring loaded poppet valve off its seat and the charge is squirted into the cylinder. There it is aimed at the spark plug area and ignited. The combustion pressure immediately shuts the spring-loaded poppet valve {{and from then on}} its (sic) just a [...] "regular" [...] stratified-charge ignition process with the flame front igniting those <b>lean</b> <b>mixture</b> areas in the cylinder.|$|E

The programmable ECU enables user control of the air-fuel ratio.

5000|$|To induce better {{swirling}} of the {{air-fuel mixture}} in the GR650 engine, Suzuki used a [...] "sub-intake port," [...] which ran a tube from the carburetor throat to the intake port {{just above the}} valve head.

50|$|Normally, the {{lifetime}} of an unheated sensor is about 30,000 to 50,000 miles (50,000 to 80,000 km). Heated sensor lifetime is typically 100,000 miles (160,000 km). Failure of an unheated sensor is usually caused by the buildup of soot on the ceramic element, which lengthens its response time and may cause total loss of ability to sense oxygen. For heated sensors, normal deposits are burned off during operation and failure occurs due to catalyst depletion. The probe then tends to report <b>lean</b> <b>mixture,</b> the ECU enriches the mixture, the exhaust gets rich with carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, and the fuel economy worsens.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the scanner}} PID {{displays}} a [...] "lambda" [...] or [...] "equivalence ratio," [...] the reading should be 1.0 under stoichiometric conditions. Numbers above 1.0 indicate a lean condition while numbers below 1.0 indicate rich mixtures. The ECM uses {{the information from}} the sensors to adjust the amount of fuel being injected into the engine, so corresponding changes in the short-term fuel trim PID(s) should also be seen. <b>Lean</b> <b>mixture</b> readings from the AFR sensor will prompt the ECM to add fuel, which will manifest itself as a positive (or more positive) short-term fuel trim percentage.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the fuel flow rate can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a <b>lean</b> <b>mixture,</b> which makes the engine misfire (or [...] "stumble")—an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or diaphragm pump which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
5000|$|Aviation gasoline, often {{referred}} to as [...] "avgas" [...] or 100-LL (low-lead), is a highly refined form of gasoline for aircraft, with an emphasis on purity, anti-knock characteristics and minimization of spark plug fouling. Avgas must meet performance guidelines for both the rich mixture condition required for take-off power settings and the <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures</b> used during cruise to reduce fuel consumption.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of the {{electric}} fields on the flame propagation and combustion characteristics of <b>lean</b> premixed methane–air <b>mixtures</b> were experimentally investigated in a constant volume chamber. Results show that the flame front is remarkably stretched by the applied electric field, the stretched flame propagation velocity and the average flame propagation velocity are all accelerated significantly as the input voltage increases. This indicates that the applied electric field can augment the stretch in flame, and the result is more obvious for <b>leaner</b> <b>mixture.</b> According to the analyses of the combustion pressure variation and the heat release rate, the peak combustion pressure Pmax increases and its appearance time tp is advanced with the increase of the input voltage. For the mixture of λ = 1. 6 at the input voltage of − 12 kV, Pmax increases by almost 12. 3 %, and tp is advanced by almost 31. 4 %, compared to the case of without electric fields. In addition, the normalized mass burning rate and the accumulated mass fraction burned are all enhanced substantially, and the flame development duration and the rapid burning duration are remarkably reduced with the increase of the input voltage, and again, the influence of electric field is more profound for <b>leaner</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The results {{can be explained by the}} electric field-induced stretch effects on <b>lean</b> burn methane-air <b>mixture...</b>|$|R
50|$|Because HCCI {{operates}} on <b>lean</b> <b>mixtures,</b> the peak temperature {{is much lower}} than that encountered in SI and diesel engines. This low peak temperature reduces the formation of , but it also leads to incomplete burning of fuel, especially near combustion chamber walls. This produces relatively high carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. An oxidizing catalyst can remove the regulated species, because the exhaust is still oxygen-rich.|$|R
