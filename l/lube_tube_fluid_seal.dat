40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic <b>fluid</b> from the <b>seal</b> clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> of supraglottic airway devices (SGA) {{protects the}} airway from fluid contamination. We {{evaluated}} {{the suitability of}} indicator dye placement in the upper digestive tract of anesthetized patients combined with fiberoptical tracing to investigate the <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> of SGA. Methods: Patients swallowed a capsule of indigo carmine green (ICG) prior to induction of anaesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, one of two different SGA (either an i-Gel™ or an LMA-Supreme ™ (LMA-S)) was inserted after randomization. Methylene blue stained normal saline was injected through the proximal opening of drainage tube during mechanical ventilation as well as spontaneous breathing. We monitored regurgitation of ICG with a flexible fiberscope (FO) inserted through the drainage tube and checked for the appearance of methylene blue in the mask bowl with the FO inserted through the airway tube. Results: In thirty-six patients with an i-Gel ™ and 37 with a LMA-S no regurgitation of ICG was observed {{at the level of}} the upper oeso-phageal sphincter (UES).

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{properties of}} magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> installed in rotary sealing nodes which {{operate in the}} utility water environment. Seals of this type have been examined as a possible {{solution to the problem}} with ship manoeuvring propulsion sealing. The present analysis bases on laboratory durability tests of magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> exposed to longterm utility water loads, at different water pressures and shaft revolutions. The basic seal durability criterion was the number of revolutions made by the sealing node shaft until the appearance of water tightness loss (leakage). It was found that the main factor leading to the wear of the seal is the relative speed of the magnetic fluid with respect to that of the utility water, and this process is heavily affected by the pressure acting on the seal. The reported test results are presented in the form of diagrams showing the seal durability (time until water tightness loss) as a function of rotational speed. The curves shown in the diagrams are regular, with two different rotational speed ranges: the highspeed range, when the tightness loss is relatively fast, and the low-speed range, with a clear tendency to prolong the seal lifetime. These diagrams were given the name of durability curves of the MF seal operating in water. The results of the performed tests suggest formal similarity between the experimental data distribution concerning tightness loss processes occurring in magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> operating in water environment and metal fatigue processes.

The cuff also has a deflated profile that may allow for easier insertion through the stoma site. This unique design {{is known as the}} TaperGuard™ cuff. The purpose of the observational, in vitro study reported here was to compare the TaperGuard™ taper-shaped cuff to a conventional high-volume low-pressure cylindrical-shaped cuff (Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy Tube [DCT]) with respect to applied tracheal wall pressure, air and <b>fluid</b> <b>sealing</b> efficacy, and insertion force. Methods: Three sizes of {{tracheostomy tube}}s with the two cuff types were placed in appropriately sized tracheal models and lateral wall pressure was measured via pressure-sensing elements on the inner surface. <b>Fluid</b> <b>sealing</b> performance was assessed by inflating the cuffs within the tracheal models (25 cmH 2 O), instilling water above the cuff, and measuring fluid leakage past the cuff. To measure air leak, tubes were attached to a test lung and ventilator, and leak was calculated by subtracting the average exhaled tidal volume from the average delivered tidal volume. A tensile test machine was used to measure insertion force for each tube with the cuff deflated to simulate clinical insertion through a stoma site. Results: The average pressure exerted on the lateral wall of the model trachea was lower for the taper-shaped cuff than for the cylindrical cuff under all test conditions (P< 0. 05). The taper-shaped cuff also demonstrated a more even, lower pressure distribution along the lateral wall of the model trachea. The average air and <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance with the taper-shaped cuff was significantly improved, when compared to the cylindrical-shaped cuff, for each tube size tested (P< 0. 05). The insertion force for the taper-shaped cuff was ~ 40 % less than that for the cylindrical-shaped cuff. Conclusion: In a model trachea, the Shiley™ Flexible Adult tracheostomy tube with TaperGuard™ cuff, when compared to the Shiley™ Disposable Inner Cannula Tracheostomy tube with cylindrical cuff, exerted a lower average lateral wall pressure and a more evenly distributed pressure. In addition, it provided more effective <b>fluid</b> and air <b>seals</b> and required less force to insert.
