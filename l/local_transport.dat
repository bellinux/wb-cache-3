5|$|English local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} produce <b>Local</b> <b>Transport</b> Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport {{as part of a}} longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final <b>Local</b> <b>Transport</b> Plan 2006–2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for {{the first five years of}} the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the bus network including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.|$|E

5|$|The Redcliffe-Maud Report (Cmnd. 4040) {{recommended}} {{the abolition of}} all the existing county, county borough, borough, urban district and rural district councils and replacement with new authorities. These new unitary (i.e. single tier) authorities were largely based on major towns, which acted as regional employment, commercial, social and recreational centres and took into account <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure and travel patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development {{and the growth of}} the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.|$|E

5|$|Historically Leigh {{was well}} {{connected}} to the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure, but with {{the closure of the}} railway in 1969 this is no longer the case. Public transport is co-ordinated by the Transport for Greater Manchester. There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Jim Stones, Maytree Travel, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester and Network Warrington from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been suggestions to reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme was chosen for the route; this decision was not universally popular.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, {{the local}} governments in Copenhagen and {{neighbouring}} Malmö in Sweden {{announced that they}} were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station, providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge. The study, for which the EU granted funding in the following December, will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> networks on each side, and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers.|$|E
5|$|Legal & General {{worked with}} the local {{community}} to secure support for the project, establishing the St Giles Renaissance Forum in 2002 as {{a focal point for}} local residents, community groups and stakeholders to collaborate on plans to regenerate St Giles. Plans for the development were unveiled in February 2004 and in January 2005 Legal & General made a planning application to begin construction. The scheme was opposed by a number of local residents' groups which complained that it would constitute an overdevelopment of the site, would put too much strain on <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> and that there was too little residential accommodation on the site.|$|E

5|$|The local Pennant {{sandstone}} {{is frequently}} used as walling material, often with limestone dressings, as {{found on the}} old Temple Meads railway station and Clifton Down railway station. Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock-faced squared blocks, described as Pennant rubble, which are used alone, eked out with plain brickwork, or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine. Much of the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the original Temple Meads railway station—now used as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum—were designed or built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007. This section presents some engineering challenges, {{as it was}} severed by {{the construction of the}} M5 motorway and the A38 road. The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome. At Stonehouse, the bridge carrying the Bristol and Gloucester Railway {{has been replaced by a}} culvert, but a bid has been made to the newly formed Gloucestershire <b>Local</b> <b>Transport</b> Board for its reinstatement, and to create a long-distance footpath along the route. Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, with the ultimate goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> and property company which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. The company will be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire <b>Local</b> <b>Transport</b> Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E
5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
