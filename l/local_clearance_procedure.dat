50|$|Trade {{facilitation}} {{involves a}} wide range of activities centered on lowering trade transaction costs for firms in global commerce. These costs include the price of moving freight from the factory to final destinations.

As such, trade facilitation involves much more than trucking goods across national borders or shipping a package by sea transport.|$|R

Heat transfer assumptions that represent the extreme case for component temperature distributions are presented. The relative <b>local</b> change in <b>clearances</b> between rotors and casing are then investigated analytically. The effect of the revised clearances on the performance is quantified and compared against experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Inertial {{motion sensors}} in the {{flight control system}} pick up high {{frequency}} signals due to the flexible modes {{in addition to the}} rigid body responses and could lead to instability at the structural frequencies when the rigid body stability augmentation feedback loops are closed. To attenuate the effects of this structural coupling, notch filters are designed and placed in series with the inertial sensors in each of the feedback paths. During the initial phase of control law design and development, aircraft structural response data is generally not available. Therefore, while designing the rigid body control laws, an additional budget is allocated for phase lags introduced by the structural notch filters. Once the structural coupling tests are carried out on the aircraft, structural filters are designed {{in order to meet the}} certification requirements. During developmental flight tests with multiple prototype vehicles there are likely to be variations in the structural response characteristics as the production processes are maturing and also, due to minor updates to the aircraft standard of preparation and addition of different external stores. This calls for the redesign of structural filters and subsequent onboard software development and testing which is a lengthy process. Hence, in order to meet project schedules without compromising safety, the <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> was modified so that it could be efficiently used for flights during the development phase. This paper presents a revised <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> based not only on values of the nominal stability margins, but also on the sensitivity of structural stability margins to the modal frequency perturbation. This change in the clearance philosophy was considered acceptable for the developmental phase of flights but for the final production vehicle standard one would need to strictly follow the MIL-F 9490 D Standard guidelines. This paper discusses the changes carried out to the <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure,</b> the rationale behind the changes made, and also gives directions for future research in robust stabilization of structural modes as well as notch filter design...|$|R

In addition, Congress passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which also created administrative <b>clearance</b> <b>procedures</b> having the effect of delaying consummation of mergers while agency evaluation of the competitive impact took place.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Local</b> <b>Clearance</b> Triangulation (LCT) of {{polygonal}} obstacles is a cell decomposition {{designed for}} the efficient computation of locally shortest paths with clearance. This paper presents a revised definition of LCTs, new theoretical results and optimizations, and new algorithms introducing dy-namic updates and robustness. Given an input obstacle set with n vertices, a theoretical analysis is proposed showing that LCTs generate a triangular decomposition of O(n) cells, guaranteeing that discrete search algorithms can compute paths in optimal times. In addition, several examples are pre-sented indicating {{that the number of}} triangles is low in practice, close to 2 n, and a new technique is described for reducing the number of triangles when the maximum query clearance is known in advance. Algorithms for repairing the <b>local</b> <b>clearance</b> property dynamically are also introduced, lead-ing to efficient LCT updates for addressing dynamic changes in the obsta-cle set. Dynamic updates automatically handle intersecting and overlapping segments with guaranteed robustness, using techniques that combine one exact geometric predicate with adjustment of illegal floating point coordi-nates. The presented results demonstrate that LCTs are efficient and highly flexible for representing dynamic polygonal environments with clearance information...|$|R

40|$|The California Automated Mortality Linkage System (CAMLIS), {{established}} in 1981 {{to facilitate the}} conduct of follow-up studies in the State of California, employs a combination of deterministic and probabilistic linkage decision criteria to perform the death clearance function. The system was evaluated against four traditional death <b>clearance</b> <b>procedures</b> {{and the performance of}} each procedure measured in terms of measures of sensitivity and specificity. Only one procedure was associated with a specificity lower than 0. 99; for that one, the specificity was 0. 93. There was much greater fluctuation in the observed sensitivity levels. In one of the procedures, CAMLIS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0. 97 versus 0. 79 for the Social Security Administration. A comparison against the National Death Index (NDI) produced sensitivities of 0. 89 for CAMLIS and 0. 94 for the NDI. An assessment of manual search procedures using a file of Japanese names produced a CAMLIS sensitivity measure of 0. 92 compared with 0. 93 for the manual search. Another manual search procedure using microfiche copies of the state death index produced a CAMLIS sensitivity of 0. 97; in this evaluation, the sensitivity of the manual search was defined as 1. 0. Another measure of performance of a death <b>clearance</b> <b>procedure</b> is its predictive value in identifying a person who has died; CAMLIS generated predictive values in these evaluations that ranged from 0. 93 through 0. 99, contrasted with the NDI value of 0. 59...|$|R
