In the experimental tests made in a wood chamber a manikin, a ventilated desk, and two interior climate analyzers are used. The fluctuations of air velocity and temperature are measured in the <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> and in 15 human body sections around the manikin, while the mean value of air relative humidity and mean radiant temperature are evaluated inside the experimental chamber. The mean air temperature in the <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> is around 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), while the mean radiant temperature in the occupation area, the mean air temperature far from the occupation area, and the internal mean air relative humidity in the occupation area are around 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), 28 degrees C (82. 4 degrees F), and 50 %, respectively. The airflow rate in tests I and II are 25. 75 m(3) /h (15. 16 ft(3) /min) and 48. 04 m(3) /h (28. 27 ft(3) /min), respectively. The mean air velocity, root mean square, and turbulence intensity for test I are 0. 59 m/s (1. 94 ft/s), 0. 13 m/s (0. 43 ft/s), and 22. 4 %, in the upper <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device,</b> and 0. 9 m/s (2. 96 ft/s), 0. 15 m/s (0. 49 ft/s), and 16. 7 %, in the lower <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> device; while, for test II they are 1. 72 m/s (5. 64 ft/s), 0. 16 m/s (0. 52 ft/s), and 9. 4 %, in the upper <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device,</b> and 1. 06 m/s (3. 48 ft/s), 0. 16 m/s (0. 52 ft/s and 14. 9 %, in the lower <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device.</b> In test I the mean air velocity and the airflow rate are higher in the lower exit <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> than in the upper exit <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> device; while in test II, the opposite is true.

40|$|In {{this work}} the comfort level, namely the thermal comfort, local thermal {{discomfort}} and air quality levels, {{in a classroom}} with desks equipped with two personalized ventilation systems, in slightly warm environments, is evaluated. A manikin, a ventilated classroom desk, two indoor climate analyzers, a multi-nodal human thermal comfort numerical model and a computational fluid dynamic numerical model, are used. The classroom desk, with double occupation capacity, is used by a student, located in the right side seat. Each personalized ventilation system is equipped with one <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> located above the desk writing area, in front to the trunk area, and an other located below the desk writing area, in front to the legs area. The thermal comfort level is evaluated by the developed multi-nodal human thermal comfort numerical model, using a PMV value, the local thermal discomfort level, namely the draught risk and the air velocity fluctuation equivalent frequencies, is evaluated by empirical models. while the air quality level and the detailed airflow around the manikin are evaluated by the computational fluid dynamic numerical model. In the experimental tests the mean air velocity and the turbulence intensity in the upper <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> are 3. 5 m/s and 9. 7 %, while in the lower <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> are 2. 6 m/s and 15. 2 %. The mean air temperature in the <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> is around 28 degrees C, while the mean radiant temperature in the occupation area, the mean air temperature far from the occupation area and the internal mean air relative humidity were. respectively, 28 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 50 %. The air velocity and temperature around the occupant are measured around 15 human body sections. The actual personalized ventilation system, which promotes an ascendant airflow around the occupant with highest air renovation rate in the respiration area, promotes acceptable thermal comfort conditions and air quality in the respiration area in accord to the present standards. The draught risk is verified {{in the head and}} left leg and the uncomfortable air velocity equivalent frequency is verified in the left arm. The left human body sections present higher local thermal discomfort levels than the right human body sections, because they are also influenced by the left <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device.</b> In accord to the obtained results, the classroom desk design, equipped with two personalized ventilation systems, guarantees acceptable thermal comfort conditions and promotes good air quality conditions, with acceptable local thermal discomfort conditions and with low energy consumption level.

40|$|Personalized {{ventilation}} {{is expected}} {{to improve the quality}} of inhaled air and accommodate individual thermal preferences. In this paper, a chair-based personalized ventilation system is proposed that can potentially be applied in theatres, cinemas, lecture halls, aircrafts, and even offices. Air quality, thermal comfort, and the human response to this ventilation method were investigated by experiments. By comparing eight different <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> (ATDs) it was found that up to 80 % of the inhaled air could be composed of fresh personalized air with a supply flow rate of less than 3. 0 l/s. Perceived air quality improved greatly by serving cool air directly to the breathing zone. Feelings of irritation and local drafts could be eliminated by proper designs. Personalized air with a temperature below that of room air was able to bring "a cool head" and increased thermal comfort in comparison with mixing ventilation.

40|$|The {{ventilation}} system design for better {{environment in the}} passenger train vehicles in Hong Kong is discussed. Mean air speed {{is an important factor}} on thermal comfort. Macroscopic flow numbers including the Archimedes number, the Reynolds number, and the throw of diffusers are recommended to be design parameters, for determining the mean air speed in the occupied zone of the train compartment. Empirical equations derived earlier are recommended {{to be used in the}} design of <b>air</b> diffusion <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> for providing a better environment in the passenger train vehicles. It is found that the supply inlet air jet would not sufficiently penetrate into the occupied zone when passengers are closely packed together in a train vehicle.

The use of active one-port models has been tested to characterize an <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> (ATD) as a source of flow generated noise. In order to predict the noise generation at different operating points of the device a scaling law was derived and verified. In the experimentally derived scaling law a flow speed dependence of 3 was found for the narrow band spectra, corresponding to a dipole-like behavior of the source in the plane wave range. The proposed technique was validated successfully and the results indicated a good prediction of in-duct sound generation by the <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device.</b> Sound reflection from hot flow duct openings has been investigated experimentally. The reflection coefficient was measured for flow temperatures up to 500 ºC and jet velocities up to 108 m/s. The results have been compared with famous Munt’s theory. It was concluded that at low Mach number and Helmholz number cases the results agree well with the Munt’s model. This was the first experimental validation of the theory for hot flow conditions. Experimental procedures to determine the sound transmission through automotive turbo-charger compressors were developed and described in detail. An overview of a unique turbocharger testing facility established at KTH CICERO in Stockholm is given. The facility can be used to measure acoustic two-port data for turbo-compressors. Results from measurements on a passenger car turbo-compressor are presented and the influence of operating conditions on the sound transmission is discussed. Current wave action models developed in CMT for computation of the gas exchange processes in I.

In {{the first part}} of this thesis a measurement procedure {{to characterize}} an <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> using an acoustic one-port source model based on the two microphone technique has been tested and validated. In order to provide a prediction of flow noise generation at different operating points for the device a scaling law was derived. Successful validation experiments were performed.

The source characterisation results were compared to results obtained using the well-known linear two-load technique. It was shown that the new non-linear multi-load technique gave improved results when the source was slightly non-linear. In the third part an improved method to characterize noise sources in high temperature flowducts has been suggested. As a test environment for the standard two microphone technique a helium-air mixture has been used to simulate acoustical conditions similar to hot exhaust gas systems. In order to test the method the passive acoustic properties of automotive diesel engine and an unflanged flow duct termination have been experimentally determined.

40|$|As a {{response}} to the need to provide an acceptable thermal comfort and air quality in indoor environments, various ventilation performance indicators were developed over the years. These metrics are mainly geared towards air distribution, heat and pollutant removals. Evidence exists of influencing factors on these indicators as centered on ventilation design and operations. Unlike other indoor environments, health care environment requires better performance of ventilation system to prevent an incidence of nosocomial and other hospital acquired illnesses. This study investigates, using in-situ experiments, the ventilation efficiency in a dentistry surgical room. Thermal and hygric parameters were monitored on the <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> and occupied zone over a period of one week covering both occupied and unoccupied hours. The resulting time-series parameters were used to evaluate the room’s ventilation effectiveness. Also, the obtained parameters were benchmarked against ASHRAE 170 (2013) and MS 1525 (2014) requirements for ventilation in health care environment and building energy efficiency respectively. The results show that the mean daily operative conditions failed to satisfy the provisions of both standards. Regarding effectiveness, the findings reveal that the surgical room ventilation is ineffective with ventilation efficiency values ranging between 0 and 0. 5 indicating air distribution short-circuiting. These results suggest further investigations, through numerical simulation, on the effect of this short-circuiting on thermal comfort, infection risk assessments and possible design improvements, an endeavour that forms our next line of research inquiries...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to illustrate how a number of parameters influence the heating and cooling demands and energy use in shopping malls situated in cold climates. The parameters of particular interest are: lighting power, infiltration through the building envelope and entrances and the use of direct cooling (also known as free cooling). The approach includes monitoring of an existing shopping mall situated in Sweden. An extensive foundation of input data concerning the building construction, building shape, HVAC systems, internal and external heat loads and measured energy use was collected. Based on the case study shopping mall, a simulation model was developed. The model facilitates studies of the effect of parameter changes, separately and in different combinations. The results are illustrated in duration diagrams, divided between day and night conditions. An interesting combination is, for instance, future energy efficient lighting in combination with direct cooling by means of low-temperature outdoor air supplied by ventilation systems with very low Specific Fan Power (SFP). Studies have showed that lighting power dominates the cooling demands in shopping malls and this implies that the size of current internal loads make the energy demand less sensitive to other parameters such as the shape of the building envelope and the proportion of window facade area. However, emerging technologies for energy efficient lighting systems and the increasing awareness of the shop owners will most likely lead to drastic reduction of the cooling demands. The simulations presented in this paper illustrate the impact this will have for the overall HVAC system, especially for the possibility of utilizing direct cooling by allowing lower supply air temperatures. In the case study building, the supply air temperature is regulated depending on the heating demand between 16 °C [60. 8 °F] to 20 °C [68 °F]. With modern supply <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> the supply <b>air</b> temperature can be significantly lower. The paper not only shows the potential for future use of direct cooling in shopping malls in cold climates but also points out the requirements on ventilation system design to make direct cooling electrically as well as thermally efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} mixing {{ventilation}} is the airflow {{supply to the}} room by means of jets initiatedfrom the ventilation diffusers. To avoid the draught problem, the design of mixing ventilationmakes uses the throw term, which {{is defined as the}} distance to the supply <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> inwhich the jet centreline mean velocity is decreased to a given value. Traditionally, the throw ismeasured by the supply air device manufacturer. The throw is applied by designers to estimatethe velocity levels in the occupied zone. A standard for determining the throw is the CENstandard CEN/TC 156 /WG 4 N 86 "Draft Standard. <b>Air</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>Devices.</b> AerodynamicsTesting And Rating For Mixed Flow Application". The measurement of the throw is very time consuming even with the free jets and theinfluence of the room (the effect of confinement) is not considered. The objective of thepresent study is to give a basis for modifying the existing design and testing method used topredict the velocities in the occupied zone during the design process. A new method whichmay probably be more easier than the existing methods {{and at the same time}} give a betterprecision by including the confinement effect. In this thesis two methodological systems of experiment and numerical simulations have beenused. The numerical predictions are used in comparison with the measurements. Thereasonable agreement of the above mentioned methods is implemented to numerical study ofthe other room configurations which are not experimentally studied. This examining methodallows the possibility of studying a lot of configurations and in this manner generalising of theresults. Although the experimental part was made for both model-scale and full-scale testrooms, a large amount of data was obtained for a new test room whose dimension aresystematically varied. All of studies have been made for the isothermal case and themeasurements of velocities and pressures conducted along the room perimeters. The effect ofshort and deep rooms on the properties of the jet (velocities, pressure, integral scale, jetmomentum, the rate of spreading of jet and turbulence intensities) have been carried out. Some old and recent investigations have been examined. Specially the concept of correlationsfrom open to closed rooms is criticised. It is also shown that the flow field in a confined roomis affected by many other factors than the Reynolds number. The surface pressure on theperimeters was used to calculate the reaction forces at the corners which causes recirculatingbubbles at corners. A study of the turbulent axisymmetric jet which is the basic element inturbulent shear flows and some restrictions of the traditional measurement techniques at theregion of interest in ventilation applications are discussed. The jet momentum is measured byweighing on a balance. Also a study of jets which collide with a wall, that is impinging jet,the effect of walls and confinement on the jet momentum have experimentally andnumerically been carried out. A new momentum balance model was developed for both thefree jet and confined one. An empirical relation has been found for estimation of the room’srotation centre which is used for validation of CFD results. Finally, it is found that the jets in a ventilated room which are a combination of free jet, walljet and impinging jet differ from the traditional wall jets. The rate of spreading of the jet andthe maximum velocity decay in a ventilated room are also different depending on the roomsize and its confinement...|$|R

Two experimental tests (in high voltage Laboratory) were made to give the answers if delaying streamer <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> is effective than franklin rod or not. A breakdown voltage for different air gaps are measured and compared between franklin rod and delaying streamer <b>air</b> <b>terminal.</b> Another experimental test to reach the effective number of dissipation point in delaying streamer <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> flashover voltage. Two empirical equations are developed for the air gap breakdown voltage for franklin rod and delaying streamer <b>air</b> <b>terminal.</b> The experimental {{results are consistent with}} the theoretical and the practice...|$|R

40|$|Analysis {{of human}} hand kinesiology {{has been used}} to justify the design {{characteristics}} of <b>terminal</b> <b>devices.</b> The human hand is a complex mechanical structure consisting of 15 articulations controlled by over 30 muscles for the 5 fingers. It functions as a communication, sensory, grasp and manipulation structure. Separating essential hand kinesiology that is linked with each hand function might allow for the efficient development of <b>terminal</b> <b>devices</b> where there is one primary function such as grasping. It follows that to develop an effective grasping mechanism for a <b>terminal</b> <b>device</b> there should be a clear understanding of hand motions as they relate directly to the grasping function. The conceptual framework used to characterize grasping functions will most likely influence the development of <b>terminal</b> <b>devices.</b> There is a growing body of literature that is refining the way we think of grasping activities, and may impact the design of <b>terminal</b> <b>devices.</b> For example, researchers have described the simplified coordination of hand motions during grasp as “synergies” or “virtual fingers”, where there are predictable dependencies of one finger on another. Using conceptual approaches such as the “virtual fingers” concept will reduce the complexity of the description of the hand/object/task interactio...|$|R
