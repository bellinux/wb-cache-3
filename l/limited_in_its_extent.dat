40|$|Using {{images from}} the Mars Orbiter Camera, we have {{identified}} several linear ridges located 10 – 60 km north of the volcano Olympus Mons, Mars, {{at the edge of}} the Olympus Mons aureole materials. These ridges appear to be made of unconsolidated material by virtue of the many dust avalanche scars seen on their upper slopes. Based upon their morphology (several ridges have crater-like central depressions) and superposition relationships, the ridges appear to have formed very recently and post-date the formation of the youngest lava flows spilling over the northern escarpment of Olympus Mons. Several possible origins for the ridges, including an eolian, periglacial, or depositional origin have been considered, but we favor a ridge origin by a series of small explosive eruptions initiated by the intrusion of a dike into a volatile-rich substrate. To explore this process, we develop a numerical model for dike intrusion into a volatile-rich substrate that yields plausible dike widths between 2. 4 – 3. 5 m. The total volume of a single ridge system is 65 × 106 m 3, and we calculate that it may have taken only a few minutes to form. Viable solutions only exist when the thicknesses of the ice-rich layer is less than 1000 – 2000 m. This strongly suggests that the ice-rich region is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> vertical <b>extent</b> to a value of this order...|$|R
40|$|Coastal cliff erosion is a {{widespread}} problem that threatens property and infrastructure along many of the world’s coastlines. Rates of erosion used for shoreline management are generally based on analysis of historic maps and aerial photographs which, in rocky coast environments, does not wholly capture the detail in the processes and the failures occurring across the cliff face. This study uses airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to gain a quantitative understanding of cliff erosion along rocky coastline where recession rates are relatively low (c. 0. 1 m yr− 1). It was found that three-dimensional volumetric changes on the cliff face and linear rates of retreat can be reliably calculated from consecutive digital elevation models (DEMs) several years apart. Furthermore, {{the accuracy of the}} data on sloping surfaces was tested by applying a threshold below which data that could be construed as error were removed. Using a vertical change threshold of 0. 5 m had limited effect on the computed rates of retreat. The spatial variability in recession rates around the coastline was considered in terms of the relationship with the varying boundary conditions (rock mass characteristics, cliff geometries, beach morphology) and forcing parameters (wave climate and wave exposure). Recession rates were statistically correlated with significant wave height (Hs), rock mass characteristics (GSI) and the ratio between the two (GSI/Hs). The current method of assessing rocky cliff recession using maps and aerial photographs tends to not only miss the detail in the three-dimensional nature of the cliff evolution, but may also be too coarse a resolution to capture the small scale changes that contribute to the overall failure. LiDAR data, although <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> temporal <b>extent</b> due to it being a relatively new technology, is a suitable method of evaluating cliff erosion on a time scale of 3 – 4 years and provides additional insight into the process occurring in slowly eroding environments...|$|R

60|$|That {{the stock}} of the common people, in numbers, is not lessened, {{any more than the}} causes are impaired, is manifest, without being at the pains of an actual numeration. An {{improved}} and improving agriculture, which implies a great augmentation of labor, has not yet found itself at a stand, no, not for a single moment, for want of the necessary hands, either in the settled progress of husbandry or in the occasional pressure of harvests. I have even reason to believe {{that there has been a}} much smaller importation, or the demand of it, from a neighboring kingdom, than in former times, when agriculture was more <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent</b> and its means, and when the time was a season of profound peace. On the contrary, the prolific fertility of country life has poured its superfluity of population into the canals, and into other public works, which of late years have been undertaken to so amazing an extent, and which have not only not been discontinued, but, beyond all expectation, pushed on with redoubled vigor, in a war that calls for so many of our men and so much of our riches. An increasing capital calls for labor, and an increasing population answers to the call. Our manufactures, augmented both for the supply of foreign and domestic consumption, reproducing, with the means of life, the multitudes which they use and waste, (and which many of them devour much more surely and much more largely than the war,) have always found the laborious hand ready for the liberal pay. That the price of the soldier is highly raised is true. In part this rise may be owing to some measures not so well considered in the beginning of this war; but the grand cause has been the reluctance of that class of people from whom the soldiery is taken to enter into a military life,--not that, but, once entered into, it has its conveniences, and even its pleasures. I have seldom known a soldier who, at the intercession of his friends, and at their no small charge, had been redeemed from that discipline, that in a short time was not eager to return to it again. But the true reason is the abundant occupation and the augmented stipend found in towns and villages and farms, which leaves a smaller number of persons to be disposed of. The price of men for new and untried ways of life must bear a proportion to the profits of that mode of existence from whence they are to be bought.|$|E

Some organisms could survive bolide impacts thus allowing successful transport between planetary bodies.

Overall, there was less urbanization inside ZNIEFFs, but this varied depending on the context. Surprisingly, they were better preserved in areas of more intense urbanization. This effect was increased if farmland area was already reduced (< 30 % of the municipality area). In contrast, when farmland was still predominant and urbanization rates were lower, ZNIEFFs tended to be more urbanized than the areas outside.

40|$|Mechanisms {{that have}} been {{proposed}} to explain species coexistence among species of tropical rain forest trees include niche partitioning of the abiotic environment, {{the positive and negative}} effects of local neighbours on reproductive success, and the impact of stochastic events and neutral demographic processes.   These were investigated using 16 species of a common tree family (the Myristicaceae) on a large forest dynamics plot in Yasuní National Park in Western Amazonia using analytical methods that accounted for spatial autocorrelation in mortality, and habitat and individual stem distribution. Species groups were differentiated with respect to topography and light availability, but short-term demographic responses to topographic variation did not account for species’ distributions.   There was a negative relationship between established tree abundance and seedling survival across species, and individual seedling survival was strongly negatively influenced by the presence of conspecific and confamilial seedlings.   Spatial autocorrelation of mortality was strong at small spatial scales but <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent.</b>   There was spatiotemporal variation in both seedling recruitment and seed output.   Reproductive success was determined largely by the availability of resources, but estimates of local male density also limited fruit production. I conclude that species coexistence is promoted by both niche assembly and dispersal assembly mechanisms for my study taxa.   Niche differentiation permits functional groups of species to coexist.   Strong negative density dependent effects restrict the potential for individual species to exclude others, and variation in seed output, dispersal and recruitment allow many rare species to persist by limiting competitive interactions.

Different X-ray sources, detectors and filtering methods were investigated. Use of a low-energy detector {{as well as a}} Cu-filter decreased the potential for phase segmentation in X-ray CT images of an artificial sand-OM mixture. A mid-range X-ray detector showed to hold more potential. Results obtained for an artificial sand-OM sample showed that an attenuation coefficient (AC) grey-value histogram-based single threshold was unsuitable for automated phase segmentation. A dual thresholding approach enabled a better separation of the different phases. Secondly, the minimal measurable pore size class in a clay loam soil aggregate was compared using micro-focus and state-of-the-art nano-focus X-ray CT. The resolution of the scanned images depends on the spot size of the X-ray source, the resolution of the detector and the magnification used. Reliable discrimination of pore and solid phases was expected to be limited by the X-ray tube's focal spot size to 2. 5 mu m, in contrast to the voxel size of 0. 84 mu m actually obtained using nano-focus CT. Although this study was <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent,</b> indications were found that more fine porosity is visible at higher resolutions and that large connected pore spaces may be observed.

The uniqueness of this article is the histology of the periapical tissues that was taken during the re-surgery as (an appropriate) reference standard for the radiographic examinations. Records of patients after surgical endodontic treatment were screened, of which 108 patients (119 teeth) were recalled for clinical and radiographic examination (PR and CBCT). Seventy-four patients (83 teeth) were examined. Three observers assessed the periapical and CBCT radiographs, and re-surgery was offered to non-healed teeth. All 19 re-operated teeth that were included in the histological evaluation were assessed as non-healed in CBCT, while 11 of these were assessed as successfully healed in the PR. During re-surgery, biopsy was performed and histopathology verified whether or not periapical inflammation was present. Importantly, out of 19 biopsies, 42 % (8 teeth) were without periapical inflammation histologically, 16 % (3 teeth) had mild inflammation, and 42 % (8 teeth) had moderate to intense inflammation. A correct diagnosis was obtained in 58 % with CBCT (true positives) and 63 % with PR (true positives+true negatives). Based on these results, the authors (correctly) concluded that of the re-operated teeth, 42 % had no periapical inflammatory lesion, and therefore no benefit from re-surgery, and that not all lesions observed in CBCT represented true periapical inflammatory lesions (Kruse et al. 2017). Although <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent,</b> the results of this unique article provide an important insight into a significant missing link in the use of CBCT in endodontics.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of avian {{resources}} within the Scottish and wider North Atlantic Island environment via archaeological bone and eggshell. Birds can provide a range of products including meat, eggs and feathers, however their archaeological investigation has frequently been both overlooked, and <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent</b> and application. By collating pre-existing avian data and combining it with new, in-depth analyses this thesis investigates bird use though time and space; firstly in the Scottish Islands (the primary area of study), and then contextualises this within the wider tradition of fowling archaeologically and historically in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Mesolithic to Norse Scottish Island bird bone is used to develop our understanding of diet, wild resource exploitation, seasonal fowling activities, habitat use, and movement around the landscape. South Uist in the Outer Hebrides forms a major case study incorporating substantial primary bone analyses from Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age Cladh Hallan, Norse Bornais and Norse Cille Pheadair. The full Scottish Island dataset is used to consider trends in bird use by period and location. Species presence, juveniles, medullary bone and SEM analysis of eggshell are used to investigate resource acquisition by season and location. The material reveals that seabirds played an enduring role, with key birds such as the gannet, auks, shag, cormorant and gulls being repeatedly exploited. Fowling is focused and diverse, often incorporating targeted species and several opportunistically caught taxa. Birds were acquired both locally and in fowling trips further afield. Variations in avian populations are observed; determining the resources available to human fowlers and investigating the impact of such exploitation. Analysing, integrating and interpreting the archaeological bird remains on this wide temporal and geographical scale has enabled {{a greater understanding of}} past bird use and role within North Atlantic Island diet, economy and life...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections {{continues to grow}} in hospital-associated settings and, more recently, in community settings in the United States and globally. The increase {{in the incidence of}} infections due to S. aureus is partially a consequence of advances in patient care and also of the pathogen’s ability to adapt to a changing environment. Infection due to S. aureus imposes a high and increasing burden on health care resources. A growing concern is the emergence of MRSA infections in patients with no apparent risk factors. MRSA infection in community settings involves considerable morbidity and mortality, as does nosocomial MRSA infection. For community-associated MRSA, person-to-person trans-mission has been reported, and several factors have been shown to predict disease. We examine the trends in both nosocomial and community-associated MRSA infections and explore recent studies of the mechanisms that allow S. aureus to become resistant to currently available drugs. “Micrococcus, which, when <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent</b> and activity, causes acute suppurative inflammation (phlegmon), produces, when more extensive and in-tense in its action on the human system, the most vir-ulent forms of septicæmia and pyæmia… ” [1].

40|$|Bovine thyroid {{membranes}} possess both ADP ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase {{activities with}} the same Km values for NAD and the same pH optima. In intact membranes, the ADP ribosyltransferase is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent</b> {{by the amount of}} available membrane acceptor which can be ADP-ribosylated; in membranes solubilized with lithium diiodosalicylate, an artificial acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester, can be substituted to eliminate this limitation. The product of the ADP ribosyltransferase is a mono-ADP-ribosylated acceptor whether the intact or solubilized membrane provides the enzyme activity and whether membrane or exogenous acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester, is utilized. The intact membranes and the solubilized preparation also have an enzyme activity which can release AMP from the mono-ADP-ribosylated acceptor whether formed by the action of the membrane ADP ribosyltransferase or the A promoter of cholera toxin. The NAD glycohydrolase activity appears to represent the half-reaction of the ADP ribosyltransferase, i. e. an activity measurable substituting water for a membrane acceptor or L-arginine methyl ester. Membranes from functional rat thyroid cells in culture, i. e. cells chronically stimulated by thyrotropin and unresponsive to further additions of thyrotropin, have low ADP-ribosylation but high NAD glycohydrolase activities. In contrast, membranes from nonfunctional rat thyroid cells, i. e. cells unresponsive to thyrotropin, have high ADP-ribosylation and low NAD glycohydrolase activities. NAD hydrolysis by the NAD glycohydrolase activity cannot account for the low ADP-ribosylation activity in membranes from the functioning cells, and its low level of ADP-ribosylation can be eliminated by solubilizing the membranes and substituting an artificial acceptor, L-arginine methyl ester. The ADP ribosyltransferase activity of rat thyroid cell membrane preparations can be enhanced by thyrotropin in a dose-dependent manner but not by insulin, glucagon, hydrocortisone, adrenocorticotropin, or its glycoprotein hormone analog, human chorionic gonadotropin. It is thus suggested (i) that, in analogy to cholera toxin, thyrotropin-stimulated ADP-ribosylation may be important in the regulation of the adenylate cyclase response and (ii) that the level of membrane acceptor available for ADP-ribosylation may relate both to a stable "'activated" state of the adenylate cyclase system in cells chronically stimulated with thyrotropin and/or to a desensitized state with regard to a failure of more thyrotropin to elicit additional functional responses...|$|E
40|$|The Ariki Formation is a {{distinctive}} Late Miocene – Early Pliocene marl facies rich in planktic foraminifera, reaching thicknesses {{in the range}} 70 - 109 m in most exploration holes drilled into the Western Platform northwest of Taranaki Peninsula. In Awatea- 1 and Mangaa- 1 in the Northern Graben, however, there are two marl units separated by the Mangaa “B” Sands. The lower unit has the same upper Tongaporutuan and Kapitean age as {{the lower part of}} the marl on the Western Platform, and the upper marl has an Upper Opoitian - Waipipian age, similar to the upper part of the Ariki Formation on the platform. In other holes located on the margins of the graben there can be one thin marly horizon, which usually correlates with the upper marl unit in Awatea- 1 and Mangaa- 1. The presence of two marly units in the Northern Graben, which are probably amalgamated on the western Platform, suggests two periods of late Neogene condensed sedimentation in northern Taranaki Basin arising from siliciclastic sediment starvation, separated by a period of submarine fan accumulation (Mangaa ‘B’ sands) following subsidence of the Northern Graben. We attribute the initial interval of marl accumulation mainly to a marked landward shift in the position of coastal onlap in central and southern Taranaki and in the region east of the Taranaki Fault Zone (southern King Country and northern Wanganui regions), which effectively shut-off the supply of siliciclastic sediment to northern Taranaki Basin, thereby enabling marl to accumulate. The start of accumulation of the upper part of the Ariki Formation and its marly correlatives in and around the Northern Graben, is attributed to a younger (upper Opoitian) landward shift in the position of coastal onlap, this time involving the formation of the Wanganui Basin depocentre and Toru Trough, which trapped the contemporary siliciclastic sediment being supplied from the south. A lower Opoitian phase of progradation between these two phases of retrogradation led to accumulation of {{the lower part of the}} Mangaa Formation (Mangaa ’B’ sands), which was <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>extent</b> to the Northern Graben because bounding normal faults had by then developed sea floor relief precluding mass-emplaced siliciclastic sediment from being deposited on the higher standing Western Platform.
