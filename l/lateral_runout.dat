It is typically measured about [...] from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around [...] Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (<b>lateral</b> <b>runout)</b> requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E
50|$|Contact Stylus {{technology}} utilizes a touch-probe to {{ride along}} the tire surface as it rotates. Analog instrumentation senses {{the movement of}} the probe, and records the run-out waveform. When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure <b>lateral</b> <b>runout</b> on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning sidewall bulges and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall.|$|E
50|$|Run-out is {{measured}} using {{a dial indicator}} on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc's face. It is typically measured about 1/2 in from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around 0.002 in. Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining {{the root cause of}} the indicator displacement (<b>lateral</b> <b>runout)</b> requires disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.|$|E
40|$|Full-depth snow {{avalanches}} as a {{geomorphic process}} are investigated in this study, {{which is part}} of the SEDAG (SEDiment cascades in Alpine Geosystems) research project. First results concerning the sediment yield of these events were presented in an earlier paper (HECKMANN ET AL. 2002). Here, they are supplemented with new data and a description of certain models constituting our modelling approach. A disposition model (certainty factor model) is used to determine potential avalanche starting zones, while a process model delineates the potential process area (<b>lateral</b> spread and <b>runout</b> length) along with modelling flow parameters (e. g. velocity). First steps towards spatial modelling of the geomorphic activity of snow avalanches, i. e. erosion and deposition of soil and debris, are presented on the basis of empirical correlation with flow parameters...|$|R
50|$|The {{tire tread}} and {{sidewall}} elements undergo deformation and recovery {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, <b>lateral</b> <b>runout,</b> and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.|$|E
40|$|Seismic data {{recorded}} on Iliamna Volcano, Alaska, indicate that Iliamna ice avalanches are preceded {{by up to}} several hours of precursory seismicity. This precursory activity is represented by a 1 - 3 hour period of activity comprising a sequence of discrete repeating earthquakes and a period of continuous groundshaking that builds in amplitude. The avalanche itself is represented by a broadband (1 - 20 Hz), spindle-shaped signal that may be composed of several pulses of activity. The precursory earthquakes are similar in time series, indicating that they share a common source region and mechanism, and {{become more and more}} frequent until they blend into the continuous signal. These events are interpreted as slip along the base of an ice layer. The continuous groundshaking is believed to represent the failure of small slip zones beneath the ice slab. Slip becomes larger as the event progresses, until the slab fails in a catastrophic avalanche. Estimates of <b>lateral</b> <b>runout</b> distance and signal duration yield velocities consistent with avalanche velocities recorded elsewhere. The fact that these events exhibit precursory seismicity while other debris avalanches and rockfalls, including one that occurred on Iliamna in May 2005, do not may result {{from the fact that the}} initial failure took place in ice. The prolonged duration of the precursory phase suggests that some warning may be possible for similar events in the future...|$|E
