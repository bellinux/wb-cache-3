40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 19) In {{the construction}} of structural steel buildings, a commonly used technique for fastening parts together is the "friction type connection". This connection functions by maintaining a constant frictional force between connected parts, sufficient to transmit design loads. Connections of this type require consistent bolt tension when erected to control this frictional force. Since consistent bolt tension is important, Coronet <b>Load</b> Indicator <b>washers</b> are sometimes used to control tension tolerances. It is also necessary that bolt holes are aligned {{in the field for}} placement of the bolts, but often times the holes are not aligned properly. To reduce the effects misalignment has on bolt holes during construction, it is helpful to use oversized holes. The effects of oversized holes on the Coronet <b>Load</b> Indicator <b>washer</b> are extremely important in their uses. It is found that on regular and oversized holes, the slip loads were larger than the minimums allowed by building code. In certain instances additional washers were required to prevent the <b>load</b> indicator <b>washer</b> from deforming into the oversized hole...|$|R

40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to clamped parts. There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring clamping force involved the use of <b>load</b> <b>washers</b> or miniature <b>load</b> cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated spring clamps have also been used. <b>Load</b> <b>washers</b> and miniature <b>load</b> cells constitute additional clamped parts in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. Spring clamps can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing the clamping force and the circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all housed on the clamp. In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package. The advantage of unitary packaging of such a system is that it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease...|$|R

50|$|Front-loading washers are {{mechanically}} simple {{compared to}} top-loaders, {{with the main}} motor (a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large pulley wheel, {{without the need for}} a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top <b>loading</b> <b>washer</b> keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.|$|R

In each cutting condition, the thrust and cutting forces increased linearly with increasing cross sectional area of groove. Forces with diamond grains were greater in almost cases than the cutting with CBN grains, and much influenced by cutting condition. On the other hand, no significant influence except for rake angle was seen in forces in cutting with CBN grain. Furthermore, the friction angles under each cutting condition was calculated to detect the deformation condition in front of rake face at chip formation. It changed largely with grain type, rake angle and cutting speed. There was a quite difference between diamond and CBN grains. The reason for the difference would be the difference in coefficient of friction of two grain types...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{two main}} types of washing {{machines}} {{exist in the}} market.

The aim of this work is to present the design of a detachable opening system for front-load washing machines.

40|$|A {{novel and}} precise {{characterization}} of the constitutive behavior of solid and laminated research-grade, polycrystalline Galfenol (Fe 81 : 6 Ga 18 : 4) under under quasi-static (1 Hz) and dynamic (4 to 1000 Hz) stress loadings was recently conducted by the authors. This paper summarizes the characterization {{by focusing on the}} experimental design and the dynamic sensing response of the solid Galfenol specimen. Mechanical loads are applied using a high frequency load frame. The dynamic stress amplitude for minor and major loops is 2. 88 and 31. 4 MPa, respectively. Dynamic minor and major loops are measured for the bias condition resulting in maximum, quasi-static sensitivity. Three key sources of error in the dynamic measurements are accounted for: (1) electromagnetic noise in strain signals due to Galfenol's magnetic response, (2) error in load signals due to the inertial force of fixturing, and (3) time delays imposed by conditioning electronics. For dynamic characterization, strain error is kept below 1. 2 % of full scale by wiring two collocated gauges in series (noise cancellation) and through lead wire weaving. Inertial force error is kept below 0. 41 % by measuring the dynamic force in the specimen using a nearly collocated piezoelectric <b>load</b> <b>washer.</b> The phase response of all conditioning electronics is explicitly measured and corrected for. In general, as frequency increases, the sensing response becomes more linear due to an increase in eddy currents. The location of positive and negative saturation is the same at all frequencies. As frequency increases above about 100 Hz, the elbow in the strain versus stress response disappears as the active (soft) regime stiffens toward the passive (hard) regime...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} different techniques to tighten a bolted joint and investigates {{the ability of the}} methods to tighten the joint to a prescribed bolt tension. A literature survey was undertaken which revealed that different opinions exist regarding the performance of certain tightening methods and the influence of several commonly encountered factors on them. Test equipment was designed and built to study the performance of five tightening methods: torque control, angle control - elastic range, angle control - yield range, yield control, and <b>load</b> indicating <b>washers.</b> The effects of a number of practical factors on the performance of these methods were investigated. The main factors investigated were: joint stiffness, nut and bolt plating and geometry, and washer type. The tests have shown that yield controlled tightening and angle control (yield range) provide the most accurate methods of tightening a bolted joint to a prescribed bolt tension (+/- 5 %). Torque control and <b>load</b> indicating <b>washers</b> (Coronet) can tighten the joint to +/- 10 %. Angle control (elastic range) gives relatively poor control over bolt tension (+/- 14 %), largely due to variations in snug position and tension-angle gradient. The deflections of the joint components influence the performance of the angle-related tightening methods. The deflection of the threaded connection itself is significant, especially for 'hard' joints. This contribution to the overall deflection has been largely neglected in previous studies. Methods to improve the accuracy of the tightening methods are discussed. In particular the use of hardened washers to improve the accuracy and repeatability of torque control is recommended. Furthermore, preliminary tests were conducted on the design of a washer, which would indicate when the joint has been tightened to a prescribed tension...|$|R
5000|$|Bendix Home Appliances, a {{subsidiary}} of Avco, an otherwise unrelated company, who licensed the name from Bendix Corporation, introduced the first domestic automatic washing machine in 1937, having applied for a patent in the same year. In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front <b>loading</b> automatic <b>washers</b> produced today. Although it included many of the today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent [...] "walking". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.|$|R
40|$|There is no {{established}} {{method of}} measuring load accurately in a threaded connection at working temperatures exceeding 500 °C. At these conditions conventional methods {{can not be}} used due to the sensitivity of the instruments and it is suggested that a non contact method should be used. The laser strain gauge was developed by the Loughborough University Optical Research Group and it is a non contact way of measuring surface strain. With the help of finite element analysis (FEA) a special nut was developed {{that can be used to}} measure the load on the connection by relating the surface strain of the nut to the load. Experimental work later revealed that due to the threads sticking in the connection there is hysteresis present between the load and surface strain relationship. To eliminate the hysteresis a new part was added to the connection which could be used to relate the surface strain on it to the load without any hysteresis. This new part was a specially designed washer with three grooves to allow easy access for the user to measure the surface strain using the laser strain gauge. Part of the design specification was that the load has to be determined to an accuracy of 0. 5 %. Using sensitivity analysis the washer was analysed in terms of how manufacturing imperfections affect the accuracy of the load measuring device. The results revealed that to achieve the required 0. 5 % accuracy the washer would have to be manufactured to very tight tolerances. To achieve these tight tolerances the manufacturing process would not be cost effective so it was proposed that individual calibration is required for each <b>load</b> measuring <b>washer.</b> Tests showed that with sufficient calibration the specially designed washer and the laser strain gauge can be combined and used as an accurate non contact load measuring device. As it is a non contact method it can be used in extreme environments including high temperatures. This thesis describes how background research, finite element analysis and experimental testing were used to develop the <b>load</b> measuring <b>washer.</b> Also it is shown, how in-depth sensitivity analysis was used to determine the accuracy of the prototype and that how manufacturing imperfections influence the working life of a threaded connection.

40|$|Galfenol has the {{potential}} to transform the smart materials industry by allowing for the development of multifunctional, load-bearing devices. One of the primary technical challenges faced by this development is the very limited experimental data on Galfenol's frequency-dependent response to dynamic stress, which is critically important for the design of such devices. This report details a novel and precise characterization of the constitutive behavior of polycrystalline Galfenol (Fe 81. 6 Ga 18. 4) under quasi-static (1 Hz) and dynamic (4 to 1000 Hz) stress loadings. Mechanical loads are applied using a high-frequency load frame. Quasi-static minor and major hysteresis loop measurements of magnetic flux density and strain are presented for constant electromagnet currents (0 to 1. 1 A) and constant magnetic fields 0 to 14 kA/m (0 to 180 Oe). The dynamic stress amplitude for minor and major loops is 2. 88 and 31. 4 MPa (418 and 4550 psi), respectively. Quasi-static material properties closely match published values for similar Galfenol materials. Quasi-static actuation responses are also measured and compared to quasi-static sensing responses; the high degree of reversibility seen in the comparison is consistent with published measurements and modeling results. Dynamic major and minor loops are measured for dynamic stresses up to 31 MPa (4496 psi) and 1 kHz, and the bias condition resulting in maximum, quasi-static sensitivity. Eddy current effects are quantified by considering solid and laminated Galfenol rods. Three key sources of error in the dynamic measurements are accounted for: (1) electromagnetic noise in strain signals due to Galfenol's magnetic response, (2) error in load signals due to the inertial force of fixturing, and (3) phase misalignment between signals due to conditioning electronics. For dynamic characterization, strain error is kept below 1. 2 percent of full scale by wiring two collocated gauges in series (noise cancellation) and through leadwire weaving. Inertial force error is kept below 0. 41 percent by measuring the dynamic force in the specimen using a nearly collocated piezoelectric <b>load</b> <b>washer.</b> The phase response of all conditioning electronics is explicitly measured and corrected for. In general, as frequency is increased, the sensing response becomes more linear because of an increase in eddy currents. As frequency increases above approximately 100 Hz, the elbow in the strain-versus-stress response disappears as the active (soft) regime stiffens toward the passive (hard) regime. Under constant-field conditions, the loss factors of the solid rod peak between 200 and 600 Hz, rather than exhibiting a monotonic increase. Compared to the solid rod, the laminated rod exhibits much slower increases in hysteresis with frequency, and its quasi-static behavior extends to higher frequencies. The elastic modulus of the laminated rod decreases between 100 and 300 Hz; this trend is currently unexplained...|$|R

40|$|This study sheds {{considerable}} {{light on}} the potential of superelastic shape memory alloy Belleville washers for innovative seismic resisting applications. A series of experimental studies were conducted on washers with different stack combinations under varying temperatures and <b>loading</b> scenarios. The <b>washers</b> showed satisfactory self-centring and energy dissipation capacities at room temperature, although slight degradations of the hysteretic responses accompanied by residual deformations were induced. The hysteretic loops became stable after a few number of cycles, indicating good repeatability. The washers also showed good flexibility in terms of load resistance and deformation, which could be easily varied via changes in the stack combination. Compromised self-centring responses were observed at temperatures below 0 °C or above 40 °C, and a numerical study, validated by the experimental results, was adopted to further investigate the deformation mechanism of the washers. A further phenomenological model, taking account of the degradation effects under varied temperatures, was developed to enable effective and accurate simulation of devices incorporating the washers. Good agreements were observed between the test and simulation results, and the model was shown to have good numerical robustness for wide engineering applications...|$|R

Then we apply the obtained $ 2 D$ inequalities to prove similar inequalities for washers with thickness $h$ subject to vanishing Dirichlet boundary conditions on {{the inner and outer}} thin faces of the washer. A washer can be regarded in two ways: As the limit case of a conical shell when the slope goes to zero, or as a very short hollow cylinder. While the optimal Korn constant in the first Korn inequality for a conical shell with thickness $h$ and with a positive slope scales like $h^{ 1. 5 }$ e. g.

The results showed that the specimens washed in the HE washer had better fabric hand and were smoother (fewer wrinkles) than those washed in the conventional washer. Conventional and HE washers performed similarly in color change, dimensional change, and skewness change. In regard to dryer, all results except those for stain removal showed no significant differences between the specimens dried in the conventional dryer and those dried in the HE dryer. In stain removal, when a softener was not used, the conventional dryer removed more stains from the specimens than the HE dryer. However, when a softener was used, the stains on the specimens dried in the conventional dryer were more difficult to remove than those on the specimens dried in the HE dryer.|$|R
