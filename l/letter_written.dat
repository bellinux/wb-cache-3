5|$|A <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> {{by former}} New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero in 1940 appears to {{indicate}} that Earp had strong feelings for Josephine in April 1882. After leaving Tombstone following the Earp Vendetta Ride, the Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for two weeks. While there, Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa was Jewish.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not {{tell anyone about}} the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E
5|$|Due to the stuffy {{atmosphere}} and vapors {{in the dark}} and cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym runs out of water.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the {{importance}} of <b>letter</b> <b>writing</b> in Austen s novels. I focus on the following aspects: how the British postal services worked, the letters significance in people s social lives, and the 'rules' and conventions of the art of <b>letter</b> <b>writing.</b> After a historical account of the above-mentioned factors, I will use this background in a literary analysis where I {{take a closer look at}} how <b>letter</b> <b>writing</b> influences the plots in the novels; how it is used in character description, and how correspondence effects the characters social lives. Finally, I analyse four different letters to see how they reflect the <b>letter</b> <b>writing</b> 'rules' of the time. A considerable part of the thesis will focus on gender roles related to <b>letter</b> <b>writing</b> both historically and in Austen s novels...|$|R
50|$|The novel has a {{parallel}} narrative that eventually converges {{with the main}} story. This narrative is portrayed {{through a series of}} <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by Oskar's grandfather to Oskar's father Thomas, and by Oskar's grandmother to Oskar himself. The <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by Oskar's grandfather explain his past in World War II, his first love, and his marriage to Oskar's grandmother. The <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by Oskar's grandmother explain her past in meeting Oskar's grandfather, the trouble in their relationship, and how important Oskar is to her.|$|R
50|$|The extant {{works of}} Conrad Grebel consist of 69 <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by him from September 1517 to July 1525, three poems, a {{petition}} to the Zürich council, and portions of a pamphlet written by him against infant baptism, as quoted by Zwingli in his counterarguments. Three <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> to Grebel (Benedikt Burgauer, 1523; Vadian, 1524; and Erhard Hegenwalt, 1525) have been preserved. The majority of the 69 <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by Grebel are from his student years, however, and shed little light on his ministry as an Anabaptist.|$|R
5|$|In fear of {{a crusade}} by Emeric, Ban Kulin of Bosnia held a synod of the Church of Bosnia at Bilino Polje on 6 April 1203. The synod {{acknowledged}} papal primacy and ordered the reform of the rites. Kulin also acknowledged Emeric's suzerainty. In a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E
5|$|Ja'far {{began his}} {{campaign}} in 877 by raiding the Byzantine territories {{in the east}} of the island and occupying some outlying forts around Syracuse. The siege of the city began in August, with the Arabs blockading it by sea and land. The events of the siege are described in some detail by the eyewitness Theodosios the Monk, who included an account of it in a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> during his subsequent captivity.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{predicted}} {{in a famous}} <b>letter,</b> <b>written</b> to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.

50|$|<b>Letters</b> <b>Written</b> in France is {{a series}} of <b>letters</b> <b>written</b> by English writer Helen Maria Williams, first {{published}} in 1790. The considerably longer title under which it was originally published is <b>Letters</b> <b>written</b> in France: in the summer 1790, to a friend in England: containing various anecdotes relative to the French revolution; and memoirs of Mons. and Madame du F---- (Fossé). The twenty-six letters cover Williams' visits to various locations associated with the Revolution, a true history of the du Fossé family and her own personal views alongside sociological observations.|$|R

5|$|Some critics, however, responded {{favorably to}} Eureka. French writer Paul Valéry praised it for both its poetic and {{scientific}} merit, calling it an abstract poem based on mathematical foundations. Albert Einstein in a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> in 1934, noted that Eureka was eine schöne Leistung eines ungewöhnlich selbständigen Geistes (a beautiful achievement of an unusually independent mind).|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} deadlocked {{among the}} three main candidates, with Virginia's votes going to Clay. Many Northern Whigs opposed Clay, and some, including Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, showed the Virginians a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> by Scott in which he apparently displayed abolitionist sentiments. The influential Virginia delegation then announced that Harrison was its second choice, causing most Scott supporters to abandon him in favor of Harrison, who gained the presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} advertised to the American churchgoer {{as a moral}} picture. The film was {{generally}} well received by critics, but the faults of story {{for the sake of}} a moral lesson was noted. Adrift, like all other American silents of the day, had no musical accompaniment, but a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> into a trade publication provides a score for the drama. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate in Finland {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm.

The letter is the oldest surviving <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> in Finland.|$|E
5|$|Together with Mellitus, the Bishop of London, Justus {{signed a}} <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops urging the native church {{to adopt the}} Roman method of calculating the date of Easter.

Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period of exile at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare glimpse {{into the life of}} a ruler who is otherwise shrouded in obscurity.|$|E

5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The <b>letter,</b> <b>written</b> in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Rhoads was {{selected}} as director of Memorial Hospital, which was devoted to cancer care and research, and had recently {{moved into a new}} building. Rhoads {{was selected}} for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to laboratory research, as the hospital did research as well as treatment. He succeeded James Ewing, a noted oncologist. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> in November of that year. In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of accuracy, Heyer once purchased a <b>letter</b> <b>written</b> by the Duke of Wellington {{so that she could}} precisely employ his style of writing. She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken or written by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E
