50|$|According to Der Spiegel, ODS paid €6.8 {{million for}} {{exclusive}} licenses to Hollywood's film studios. Another €10.4 million were spent for a lawsuit on licenses. In this lawsuit ODS defended its position against a <b>license</b> <b>pool</b> that granted what ODS deemed unfair commercial advantage to certain competitors of ODS {{in respect to}} license dues. Internally held shares in the company were allegedly sold so as to further produce assets, an operation deemed worth €23 million but no wrongdoing has ever been proven. In October 2007 the company filed for insolvency and on 29 February 2008 the Dassow plant finally stopped its production. The former management under Wilhelm Friedrich Mittrich is since being investigated by authorities for tax and subsidiary fraud and for professional patent violations but to date no proof has been forthcoming. In August 2010 the public prosecutor's office at Schwerin charged the three former managers of ODS with fraud {{in the order of}} millions. This has been one of many so far unsuccessful attempts to build such a case.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{unequivocally}} established a consistent association between osteoporotic hip fracture risk and {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus. One reason this association still remains unclear is primarily due to the limited amount of research conducted in this area. The Utah Study of Nutrition and Bone Health (USNBH) is a case-control study conducted in Utah {{during the period of}} 1997 - 2001 to determine risk factors for osteoporotic hip fracture. All study participants (n = 2590) were determined from Utah residents 50 - 90 years of age. Cases were determined from 18 Utah hospitals during 1997 - 2001. Age and gender-matched controls were randomly selected from the Utah Drivers <b>License</b> <b>pool</b> if less than 65 years of age and the Medicare databases if greater than 65 years of age. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between type 2 diabetes and hip fracture risk. Logistic regression modeling controlled for gender, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, education level, and estrogen use in women. The risk of hip fracture was associated with type 2 diabetes. The significant correlation was primarily found in females in which the risk of hip fracture increased accompanying diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Estrogen usage in females decreased (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) hip fracture risk in both former or current users. Physical activity significantly decreased the risk of hip fracture for females (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and for males (p = 0. 001). Smoking and alcohol use may increase the risk of hip fracture, especially in women. This study substantiates the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hip fracture...|$|E

5000|$|Plaintiffs' {{suit was}} based upon the theory that [...] "networks {{conforming}} with IEEE standard also conformed to the patent in suit". Stated simply, plaintiffs attempted to prove infringement by Netgear's products by showing that those products that practice WiFi standard and WMM Specification necessarily infringe three patents in suit. The district court {{pointed out that the}} central issue here is whether mere implementation of WiFi standard by Netgear's products made Netgear automatically liable for infringement of patents placed in the <b>licensing</b> <b>pool</b> related to the 801.11 standard and related Specification.|$|R
5000|$|Second, the {{district}} court decided that Netgear did {{not contribute to the}} infringement.

40|$|International audienceSepsis is a {{major cause}} for death worldwide. Numerous interventional trials with agents {{neutralizing}} single pro-inflammatory mediators have failed to improve survival in sepsis and aseptic systemic inflammatory response syndromes. This failure could well {{be explained by the}} widespread gene expression dysregulation known as "genomic storm" in these patients. A multifunctional polyspecific therapeutic agent might be needed to thwart the effects of this "storm". <b>Licensed</b> <b>pooled</b> intravenous immunoglobulin preparations seemed to be a promising candidate but they have also failed in their present form to prevent sepsis-related death. We report here the protective effect of a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations with additionally enhanced polyspecificity in three models of sepsis and aseptic systemic inflammation. The modification of the pooled immunoglobulin G molecules by exposure to ferrous ions resulted in their newly acquired ability to bind some pro-inflammatory molecules, complement components and endogenous "danger" signals. The improved survival in endotoxemia was associated with serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, diminished complement consumption and normalization of the coagulation time. We suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin preparations with additionally enhanced polyspecificity have a clinical potential in sepsis and related systemic inflammatory syndromes...|$|R

A key distinction made by regulators – between patents essential to a standard and patents with substitutes – has not been addressed in the theoretical literature.

This paper investigates how the presence of vertically integrated firms affects the economic impact of a patent pool. Without a patent pool, the presence of integrated firms may either increase or decrease the final product price as there are two countervailing effects – reduced double marginalization and raising rivals’ costs. However, when there is a patent pool, vertical integration always lowers the final product price. In conclusion, the economic efficiency arguments for patent pools are enhanced when some firms are vertically integrated.

40|$|ACIPA {{welcomes the}} {{opportunity}} to make a submission to the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property issues paper, "Patents And Experimental Use". It is concerned that there is great uncertainty whether researchers can rely upon a defence for experimental use. ACIPA recommends that the Commonwealth should amend the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) to establish a new defence to a claim of patent infringement based on the use of a patented invention to study or experiment on {{the subject matter of the}} invention; for example, to investigate its properties or improve upon it. The legislation should make it clear that the existence of a commercial purpose or intention does not affect the availability of the defence. ACIPA believes that such a research exemption is in keeping with our international obligations. Indeed, it is of the opinion that a defence for experimental use is compatible both with the TRIPS Agreement of the World Trade Organization and the recently concluded United States- Australia Free Trade Agreement. ACIPA maintains that a defence for experimental use is a unique policy reform - because it would enable researchers to use a patented invention without either seeking permission from the patent owner or paying royalties. It can be distinguished by these characteristics from a number of other policy options. Thus, <b>licensing,</b> patent <b>pools,</b> and open source licensing depend very much up the patent holder providing permission for an invention to be shared in that way. Furthermore, compulsory licensing can compel a patent holder to give access to patented inventions - but the user is still obliged to pay royalties. Nonetheless, ACIPA observes that a defence for experimental use can be supplemented by additional reforms to patent law. The threshold patent criteria of novelty and inventive step could be tightened, in line with the dissenting judgment of Justice Kirby in Aktiebolaget Hassle v Alphapharm Pty Limited. 4 The compulsory licensing provisions in the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) need to be modernised to reflect contemporary concerns about competition policy. There should be greater use of creative <b>licensing,</b> patent <b>pooling,</b> and open source licensing to share patented technology. However, none of such reforms could be considered to be a substitute for the recognition of a defence of experimental use...|$|R
