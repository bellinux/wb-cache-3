5|$|On 17 February 2012, Henry {{returned}} to Red Bulls {{to prepare for}} the 2012 season. His base salary of $5million ($5.6million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in the MLS—surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35million compared to Keane's $4.33million.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 {{season was}} Rodriguez' <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Rangers. He led the American League in home runs, runs scored, and {{slugging}} percentage, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He also {{led the league}} in fewest at-bats per home run (12.9) and became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with Jim Thome for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.|$|E

As the third seed, the Pacers were {{eliminated}} {{in the first round of}} the playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Celtics. With blossoming talents such as Jermaine O'Neal, Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley, along with the veteran leadership of Reggie Miller, the perception existed that the Pacers' unfulfilled potential stemmed from Thomas' inexperience as a coach. In the offseason, Larry Bird returned to the Pacers as President of Basketball Operations, and his first act was to replace Thomas with Rick Carlisle.|$|E

25|$|Another {{championship}} game appearance and {{loss to the}} Lions followed in 1953, when Gibron was again named to the Pro Bowl and was selected to one sportswriter's first-team All-Pro list. The Browns came back in 1954 and 1955 to win championships against the Lions and Rams. Gibron {{was named to the}} Pro Bowl both of those years and was a first-team All-Pro in 1955. Gibron played part of the 1956 season for the Browns, but he suffered a leg injury and was cut in November to make room on the roster for rookie Don Goss. The Philadelphia Eagles signed him two weeks later to replace Norm Willey, who was out with a broken leg. The Eagles finished with losing records in both 1956 and 1957, Gibron's <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres {{and the number of}} cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both rev and air-intake limiters to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> V10 engines.|$|E
25|$|While Cochrane {{was honored}} in 2000, the {{ceremony}} honoring Cochrane and Kell {{did not include}} the retirement of Cochrane's number 3; the number 3 has not been retired for Dick McAuliffe or Alan Trammell either, although number 3 has only been issued three times since Trammell retired as a player after the 1996 season: to Trammell himself when he managed the Tigers from 2003 to 2005, Gary Sheffield (after Trammell approved of it from 2007 until he was released prior to the 2009 seasons). Sheffield had previously worn the numbers 1, 5, 10, and 11. Presently the number is being worn by Ian Kinsler, who was acquired after the 2013 season in a trade with the Texas Rangers for Prince Fielder. Similarly, the number 1 was last worn by Lou Whitaker in 1995, the year Whitaker retired as a player. It was not reissued again until 2013, when mid-season acquisition José Iglesias requested it. The number 47, last worn by Jack Morris, has also not been retired, but has not been issued since 1990, Morris' <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tigers.|$|E

500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late <b>last</b> <b>year</b> , <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E

500|$|The Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. Taylor's absence, combined with a difficult early season schedule had them alternating wins and losses through their first six games. However, with Taylor back and playing well {{they were able to}} take full advantage of their remaining easier games (due to their last–place schedule from the year before), winning their next four games against the Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons, and the Detroit Lions twice. After two straight losses, including a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, they won their next three contests to set up a win-or-go-home game against the New York Jets in the season finale. The Jets game was technically a [...] "road" [...] game, and though the Jets were playing for little other than pride and a winning season, they defeated the Giants 27–21. In the game quarterback Ken O'Brien found Al Toon in the corner of the endzone in the final minute to give the Jets a victory. When the 49ers got blown out by the Rams 38–16 in the night game, the Giants were left outside of the postseason despite going 10–6. Season highlights included Joe Morris, in what would be his <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Giants, rushing for 1,083yards, and the emergence of wide receiver Lionel Manuel, who led the team with 65 catches and 1,029yards receiving.|$|E
