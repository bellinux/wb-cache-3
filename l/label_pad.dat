40|$|The protein {{arginine}} deiminases (PADs), which catalyze the hydrolysis of peptidyl-arginine to form peptidyl-citrulline, {{are potential}} {{targets for the}} development of a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapeutic, as well as other human diseases including colitis and cancer. Additionally, these enzymes, and in particular PAD 4, appear to play important roles in a variety of cell signaling pathways including apoptosis, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. To better understand the factors that regulate in vivo PAD 4 activity, we set out to design and synthesize a series of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) reagents that target this enzyme. Herein we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of six ABPPs including (i) FITC-conjugated F-amidine (FFA 1 and 2) and Cl-amidine (FCA 1 and 2), and (ii) biotin-conjugated F-amidine (BFA) and Cl-amidine (BCA). We further demonstrate the utility of these probes for <b>labeling</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 in cells, as well as for isolating PAD 4 and PAD 4 binding proteins. These probes will undoubtedly prove to be powerful tools that can be used to dissect the factors controlling the dynamics of PAD 4 expression, activity, and function...|$|R
