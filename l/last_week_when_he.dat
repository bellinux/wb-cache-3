Ru studied at the universities of Groningen and Leiden. He got his Ph. D. in Leiden in 1950 on the thesis “A Revision of the Genus Dillenia”. His promotor was Prof. Dr. H. J. Lam. He started his career as a botanist {{in the service of the}} Flora Malesiana Foundation (1949 — 1952). Being a field man rather than a herbarium taxonomist he went to Australia where he finally became a Principal Research Scientist to CSIRO, Division of Land Research and Regional Survey at Canberra and head of the Herbarium, in 1968 Senior Research Fellow in the Research School of Biological Sciences, also at Canberra. In 1976 he stepped over to the Australian National University. He retired late 1979, but as a matter of fact he went on with his work. In 1981 he moved to Leiden with the intention to work for the Flora Malesiana. Due to a difference of opinion with the Dutch tax office, in 1984 he moved to La Varenne St. Hilaire, not far from Paris, where at the Laboratoire de Phanérogamie he got the opportunity to continue his work...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Warthin tumor is {{described}} as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum and {{is the second most}} common tumor of the parotid glands. Bilateral synchronous incidence is rare, occurring in 7 to 10 % of the cases. It is more common in males between 60 and 70 years of age and is closely related to smoking. There is slow growth and the condition is a delimited nodule of regular outlines; it has low rates of malignant progression and recurrence. Objective Report a case of synchronous bilateral Warthin tumor occurring in an elderly patient, and review incidence and peculiarities of this tumor. Case Report A 78 -year-old man who used to smoke had a history of mild pain in the topography of right parotid three weeks ago. Patient with hypertension, diabetes and a longtime smoker (smoking a pack per day for 32 years) noticed a progressive bulging in the right parotid region for about 2. 5 years ago, and noticed another progressive bulging (althought in the left parotid region), for about one year ago. Patient denied fever, redness, skin lesions and pain during this period until <b>last</b> three <b>weeks,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sought medical attention for a mild pain in the right facial region. The patient underwent cervical magnetic resonance imaging that showed tumor lesions in both parotids. Fine needle aspiration revealed a typical lesion of epithelial oxyphilic cells associated with reactive lymphoid proliferation, suggesting Warthin tumor. The patient underwent two superficial parotidectomies, and the histopathologic result from both tumors of parotid glands showed papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. Conclusion The occurrence of synchronous bilateral Warthin tumor is extremely rare, and anamnesis and physical examination, as well as some complementary examinations, are important means for diagnostic evaluation. Confirmation of the diagnosis can only be obtained through a histopathologic study. A superficial or total parotidectomy is the recommended treatment for the disease...|$|R

The Rudd manual has been in operation since day one of this government and is exactingly enforced on all members. It decrees that ministers, when speaking in public, and particularly when answering a question, shall only employ generalities and clichés.

40|$|The West Australian {{election}} {{is likely to}} be a close-fought affair, according to Peter van Onselen THE West Australian election called for 26 February will be an interesting electoral test for the post-Latham Labor Party. It will be particularly interesting given that the new leader of federal Labor is WA’s own Kim Beazley. It should have come as no surprise to anyone that without the affable Beazley at the helm federal Labor lost two seats in the west at the last federal election, nearly losing two more. Meanwhile the Liberals held on to their marginal seats of Canning and Kalgoorlie. WA premier Geoff Gallop couldn’t keep the smile off his face when interviewed for the local 6 pm news following Latham’s resignation and Beazley’s announcement he was running for the leadership. WA attorney general Jim McGinty was the first senior Labor figure to publicly call for Latham to resign. Gallop called the election shortly after he did. Kim Beazley has indicated he will play his part in Gallop’s re-election bid. However he wasn’t doing the premier any favours <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> announced he will be setting up a home base in Sydney to cut down on air travel. West Australians are parochial at the best of times. Gallop would have preferred Beazley kept his decision to spend more time over east private until after polling day. Last Wednesday night, the premier and opposition leader Colin Barnett squared off in the only leaders’ debate of the campaign. A leaders’ debate can be a valuable forum for an opposition leader, giving him an equal footing with the premier. Barnett used the stage to introduce his plan to build a canal from the Kimberley region in the north of the state to service water shortages in the state’s south-east. The ambitious project is a risky move for Barnett. As yet he has not given any details on how it would be funded, or exactly how much it will cost. The unsightly canal will also have to trail through a number of electorates to reach its destination. The federal treasurer, Peter Costello, appeared to distance himself from the project late last week, further complicating the issue for Barnett. The ambiguity attached to the proposal could mar the Coalition for the remainder of the campaign, even if the initial reaction in WA appears to have been positive. The proposal has a little bit of the Latham Medicare Gold about it. In contrast, Gallop looked polished and confident, even if he didn’t use the stage to make any significant announcements. He faced some tough questions about broken promises not to increase taxes and energy shortages from 12 months ago. These two issues are the reason he has never enjoyed a honeymoon period as leader and continues to trail in most polls. Barnett was effective at attacking Gallop on both these issues, even if as energy minister in the previous Court government he failed to take the necessary steps in reforming Western Power which served as the precursor to power outages on Labor’s watch. Last year I co-wrote a paper on the energy sector in WA for the academic journal Policy and Society. Our findings showed that Barnett was captured by the sector. As minister he failed to institute the long-terms reforms that were needed to guarantee supply into the coming decades. Nonetheless, voters know the outages happened while Labor were running the state, and blame them accordingly. Despite his failings as energy minister, Colin Barnett is no pushover. He is an experienced politician and policy wonk. He is a former head of the WA Chamber of Commerce, and he served as Richard Court’s deputy for eight years in government. As a minister he held a range of senior portfolios, and his television advertising campaign for this election draws voters attention to his past achievements. The Coalition’s message in the campaign is that voters have a choice between delays under Gallop or decisions under Barnett. Barnett’s past experience in government is essential in an Opposition Leader. It gives voters the confidence he could run the state. Federally, Beazley has the same experience; Mark Latham didn’t. This is why Beazley will be a much more dangerous opponent for Howard or Costello in 2007. This week Bob Hawke flew into Perth to help with Labor’s campaign. Both he and the premier launched into a scathing attack on the bias in reporting by the states only daily newspaper, the West Australian. Despite the lowest unemployment figures in the nation and the highest economic growth, both under Gallop’s stewardship, an editorial suggested voters face a ‘dismal choice’ on polling day. On the day of the debate the front page of the West carried a story of how the Labor Party is soft on drugs. That morning Barnett also launched his tough on drugs campaign. Labor’s chances of winning a second term in the west aren’t made any easier by the heavy rural malaportionment in the lower house. Rural voters are represented at the rate of about 2 : 1 over city voters. This favours the junior coalition partner the Nationals. The Labor Party tried to remove the malaportionment via parliament and the courts, but failed on both fronts. Rural voters are unlikely to thank Gallop at the polls for attempting to reduce their voting influence, no matter how undemocratic the present state of malaportionment might be. History tells us governments rarely get defeated after just one term. The last time it happened in WA was 1974, and before that 1933. But with just over three weeks left before polling day this election remains up for grabs. Peter van Onselen is a lecturer in politics at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia.

Focusing specifically on reducing top-shelf foods and drinks is the Department of Health’s key healthy eating message. Alcohol is now also included on the top-shelf as it provides calories. ” The two booklets launched were ‘Your Guide to Healthy Eating Using the Food Pyramid’ from the Department and the complementary Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) ’s resource for health professionals, ‘Healthy Eating and Active Living for Adults, Teenagers and Children over 5 years – A Food Guide for Health Professionals and Catering Services’.

6000|$|The day {{was soon}} fixed, but fixed not entirely in {{reference}} to the wants of Gertrude and her wedding. Lucy had also to be married from the same house, and the day for her marriage had already been arranged. Sir Thomas had ordered that everything should be done for Lucy as though she were a daughter of the house, and her wedding had been arranged for the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> in May. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> heard that Ayala and Colonel Stubbs were also engaged he was anxious that the two sisters should be [...] "buckled," [...] as he called it, on the same occasion,--and he magnanimously offered to take upon himself the entire expense of the double arrangement, intimating that the people in Kingsbury Crescent had hardly room enough for a wedding. But Ayala, acting probably under Stalham influences, would not consent to this. Lady Albury, who was now in London, was determined that Ayala's marriage should take place from her own house; and, as Aunt Margaret and Uncle Reginald had consented, that matter was considered as settled. But Sir Thomas, having fixed his mind upon a double wedding, resolved that Gertrude and Lucy should be the joint brides. Gertrude, who still suffered perhaps a little in public estimation from the Ostend journey, was glad enough to wipe out that stain as quickly as possible, and did not therefore object to the arrangement. But to the Captain there was something in it by which his more delicate feelings were revolted. It was a matter of course that Ayala should be present at her sister's wedding, and would naturally appear there {{in the guise of a}} bridesmaid. She would also, now, act as a bridesmaid to Gertrude,--her future position as Mrs. Colonel Stubbs giving her, as was supposed, sufficient dignity for that honourable employment. But Captain Batsby, not so very long ago, had appeared among the suitors for Ayala's hand; and therefore, as he said to Gertrude, he felt a little shamefaced about it. [...] "What does that signify?" [...] said Gertrude. [...] "If you say nothing to her about it, I'll be bound she'll say nothing to you." [...] And so it was on the day of the wedding. Ayala did not say a word to Captain Batsby, nor did Captain Batsby say very much to Ayala.|$|R
