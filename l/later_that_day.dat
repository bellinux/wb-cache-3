Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> downgraded all the warnings that were still in effect for Fiji to gale force as Daman was weakening.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed northeast of Yap on July 7 and slowly increased in organization. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> {{as it moved}} northwestward. By July 8, it had developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression by the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The depression continued to strengthen, and was designated Tropical Storm Bilis by the JMA early on July 9. The JTWC upgraded Bilis to tropical storm status <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> On July 10, Bilis moved into the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and was designated Tropical Storm Florita for local warnings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|As Isaac tracked northwestward, it re-strengthened {{into a major}} {{hurricane}} on September28. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Isaac peaked as a moderate-Category4 hurricane. However, Isaac {{began to}} track northward over an area of colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs), which gradually weakened the storm {{over the next three}} days. Eventually, the storm curved northeastward, and weakened to a tropical storm early on October1. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. While extratropical, it brushed the British Isles, producing below gale-force winds. The storm had no interaction with land while tropical; however, one fatality occurred on Long Island when large swells generated by Isaac overturned a boat. In addition, rough seas also affected the coastlines of Bermuda and The Carolinas.|$|E
5|$|As the cyclone {{moved closer}} to Madagascar on April2, Radio Madagascar called for {{residents}} of Toamasina to take precautionary measures. At the time, forecasts predicted that Hudah would make landfall in northern Madagascar <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward. Although {{the center of}} the storm was poorly defined at the time and located to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> the storm curved towards the east while approaching Florida. At around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22.

5|$|On August 25, a {{tropical}} wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the Cape Verde islands <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> as convection steadily weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located 420miles (675km) west of the Cape Verde islands. Moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression steadily intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Erika was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that had minor impacts in the Lesser Antilles. The fifth named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Erika originated {{out of a}} tropical wave on September1 near the Lesser Antilles. Although it was a disorganized system, it was immediately declared a tropical storm, rather than a tropical depression. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the system reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg). Increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken shortly thereafter, with Erika barely maintaining tropical storm-status by September2. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the storm passed over the island of Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea. On September3, Erika weakened to a tropical depression as the low pressure center became fully displaced from convective activity. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the system degenerated into a remnant low before dissipating near Puerto Rico on September4.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{being named}} Nancy on February13, a gale warning {{was put in}} place for American Samoa. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> four {{additional}} countries were placed under watches and warnings.

Additionally, Niue was placed under a strong wind warning. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> Wallis and Futuna were placed under a strong wind warning. On February15, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Cook Islands as Nancy tracked through the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio {{to intensify}} further to reach winds of 120mph (195km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane {{turned to the}} north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed {{on the west side of}} the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in a slight increase in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225miles (360km) southwest of Michoacán. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> Sergio dissipated about 360miles (580km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, or about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of where it originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for about a day before the minimal amount of convection diminished.|$|E

5|$|A {{mesoscale}} convective complex, {{or large}} circular area of thunderstorms, {{developed in the}} Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued {{to move to the}} west-northwest <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> reaching its first peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) on August 7.|$|E
