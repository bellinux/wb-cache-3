5|$|The {{report states}} {{that there were}} two {{critical}} errors made during the planning stages. Firstly, the parking <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> the mall was located {{on the roof of the}} building without there being sound waterproofing, and secondly the structural inefficiency of the hollow concrete slabs which prevented the installation of effective waterproofing later on.|$|E
5|$|A new {{central library}} was {{discussed}} by library administrators {{for several decades}} {{and approved by the}} regional council in 2008. The architects, a joint venture between local firm Fowler Bauld and Mitchell and Schmidt Hammer Lassen of Denmark, were chosen in 2010 through an international design competition. Construction began later that year on a prominent downtown site that had been a parking <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> half a century.|$|E

5|$|In May 2001, Oslo City Council {{voted to}} sell their {{properties}} at Fornebu to Fornebu Boligspar (FB), which again had agreements to sell a <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> the stadium to Stabæk. In November 2002, Borgarting Court of Appeal concluded that Norrønafly {{had the right to}} continue leasing a hangar—located at the planned location of the venue—until 2014. In June 2003, Stabæk was in financial difficulties, and investor Kjell Chr. Ulrichsen bought shares for NOK10 million to avoid bankruptcy; these shares had the option to be converted to shares in the arena company.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Karl Dean drafted {{plans for}} {{financing}} the stadium and acquiring the necessary {{land from the}} state. The deal involved the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metro) receiving the state-owned Sulphur Dell property—then in use as a parking <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> state employees—in exchange for paying the state $18million {{for the construction of}} a 1,000-car parking garage on the site and $5million for an underground parking garage below the proposed new state library and archives. The city also acquired the property on which the Nashville School of the Arts is located.|$|E

5|$|The main {{bus station}} of Arad, Arad Central Bus Station, was {{located on the}} corner of Jerusalem (Yerushalayim) Street and Jeuda (Yehuda) Street. It has however been closed due to a legal battle between Arad's {{municipality}} and the Egged Bus Cooperative, and its bus stops are now located nearby on Jerusalem St. Construction of the central station officially restarted 18 January 2009. The new station will include seven platforms and a large parking <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> park and ride. The planned cost of the project is NIS 4.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared a <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
