50|$|Prost was {{piling on}} the {{pressure}} - by lap 35 he had climbed to second within 10 seconds of Senna, {{and was now}} ahead of Riccardo Patrese, Berger and Nelson Piquet. When Senna came up to <b>lap</b> <b>former</b> Lotus team mate Satoru Nakajima, there was contact and the McLaren had to pit for a new nosecone. He rejoined and challenged hard, but the reduced downforce levels made the car difficult to drive. On lap 66, Patrese retired with a broken oil cooler.|$|E

50|$|The steeplechase {{has become}} a {{national}} event of Kenya. Their team tactics dominate major championship races. For the first 5 laps, they let others dominate the lead, primarily led by Americans Donald Cabral and Evan Jager. Then the Kenyans decided to move as a team, leaving the field to chase. With less than 800 metres to go, Ugandan Benjamin Kiplagat got tangled up on a barrier and fell flat on his face, the runners behind him having to scramble. 200 metres later, Kenyan Brimin Kipruto fell. Though he quickly scrambled to his feet, that effectively ruined the chances for a Kenyan sweep. Still the other two led through the final <b>lap.</b> <b>Former</b> gold medalist and multiple world champion Ezekiel Kemboi pulled away off the front. As Abel Mutai began to falter, Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad sprinted past to repeat his silver medal. Kemboi's lead was secure and after clearing the final barrier, he began to celebrate, drifting out to lane 8 {{by the time he}} crossed the finish line.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying {{resulted}} in pole position for Nigel Mansell's Williams-Honda with Ayrton Senna's Lotus-Renault right with him. Nelson Piquet was {{third in the}} second Williams while Alain Prost was fourth for McLaren ahead of Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Gerhard Berger (Benetton), Jacques Laffite (Ligier), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham) and Warwick. Michele Alboreto was 11th in his Ferrari. In the morning warm-up Patrick Tambay suffered a suspension failure on his Lola-Ford and injured his feet in the resulting accident {{and so he did}} not start. Mansell took the lead and with Senna holding up those behind him, Mansell seemed to be in a very strong position. Behind Senna were Prost, Piquet, Rosberg, Arnoux and the rest. Rosberg soon overtook Piquet. On the fifth lap Prost finally made it ahead of Senna and the Brazilian went wide and was pushed back to sixth behind Piquet and Arnoux. On lap 13 Rosberg overtook Prost for second and four laps later the Finn took the lead. His fuel consumption was too much., however, and so Rosberg had to back off which enabled Mansell and Prost to close up. As they came up to <b>lap</b> <b>former</b> world champion Alan Jones on lap 22 Rosberg left a small gap and Mansell took the lead again. Mansell pulled away to win the race, and Prost retook Rosberg for second place but he then had a slow pit stop caused by a sticking wheelnut and dropped back to fifth. He {{spent the rest of the}} race charging back to take second by the finish. Piquet was third with Rosberg fourth having had to slow to conserve fuel in the closing laps while the troubled Senna was fifth and Arnoux sixth.|$|E
50|$|The delayed Superstock TT Race {{was held}} over to Tuesday 5 June 2007 and was over 4 laps (150.92 miles) of the Snaefell Mountain Course. Despite the windy conditions, the race {{favourite}} Bruce Anstey riding a Suzuki motor-cycle established a 5-second lead at Glen Helen on lap 1 and shattered the lap {{record for the}} race from a standing start, lapping in 17 minutes and 38.70 seconds an average speed of 128.29 mph. The fast pace and blustery conditions caused both Ryan Farquhar to Guy Martin {{to run out of}} fuel on lap 2 and Bruce Anstey increased the pace to produce another Superstock lap record in 17 minutes 37.85 seconds an average speed of 128.400 mph and a lead of 23.15 seconds. The Honda pair of John McGuinness and Ian Hutchinson occupied 2nd and 3rd places, Martin Finnegan in 4th place riding an MV Agusta motor-cycle and 5th place Conor Cummins who now held the record for the fastest local Isle of Man competitor after lapping at 18 minutes and 10.78 seconds from a standing start on lap 1 of the 2007 Superstock Race. Despite a reduce pace which produced laps at an average speed of 121.299 mph and 125.771 mph on the 3rd and 4th laps, the New Zealander Bruce Anstey won the 2007 Superstock TT Race in 1 hour, 11 minutes and 56.29 seconds at an average race speed of 125.875 mph. The winning margin was 40.3 seconds over 2nd place John McGuinness who mentioned at the race finish that “....Bruce has taken Superstock racing to a new level. He pulled our pants down on the first lap and that was it.” At Union Mills on the last <b>lap,</b> <b>former</b> New Zealand TT winner Shaun Harris crashed while in 13th place and was taken to Nobles Hospital with injuries that were described as critical.|$|E

5000|$|By then Senna was {{catching}} Prost rapidly, and with traffic, Prost's malfunctioning gearbox, and a tricky {{wet and dry}} surface, conditions were favourable to the Brazilian. On lap 27, as they attempted to lap Andrea de Cesaris, Satoru Nakajima and Maurício Gugelmin, Senna managed to force his way through as Prost was delayed by the de Cesaris' Rial. BBC commentator James Hunt famously called de Cesaris a [...] "disgrace" [...] for blocking Prost and publicly lambasted him during the commentary for his driving (it wasn't the first or last time Hunt would criticise de Cesaris' driving during his commentary). Senna then put in a succession of fast <b>laps,</b> breaking the <b>former</b> <b>lap</b> record and building a lead of over three seconds, despite being delayed while lapping Nakajima.|$|R
25|$|On May 26, 2014, reports {{surfaced}} that Giguère {{was likely}} to retire {{at the conclusion of}} the 2013–14 season, amidst much speculation.

At the end of the game, he took a victory <b>lap</b> with <b>former</b> teammate Teemu Selänne, who was also retiring. On August 21, Giguère formally announced his retirement.

5000|$|As {{darkness}} fell on {{the former}} Hendricks Army Airfield, the race ended in confusion. At one point, the Ferrari of Phil Hill and Carroll Shelby were declared winners, then it was the D-Type. The Jag was called to the winner’s circle, only {{to run out of}} fuel during the victory <b>lap.</b> The <b>former</b> Le Mans winner, Luigi Chinetti, the Ferrari representative from New York protested the result, which was counter-protected by the Jaguar owner, Briggs Cunningham. Cunningham insisted that the D-Type had passed the Ferrari. The owner of the Ferrari, Allen Guiberson demanded that the D-Type should be disqualified, as it passed the Ferrari under a yellow flag. Cunningham countered the Index of Performance Trophy should not have been handed to Hill/Shelby, when in fact it should have gone to the Osca driven by Bill Lloyd and George Huntoon.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a 1979 Grand Prix and {{maintained}} the original brakes and suspension control arms {{in an effort to keep}} cost down. At 2,600 lbs and over 400 horse power on hand it should be fast. First time out was at the demanding Sear Point Raceway (Infenion). Test Drivers were Brandon Kraus and Miguel Caparros. It was fast with predictable handling, in short time both drivers were setting fast laps for the day. The Young Mr Kraus got to test his abilities and brute strength when the engine pulley came off and the vehicle lost the power steering in the middle of the infamous Turn 2. Kraus was able to spin and avoid contact and brought the truck in for the day. It was a good day all in all.Next test was 3 weeks later at Laguna Seca. The high speeds attainable at Laguna Seca, played into the strengths of the truck. The Truck was the fastest car on the track. It was decided at the last minute to enter the 3 hour enduro that afternoon.Starting from the last position, Brandon Kraus was at the lead by the end of the first lap.Pulling away to a two lap lead after the first hour. At the first pit stop the lead was given back as the crew was not prepared for fast refueling and the drivers change in a race truck is rather tedious. Rich Rogers took off and drove at a more conservative pace and lost two laps to the leading BMW M3's. The second pit stop and driver change went better and only one additional laps. Now down 3 <b>laps</b> <b>former</b> Trans Am driver Lou Lerner took off matching earlier lap times. On the last lap Lou passed the lead BMW for the lead having made up all the lost laps. At Laguna's turn 11 with the checker in sight, leading by 100 yards, the heat and exhaustion caused Lou to go into the turn too fast and spun into the sand trap.|$|R
50|$|The {{third part}} of the {{championship}} started in Germany, and Lauda took pole as usual, and Regazzoni ensured that Ferrari locked out the front row, with other contenders Fittipaldi third and Scheckter fourth. Regazzoni took the lead at the start, whereas Lauda and Scheckter collided on the first <b>lap</b> with the <b>former</b> retiring, and the latter continuing unscathed in second. Fittipaldi suffered a puncture and had to pit. Regazzoni {{went on to win}} and take the championship lead, with Scheckter second and Reutemann third.|$|R

50|$|The {{band has}} been through a plethora of line-up changes, and minor {{positions}} in the band {{have proved to be}} a revolving chair, while retaining the core force of the Karpinski brothers and Tim Gerak.

50|$|Pole-sitter James Buescher led for {{the first}} two laps before Chase Elliott took the lead, leading for 23 laps until lap 26, when Ryan Blaney claimed it, leading for two laps until it was relinquished to Ty Dillon. Germán Quiroga and Miguel Paludo also led <b>laps,</b> the <b>former</b> leading <b>laps</b> 34-36 and the latter leading 37-46; Dillon took the lead again on lap 48. Prior to lap 48, three {{cautions}} were waved: on lap 8 for Max Gresham stalling in turn 5, on lap 33 for Jennifer Jo Cobb's stall in turn 2, and on lap 47 with Alex Guenette also stalling in turn 4. Dillon continued to lead for 17 laps from lap 47 to 63, and on lap 58, Johnny Sauter stalled in turn 6. In the final turn of the last lap, Elliott turned Dillon into the tire barrier, which brought out the caution, to claim his first career NASCAR win in his sixth series start, becoming the youngest Truck Series race winner at 17 years, 9 months, 4 days. Followed by Elliott was Chad Hackenbracht, Paludo, Darrell Wallace Jr., Ron Hornaday Jr., Max Papis, Ross Chastain, Timothy Peters, Buescher and Matt Crafton.

50|$|It was {{generally}} thought that Senna had used too much fuel {{in the first}} half of the race in his bid to keep in front of Prost and that was why the Ferraris were rapidly catching him towards the end of the race, with Berger reducing what was a 26-second gap when Prost retired, to be only 5 seconds behind when Senna and Schlesser collided 14 <b>laps</b> later. Senna's <b>former</b> Lotus team boss Peter Warr commented after the race that he felt Prost, knowing he wouldn't finish the race, had suckered his team mate into using too much fuel in the hope that it would keep his championship hopes alive. He also added that if Senna had thought about it he'd have realised that to stay close to him, Prost must have also been using too much fuel and that was not something the dual World Champion usually did. Prost's tactics may have contributed to McLaren missing out on a perfect season, but they had the desired effect as Senna scored no points (after four straight wins including Britain where Prost failed to finish) and he was still in with a good chance of winning his third World Championship.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1995 season finale, the NAPA 500, Hendrick Motorsports {{entered a}} fourth car just for this race {{just in case}} the {{unforeseen}} were to hit Jeff Gordon's car. If problems were to befall Gordon's car, the car would immediately pull off the track and retire from the race. This was the No. 58 Chevrolet with [...] "Racing for a Reason" [...] on the quarterpanels. Racing for a Reason referred to finding a cure for leukemia, a disease that owner Rick Hendrick had been diagnosed with. The team had originally hired Jimmy Horton to drive the car in the race. Horton qualified the car in 34th, but was unable to race it due to serious injuries suffered in a crash in the ARCA Bondo Mar-Hyde Series support race the day before the NAPA 500. Jeff Purvis was then hired to sub for Horton in the No. 58 and drove the car to a 26th-place finish, eight <b>laps</b> down. The <b>former</b> No. 58 car is now known as the No. 48 car driven by Jimmie Johnson with Lowe's sponsorship since 2002.

The Tekno Autosports pairing of Shane Van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb finished in third place. Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell started from pole position and led {{for the majority}} of the race, but a puncture, caused by a bracket dislodged by a pit crew member during a pit stop, saw them finish in fifteenth place. Russell Ingall returned to the series to substitute for the injured James Courtney. Ingall partnered Jack Perkins, the pair finishing ninth after starting from twenty-fourth place on the grid. The pairings of Will and Alex Davison and Todd Kelly and Alex Buncombe both finished multiple <b>laps</b> down, the <b>former</b> pair due to a starter motor problem at a pit stop and the latter due to Buncombe running off the track. The only retirement during the race was the car of Nick Percat and Oliver Gavin with steering failure. Winterbottom extended his championship lead over Mostert to 198 points, while David Reynolds, who finished fifth with Dean Canto, moved up to third place in the standings after Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards only managed to finish thirteenth.
