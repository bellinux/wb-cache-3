40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the motif of}} touch and resistance to touch in Yves Bonnefoy’s collection of snow poems, Début et fin de la neige, 1992. The resistance encountered by the hand that seeks to touch, as evoked within Bonnefoy’s poem ‘Noli me tangere’, is suggestive of the problems and obstacles inherent in the poetic process: the disjuncture between language and the physical world, the impossibility of attaining presence in language, and the dispersal or dissemination of meaning. Yet the partial touchings and the failed touchings that are portrayed in Début et fin de la neige suggest how the potential impossibilities and aporias of the poetic text become its enabling devices. This paper examines an attitude to meaning that rejects comprehension, the possession or holding of knowledge, in favour of receptiveness, interaction, and playfulness. It examines how, across the poems of the collection, a different conception of touch emerges: a touch that does not resist or seek to overcome disjuncture, but which explores and engages with the very movements of separation. This paper identifies important similarities between Bonnefoy’s treatment of touch, Nancy’s Noli me tangere, and Derrida’s <b>Le</b> <b>toucher,</b> Jean-Luc Nancy...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePackaging or {{methods of}} {{distance}} selling prevent consumers from touching the products and therefore from evaluating them properly. Thus {{the aim of}} this research is to observe whether extrinsic information, such as brand or innovative cue, can compensate this lack of sensory information and so improve the hedonic evaluation. An experiment conducted on 110 subjects with two fabrics shows that consumers evaluate them more positively when they observe them with an extrinsic information than when they observe them without this information, and that this improvement is greater than that obtained when we allow them to assess the fabrics by the touch in addition to the mere sight. Les emballages ou les méthodes de vente à distance empêchent les consommateurs de toucher les produits et, donc, de les évaluer correctement. L'objectif de cette recherche est de savoir si une information extrinsèque, comme la marque ou une mention innovante, peut permettre de compenser ce manque d'information sensorielle et, ainsi, d'améliorer l'évaluation hédonique. Une expérimentation menée auprès de 110 répondants avec 2 tissus montre que les consommateurs les évaluent plus favorablement quand ils les observent avec une information extrinsèque que quand ils les observent sans cette information, et que cette amélioration est supérieure à celle obtenue quand on leur permet d 'évaluer les tissus par <b>le</b> <b>toucher</b> en plus de la vue seule...|$|E

50|$|L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin (English: The Art of Playing the Harpsichord) is a didactic {{treatise}} by the French composer François Couperin. It {{was first}} published in 1716, and was followed by a revised edition in 1717.|$|R
50|$|For his keyboard-playing Bach {{is largely}} {{considered}} an autodidact. In 1716 François Couperin's L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin had appeared. Bach knew Couperin's harpsichord music: {{one of his}} pieces {{ended up in the}} Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach. The Applicatio in C major BWV 994, the first piece in the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, is one of a very few instances where Bach indicates fingering. Apart from such minute indications there are no direct descriptions by the composer of how he taught his students to play the keyboard. Generally, however, it is assumed that the indications in L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin are not too far from how Bach played the harpsichord.|$|R

50|$|François Couperin's didactic L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin (1716) {{contained}} eight preludes that, while unmeasured and improvisatory in nature, {{were measured}} for teaching purposes. These pieces, {{along with several}} preludes from Nicolas Siret's Second Livre de Pieces de Clavecin (1719), were among the last unmeasured harpsichord preludes written.|$|R

His treatise on theorbo accompaniment (Table pour apprendre facilement à <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> théorbe sur la basse-continuë (Paris, 1669) is among the best 17th-century sources on the subject.|$|R
2500|$|In his 1920 essay, André Salmon again quotes Metzinger's statement: [...] "Jamais, jusqu’a ce jour, les peintres n’avaient eu la curiosité de <b>toucher</b> <b>les</b> objets dont ils prétendaient {{traduire}} l’apparence". According to Salmon, Metzinger's {{reference to}} [...] "touching" [...] (toucher) the objects {{they attempted to}} represent, was {{a means by which}} to show all the sides, every aspect, each view-point, each element of the surface of the object simultaneously ("toutes les faces d'un objet à la fois").|$|R
50|$|He {{described}} himself as a disciple of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. In Paris in 1687, he published the book L'Art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> dessus et le basse de violle about playing on viola da gamba. This concise work of 47 pages was written only for self-study. It comprises four parts, in which the attitude of the viol, the notation and the fingerboard in notation and tablature, the decorations and finally bowing are explained. Unlike Jean Rousseau's Traité de la Viole, which appeared in the same year and won extraordinary popularity, Danoville's textbook did not include an historical and aesthetic chapter, but was limited only to the technical instructions.|$|R
5000|$|Louis {{was evidently}} a very {{successful}} and influential composer, but he died young, in 1661, {{and most of his}} compositions remained unpublished until the 20th century. Some years after his death, the second of the two most important Couperins was born: François Couperin, nicknamed le Grand - [...] "the Great". Although suffering from poor health throughout his life, François was a very prolific composer. He produced four livres of harpsichord pieces that represent the summit of the French harpsichord school, authored an influential and historically important treatise on harpsichord playing (L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin), and produced a number of other, sacred and secular works, that are still well known today.|$|R
5000|$|Siret was {{a friend}} and admirer of François Couperin, and his first {{collection}} of harpsichord pieces, published approximately in 1709, was dedicated to Couperin. The suites of this collection all begin with a French overture, following the tradition established by Jean-Baptiste Lully. Siret's second volume of harpsichord pieces (Second livre de pièces de clavecin, published in 1719) was, along with Couperin's L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin, {{one of the last}} publications to include unmeasured preludes. Siret also wrote some [...] "pièces de caractère" [...] (pieces of descriptive character, not dances), stylistically reminiscent of Couperin, and a single organ work by him survives, Fugue primi toni.|$|R
50|$|Johann Sebastian Bach {{introduced}} an innovation in fingering for the organ and the clavier. (A similar, although according to Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach less radical, innovation {{was introduced by}} François Couperin, {{at roughly the same}} time in 1716, in his book L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one finger under or over another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing the third finger over the fourth or the fourth finger over the fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb. Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other fingers over or under one another.|$|R
50|$|Application {{of notes}} inégales to {{contemporary}} performance of music not written in France, {{for example the}} music of J.S. Bach, is extremely controversial, and indeed resulted {{in one of the}} most heated debates in 20th-century musicology. One school of thought attempted to show that the French practice was actually widespread in Europe, and performance of music by composers as diverse as Bach and Scarlatti should be suffused with dotted rhythms; another school of thought held that even-note playing was the norm in their music unless dotted rhythms were explicitly notated in the score. Evidence on both sides of the argument is compelling; for example 17th-century English writings recommending unequal playing (Roger North's autobiographical Notes of Me, written around 1695, describes the practice explicitly, in reference to English lute music), as well as François Couperin, who wrote in L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin (1716), that in Italian music, Italians always write the notes exactly the way they want them played. Then again, the practice may have been more widespread in some areas, such as England, than others, such as Italy and Germany.|$|R
40|$|My Master´s work {{is called}} The {{historical}} interpretative and methodical sources for harpsichord of the 18 th century. I have compiled the main French {{sources of the}} 17 th and 18 th century in my Bachelor´s work(2008) : Les Principes du Clavecin (1702), Monsieur de Saint Lambert (ccca. 1700), L´Art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> Clavecin (1716, 1717), Francois Couperin (1668 - 1733) a De la mechanique des doigts sur le clavessin (1724), Jean Philippe Rameau (1683 - 1764). My Master´s work is divided into five chapters. the first chapter is about {{the social and political}} situation of the 18 th century in France and Germany and also includes the main features of the keyboards music. The second and the third chapter focus on the detailed contents of the interpretative and methodical sources. It also explores the principal questions of the foundations of playing the harpsichord, music theory, ornamentation, fingering, dynamic and expression of pieces. The forth chapter deals with the basic principles of the interpretation fo thoroughbass. The main sources of information are summarized in the fifth chapter...|$|R
40|$|The raison d’être of ISKCON is the {{communication}} {{of the name}} of Krishna worldwide, ensuring that it reaches into {{the hearts and minds of}} those in every town and village. ISKCON’s own intention, derived from the teachings of Chaitanya and preached unceasingly by the founder, Bhaktivedanta Swami, provides a focus for assessing the success of the movement since its arrival in England in 1968. What strategies have been adopted for achieving this objective? How have the strategies changed as ISKCON has increased its membership and support throughout the UK, and has become more established on the public religious scene? Using ISKCON’s publications and ephemera, the author evaluates the shift from world-rejection to social inte-gration, and from the desire for refuge to the more recent commitment to encounter and dialogue.

5000|$|A single 256th note {{is always}} stemmed with flags, while {{two or more}} are usually beamed in groups. Notes this short are very rare in printed music but not unknown. One reason that notes with many beams are rare is that, for instance, a thirty-second note at =50 lasts {{the same amount of}} time as a sixteenth note at =100; every note in a piece may be notated as twice as long but last {{the same amount of time}} if the tempo is also doubled. They are principally used for brief, rapid {{sections}} in slow movements. For example they occur in some editions of the second movement (Largo) of Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto (Op. 37) (1800), to notate rapid scales. Another example is in Mozart's Variations on [...] "Je suis Lindor" [...] (1778), where four of them are used in the slow (molto adagio) twelfth variation. A further example occurs (Grave.Adagio non troppo) in Jan Ladislav Dussek's (1760-1812) Fifth Piano Sonata, Op. 10 No. 2. They also occur (Largo) in Vivaldi's (1678-1741) Concerto, RV 444, and in bar 15 of François Couperin's Second Prelude from L'art de <b>toucher</b> <b>le</b> clavecin (1716).|$|R
