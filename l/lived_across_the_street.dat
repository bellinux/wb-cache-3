5|$|Notably, the Queen was {{the first}} {{character}} to ever speak in an animated feature film. She was voiced by Lucille La Verne, who achieved her voice change {{for the role of}} the Witch by removing her false teeth. Joe Grant, who contributed the design for her Witch form, noticed La Verne's changing attitude and posture when voicing the Queen and Witch, and sketched these poses and her body language down for animation reference. He also said he based the Witch's concept art on a woman who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from him. The character's foreign dubbing voice actresses included Jiřina Petrovická in Czechoslovakia, Clara Pontoppidan, Kirsten Rolffes, Lise Ringheim in Denmark, Rauni Luoma and Seela Sella in Finland, Claude Gensac in France, Dagny Servaes in Germany, Ilus Vay in Hungary, Tina Lattanzi and Dina Romano in Italy, Tanie Kitabayashi in Japan, Blanca de Castejón and Cristina Montt in Mexico, Zinaida Sharko in Russia, and Helena Brodin, Hjördis Petterson and Lil Terselius in Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|Handy relayed {{a message}} to Heney: [...] "If Frank Heney takes the case I will kill him!" [...] Handy {{publicly}} proclaimed that any attorney foolish enough to represent her in the divorce case “would be sorry.” He described his wife as [...] "a morphine fiend and a common slut."

In July 1891, Handy, acting in his mother's name, sued his ex-wife for unlawful detainer of property, trying to force her out of the house that the court had granted her. His suit was dismissed but he went to a second judge and presented the deed that his wife had signed under duress two years previously. Heney represented Mary again and Handy made more death threats. [...] Fearful for his life, Heney began carrying a pistol. Heney's brother Ben <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Handy and began accompanying his brother to and from the office. Ben reported that Handy said he would [...] "take Frank's gun away and kill him with it." [...] Handy hired a former policeman named McCarthy as a bodyguard.

2500|$|After her husband's death, Almena frugally {{held on to}} {{the family}} wealth. She built a large home at 2 Ferncliff Place in Springfield in about 1852, which was long known as the King Homestead. The Springfield City Directory of that time located it simply as [...] "North of Buck Creek." [...] Buck Creek, which is {{probably}} wide enough to be called a river at that point, has long marked the north boundary of downtown Springfield. There are tall limestone cliffs on both sides of it. Isaac Ward cut building stone from these cliffs, at the location of present-day Cliff Park in Springfield, that later became part of many of the early buildings in Springfield. There was only the Limestone Street footbridge across Buck Creek at the time Almena King built the King Homestead, and that footbridge was more than a block upstream. [...] She bought this land from Robert Quigley's grandson-in-law, Isaac Ward, who <b>lived</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> on present-day Fountain (then Market). The Isaac Ward Mansion still stands today and is still occupied. The Kings and the Quigley descendants remained very close, which is why Ward's father gave him the middle name of [...] "Ward", and Ward went by that middle name all his life. One family account credits Isaac Ward with having been particularly helpful to the King family after the death of David King. Isaac Ward also sold a large tract of his land to Wittenberg College, which now forms the eastern part of its campus and is the reason the main road through present day Wittenberg University is Ward Street. The King Homestead was out in the country when first built, which was to get her boys away from the reported 122 saloons near their home in Springfield proper. All three of her sons attended nearby Wittenberg College.|$|E
