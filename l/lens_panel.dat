The shutter speed dial surrounds the lens mount. The semi-automatic preset lens diaphragm is automatically closed by a small protrusion at seven-o-clock at the lens mount, but activated manually by an anti-clockwise turn of the aperture ring while depressing a small release button on it and then returned to the required preset aperture value. In this way, the lens is wide open for bright finder image and ready to instantly close down upon shutter release. A focusing lever is situated on the left-hand lens control.

50|$|The Mecaflex {{is built}} of {{precision}} cast metal alloy parts with a matte chrome finish {{and decorated with}} a striped black body covering material.

Apart from the SEROA markings at the top to this effect, these later cameras have a different fine grain body covering material, the shutter speed extend to 1/250 sec. and the M/X flash sync switch is left out, the feature conspicuously missing on the top left of the <b>lens</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Reisekamera, {{meaning a}} [...] "travel camera", is a large-format wooden bellows tailboard view camera of almost {{standardised}} design, unlike the much lighter and more flexible field camera, {{but not as}} cumbersome as the studio camera. A sturdy tripod is always brought along, but it {{might just as well}} be placed on a tabletop. It has equally sized rectangular front and back panels on a full-width double-extension baseboard that is hinged near the front. The front panel, holding the lens plate, has horizontal and vertical movements, while the back is tilt-suspended on brass standards running on brass tracks {{on either side of the}} baseboard, providing rack and pinion focusing on the film plane. An almost non-tapering calico double-extension bellows is employed; allowing the projected image to freely reach the photographic plate regardless of lens offset position. The camera folds flat, after the back panel is brought forward to the <b>lens</b> <b>panel,</b> by folding the hinged base board up, and thus conveniently protecting the focusing screen. For insertion of the wooden dark slide plate cassette, the hinged focusing screen is swung up and away. The Reisekamera was made available for several plate sizes; most common are the 13×18 cm, 18×24 cm and 24×30 cm versions. Shutter and lens were normally not part of the original delivery. However, some were made available with a spectacular focal-plane shutter, recognisable by the brass mechanisms either side of the back panel.|$|E

Here we sought to determine if germ-line EPHA 2 coding SNVs were associated with age-related cataract in a case-control DNA panel (> 50 years) and if somatic EPHA 2 coding SNVs were associated with lens aging and/or cataract in a post-mortem lens DNA panel (> 48 years). Micro-fluidic PCR amplification followed by targeted amplicon (exon) next-generation (deep) sequencing of EPHA 2 (17 -exons) afforded high read-depth coverage (1000 x) for > 82 % of reads in the cataract case-control panel (161 cases, 64 controls) and > 70 % of reads in the post-mortem <b>lens</b> <b>panel</b> (35 clear lens pairs, 22 cataract lens pairs). Novel and reference (known) missense SNVs in EPHA 2 that were predicted in silico to be functionally damaging were found in both cases and controls from the age-related cataract panel at variant allele frequencies (VAFs) consistent with germ-line transmission (VAF > 20 %). Similarly, both novel and reference missense SNVs in EPHA 2 were found in the post-mortem <b>lens</b> <b>panel</b> at VAFs consistent with a somatic origin (VAF > 3 %). The majority of SNVs found in the cataract case-control panel and post-mortem <b>lens</b> <b>panel</b> were transitions and many occurred at di-pyrimidine sites that are susceptible to ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced mutation. These data suggest that novel germ-line (blood) and somatic (lens) coding SNVs in EPHA 2 that are predicted to be functionally deleterious occur in adults over 50 years of age. However, both types of EPHA 2 coding variants were present at comparable levels in individuals with or without age-related cataract making simple genotype-phenotype correlations inconclusive...|$|E

40|$|The primary project {{objective}} was to generate a conceptual design for a nominal 5 kW solar dynamic space power system, which uses a unique, patented, transmittance-optimized, dome-shaped, point-focus Fresnel lens as the optical concentrator. Compared to reflective concentrators, the dome lens allows 200 times larger slope errors for the same image displacement. Additionally, the dome lens allows the energy receiver, the power conversion unit (PCU), and the heat rejection radiator to be independently optimized in configuration and orientation, since none of these elements causes any aperture blockage. Based on optical and thermal trade studies, a 6. 6 m diameter lens with a focal length of 7. 2 m was selected. This lens should provide 87 percent net optical efficienty at 800 X geometric concentration ratio. The large lens is comprised of 24 gores, which compactly stow together during launch, and automatically deploy on orbit. The total mass of the microglass <b>lens</b> <b>panels,</b> the graphite/epoxy support structure, and miscellaneous hardware is about 1. 2 kg per square meter of aperture.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of secondary optics for concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules. It focuses on reflective secondary optics designed for high concentration modules using fresnel lenses as the primary concentrating optics. The development of the secondary optics was guided by the idea of designing an optical element suitable for cost effective mass production. The primary concentrating optics of a CPV module can direct only a limited part of the solar aureole (the immediate surroundings of the sun) onto the solar cell. The same applies to light impinging non-perpendicular to the optical axis of the module (e. g., due to misalignment of the module). Therefore, one of the main functions of reflective secondary optics is to redirect light onto the solar cell that would otherwise not reach it. In order to analyze the performance of secondary optical elements ("secondaries"), a measurement setup is introduced that measures the angular photocurrent response of a CPV device with highly parallel light. This response {{is referred to as the}} "angular acceptance function" (AAF). The AAF is used to estimate the performance of the CPV device under various conditions with differing circumsolar radiation (CSR). A CPV test module was manufactured featuring III-V triple-junction solar cells, a fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>panel</b> as the primary concentrator optic, and the newly developed reflective secondary. The results of a 6 -month outdoor measurement period are presented and compared to the performance of a reference module as well as to the results of the indoor AAF measurements...|$|E
30|$|Although {{they are}} mainly {{composed}} of silicon, {{which is a}} widespread material in nature, the process and thus the final product is expensive. Many investigations have been done to raise the performance of PV cells and reduce the required cell area and its final cost. The proposed methods are mainly based on concentrating the sunrays on a small cell area. There are several concentrator technologies that include parabolic trough solar concentrator, linear refractive Fresnel lens, linear reflective Fresnel lens, dish-shaped reflectors, etc. [1, 2]. Compared to other concentrator technologies, Fresnel lens is characterized by some advantages such as small volume, low weight, short focus, high efficiency, and low cost that motivate researchers to design and commercialize Fresnel-based solar concentrators [3, 4]. With the improvements of lens material since the official invention of Fresnel lens in 1822, especially polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which has a good transmissivity and resistance to sunlight, interest in Fresnel lenses for concentrated solar energy applications rose {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century. The recent developments of concentrated solar energy applications using Fresnel lens systems include imaging Fresnel lens solar concentration systems and non-imaging systems [5]. Researches have revealed that it is the refractive surface of a conventional lens which defines its focusing properties. Based on this fact the Fresnel lens was invented. Later, researchers found out that using Fresnel lens as a concentrator in PV systems can effectively increase the system’s efficiency. A concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) system with a steady electric output adopting an electrically tunable concentration ratio of the liquid crystals (LC) lens is demonstrated [6]. The module consists of a Fresnel lens array (including 16 Fresnel lenses, each 0.120  m ×  0.120  m), a solar cell array (including 16 solar cells connected in series, each 0.025  m ×  0.025  m) which was pasted onto an aluminum plate heat sink and below the Fresnel array. The authors pointed out that using a Fresnel lens array, instead of a large Fresnel lens, can reduce the thermal energy of the solar cells. Zhai et al. [1] experimentally investigated a concentrating solar collector using linear Fresnel lens. Test results revealed that the indication of lost energy was 0.578  W/m 2  K, which was much smaller than solar collectors without concentrator. In [1], authors used five small Fresnel lenses made of polymethyl, evacuated tube absorber, stepping motor, etc. as the main parts of the module. The module was equipped with a sun-tracking system that tracked the sunlight and a 20  mm light strip was produced. The advantages of this solar collector are: (1) low cost due to accessibility of polymethyl and evacuated glass tube, (2) the area of receiver solar cells is smaller than modules without concentrator, (3) the module is easy to deploy in large scale at high temperature [1]. Rai et al. [9] have investigated the Fresnel lens application for space photovoltaic. The authors proposed the optimum linear Fresnel lens concentrator in terms of concentration ratio. Shvartz and Soluyanov [8] presented space Fresnel concentrated modules with GaInp/GaAs/Ge triple-junction (TJ) solar cells. The module included 4 linear Fresnel lenses, 4 linear photo receivers containing 12 TJ solar cells, and a copper heat sink. Optical characteristics of the linear Fresnel lens were estimated accordingly [8]. Wagner et al. [9] have proposed a refractive system, which enhances solar system’s efficiency and reduces its cost. The proposed model works based on separating sunlight (white light) into different wavelengths. Then using a Fresnel lens and with the help of progresses in semiconductors, each wavelength can be concentrated on a different material to be absorbed effectively. This will increase the solar system’s efficiency. A switchable Fresnel zone plate lens is demonstrated using a polymer-stabilized liquid crystal. The fabrication process is relatively simple and the device can be operated below 10  V with fast response time [10]. In this paper, a novel refractive structure, named semi-Fresnel lens, is proposed. The proposed model works by calculating the groove angles of Fresnel lens based on the refraction and convergent angles of the orthogonal incident ray. To be clearer, we assume that the incoming ray is directly refracted and converged to a special point. Then using Snell’s law and simple trigonometry we find these refraction and convergent angles. Finally based on these two parameters, we calculate the groove angles. This method ensures that every incoming ray will refract directly with refraction angle calculated before. As a result all rays will be converged to a predetermined point with a special convergent angle. Therefore, the needed solar cell area can be significantly reduced. It should not be left unmentioned that, since all calculations are based on the incidence angle orthogonal to the lens surface, the most efficiency will be obtained when the Sun is exactly above the module. To provide this situation in practice, we suggest a sun-tracking method which tracks the sun and adjusts the module so that the incidence angle is always 90 degrees. This way, all incoming rays are concentrated to a line resulting in producing a 2 -cm light strip. This will reduce the needed solar cell area resulting in lower cost and lower loss of energy. Based on this assumption a solar panel containing four rows of 2  cm ×  90  cm solar cells is designed and implemented. A Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>panel</b> including four 90  cm ×  20  cm semi-Fresnel arrays is placed on a the solar cell module at a distance equal to its focal length which is 5  cm. Test results show that the designed model effectively increases the efficiency of the PV system, reducing its cost and loss of energy [7].|$|E

The glass lenses are moulded by press moulding with micro ceramics moulds made of tungsten carbides (WC).

The polisher is composed of a magnetostrictive vibrator and a small polishing tool, and the small polishing tool is mounted {{on the head of}} the magnetostrictive vibrator. The concrete design of the magnetostrictive vibrating polisher is assisted by the finite element method (FEM) and through vibration mode analysis, the 4 th mode is selected. It generates a circular vibration trace at a frequency of 9. 2 kHz with a radius of 30 µm. The polisher is fixed in a 5 -axis (X, Y, Z, B and C) controlled polishing system. Through some fundamental polishing experiments, the shapes of the removal function is acquired and surface roughness is reduced to 9 nm Rz (1 nm Ra) ...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{insulating}} spacecraft {{surfaces are}} vulnerable to nonuniform charge buildup due to particles emitted by the sun. On Mars, insulating surfaces of exploration vehicles and structures {{will be affected by}} dust coatings possibly held in place by triboelectric surface charge. Application of a conductive film may be a solution to the charging problem, but the coating must be highly transparent if used on solar <b>panels,</b> <b>lenses,</b> etc. Sheet resistivity requirements depend on the application and are in the range 10 (exp 2) - 10 (exp 8) ohms/square. Co-deposited indium tin oxide (ITO) and MgF 2 is promising, with high transparency, tailorable electrical properties, and durability to atomic oxygen. Due to ITO's relatively narrow bandgap (approximately 3. 5 eV), the film might absorb enough ultraviolet to protect polymeric substrates. Recent work on dual-magnetron-sputtered ITO-MgF 2 showed that a variety of polymeric substrates can be coated at room temperature. However, the sheet resistivity is very sensitive to composition, suggestive of a percolation transition. This could be a serious problem for large-scale coating production. We will report on attempts to control film composition by plasma emission monitoring of the ITO and MgF 2 guns...|$|R
50|$|November 1973 saw {{the next}} series of changes, to the ZG series Fairlane. The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four {{horizontal}} bar grille and revised tail-light <b>lenses</b> and garnish <b>panel.</b> An anniversary {{model with a}} standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed {{the same as the}} 1974 versions.The Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coupé called the Ford Landau (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop and therefore featured a 111 in wheelbase as opposed to the 121 in wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their concealed headlamps, which would be revealed when their vacuum-operated grille sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on an option offered on an earlier Ford Thunderbird. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows and a 351 cuin L V8 engine.|$|R
