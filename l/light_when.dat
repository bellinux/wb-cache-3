5|$|In August 2016, new {{information}} about Wallenberg's death came to <b>light</b> <b>when</b> the diary of KGB head Ivan Serov surfaced after Serov's granddaughter found the diary hidden in a wall of her house. “I have no doubts that Wallenberg was liquidated in 1947” Serov wrote.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, two further short {{clips from}} The Power of the Daleks– {{along with a}} higher-quality version {{of one of the}} extant scenes– were {{discovered}} in a 1966 episode of the BBC science series Tomorrow's World. The clips, lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film (as opposed to film recordings), came to <b>light</b> <b>when</b> the Tomorrow's World segment was broadcast as part of the 11 September 2005 edition of the clip-based nostalgia show Sunday Past Times on BBC Two. After being alerted to the footage, Paul Vanezis of the Doctor Who Restoration Team tracked down the uncut version of the clip.|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings <b>light</b> <b>when</b> there is only darkness of error.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces <b>light</b> <b>when</b> the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Unleashed began {{development}} in 2006 after {{the creation of}} its game engine, the Hedgehog Engine. The game was initially conceived as the sequel to Sonic Adventure 2, but the development team began to introduce enough new innovations that separated it from previous games, and it was renamed Unleashed. The Werehog gameplay was conceived to help introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series. The game's existence was first brought to <b>light</b> <b>when</b> Sega trademarked the Unleashed name, and shortly after, images and a gameplay video were leaked {{to the public in}} March 2008. Three versions of the game were developed: one by Sonic Team for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, one by Dimps for the Wii and PlayStation 2, and one by Gameloft for mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet <b>light</b> <b>when</b> compared to the originals. Langer surmised {{it was because of the}} chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.|$|E

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing <b>light.</b> <b>When</b> they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of <b>light.</b> <b>When</b> eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized <b>light</b> <b>when</b> it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Presently in work zones, {{standard}} barricade {{warning lights}} {{are used to}} provide channelizing and warning functions. These yellow flashing lights are presently used for different work zone activities. Concepts for a non-standard barricade lighting system were developed and evaluated: flashing red <b>lights</b> <b>when</b> traffic is stopped or very slow within a work zone, flashing green <b>lights</b> <b>when</b> a work zone is inactive and traffic should proceed normally, expanding yellow <b>lights</b> <b>when</b> drivers should slow down and exercise enhanced caution, and sweeping yellow <b>lights</b> <b>when</b> lane closures require drivers {{to move to the}} right or left. Prototype units were designed and fabricated. A survey of driver understanding of these functions indicated that drivers would probably understand all of the functions but that the flashing red and green functions could result in conflicts with other roadway traffic control devices. A field evaluation of the expanding and sweeping functions in mock-up work zones demonstrated that driver comprehension of the lights could be translated to a driving situation. Drivers changed lanes sooner (providing a 40 % longer lane change margin) in response to the sweeping function than to conventional flashing barricade lights, and subjective ratings about the intende...|$|R
