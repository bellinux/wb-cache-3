The main principle behind various identities is that identity as well culture is flexible and ever changing units. The meta-theoretic approach used is social constructivism as it deals with how individuals construct themselves and perceive others in social interaction. The process of constructing social relations happens {{through the use of}} language and how the use of language creates different meanings in different contexts. The case used in the thesis is the MMORPG (Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Game) World of Warcraft (WoW), which is currently “inhabited” by 12 million active subscribers monthly. This number is more than twice the population of Denmark. The players of WoW are spread globally on many different servers to play on. The server used for this thesis is the European Bloodfeather server. In my search for answers I have created an avatar, which is a virtual digital representation of the player set in a virtual environment. By doing so I have been able to conduct what Celia Pearce calls Game Ethnography – a form of ethnography that takes place inside virtual worlds. Pearce states {{that the only way to}} examine online behavior in virtual worlds is by being there yourself. My problem definition is: How does the language and social interaction used by WoW-players define their online identity? And in order to answer that I have included theory on global sociolinguistics using theories by sociolinguists David Crystal and Jan Blommaert who have provided me with a range of sociolinguistic tools and insight to help me analyze gamer lingo also known as leet speek, which is a dialect used by gamers online. Furthermore, the focus on social interaction is dealt with using sociological theories by Erving Goffman and Michel Maffesoli. They both deal with social interaction and identity. Goffman is known for his theory on the representation of self and Maffesoli is known for his theory on group identity, which he calls neo-tribalism. Also included in the research was a field trip to a big digital festival in Sweden known as DreamHack, an event that holds the world record for the biggest <b>LAN-party</b> hosting over 12. 000 people. <b>LAN-party</b> is a local-area-network computer event usually hosted by private people or by schools during weekends. The idea was to conduct semi-structured interviews with active players of WoW while observing how players act while engaging in their favorite activities. Another important aspect of the thesis is the use of intertextuality in a game like WoW, which has some very distinct features and intertextual references to popular culture as well as finer literary culture. In order to use intertextuality I have used theory from Norman Fairclough, who is one of the founders of critical discourse theory. I concluded that language alone is not the only factor when dealing with identity of WoW-players, but it is an essential part. Leet speek has been used before WoW was launched in 2004, but many of the people who play WoW have been playing games for years and have picked up the language elsewhere and the people new to WoW quickly learn the language and discourse used in gaming. Looking at identity among WoW-players it is evident that the choice of guild reflects your identity as a player. You are not only in a guild you are part of constructing that guild’s identity...|$|E
50|$|A notable {{organization}} is Gameparty.net, a website that {{functions as a}} central hub in the Dutch game event scene, who also hosts two large annual events, TheParty and CampZone. Other major <b>LAN-parties</b> and organisations that have organized 1000+ visitor events include Drome, Netgamez, LAN = Life and Regroup. Most of these organizations operate on a non-profit basis, finding sponsors within the computer and gaming world {{to be able to}} operate budget-neutral.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands, {{several large}} and smaller LAN parties and other gaming events are held yearly. In recent years, the 1000+ {{visitors}} have declined in popularity, with the scene seeing a shift towards smaller, more sociable events and/or events that offer {{more than just}} non-stop gaming. Additional activities include (outdoor) sports events, quizzes and other non-gaming competitions. In addition, small <b>LAN-parties</b> held at home for typically 5-15 visitors, remain popular.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the official}} U. S. Army PC-game, America's Army, {{against the backdrop}} of the ongoing war on terror and the military-entertainment complex. It considers the dual role of the game as a recruiting tool and a propaganda instrument. The expansion of the military-entertainment complex has significant consequences for the militarisation of the domestic sphere and youth popular culture. Whereas commercial game developers and publishers are eager to tap into First Person Shooter mod communities in order to institutionalise both cultural and economic value-exchanges, it is impossible to modify the official U. S. Army Game in any way. Yet, a closer look at America' s Army and its community shows the appropriation of various other elements of contemporary game culture: for instance, clan culture, <b>LAN-parties</b> and various forms of fan production. The analysis of America's Army and its community demonstrates that the appropriation of game culture has serious political-ideological implication...|$|R
40|$|Video {{games and}} the social effects that they inflict upon society and the {{individual}} have been a highly debated subject. While studies {{have been made in}} regards to several social issues and their connection to video games, there was little research in regards to physical game gatherings like <b>LAN-parties,</b> as well as larger game gatherings like Dreamhack, and what the social effects of having physical contact with other people are at these gatherings. The goal with this study was to answer the question: “What are the social effects for the individual when participating in physical video game gatherings?”. This was done through a qualitative study by conducting five semi-structured interviews at the physical game gathering called Umeå Game Night that was located in the Umeå cultural center Klossen at Ålidhems Centrum. Four of the participants were male and one female. “Snowball-sampling” was used to gather the participants for the study through Game Night’s Facebook group. However, this sampling was unsuccessful when no participants were gained from it. Instead I had to take direct contact with people at the game gathering. The interviews were all done during the game gathering in their facility and were then transcribed for analysis with two types of methods; an inductive analysis that was backed up by a deductive analysis in the form of Activity Theory using Engeström’s model of Activity Theory. The results of this study showed that physical game gatherings helped to overcome some negative social effects that the participants thought surrounded online game as well as other social problems that they brought up during the interviews, like toxic behaviour, discrimination, and the feeling of not being welcome. There was an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the participants when being at the game gathering. Being able to socialize with other people proved to be the main motivation. However, even though physical game gatherings showed to improve negative social effects surrounding game, the learning process was still difficult to overcome for new players, and participating in these game gathering may even have negative results in keeping the new players interested in wanting to play as well as participate at the physical game gatherings. This was mainly because of the skill disparity between the experienced players, who were the majority at the game gathering, and the new players, who would feel potentially frustrated from seeing the experienced players being much better than themselves. However, the less experienced female participant in the study indicated that this issue may still be overcome, but more research {{needs to be done to}} see how big the issue surrounding the learning process when playing games at game gatherings actually is, and if there are ways to solve it...|$|R
