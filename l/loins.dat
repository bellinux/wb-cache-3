5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their <b>loins,</b> symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and <b>loins,</b> as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the <b>loins</b> are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E

However, using carcass <b>loin</b> muscle area as the true value, the standard error of prediction for real-time ultrasound <b>loin</b> muscle area was lower than those for <b>loin</b> muscle areas predicted from either real-time ultrasound <b>loin</b> depth or carcass <b>loin</b> depth. Real-time ultrasound and carcass depth or length or a combination thereof is a less accurate predictor of carcass <b>loin</b> muscle area than simply real-time ultrasound <b>loin</b> muscle area alone...|$|R

50|$|A pork <b>loin</b> joint or pork <b>loin</b> roast is {{a larger}} section of the <b>loin</b> which is roasted. It can take two forms: 'bone in', which still has the <b>loin</b> ribs attached, or 'boneless', which is often tied with butchers string to prevent the roast from falling apart. Pork rind may {{be added to the}} fat side of the joint to give a {{desirable}} crackling which the <b>loin</b> otherwise lacks.|$|R
5|$|The Canadian horse has {{a rather}} short, high-set {{head with a}} broad forehead. The neck is arched and graceful, and the chest, back and <b>loins</b> broad and {{strongly}} muscled. The shoulders and croup are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression of strength and agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the <b>loins</b> and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller thigh and a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the <b>loins</b> are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E

5000|$|Loin: This can {{be cured}} to make back bacon or Canadian-style bacon. The <b>loin</b> and belly can be cured {{together}} to make a side of bacon. The <b>loin</b> can also be divided up into roasts (blade <b>loin</b> roasts, center <b>loin</b> roasts, and sirloin roasts come from the front, center, or rear of the <b>loin),</b> back ribs (also called baby back ribs, or riblets), pork cutlets, and pork chops. A pork <b>loin</b> crown roast is arranged into a circle, either boneless or with rib bones protruding upward as points in a crown. Pork tenderloin, removed from the <b>loin,</b> should be practically free of fat. This high quality meat shows a very ordered arrangement of muscle cells that can cause light diffraction and structural coloration.|$|R
40|$|When pigs {{were fed}} to 230 Ib, high-lean {{genotype}} <b>loin</b> eyes had less visual marbling {{and a higher}} saturation index (more vivid or intense color) than medium-lean genotype <b>loin</b> eyes. <b>Loin</b> eye chops from high-lean gilts had greater cooking losses and WarnerBratzler shear values (mechanically tougher) than those from high-lean barrows and medium-lean barrows and gilts. When pigs were fed to 280 Ib, medium-lean genotype <b>loin</b> eyes had a lighter color visually and indicated by Hunter L* values, more marbling, less firmness, more moisture exudate, and a higher chop thaw loss than high-lean <b>loin</b> eyes.

25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or <b>loins)</b> in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E

25|$|In males, orgasm {{is usually}} {{associated}} with ejaculation. Each ejection is accompanied with continuous pulses of sexual pleasure, especially in the penis and <b>loins.</b> Other sensations may be felt strongly among the lower spine, or lower back. The first and second convulsions are usually the most intense in sensation, and produce the greatest quantity of semen. Thereafter, each contraction {{is associated with a}} diminishing volume of semen and a milder sensation of pleasure.|$|E
25|$|Nair women {{traditionally}} wore a cloth {{wrapped around}} the <b>loins,</b> and a second cloth falling from the waist to the knees. Earlier in history, nothing was worn above the waist, but {{at the start of}} the 20th century it was noted that Nair women had begun to cover their upper body with a loose cloth when traveling, and that a sense of shame had begun to reduce the custom of leaving a woman's upper body uncovered.|$|E
25|$|Theodore Roosevelt himself {{likened the}} flesh of young black bears to that of pork, and not as coarse or flavourless as the meat of grizzlies. The most favoured cuts of the black bear's meat are {{concentrated}} in the legs and <b>loins.</b> Meat from the neck, front legs and shoulders is usually ground into minced meat or used for stews and casseroles. Keeping the fat tends to give the meat a strong flavour. As black bears can have trichinellosis, cooking temperatures need to be high in order to kill the parasites.|$|E

Cancerous humor, which would lie dormant in the system their lifetime, is inflamed, and commences its eating, destructive work. The mind is often utterly ruined, and insanity supervenes.|$|E
25|$|The Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order {{founded in}} the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli, a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia {{at the time of}} the Mongol invasions (1219–23). This order gained a great {{following}} in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called Bel evladları (children of the <b>loins),</b> and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the Babağan, those faithful to the path (yol evladları - children of the way) who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.|$|E

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{a second time}} to ask what he saw, he replied that he saw a seething pot tipping from the north, and God said {{that out of the}} north evil would break forth upon all Israel. For God would call all the kingdoms of the north to come, and they would set their thrones at Jerusalem's gate, against its walls, and against the cities of Judah. God would utter God's {{judgments}} against Judah, as its people had forsaken God and worshipped the work of their own hands. God thus directed Jeremiah to gird his <b>loins,</b> arise, and speak to the Judean people all that God commanded, for God had made Jeremiah a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the land of Judah, its rulers, its priests, and its people. They would fight against him, but they would not prevail, for God would be with him to deliver him.|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} include eyes {{that are very}} clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and <b>loins.</b> The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and {{is often associated with}} a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath {{and went up to}} the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the <b>loins</b> are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that the summit of the mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E
40|$|Chicken breast {{was more}} {{resistant}} to various exogenous oxidative factors than beef loin: addition of NaCl did not increase TBARS values and nonheme content of raw chicken breast, but significantly increased those of raw beef <b>loin</b> patties during storage. Addition of NaCl+Mb did not affect lipid oxidation in raw chicken breast patties, but decreased the TBARS of beef <b>loin</b> during storage. Addition of NaCl+Fe(III) or NaCl+Fe(II) increased the TBARS values of both raw chicken breast and beef <b>loin</b> during storage, but the increase was greater in beef <b>loin</b> than in chicken breast. The TBARS values of all cooked chicken breast and beef <b>loin</b> increased during 7 -day storage, but the increases in cooked chicken patties were significantly smaller than those of cooked beef <b>loin</b> patties with the same treatments. Addition of NaCl and cooking caused severe degradation of myoglobin, leading to {{a significant increase in}} free ionic iron content in beef <b>loin.</b> It is suggested that free ionic iron is the major catalyst for lipid oxidation, and the high “storage-stable” ferric ionic reducing capacity and “heat-stable” ferric ion reducing capacity in chicken breast were responsible for the high oxidative stability for raw and cooked chicken breast compared with beef <b>loin</b> under prooxidants, cooking and storage conditions...|$|R
