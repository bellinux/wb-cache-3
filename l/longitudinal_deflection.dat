40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} two areas of high {{interest}} in solar physics: {{the propagation of}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs); and the heating and thermal evolution of coronal loops. In our study of CMEs, two separate techniques are employed to derive the three-dimensional (3 -D) position angles and kinematic profiles of three separate CME events as they propagate through the heliosphere and into interplanetary space. By analysing observations from two vantage points of Sun-centred, and coronagraph stereoscopic data, provided by the NASA STEREO spacecraft, a triangulation technique is used to pin-point {{the location of the}} CME’s leading edge in 3 -D space. The resulting direction of the CME is compared with that derived from a method which employs the construction of “j-maps”; continuous running-difference height-time maps of coronal ejecta displaying solar transients along a selected radial path as they propagate from the Sun. This technique uses the assumption that a CME will experience no change in velocity or direction once it has reached the field of view of STEREO’s Heliospheric Imager (HI). It is found that the two methods agree well for fast CMEs (propagating faster than the ambient solar wind speed), but there is a large discrepancy in the slow CME (propagating slower than the ambient solar wind speed), which is due to the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection</b> of the CME by the interplanetary magnetic field. Also, the analyses show that the CME experiences both a latitudinal and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection</b> early in its acceleration / propagation phase. The study of coronal loops consists of two parts; hydrodynamics and hydrostatics. Firstly, a 1 -D hydrodynamic Lagrange re-map code is employed to numerically model a 10 Mm coronal loop which is split into many sub-resolution strands. Each strand is heated impulsively, by localised discrete energy bursts, and the strands are then amalgamated to form a global loop system. The effects of changing the parameters of the simulation upon the temperature and velocity profiles of the loop are examined and compared to observations. It is found that the multi-strand model can accurately match synthetic velocity observations to those from spectroscopic satellite observations from Hinode EIS, say. Finally, a phase plane analysis is introduced to study the temperature structure along 1 -D hydrostatic coronal loops. Using a new four-range optically thin radiative loss function, it is possible to analytically solve the thermal equilibrium equation and investigate the resulting solution space. It is found that the new radiative function produces many new solutions to the phase plane with a subsequent impact on coronal loop thermal equilibria.

40|$|This {{research}} {{study is to}} introduce and investigate an effective technique of external pre-tensioning using steel strapping (SSTT) to reduce the brittleness and enhance the ductility of high-strength concrete cylinders. Fifteen cylinders with dimension of 150 mm and 300 mm in diameter and height respectively were casted, pre-tensioned with two and four layers of steel strapping and tested to failure under uniaxial monotonic and cyclic compression. The behaviour of SSTT confined cylinders was studied through their stress-strain relationship upon the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection,</b> transverse strain, mode of failure, confinement ratio, and existence of an envelope curve. It is experimentally proved that SSTT confinement do helps in controlling the brittleness problem of high-strength concrete {{and at the same}} time, enhancing both the concrete ductility and compressive strength up to 46. 2 % and 112. 5 % respectively. The envelope curve of uniaxial cyclic loading also coincides with the corresponding monotonic loading curve, regardless of any loading activity. The observed stress-strain relationship of confined cylinders with different confining ratios are compared with existing strength and strain models and a stress-strain prediction model, the result showed a linear relationship between the compressive strength and strain enhancement and confining ratio, with acceptable agreement between the prediction model...|$|E

This is due to its greater sen-sitivity to control inputs and disturbances as well as higher bandwidth of dynamics.

A tracking controller based on optimal control theory is synthesized as part of the devel-opment of an autonomous helicopter. Some issues in regards to control contraints are addressed. The weighting between state tracking performance and control power expenditure is analyzed.

The model is computationally efficient and it only requires a limited set of easily obtained input parameters.

40|$|Between the 13 and 16 of February 2011 {{a series}} of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) erupted from {{multiple}} polarity inversion lines within active region 11158. For seven of these CMEs we use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) flux rope model to determine the CME trajectory using both Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and coronagraph images. We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model for nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the deflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the ForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME deflections range in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. All CMEs deflect to the north but we find variations {{in the direction of}} the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection.</b> The rotations range between 5 and 50 with both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations occurring. Three of the CMEs begin with initial positions within 2 degrees of one another. These three CMEs all deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and rotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however, respectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection and rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial propagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass. Ultimately, only one of these seven CMEs yielded discernible in situ signatures near Earth, despite the active region facing near Earth throughout the eruptions. We suggest that the differences in the deflection and rotation of the CMEs can explain whether each CME impacted or missed the Earth. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, accepted in Solar Physic...|$|E
40|$|This {{observation}} may {{support a}} concept that the IJ deflection in normal health and in arterial hypertension {{may be influenced by}} vascular factors. B- 2. Taking the hemodynamic behavior and age into consideration, the corrected IJc was determined in arterial hypertension. Among N (normal), W and W+E 2 ̆ 7 types, a marked difference of IJc was noted between patients younger than 39 years of age and older than 40 years of age. IJc in M type was small andnotrelated to age. No definite correlationship could not be seen in the E 2 ̆ 7 type. IJc of valvular diseases was correlated to Vm. The same tendency was obtained by corrected Vbc, i. e. the corrected velocity of the body displacement Vb. B- 3. Stumpf 2 ̆ 7 s X-ray kymographic classification and IJc were investigated in arterial hypertension. IJc of the cases of Stump f 2 ̆ 7 s II type was less than that of Stump f 2 ̆ 7 s I type in juvenile, middle-aged and senile hypertension. The cases of Stumpf 2 ̆ 7 s II type in middle aged and senile hypertension showed the definitely small IJc deflection. The cases of Stumf 2 ̆ 7 s I type in juvenile hypertension showed the fairly large IJc deflection. The IJc in arterial, hypertension seemed to have close relationship to Stump f 2 ̆ 7 s types. B- 4. IJ {{may be one of the}} good indicators to cardio-vascular function. As mentioned above, IJ seems to be more gravely affected by vascular factors in arterial hypertension which is free from valvular disorders. In mitral and aortic valvular diseases, IJ seems to affected much more by cardiac factors. C. The vectorial analysis of Bcg with special reference to the transeverse deflection. The methods for the vectorial analysis are yet unsatisfactory. The present work indicated of the vectorial analyses for the transverse deflection of ballistic movement. C- 1. By horizontal vectorial analysis of Bcg, the maximal vector J^^^ was obtained. Its angle was denoted by αJ^^^. The area of the J vector loop above the abscissa was named a^^^J. a^^^J/J^^^ implied a mean value of the transverse deflection. This simple procedure made it possible to clarify the unknown difference of ballistic movements in various cardiac diseases and to characterize the peculiarity of underlying diseases. The large <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection</b> of Asl and the large transverse deflection of MS were an excelent example. In arterial hypertension, the W+E 2 ̆ 7 type showed decreased a^^^J (decrease length and breadth). The M type showed marked increased both transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection</b> than the W+E 2 ̆ 7 type. Increased transverse deflection in the M type suggested that relative Ms might be contributory to this phenomenon. αJ^^^ of normal health and aortic disorders was in the 1 st quadrant and that of mitral disorders was in the 2 nd quadrant, αJ^^^ of arterial hypertension was in the 1 st and/or 2 nd quadrant. C- 2. The above specific findings in the aortic insufficiency and mitral stenosis were analyzed with those of Eky and X-ray kymography. The hemodynamic bases of the argumention of either longitudinal or transverse directions were discussed. The peripheral vascular factors are thought to relate dominantly to the IJ deflection, of Bcg. However, the cardiac factors also should not be neglected. In order to clarify this problem, cardiovascular dynamical analyses were performed. simultaneously by the methods of Wezler, Blumberger and Holldack, and vectorial Bcg. Methods Starr 2 ̆ 7 s high frequency Bcg of the horizontal, two directional type i. e. head-foot and left-right directions was used for the qualitative and semi-quantitative studies. This Bcg was standerdized by the Committee on Ballistocardiographic Terminology in U. S. A. (1956). Pcg., Ecg., carotid and femoral arterial pulse waves and respiratory curve were recorded simultaneously. The Bcgraphic findings were compared with the cardio-vascular dynamics obtained by Wezler, Blumberger and Holldack 2 ̆ 7 s methods as well as the X-ray kymographic and electrokymographic findings. A.

40|$|Arch bridge {{structural}} solution {{has been}} known for centuries, in fact the simple nature of arch that require low tension and shear strength was an advantage as the simple materials like stone and brick were the only option back in ancient centuries. By the pass of time especially after industrial revolution, the new materials were adopted in construction of arch bridges to reach longer spans. Nowadays one long span arch bridge is made of steel, concrete or combination of these two as "CFST", as the result of using these high strength materials, very long spans can be achieved. The current record for longest arch belongs to Chaotianmen bridge over Yangtze river in China with 552 meters span made of steel and the longest reinforced concrete type is Wanxian bridge which also cross the Yangtze river through a 420 meters span. Today the designer is no longer limited by span length as long as arch bridge is the most applicable solution among other approaches, i. e. cable stayed and suspended bridges are more reasonable if very long span is desired. Like any super structure, the economical and architectural aspects in construction of a bridge is extremely important, in other words, as a narrower bridge has better appearance, it also require smaller volume of material which make the design more economical. Design of such bridge, beside the high strength materials, requires precise structural analysis approaches capable of integrating the combination of material behaviour and complex geometry of structure and various types of loads which may be applied to bridge during its service life. Depend on the design strategy, analysis may only evaluates the linear elastic behaviour of structure or consider the nonlinear properties as well. Although most of structures in the past were designed to act in their elastic range, the rapid increase in computational capacity allow us to consider different sources of nonlinearities in order to achieve a more realistic evaluations where the dynamic behaviour of bridge is important especially in seismic zones where large movements may occur or structure experience P - _ effect during the earthquake. The above mentioned type of analysis is computationally expensive and very time consuming. In recent years, several methods were proposed in order to resolve this problem. Discussion of recent developments on these methods and their application on long span concrete arch bridges is the main goal of this research. Accordingly available long span concrete arch bridges have been studied to gather the critical information about their geometrical aspects and properties of their materials. Based on concluded information, several concrete arch bridges were designed for further studies. The main span of these bridges range from 100 to 400 meters. The Structural analysis methods implemented in in this study are as following: Elastic Analysis: Direct Response History Analysis (DRHA) : This method solves the direct equation of motion over time history of applied acceleration or imposed load in linear elastic range. Modal Response History Analysis (MRHA) : Similar to DRHA, this method is also based on time history, but the equation of motion is simplified to single degree of freedom system and calculates the response of each mode independently. Performing this analysis require less time than DRHA. Modal Response Spectrum Analysis (MRSA) : As it is obvious from its name, this method calculates the peak response of structure for each mode and combine them using modal combination rules based on the introduced spectra of ground motion. This method is expected to be fastest among Elastic analysis. Inelastic Analysis: Nonlinear Response History Analysis (NL-RHA) : The most accurate strategy to address significant nonlinearities in structural dynamics is undoubtedly the nonlinear response history analysis which is similar to DRHA but extended to inelastic range by updating the stiffness matrix for every iteration. This onerous task, clearly increase the computational cost especially for unsymmetrical buildings that requires to be analyzed in a full 3 D model for taking the torsional effects in to consideration. Modal Pushover Analysis (MPA) : The Modal Pushover Analysis is basically the MRHA but extended to inelastic stage. After all, the MRHA cannot solve the system of dynamics because the resisting force fs(u; u_) is unknown for inelastic stage. The solution of MPA for this obstacle is using the previously recorded fs to evaluate system of dynamics. Extended Modal Pushover Analysis (EMPA) : Expanded Modal pushover is a one of very recent proposed methods which evaluates response of structure under multi-directional excitation using the modal pushover analysis strategy. In one specific mode,the original pushover neglect the contribution of the directions different than characteristic one, this is reasonable in regular symmetric building but a structure with complex shape like long span arch bridges may go through strong modal coupling. This method intend to consider modal coupling while it take same time of computation as MPA. Coupled Nonlinear Static Pushover Analysis (CNSP) : The EMPA includes the contribution of non-characteristic direction to the formal MPA procedure. However the static pushovers in EMPA are performed individually for every mode, accordingly the resulted values from different modes can be combined but this is only valid in elastic phase; as soon as any element in structure starts yielding the neutral axis of that section is no longer fixed for both response during the earthquake, meaning the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflection</b> unavoidably affect the transverse one or vice versa. To overcome this drawback, the CNSP suggests executing pushover analysis for governing modes of each direction at the same time. This strategy is estimated to be more accurate than MPA and EMPA, moreover the calculation time is reduced because only one pushover analysis is required. Regardless of the strategy, the accuracy of structural analysis is highly dependent on modelling and numerical integration approaches used in evaluation of each method. Therefore the widely used Finite Element Method is implemented in process of all analysis performed in this research. In order to address the study, chapter 2, starts with gathered information about constructed long span arch bridges, this chapter continuous with geometrical and material definition of new models. Chapter 3 provides the detailed information about structural analysis strategies; furthermore the step by step description of procedure of all methods is available in Appendix A.

40|$|An energy {{harvester}} {{operating in}} the thickness-mode (TMH) or longitudinal-mode (LMH) consists of a piezoelectric element which is sandwiched between a proof mass and a base. The piezo-element is poled along a direction perpendicular to the electrodes. When the base is subjected to a sinusoidal excitation, along the poling direction, a rela-tive motion is generated between the proof mass and the base producing mechanical strain in the piezoelectric element. The resulting strain is converted into electrical power {{by virtue of the}} direct piezoelectric effect. In this study, a shear-mode harvester (SMH) is considered as a viable alternative to the TMH and LMH to enhance the harvested output power. The enhancement is generated by capitalizing {{on the fact that the}} strain constant of the piezoelectric in shear is much higher than those due to thickness or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflections.</b> To achieve such an enhancement, the piezoelectric element is poled along a direction parallel to its electrodes and is sandwiched between a proof mass and oscillat-ing base in a design similar to that of the TMH and the LMH.

A prototype power transmission structure designed {{to address the issue}} of cascading collapse, be efficiently constructed, and be easily repaired in the event of a catastrophic load such as a transmission line break was investigated. This structure utilizes post-tensioning and a joint to allow for large deflections. The specially designed joint isolates inelastic deformation to structural fuses that are inexpensive and easy to replace. The structure 2 ̆ 7 s high deflection capacity could isolate damage from extreme loads to a few structures near the origin of the load and prevent a cascading collapse. A scale model was constructed and tested in the laboratory. The test procedure and structural behavior are discussed and compared to predictions from alternative methods of analysis. The prototype satisfied primary design objectives for behavior and could offer significant advantages relative to current design practice for power transmission structures. Currently, many resources exist to help designers accurately define and apply transverse loads to power transmission structures. However, there is less guidance available for longitudinal loads such as those applied by broken conductors. Current practice focuses on mitigating the effects of cascade events rather than stopping them altogether. An alternative approach for considering longitudinal loading is discussed that could prevent cascades through the use of the prototype structure that can sustain high loads while undergoing large <b>longitudinal</b> <b>deflections.</b> Such an approach could increase system reliability and security while reducing both initial and life-cycle costs of the power transmission infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In certain {{situations}} the punching {{strength of a}} connection may become inadequate after construction due to changes of connection geometry from drilling or coring, or from changes of building use, or construction and design errors. The use of shear reinforcement {{in the form of}} Shear Bolts is a new approach to strengthening slab-column connections. Reported in this thesis are the results of research on the use of shear bolts for reinforced concrete interior slab-column connections without unbalanced moments. Six slab specimens were tested with different configurations of shear bolts and without shear reinforcement to verify the effectiveness of this method of reinforcement. The central idea is an externally applied shear reinforcing technique that provides strength in shear at par with other conventional reinforcement types {{on the one hand and}} offering the distinct advantage and flexibility of external application after construction. A shear bolt consists of an unhardened steel shaft threaded at one end and flared out to form a bearing/anchor surface on the other end. All six specimens were designed to fail in shear before reaching their flexural capacity, two of which were more critical than the others because of the presence of openings simulating utility ducts around the column perimeter. From the tests, comparisons of predicted loads with the failure loads indicated a higher ultimate load for slab reinforced with the bolt system. Similarly, strain measurements from strain gauges attached to the <b>longitudinal</b> steel and <b>deflection</b> profiles of the slab showed that the new method was efficient in increasing the shear capacity of the slabs. In summary, the test program showed that shear bolts are effective in transforming the behaviour of the slab-column connections from a brittle punching shear failure mode to a more ductile flexural one. Deflection profiles at different load stages, and particularly at failure, show increased deflections for specimens reinforced with bolt reinforcements. This indicates an increased ductility at the connection. Similarly, load and flexural reinforcement strain magnitudes show substantial improvements in the strength of the connections...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and investigates two common techniques of modeling large periodic side shell openings in global {{finite element models}} for evaluation of passenger ship hull girder static response in early design phase. The first technique is based on homogenization of side shell structure and modeling side shell openings with homogenized orthotropic material using 4 -noded and 8 -noded shell elements. Second technique is direct modeling of side shell openings using coarse mesh, where cost of simplification to geometry and mesh size is studied. The proposed techniques are validated with respect to 3 D fine mesh analysis in two cases. First, periodic side shell model is studied for evaluation of correct in plane response under uniform axial and shear loading. Second, the techniques are investigated in a box-like ship under 4 -point bending load. Accuracy of both techniques is evaluated by means of hull girder <b>deflection,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> deck forces and side shell vertical shear forces. In addition, the performance in border of periodic grid and at areas of high strain gradients is investigated. The results indicate that equivalent orthotropic modeling of both central and offset openings gives accurate global <b>deflection</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> bending response in a simple model where strain gradients are small. When significant strain gradients are introduced e. g. where internal longitudinal bulkheads are discontinuous, the <b>deflection</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> bending response accuracies are compromised. Local response of orthotropic model is less accurate and especially compromised at edges of periodic grid and areas of high strain gradient. Additional local errors arise due to micropolar behavior of offset openings, where the equivalence is only achieved in forces but not in moments due to application of classical theory of elasticity. No significant difference in response is observed whether 4 - or 8 -noded elements are applied. For coarse mesh modeling a sensitivity analysis is performed taking account effect of simplification of structure and mesh size. A reasonable compromise between modeling effort, computational cost and accuracy is found at 4 x 4 elements per opening. Despite being stiffer in uniformly loaded periodic side shell model, the accuracy of coarse mesh modeling is shown to be reliable in application to box-like ship, where performance is not significantly affected by strain gradients and boundary effects...|$|R

As the construction stages go on, the statically determinate structure changes to a statically indeterminate one, which should be considered in the design process. Creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of prestressing steel may lead to excess long-term deflection and may cause redistributions in internal forces and stresses. In the previous study (Hedjazi et. al.) a general simulation for time-dependent analysis of segmentally erected prestressed concrete box-girder bridges has been presented. A three dimensional finite-element model for the balanced-cantilever construction of segmental bridges, including effects of the load history, material nonlinearity, creep, shrinkage, and aging of concrete and relaxation of prestressing steel was developed using ABAQUS software. The analysis has shown significant changes in the values of <b>deflections,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> stresses and internal forces as a result of long-term effects of creep and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of the prestressing steel which has led to new arrangement and the increase in the number of mid-span continuity cables. But some times, adding new cables or rearranging the cables in existing bridges, is impossible. In these cases strengthening of the deck is a fast and economical solution. The aim of this study is to analyze the structural behavior of prestressed concrete box girder bridges when strengthening with fiber reinforced polymer laminates (FRP). Three examples of prestressed concrete box-girder bridges segmentally-erected using the balanced-cantilever technique have previously discussed to demonstrate their long-term behavior under dead load and effects of live load at the end of construction and different ages up to a thousand days by performing nonlinear analysis up to failure. In the present study, same examples of prestressed concrete box-girder bridges is being strengthened using FRP laminates. A moment–curvature analysis was subsequently carried out to investigate the flexural characteristics of the prestressed concrete box-girder bridges prior to and after strengthening with CFRP laminates. The results shows that significant strength can be gained at the ultimate limit state. The increase in flexural resistance at ultimate does provide an adequate margin of safety against further overloading...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{strength of the}} hull girder for large passenger ships with numerous decks and openings was investigated. The collapse of the hull girder, composed of the hull itself and the superstructure, as compared to a single deck ship with a continuous structure, involves several important structural phenomena that complicate understanding of this process. In this study, a theory of a non-linear coupled beam method was created. This method enables one to estimate the non-linear response of a passenger ship with a large multi-deck superstructure subjected to longitudinal bending. The method {{is based on the}} assumption that the ship structure can be modelled as a set of coupled beams. Each deck in the superstructure and also in the main hull can be considered as a thin-walled beam with non-linear structural behaviour. These beams are coupled to adjacent beams with non-linear springs called vertical and shear members, modelling the stiffness properties of the longitudinal bulkheads, side shells and pillars. Special emphasis was placed on the modelling of the shear members. A semi-analytic formula of the load-displacement curve was developed by help of the non-linear finite element analysis. Also, the load-end shortening curves under axial load taken from the literature were validated with the finite element method. The reverse loading options are included into the behaviour of the structural members. The created approach allows the calculation of the normal stresses and vertical deflections in the arbitrary location of the whole hull girder. Average <b>longitudinal</b> displacements and <b>deflections</b> of deck structures and shear stresses in the side structures can be estimated as well. The method is a further development of the linear coupled beam method. The {{ultimate strength}} of the hull girder was studied also with the non-linear finite element method. This required an investigation of the element mesh configuration in order to find an optimum mesh type and size. The prismatic hull girder of a post-Panamax passenger ship was chosen as a case study. The ultimate strength was estimated both in hogging and sagging loading with the coupled beam method and with the finite element method. The results of these two different methods, presented in the form of the bending moment versus the deflection of the hull girder, show good correlation up to the area where the moment starts to decrease. In both loading cases, the failure starts by the shear collapse in the longitudinal bulkhead. The ultimate stage of the strength was reached in the sagging loading when the failure progressed to the lower decks and correspondingly, in the hogging loading when the bottom structures failed in compression. The results on the structural failure modes show clearly that the shear strength of the longitudinal bulkheads and side structures is a very important issue on the ultimate strength problem of a passenger ship. reviewe...|$|R
