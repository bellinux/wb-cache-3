25|$|There are {{two major}} groups of TCAs in terms of {{chemical}} structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings {{are based on the}} tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, <b>lofepramine)</b> and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine). In addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped {{based on the number of}} substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). <b>Lofepramine</b> is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them.|$|E
25|$|Imipramine is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include desipramine (N-desmethylimipramine), clomipramine (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and <b>lofepramine</b> (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Imipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of imipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzoazepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H2N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lofepramine</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, and trimipramine. <b>Lofepramine</b> is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Unlike other tertiary amine TCAs, <b>lofepramine</b> has a bulky 4-chlorobenzoylmethyl substituent on its amine instead of a methyl group. Although <b>lofepramine</b> is technically a tertiary amine, it acts in large part as a prodrug of desipramine, and is more similar to secondary amine TCAs in its effects. Other secondary amine TCAs besides desipramine include nortriptyline and protriptyline.

50|$|<b>Lofepramine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Gamanil, Lomont, and Tymelyt among others, is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) {{which is used}} to treat depression. The TCAs are so named as they share the common property of having three rings in their chemical structure. Like most TCAs <b>lofepramine</b> is believed to work in relieving depression by increasing concentrations of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin in the synapse, by inhibiting their reuptake. It is usually considered a third-generation TCA, as unlike the first- and second-generation TCAs it is relatively safe in overdose and has milder and less frequent side effects.|$|E
5000|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Advised not to {{be started}} until at least 2 weeks after {{stopping}} MAOIs. MAOIs are advised {{not to be}} started until at least 1-2 weeks after stopping TCAs like <b>lofepramine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofepramine</b> was {{developed}} by Leo Läkemedel AB. It {{first appeared in the}} literature in 1969 and was patented in 1970. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in either 1980 or 1983.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} TCAs, <b>lofepramine</b> is {{considered}} to be less toxic in overdose. Its treatment is mostly a matter of trying to reduce absorption of the drug, if possible, using gastric lavage and monitoring for adverse effects on the heart.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofepramine</b> is {{a strong}} {{inhibitor}} of norepinephrine reuptake (Ki=5.4 nM) and a moderate inhibitor of serotonin reuptake (Ki=70 nM). It is a weak-intermediate level antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (Ki values of 67 nM, 330 nM, 130 nM, 340 nM, 460 nM for M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 respectively).|$|E

50|$|It is {{extensively}} metabolized, via cleavage of the p-chlorophenacyl group, to the TCA, desipramine, in humans. However, it {{is unlikely}} this property plays a substantial role in its overall effects as <b>lofepramine</b> exhibits lower toxicity and anticholinergic side effects relative to desipramine while retaining equivalent antidepressant efficacy. The p-chlorophenacyl group is metabolized to p-chlorobenzoic acid which is then conjugated with glycine and excreted in the urine. The desipramine metabolite is partly secreted in the faeces. Other routes of metabolism include hydroxylation, glucuronidation, N-dealkylation and N-oxidation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofepramine</b> {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} is advised against unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. This is because its safety during pregnancy {{has not been}} established and animal studies have shown some potential for harm if used during pregnancy. If used during the third trimester of pregnancy it can cause insufficient breathing to meet oxygen requirements, agitation and withdrawal symptoms in the infant. Likewise its use by breastfeeding women is advised against, except when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, {{due to the fact}} it is excreted in the breast milk and may therefore adversely affect the infant. Although the amount secreted in breast milk is likely too small to be harmful.|$|E

40|$|A {{double-blind}} randomised controlled {{trial of}} the effect of low dose <b>lofepramine</b> (70 mg once daily) against placebo was carried out on depressed elderly inpatients on general medical wards for the elderly, comparing measures of depression and side-effects between the randomised groups. Patients were identified for the study using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards (BASDEC). Sixty-three subjects were randomised: 46 patients completed the entire trial of 28 days treatment. BASDEC and GDS were administered on day 8 post-admission, and depressed patients were randomised double-blind to either low dose <b>lofepramine</b> (70 mg daily) (n = 23) or placebo (n = 23). Assessment of changes in depressive states were made using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on days 8, 18 and 36 post-admission. Both groups improved by a similar amount during the trial. <b>Lofepramine</b> tended to be more effective than placebo in those patients who were more depressed (GDS > or = 18).

40|$|The {{effects of}} single doses of <b>lofepramine</b> (70 mg), dothiepin (50 mg) and placebo on memory and {{psychomotor}} function were compared in a cross-over study with 12 healthy volunteers.

Dothiepin also impaired performance on two attentional tasks, slowed down reaction times and increased subjective sedation. <b>Lofepramine</b> was similar to placebo on nearly all objective measures, but produced effects similar to dothiepin on critical flicker fusion threshold, salivary flow and most EEG wavebands.
