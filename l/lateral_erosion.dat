50|$|Fluvial {{terraces}} are {{remnants of}} the former floodplain of a stream or river. They are formed by the downcutting of a river or stream channel into and the abandonment and <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of its former floodplain. The downcutting, abandonment, and <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of a former floodplain can {{be the result of}} either changes in sea level, local or regional tectonic uplift; changes in local or regional climate; changes the amount of sediment being carried by the river or stream; change in discharge of the river; or a complex mixture of these and other factors. The most common sources of the variations in rivers and streams that create fluvial terraces are vegetative, geomorphic, and hydrologic responses to climate. More recently, the direct modification of rivers and streams and their watersheds by cultural processes have result in the development of terraces along many rivers and streams.|$|E

5000|$|When a river {{reaches a}} low-lying plain, often {{in its final}} course to the sea or a lake, it meanders widely. In the {{vicinity}} of a river bend, deposition occurs on the [...] bank (the bank with the smaller radius). In contrast, both <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> and undercutting occur on the cut bank or concave bank (the bank with the greater radius.) Continuous deposition on the convex bank and erosion of the concave bank of a meandering river cause {{the formation of a}} very pronounced meander with two [...] banks getting closer. The narrow neck of land between the two neighboring concave banks is finally cut through, either by <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of the two concave banks or by the strong currents of a flood. When this happens, a new straighter river channel is created and an abandoned meander loop, called a cutoff, is formed. When deposition finally seals off the cutoff from the river channel, an oxbow lake is formed. This process can occur over a time scale from a few years to several decades and may sometimes become essentially static.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-term field {{performance of the}} check-dams in mitigation of soil erosion in the Duozhao catchment of Jiangjia stream, southwest China. Since their construction between 1979 and 1982, the check-dams have been functioning effectively. The examination is made via comparisons between the environmental conditions of the Duozhao catchment with its adjacent Menqian catchment in the stream, because no check dams were constructed in the Menqian catchment. The examination is based on recent field investigations and aerial photograph analyses, and covers four aspects: (a) bed gradients of catchment channels; (b) stability of bank slopes; (c) rates of land erosion; and (d) vegetations on bank slopes. The field data demonstrate that the check-dams have had the following good functions for mitigation of soil erosion: (1) restricting the channel depth and <b>lateral</b> <b>erosions,</b> (2) protecting the channel erosion base, (3) reducing the bed gradients of debris-flow channels, (4) fixing the channel bed, (5) stabilizing the bank slopes, as well as (6) facilitating the growth of vegetations. © Springer-Verlag 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|International audiencen this study, the Capbreton canyon head, {{just off}} the coast, is {{investigated}} using high-resolution multibeam bathymetry datasets, sediment samples and numerical modeling. The HR bathymetty analysis reveals a morphological connection between the longshore trough {{and the head of}} the canyon. The analysis of recent sediment samples shows a clear correlation between the sediment of the canyon head and that of the nearshore. Hydrodynamic modeling (a coupled wave-flow model) shows that for high-energy waves, the rotational nature of surfzone circulation reverses and wave-induced currents have the potential to transport large quantities of nearshore sands toward the canyon head. All these arguments support the assumption that the canyon head captures a part of the sand transported by longshore drift. Over the 15 years of observation (1998 - 2013), time-lapse bathymetry shows that the floor of the canyon head and one lateral gully network experienced significant morphological reworking. In terms of hazards, despite this strong activity, the position of the canyon head and the profile of its longitudinal slope remained stable and appear as a comforting factor.

5000|$|While {{similar in}} general appearance, the {{mechanism}} behind {{the formation of}} interlocking spurs {{is different from that}} behind meanders, which arise out of a combination of <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> and deposition. Interlocking spurs are formed as either a river or stream cuts its valley into local bedrock. As it entrenches its valley, it preferentially follows and erodes zones of weaknesses within the bedrock that typically consist of intersecting sets of joints. This process creates a zig-zagging fluvial valley that [...] "interlock" [...] or [...] "overlap" [...] in a staggered manner.조까 ...|$|E
5000|$|Downcutting, {{also called}} erosional downcutting, {{downward}} erosion or vertical erosion is a geological process by hydraulic action that deepens the channel {{of a stream}} or valley by removing material from the stream's bed or the valley's floor. The speed of downcutting depends on the stream's base level, the lowest point to which the stream can erode. Sea level is the ultimate base level, but many streams have a higher [...] "temporary" [...] base level because they empty into another body of water that is above sea level or encounter bedrock that resists erosion. A concurrent process called <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> refers to the widening of a stream channel or valley. When a stream is high above its base level, downcutting will take place faster than lateral erosion; but {{as the level of}} the stream approaches its base level, the rate of <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> increases. This is why streams in mountainous areas tend to be narrow and swift, forming V-shaped valleys, while streams in lowland areas tend to be wide and slow-moving, with valleys that are correspondingly wide and flat-bottomed. The term gradient refers to the elevation of a stream relative to its base level. The steeper the gradient, the faster the stream flows. Sometimes geological uplift will increase the gradient of a stream even while the stream downcuts toward its base level, a process called [...] "rejuvenation." [...] This happened {{in the case of the}} Colorado River in the western United States, resulting in the process that created the Grand Canyon.|$|E
50|$|For {{freshwater}} organisms, landscapes {{are divided}} naturally into discrete drainage basins by watersheds, episodically isolated and reunited by erosional processes. In regions like the Amazon Basin with an exceptionally low (flat) topographic relief, the many waterways {{have had a}} highly reticulated history over geological time. In such a context, stream capture {{is an important factor}} affecting the evolution and distribution of freshwater organisms. Stream capture occurs when an upstream portion of one river drainage is diverted to the downstream portion of an adjacent basin. This can happen as a result of tectonic uplift (or subsidence), natural damming created by a landslide, or headward or <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of the watershed between adjacent basins.|$|E

50|$|Valley or {{stream erosion}} occurs with {{continued}} water flow along a linear feature. The erosion is both downward, deepening the valley, and headward, extending the valley into the hillside, creating head cuts and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical V cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some base level is reached, the erosive activity switches to <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion,</b> which widens {{the valley floor}} and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream meanders across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, {{by far the most}} erosion occurs during times of flood, when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, pebbles and boulders can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as traction.|$|E
50|$|An entrenched river {{refers to}} a river that is {{confined}} to a canyon or gorge, and in most cases, it is relatively narrow with very little or no flood plain. It often has meanders already developed into landscapes. An entrenched river usually forms a rapid downcutting of the river channel before it changes its course. The river downcutting may occur rapidly {{as a result of}} a tectonic uplift rift or when a lowering of the ocean floor takes place. Increased level of downcutting is also possible when a moraine-dammed lake collapses downstream, or when there is a capture of a river by another river.The meanders formed in these landscapes refer to incised meanders and they occur in two forms, including an ingrown meander and entrenched meander. An ingrown meander occurs when downcutting process is slow and the river can cause <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion,</b> leading to an asymmetric valley. The feature developed when such processes occur refers to un-incised meander. On the other hand, entrenched meander occurs when there is a rapid incision of the river bed such that the river does not have the opportunity to erode the lateral side. This leads to symmetrical valleys with a gorge-like appearance. It is widely believed that the development of these two features occurs before the rejuvenation does.|$|E
50|$|As the {{highlands}} erode due to weathering and water flow, the sediment {{from the hills}} is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will, over time, seek new, lower paths, forming a meander (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees {{at the margins of}} the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by <b>lateral</b> stream <b>erosion</b> and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes, over geologic time, will form the plain, a region with little relief (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope.|$|R

40|$|The upper Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada, shows typical anastomosing {{morphology}} - multiple interconnected {{channels that}} enclose floodbasins - and lateral channel stability We analysed field data on hydraulic and sedimentary processes {{and show that}} the anastomosing morphology of the upper Columbia River is caused by sediment (bedload) transport inefficiency, in combination with very limited potential for <b>lateral</b> bank <b>erosion</b> because of very low specific stream power (90 % of the sediment in the cross-valley transect studied. Because of very low sediment transport capacity, the morphological evolution of most secondary channels is slow. Measurements and calculations indicate that much more bedload is sequestered in the relatively steep upper anastomosing reach of the upper Columbia River than in the relatively gentle lower anastomosing reach. With anastomosing morphology and related processes (e. g., crevassing) being best developed in the upper reach, this confirms the notion of upstream rather than downstream control of upper Columbia River anastomosis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of saltmarshes is {{affected}} by many abiotic and biotic factors. While abiotic factors are typically regarded as primary drivers of erosion, biotic influences such as burrowing or bioturbating taxa can also extensively modify the physical structure of this marine habitat. Many estuaries on the Pacific coast of North America have been invaded by populations of the burrowing non-native isopod Sphaeroma quoianum, which are thought to exacerbate the erosion of saltmarshes. We conducted a mensurative experiment {{to examine the relationship}} between populations of S. quoianum and <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> rate of saltmarshes in Coos Bay, Oregon, USA. After 1 yr, we measured higher <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> rates, more undercutting, and higher numbers of calved and slumped marsh sections in marsh sites infested by S. quoianum than in uninfested sites. This effect was also consistent at smaller spatial scales: we found <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> was 300 % higher in burrowed areas than in adjacent (within approx. 1 m) unburrowed areas within infested sites. Our results suggest that the prodigious burrowing by dense populations of S. quoianum can accelerate erosion rates in saltmarshes and are substantial geomorphic agents of change in estuaries on the Pacific coast of North America...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2014. Major: Earth sciences. Advisor: Christopher Paola. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 132 pages, appendix 1. The process of <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> in bedrock channels is poorly understood. This thesis {{sheds light on}} the mechanisms of lateral bedrock erosion {{as well as the}} larger scale drivers of <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion.</b> Contained in this thesis are three distinct studies: a field-based study that investigates the drivers of lateral planation of strath surfaces; an experimental study that seeks to identify specific mechanisms of lateral erosion; and a numerical modeling study that seeks to corroborate the findings of the experimental study and permit exploration of parameter space. The field study (Chapter 1) concludes that lateral planation of strath surfaces in the dominant channel erosion process during periods of elevated sediment supply. This study further concludes that the elevated sediment supply conditions were driven by changes in climate. The experimental study (Chapter 2) concludes that the deflection of saltating bedload particles by fixed roughness elements into the wall is an effective mechanism of erosion. In addition, the experimental study identifies a minimum roughness threshold that must be crossed before significant <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> can occur. Finally, the experimental study suggests that once the roughness threshold is crossed (i. e. moving from a smooth bed devoid of roughness elements to a bed with roughness elements), further increases in bed roughness do not produce ever increasing rates of <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion.</b> Rather, an erosion rate plateau is reached shortly after the roughness threshold is crossed. The numerical modeling study (Chapter 3) corroborates the findings of the experimental study and demonstrates, from first principles, that <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> by deflected bed load particles is an effective mechanism of lateral bedrock erosion. In addition, this study identifies an important trade-off between increased deflection surface area from larger roughness elements and the increased form drag associated with the larger roughness elements. Here, {{the increase in the number}} of particle deflections is offset by the decrease in particle kinetic energy on impact, resulting in the erosion rate plateau observed in the physical experiments...|$|E

40|$|Coupled {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) morphodynamic {{and bank}} erosion models are gaining attentions in recent years. It {{has been shown}} that such models have advantages over the one-dimensional (1 D) modeling approaches. In this paper, a previous 2 D bank erosion model with the moving mesh method is extended to include the fixed mesh approach. Further, two practical streams with differing complexity are simulated to demonstrate the extended model. Both the moving mesh and fixed mesh methods are used in the modeling. The model consists of two components: a 2 D flow and mobile-bed model for vertical bed changes and hydraulic forces acting on a bank and a lateral bank retreat model. The 2 D vertical model and the <b>lateral</b> bank <b>erosion</b> model are coupled together spatially and temporally through a special procedure and a common mesh. With the experiences gained with practical stream modeling, the modeling procedure and key model input parameters are described. The study shows that the moving and fixed mesh methods together make the extended bank erosion model numerically robust and capable of predicting both the vertical bed changes and the <b>lateral</b> stream bank <b>erosion</b> for complex streams. Each individual method, however, has its own limitations in terms of model accuracy and efficiency. The moving mesh works well if bank retreat is relatively small, e. g., less than one channel width, and produces more accurate results than the fixed mesh method. The fixed mesh may be needed for ensuring numerical stability if a bank may be subject to significant retreat (e. g., more than one channel width). The fixed mesh method, however, is less accurate than the moving mesh method and a much refined mesh may be needed. Both methods need future research and improvements in terms of their model accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The Shimanto River, in the {{southwest}} of Shikoku Island, forms incised meanders. It {{has been suggested that}} gorges are formed as meanders incise bedrock during tectonic uplift, or a lowering of the baselevel of erosion. However, it is known that the formation of incised meanders is dependent on many other factors. The Shimanto River is composed of a main stream and two major tributaries. Incised meanders occur especially in the middle section of the main stream. It is clear that scarcely any <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> occurs here, as the meanders have very small terraces. The study site is located in the Shimanto Belt, which is composed of interbedded sandstone and mudstone. The sandstone is resistant to erosion, but the mudstone is easily eroded and transported by the river in suspension. There is little sediment load in the river because the area has not experienced recent uplift. Also, since the sediment load is mainly mud, there is very little bedload in the river, which results in a rough, bedrock channel floor. It is proposed that the lack of bedload supplied to the channel and the rough channel floor influence the <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> of the channel and lead to the formation of incised meanders. To test this hypothesis, a flume experiment was conducted using a channel with fixed meanders and varying degrees of roughness of the channel bed. It was found that the greater the roughness of the channel bed, the weaker the concentration of streampower at meanders. It is therefore concluded that little <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion</b> is produced at channel bends over a rough bed. It seems likely that incised meanders are formed in the middle section of the Shimanto River because there is little bedload in the channel, resulting in a very rough, bedrock channel floor and a reduction in the efficient streampower for cutting banks erosion at the bends. This in turn reduces <b>lateral</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|E
