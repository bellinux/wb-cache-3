40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} patients who presented to the ED from a ladder-related fall and their injuries, highlight the impact of ladder-related falls on the ED, identify contributing factors of ladder falls and draw recommendations to improve <b>ladder</b> <b>safety.</b> Methods: A prospective observational {{study was conducted in}} two EDs. Patients 2 ̆ 7 demographics and ED services used were obtained from medical records. A 53 -item questionnaire was used to gather information about the type of ladder used, ladder activity, circumstances of the fall, contributing factors and future recommendations. Results: A total of 177 patients were recruited for this study. The typical patient was male, over the age of 50 and using a domestic ladder. The ED length of stay was between 30 min and 16 h, and was longer if patients were transferred to the short stay unit. Services most utilised in the ED included diagnostic tests, procedures and referrals to other healthcare teams. Most falls occurred because of ladder movement and slips or misstep. The major contributing factors identified were a combination of user features and flaws in ladder setup. Conclusions: Ladder-related falls carry a considerable burden to the ED. Recommendations include <b>ladder</b> <b>safety</b> interventions that target ladder users most at risk of falls: men, ≥ 50 years old and performing domestic tasks. Safety interventions should emphasise task avoidance, education and training, utilisation of safety equipment and appropriate ladder setup...|$|E

40|$|The Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro- gram aims {{to reduce}} the {{incidence}} of physical trauma in the workplace, whether it is caused by unintentional injury or by violence. This snapshot highlights our recent accomplish- ments and some upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Traumatic Injury Prevention Pro-gram works with partners from industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program addresses these areas: 1. Decreasing the leading causes of work-related injuries. 2. Decreasing work-related injuries among high-risk occupations and vulnerable worker groups. What do we do? 1. Conduct research to develop an evidence base for: a. Preventing falls at work, and protecting workers from injury when falls happen. b. Preventing motor vehicle-related injuries, and protecting workers from injury during motor vehicle incidents. c. Preventing workplace violence by evaluating measures designed to reduce such violence, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. d. Identifying and evaluating ways to reduce traumatic injuries among high-risk occupations and vulnerable worker groups, and making recommendations to reduce risk factors. These groups may include fire fighters; law enforcement officers; workers in construction, transportation, healthcare and fishing industries; young workers; older workers; racial/ethnic minorities; and others. 2. Share research findings and evidence-based recommendations with partners who can put the information into practice. These partners include manufacturers, consensus standard committees, employers, workers, and government agencies. 3. Conduct effective surveillance for occupational injuries, and share data with the re-search community, employers, and workers to guide future research and prevention efforts. What have we accomplished? 1. Released upgraded version of the award-winning NIOSH <b>Ladder</b> <b>Safety</b> smartphone app, which has been downloaded more than 50, 000 times. 2. Adoption of ambulance test methods by the General Services Administration's (GSA) purchase specifications for ambulances, and the National Fire Prevention Association standard. These test methods were developed by NIOSH and partners to improve ambulance crashworthiness. 3. Nearly 15, 000 healthcare personnel completed a free online workplace violence training course between August 2013 and December 2015. The course was developed by NIOSH and partners. 4. Published contemporary anthropometry (body size and dimensions) data for fire fighters and truck drivers on the NIOSH website, and encouraged use of these data in equipment and workspace design (e. g. fire fighter gloves, truck cabs). 5. Raised awareness of an upward trend in suicides in the workplace through analysis of surveillance data. 6. A manufacturer used NIOSH research to create an innovative personal flotation device for commercial fishermen that is comfortable enough to be worn continuously on deck while still providing flotation protection. It won an industry safety award, and more than 2, 000 units were sold in the first year. What's next? 1. Release a web-based simulator that will allow users to test and view the stability of aerial lifts under different worksite conditions, such as high winds and uneven ground. 2. Release a NIOSH Fact Sheet with recommendations to improve the safety of older drivers in the workplace. 3. Complete analyses evaluating workplace violence prevention interventions. 4. Publish findings on research into the underreporting of occupational injuries and its implications. NIOSHTIC No 2004815...|$|E

Method : This study is descriptive with qualitative approaches. Sources of information in this study amounted to five people and three key informants. Research instruments using the interview guidelines, hazard checklist, PHA Worksheet, and conducted a document review. Result : The result show that identified hazards based on equipment used are radiation, noise, splashing hot materials, vibration, fire, lightning, falling, hazard from magnet flow, pinch, dust material, explosion, stability disturbed equipment, rotating equipment, and electric shock. Hazards that has extreme risk is fire. A control measures is needed in extreme risk. Control measures that needed is to carry out emergency fire response procedures. Conclusion : There are 30 hazards in medium risk, 11 hazards in high risk, 2 hazards in extreme risk, and 1 hazards in low risk. Suggestion from this research are conducting regular inspection, notice the ventilation, implementing noise control program, conduct training for employees, notice the safety sign, notice the <b>ladder,</b> enrich <b>safety</b> talk material, and in the implementation of hazard identification and risk assessment should be perfomed by person that have safety background...|$|R

By way of the lines the rescue swimmers tied around those who were having trouble helping themselves, many struggling survivors who, debilitated by the cold, would have otherwise been consigned to a watery grave were able to be hauled aboard the Escanaba by crewmen on deck. Even those in the water who appeared to be dead were harnessed by the retrieval swimmers and pulled aboard — indeed, it was found that only 12 of the 50 apparently dead victims thus brought aboard by the retrieval teams actually turned out to be deceased.

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the tower was restored by the United States Coast Guard in 1999. Also in 1999, the Delaware River and Bay Lighthouse Foundation began working for its restoration. In 2001 the Coast Guard repaired the docking platform and <b>ladders</b> to improve <b>safety</b> {{of access to the}} building. In April 2002, the Delaware River and Bay Lighthouse Foundation, a non-profit, volunteer organization, signed a lease to manage the structure. The station's dock landing was restored in March 2003 and the first tour was held in June. Except for a brief hiatus in 2005 because of an inability to get insurance for the lighthouse, the Foundation has continued a regular schedule of tours each summer since then. The organization was granted ownership by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2004 under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. The first step was to restore the windows, which had been removed and boarded up by the Coast Guard. Damage by Hurricane Isabel in September was quickly repaired, but there is concern that the lighthouse is endangered by the poor condition of the Harbor of Refuge Breakwater on which it is built and which is still owned by the Federal Government and is the maintenance responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. With the blessing of the Corps of Engineers, the Delaware River & Bay Lighthouse Foundation began seeking Federal appropriations to fund repairs to the breakwater. An appropriation of just under $350,000 was finally made with the Federal budget for 2008 and the Corps began survey and planning work in preparation for repairs. The Corps and the Foundation estimate that at least $2.7 million is needed to stabilize the 100-year-old structure.Meanwhile, the Foundation continues to preserve the lighthouse itself and, in 2008 procured a new stainless steel door system for the main entryway.|$|R
