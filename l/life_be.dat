Though Salamiyah was a {{predominantly}} Ismaili town, al-Jundi belonged to the Sunni minority of the area, and would in later <b>life</b> <b>be</b> known as 'an inciter of anti-Ismaili sentiments.'

Was {{it better to}} blaze his own path or follow the course mapped for him by his father and Basil? Gregory's writings illuminate the conflicts which both tormented and motivated him. Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for meaning and truth.|$|E

500|$|Friends of {{the couple}} were {{surprised}} by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom. Burckhard called Mahler [...] "that rachitic degenerate Jew," [...] unworthy for such a good-looking girl of good family. On the other hand, Mahler's family considered Alma to be flirtatious, unreliable, and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms. Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian—Natalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was [...] "like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves." [...] Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler's insistence that there could only be one composer {{in the family and}} that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him. She wrote in her diary: [...] "How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of... things closest to one's heart." [...] Mahler's requirement that their married <b>life</b> <b>be</b> organized around his creative activities imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma's part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.|$|E

[...] However, {{this does not mean}} that the person being crushed cannot act in self-defense and attack the child to save his or her own life. [...] To liken this to pregnancy, the mother can be thought to be the house, the fetus the growing-child. [...] In such a case, the mother’s life is being threatened, and the fetus is the one who threatens it. [...] Because for no reason should the mother’s <b>life</b> <b>be</b> threatened, and also for no reason is the fetus {{threatening}} it, both are innocent, and thus no third party can intervene. But, Thomson says, the person threatened can intervene, by which justification a mother can rightfully abort.|$|E
