We focus on two major parameters affecting laser-induced plasma spectroscopy for exploration of icy moons: transparent icy materials as well as thin atmospheres.

The spectrum of the generated plasma is dominated by emission of strong O, O+ and weak O 2 + atomic lines.

40|$|Elemental {{analysis}} of geologic samples based on {{atomic emission spectroscopy}} is currently considered for several future space lander missions to planets, moons and asteroids in solar system. The spectroscopy technique, called <b>laser-induced</b> plasma (<b>breakdown)</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (LIBS), provides quantitatively the microscopic in-situ abundances of all major and many trace elements of surfaces of solar system bodies. Excitation and evolution of the plasmas induced by lasers depend on {{the properties of the}} investigated material and on environmental conditions. This study focuses on feasibility of spectroscopy of plasmas induced by low-energy laser (below 1 mJ per pulse) for exploration of solar system bodies with thin atmospheres (pressures below 1 mPa). At such low pressures the excited plasmas have small plumes and expand very rapidly, which limits both the LIBS signal intensity and the available acquisition time. This, in turn, requires usually relatively powerful laser sources to create a detectable LIBS plasma. The low pressure conditions were simulated in a dedicated chamber at DLR-Berlin, that can hold the Martian-like atmosphere or high vacuum conditions. Two infrared Q-switched lasers are used for comparative investigation of atomic emission spectra: Nd:YAG laser (Inlite, Continuum) operating at 1064 nm and at 10 Hz, pulse energy up to 230 mJ at 8 - 10 ns pulse duration and developed for future planetary missions Nd:YLF laser (NeoLASE) operating at 1053 nm and at 10 - 50 Hz, pulse energy up to 3 mJ at 3 - 5 ns pulse duration. The emitted light of the laser-induced plasma was analysed by an echelle spectrometer (LTB Aryelle Butterfly) covering the wavelength range of 280 – 900 nm with a spectral resolution of around 104. Identification of atomic transitions was performed using the LTB built-in spectrometer software by comparison with the NIST spectral database. Several basaltic rock and sediment standards were crushed to powder and pressed into pellets. Reduction of both pressure and a laser excitation energy results in significant decrease of signal-to-noise ratio for most of atomic lines (an exception are the widely broadened lines of H). However, detection of atomic emission lines of elements with relative abundances above 10 - 3 (0. 1 wt%), in presented samples: Al, Ca, Cr, H, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, O, Si, Ti,  was possible down to a laser excitation energy of ~ 0. 9 mJ (provided laser irradiance on a sample surface of 46 MW/mm 2). Additionally, detection of carbon and sulphur, having strong atomic transitions in ultraviolet range, can be expected by extension of the spectral range of a LIBS spectrometer to 190 nm. Atomic doublet and triplet transitions, broadened by atomic collisions at ambient pressures (100 kPa), become spectrally resolved and are identified below 1 mPa. This demonstrates the feasibility of miniaturized <b>laser-induced</b> <b>breakdown</b> spectrometry for space missions to solar bodies with absent or thin atmospheres...|$|R

Optimization of the Laser Induced <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (LIBS) signal with respect to carrier gas flow rate, analyte, acid (HCl) and reductant (NaBH 4) concentrations and flow rates was performed by using spectral emission intensity from the neutral Sn(I) line at 284. 0 nm under atmospheric pressures. With flow rates of 5. 0 mL/min for NaBH 4 and 2. 5 mL/min for HCl, optimum NaBH 4 and HCl concentrations were determined as 2. 0 % (w/v) and 1. 0 % (v/v), respectively. The hydride generation efficiency of the system was tested for tin hydride, stannane (SnH 4), by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). It was found that higher than 99 % of the analyte was released into the gaseous phase. Upon optimization, the minimum detectable Sn concentration was found as 0. 3 mg/L in water samples. That corresponds to more than two orders of increase in sensitivity compared to methods that employ common sample introduction techniques in liquids analysis by LIBS. Over 90 % recoveries were obtained from spiking experiments with river, tap and drinking water samples.

Micro-plasma parameters such as temperature and electron density can be inferred from emission spectra that occur subsequent to <b>laser-induced</b> optical <b>breakdown.</b> Molecular recombination and/or excitation of selected molecules can lead to simultaneous occurrence of atomic and molecular species. In order to advance the superposition spectroscopy technology, it is desirable to have available accurate theoretical atomic line profiles and molecular spectra.

5000|$|<b>Laser-induced</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (LIBS) {{is a type}} {{of atomic}} {{emission}} spectroscopy which uses a highly energetic laser pulse as the excitation source. The laser is focused to form a plasma, which atomizes and excites samples. The formation of the plasma only begins when the focused laser achieves a certain threshold for optical breakdown, which generally depends on the environment and the target material. [...] In principle, LIBS can analyze any matter regardless of its physical state, be it solid, liquid or gas. Because all elements emit light of characteristic frequencies when excited to sufficiently high temperatures, LIBS can (in principle) detect all elements, limited only by the power of the laser as well as the sensitivity and wavelength range of the spectrograph & detector. If the constituents of a material to be analyzed are known, LIBS may be used to evaluate the relative abundance of each constituent element, or to monitor the presence of impurities. In practice, detection limits are a function of a) the plasma excitation temperature, b) the light collection window, and c) the line strength of the viewed transition. LIBS makes use of optical emission spectrometry and is to this extent very similar to arc/spark emission spectroscopy.|$|E
