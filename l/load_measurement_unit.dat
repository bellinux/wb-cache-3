40|$|Objectives: To {{systematically}} review {{risks of}} mechanical impact on peri-implant strain and prosthetic influence on stability across finite element studies. Material and Methods: An online literature search {{was performed on}} MEDLINE and EMBASE databases published between 2011 and 2016. Following keywords tiered screening and selection of the title, abstract and full-text were performed. Studies of finite element analysis (FEA) were considered for inclusion that were written in English and revealed stress concentrations or strain at peri-implant bone level. Results: There were included 20 FEA studies in total. Data were organized according to the following topics: bone layers, type of bone, osseointegration level, bone level, design of implant, diameter and length of implant, implant-abutment connection, type of supra-construction, <b>loading</b> axis, <b>measurement</b> <b>units.</b> The stress or strain at implant-bone contact was measured over all studies and numerical values estimated. Risks of overloading were accented as non-axial loading, misfits, cantilevers and the stability of peri-implant bone was related with the usage of platform switch connection of abutment. Conclusions: Peri-implant area could be affected by non-axial loading, cantilever prosthetic elements, crown/implant ratio, type of implant-abutment connection, misfits, properties of restoration materials and antagonistic tooth. The heterogeneity of finite element analysis studies limits systematization of data. Results of these studies are comparable with other findings of in vitro, in vivo, prospective and retrospective studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract MEMS-based {{tensile testing}} devices are {{powerful}} tools for mechanical characterization of nanoscale materials. In a typical configuration, their design includes an actuator to deliver loads/displace-ments to a sample, and a sensing <b>unit</b> for <b>load</b> <b>measurement.</b> The sensing <b>unit</b> {{consists of a}} flexible structure, which deforms {{in response to the}} force imposed to the sample. Such deformation, while being necessary for the sensing function, may become a source of instability. When the sample experiences a load drop, as it may result from yield, necking or phase transitions, the elastic energy accumulated by the sensor can be released, thus leading to loss of the displacement-controlled condition and dynamic fail-ure. Here, we report a newly-developed MEMS testing system where the sensor is designed to constantly keep its equilibrium position through an electrostatic feed-back-control. We show design, implementation, and calibration of the system, as well as validation by tensile testing of silver nanowires. The implemented system allows capture of softening events and affords significant improvement on the resolution of stress– strain curves...|$|R

The enhanced measurement is obtained by merging two different measurements of building cooling load using data fusion technique. One is the direct cooling <b>load</b> <b>measurement,</b> which is obtained directly using the differential water temperature and water flow rate measurements. The other is the indirect cooling <b>load</b> <b>measurement,</b> which estimates the cooling load using chiller models based on the instantaneous chiller electrical power input and condition measured variables. The control performance of the proposed scheme is validated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers, which {{are known as}} inertial sensors. These sensors are prone to various deterministic and random errors which need to be compensated. This work presents a calibration and stochastic modeling technique for six degree of freedom inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> in order to remove these errors from inertial sensors. Calibration of inertial <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> is carried out to estimate the coefficients which transform the raw output of sensors into meaningful data. In this paper, allan variance technique is used to model and analyze various random errors present in inertial sensors. This paper covers the theoretical basis of calibration and allan variance along with implementation of these techniques to inertial sensors.

40|$|Monitoring users’ {{cognitive}} load in real-time allows {{the system to}} adjust its interface and improve the interaction experience and user performance. Physiological signals are relatively reliable, real-time measures of cognitive <b>load.</b> <b>Measurement</b> robustness can be improved by taking account of confounding factors, and multimodality {{has the potential to}} enhance mental load prediction. This thesis investigates cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> by means of physiological data and machine learning techniques. Skin response and eye blink are economical, conveniently-captured physiological measures that were studied. Multiple datasets were used to increase the reliability of the results which confirmed that the explored features can significantly measure different {{cognitive load}} levels. Confounding factors can distort cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> results. Emotional fluctuations have profound impacts on physiological signals. Therefore to examine the robustness of the explored features, they were evaluated for cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> with affective interference in different datasets. The results showed that they can measure multiple cognitive load levels with high accuracy even under emotional changes. Different modalities can impart complementary information. Hence we tried to improve the accuracy by means of multimodal cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement.</b> Two fusion techniques were used and different combinations of classifiers and features were examined. Multimodality proved to improve the cognitive load classification accuracy and the studied feature fusions performed well both in the absence and presence of affective stimuli. This thesis proposes frameworks for monitoring cognitive load using physiological data and machine learning techniques. The system was tested during affective fluctuations and modality fusion was performed. The outcomes of this research show that the explored features and methods could be used as means for objective, robust, accurate cognitive <b>load</b> <b>measurement.</b> Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|One of the {{foundational}} students’ misconceptions of area measurement is conceiving area as {{the length of}} a line, instead the size of a surface. They do not see area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. Therefore, this study intends to develop learning activities and materials that support students in developing their understanding of area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. This research is conducted based on the view of the design research approach consisting of two cycles. The subjects of the study are taken from the third grade students of two primary schools in Surabaya. Meanwhile, the learning activities in this study are based on the view of PMRI (Indonesia realistic mathematics education). We found that student need to understand physically quantity of area and the <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> of area before they are introduced to the meaning of area as the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units</b> covering a surface. Learning activity that provides students with the experience of covering activity and comparing area problems could lead to the discussion on the physically quantity of area, the <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> of area, and its properties (no gap, no overlapping, and unit consistency); meanwhile, learning activity that engaging students in comparing area of tiled floors can be used to develop students’ understanding of measuring area as the process of finding the number of <b>measurement</b> <b>units.</b> Keywords: Area, area <b>measurement,</b> the <b>unit</b> of area <b>measurement,</b> design research...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses}} the light-source-stepping method (LSSM) is developed. The LSSM {{proposed}} by the authors is a phase-shifting fringe projection method for shape measurement. The authors also developed a linear LED device for high-speed shape measurement using the LSSM. A compact and high-speed 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> can be realized using a linear LED device. However, the LSSM is difficult to utilize because the phase-shifting amount is not uniform. The phase-shifting amount depends on {{the distance from the}} grating plate. It is therefore necessary to consider carefully the locations of the linear LED device and the grating plate. In this paper, the design method for a 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{that uses the}} LSSM is shown, and a prototype of a compact 3 D shape <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> with a linear LED device is developed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the frame}} {{work of the}} project Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX), a <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System was {{developed}} and fabricated to measure the impingement force of Shuttle Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. The <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System is a force sensing system that measures any combination of normal and shear forces up to 40 N (9 lbf) in the normal direction and 22 N (5 lbf) in the shear direction with an accuracy of +/- 0. 04 N (+/- 0. 01 lbf) Since high resolution {{is required for the}} force <b>measurement,</b> the <b>Load</b> <b>Measurement</b> System is built with highly sensitive load cells. To protect these fragile load cells in the non-operational mode from being damaged due to flight loads such as launch and landing loads of the Shuttle vehicle, a motor driven device known as the Load Cell Lock-Out Mechanism was built. This Lock-Out Mechanism isolates the load cells from flight loads and re-engages the load cells for the force measurement experiment once in space. With this highly effective protection system, the SPIFEX <b>load</b> <b>measurement</b> experiment was successfully conducted on STS- 44 in September 1994 with all load cells operating properly and reading impingement forces as expected...|$|R

40|$|A multi-objective optimal phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> {{placement}} model using integer {{linear programming}} {{is presented in}} this article. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes two objectives, i. e., minimization of phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> numbers and maximization of measurement redundancy. To calculate the redundancy criteria, the single-line outage and the phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> loss are considered simultaneously. A linear formulation is presented for both objective functions. Also herein, to address conflicting attributes and identify Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective optimal phasor <b>measurement</b> <b>unit</b> placement problem, a new multi-objective mathematical programming method is proposed. Finally, a new index, i. e., minimum distance to utopia point, is implemented to select the most preferred solution among the available Pareto front based options on the goal to achieve judicious decision makers.
