50|$|Batteries are {{typically}} made of six galvanic cells {{in a series}} circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts {{for a total of}} 12.6 volts at full charge. Each cell of a <b>lead</b> <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> consists of alternate plates of lead (cathode) and lead coated with lead dioxide (anode) immersed in an electrolyte of sulfuric acid solution. The actual standard cell potential is obtained from the standard reduction potentials. This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity. As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{reactions}} and equilibrium equations f the system lead-water {{are given in}} detail and {{are used in the}} construction of the potential-pH diagram of lead. Some important features of the diagram are discussed, in particular the solubilities of oxides and hydrox-ides and some of the important oxidation reduction reactions. A modified form of the potential-pH diagram of lead showing corrosion, passivity, and passivation domains is presented. The addition of passivation domains due to the presence of carbon dioxide and carbonates are determined. A modified potential-pH diagram taking into account the presence of sulfate in solution is also presented. Important features of the behavior of <b>lead</b> <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> are studied on the basis of this modified diagram. The construction of potential-pH diagrams for the various elements has been previously discussed (1, 2, 3) and diagrams for iron, copper, chromium, and ni-trogen have been presented. A particularly inter-esting and important case is that of lead which is discussed in the present paper.

40|$|The zinc protoporphyrin/haemoglobin (ZPP/Hb) {{ratio was}} {{measured}} in the field with a haematofluorometer. A significant increase in ZPP/Hb ratio with advancing age was found in 1295 men who denied any excess exposure to lead. Ninety-seven per cent of the results were below 110 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (4. 4 microgram ZPP/g Hb). The ZPP/Hb ratio was determined in a lead-exposed population of 2275 men, and in 305 a blood lead analysis was also performed. A blood lead limit of 2. 9 mumol/l (60 microgram/ 100 ml) corresponds to about 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (20 microgram/g). This limit was exceeded in workers engaged in secondary <b>lead</b> smelting, <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> manufacture, car radiator repair, crystal glass manufacture, <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> repair, ship breaking, metal foundries, the ceramic industry, scrap metal handling, and PVC plastic manufacture. Other occupations caused lower lead exposures with ZPP/Hb ratios between 110 and 500 mumol ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) : such ratios were found in men from shooting ranges, in leaded pane manufacturers, gunsmiths, car paint sprayers, type setters, steel rolling mill workers, shipbuilders and welders, car mechanics, lead pigment handlers, and solderers. Increased ZPP/Hb ratios and blood lead levels in 210 workers were associated with a decrease in haemoglobin concentration in the blood. Thus, the haematofluorometer {{has proved to be}} very useful for screening purposes. A blood lead determination should be performed if the ZPP/Hb ratio exceeds 300 microgram ZPP/mol Hb(Fe) (12 microgram/g) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{concentrations}} {{of lead in}} the phalanges and in the blood were determined in 22 subjects who had formerly been exposed to <b>lead</b> in a <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> plant, which had been closed for seven years. The bone lead concentration was measured in vivo using an ϰ-ray fluorescence technique in which two 57 Co γ-ray sources were used for generating the characteristic ϰ-rays of lead, which were measured with a Ge(Li) detector. In three subjects the variation of the lead concentration along the fore finger was measured together with the lead concentration in the tibia. The measured lead concentrations in the phalanges were between 20 μg/g (our detection limit) and 118 μg/g. The lead concentration in the phalanges was found to increase with the length of employment, but no simple relation {{was found between the}} lead concentrations in the blood and in the phalanges. The decrease in the blood lead concentration after the cessation of exposure was followed in four subjects. Seven years after exposure had ended, the blood lead concentration was found to be more dependent on the daily intake of lead than on the release of lead from the skeleton. These experimental results could be explained by a two-compartment model using exchange rates given in publications. This model has also been used to calculate the blood lead concentration that could be achieved after a sudden release of lead from the skeleton...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{interaction}} between serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), biogenic amino-acids and neurobehavioral function with blood lead levels in workers exposed to lead form lead-acid battery manufacturing process was not studied. Objective: To evaluate serum NSE and biogenic amino-acids (dopamine and serotonin) levels, and neurobehavioral performance among workers exposed to <b>lead</b> from lead-acid <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> plant, {{and its relation}} with blood lead levels (BLLs). Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we performed biochemical and neurobehavioral function tests on 146 workers exposed to lead from lead-acid battery manufacturing process. BLLs were assessed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Serum NSE, dopamine and serotonin were measured by ELISA. Neurobehavioral functions were assessed by CDC-recommended tests—simple reaction time (SRT), symbol digit substitution test (SDST), and serial digit learning test (SDLT). Results: There was a significant correlation (r 0. 199, p< 0. 05) between SDST and BLL. SDLT and SRT had also a significant positive correlation (r 0. 238, p< 0. 01). NSE had a negative correlation (r – 0. 194, p< 0. 05) with serotonin level. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that both SRT and SDST had positive significant associations with BLL. SRT also had a positive significant association with age. Conclusion: Serum NSE cannot {{be used as a}} marker for BLL.
