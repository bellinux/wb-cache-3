The two communities have often remained separate, mingling regularly only during the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.

25|$|Wilson {{wanted to}} {{concentrate}} troops in Britain, Ireland, India and Egypt – {{rather than what}} he saw as excessive commitments to the Rhine and in Mesopotamia, Persia and Palestine, later writing (11 August 1921) that interfering in other countries followed by having to make “peace” was “like buggery: once you take to it, you cannot stop”. However, Keith Jeffery argues that he failed to realise that the granting of self-government to Ireland and Egypt was also necessary, such concession keeping Egypt (<b>like</b> <b>Iraq</b> to a certain extent) pro-British for another generation.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} high oil prices set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states <b>like</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|E
500|$|In September 2007 Clark's memoir A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country.

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we did learn one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us.

[...] He therefore contrasted her with contemporaries <b>like</b> <b>Iraq's</b> Saddam Hussein who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's Hosni Mubarak who curried favour with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience. Comparisons were often made between Bhutto and the Filipino exile-come-political leader Corazon Aquino.|$|R

[...] In [...] "Treehouse of Horror XVII", a segment called [...] "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" [...] ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called [...] "Operation: Enduring occupation".

2500|$|Terrorism {{can never}} be totally {{eliminated}} as a tactic, but the ideology that drives organizations like Al-Qa’ida can be discredited and isolated.

2500|$|He {{suggests}} that current efforts to sustain dollar hegemony, {{especially since the}} collapse of the Bretton Woods system following the United States' suspension of the dollar's conversion to gold in 1971, exacerbate a rationale for war. Consequently, when petroleum producing nations <b>like</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Iran, or Venezuela elect to trade in Petroeuro instead of Petrodollar, it devalues an already overly inflated dollar, further eroding its supremacy as a global currency. According to Paul, along with vested American interests in oil and plans to [...] "remake the Middle East", this scenario has proven a contributing factor for the war in Iraq and diplomatic tensions with Iran.|$|E
