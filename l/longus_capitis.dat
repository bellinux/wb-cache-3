40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that submergence temperature affects {{the distribution of the}} lactate load and glycogen utilization during anoxia in turtles, we sampled a variety of tissues after 7 d, 24 h and 4 h of anoxic submergence at 5, 15 and 25 °C, respectively. These anoxic durations were chosen because we found they produced similar decreases in plasma HCO 3 - (ca. 18 - 22 mequiv L- 1). The sampled tissues included ventricle, liver, small intestine, carapace and the following muscles: flexor digitorum <b>longus</b> (FD), retrahens <b>capitis</b> (RC), iliofibularis (IF), and pectoralis (PT). Shell and skeleton sequestered 41. 9 %, 34. 1 % and 26. 1 % of the estimated lactate load at 5, 15 and 25 ºC. The change in plasma Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, relative to the estimated lactate load, decreased with increased temperature, indicating greater buffer release from bone at colder temperatures. Tissue lactate contents, relative to plasma lactate, increased with the temperature of the submergence. Glucose mobilization and tissue glycogen utilization were more pronounced at 15 and 25 ºC than at 5 °C. We conclude that, in slider turtles, the ability of the mineralized tissue to participate in the buffering of lactic acid during anoxia is inversely related to temperature, causing the lactate burden to shift to the tissues at warmer temperatures. Muscles utilize glycogen during anoxia more at warmer temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{mechanical}} activity of the neck muscles during loaded arm lifting tasks in individuals with long-standing disability after anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) with that of healthy controls. Methods Ten individuals (mean age, 60 years; SD, 7. 1) who underwent ACDF (10 - 13 years previously) for cervical disc disease and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. Ultrasonography was used to investigate the degree of deformation and deformation rate of ventral and dorsal neck muscles at the C 4 segmental level during a single (1  × arm flexion to 120 °) and repeated (10  × arm flexion to 90 °) loaded arm elevation condition. Results The ACDF group showed greater deformation and deformation rate of the <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (P =. 02) and deformation rate of the sternocleidomastoid (P =. 04) during the 120 ° arm lift. For repeated 90 ° arm lift, there was a significant group effect with higher deformation rate values observed in the <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (P =. 005 -. 01) and multifidus (P =. 03) muscles in the ACDF group. Muscle behavior did not change the repeated arm lifts (no group × time interactions) for either the ventral or the dorsal muscles. Conclusions For study participants, greater muscle mechanical activity levels were observed in the ventral and multifidus muscles of patients with persistent symptoms after ACDF. These differences may indicate altered motor strategy in this patient group when performing the upper limb task and may need to be considered when prescribing exercise for postsurgical rehabilitation.

40|$|Background. Chronic whiplash-associated {{disorders}} (WAD) {{have been}} shown to be associated with motor dysfunction. Increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in neck and shoulder girdle muscles has been demonstrated during different tasks in participants with persistent WAD.

40|$|EMG {{recordings}} of the neck muscles (biventer cervicis, complexus, splenius, <b>longus</b> <b>capitis)</b> of decerebrate cats were obtained during pitch and roll stimulations (sinusoidal stimulation: 30 -degrees p-p amplitude, 0. 2 Hz frequency). Most of the EMG responses to pitch showed activation peaks leading the position stimuli by 56 -degrees and inhibition peaks leading by 11 -degrees. Conversely, in response to roll the activation peak led by 16 -degrees and the inhibition peak by 10 -degrees. The activation peaks of the pitch responses were, thus, more asymmetric and more leading {{than those of the}} roll responses. Consequently, the harmonic distortion coefficient was significantly higher in pitch than in roll. Moreover, when the vertical semicircular canals were activated in absence of otolithic modulation, the pitch and roll responses maintained the same difference in timing observed in the presence of otolithic coactivation. It appeared that the simultaneous stimulation of both anterior semicircular canals (pitch) induces a greater lead than that of combined anterior and posterior canals (roll). Thus the timing of neck muscle responses to vestibular stimulation depends on the pair of activated vertical semicircular canals...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the recruitment pattern of deep and superficial neck flexors evoked by three different cervical flexion exercises using muscle functional MRI. In 19 healthy participants, transverse relaxation time (T 2) values were calculated for the longus colli (Lco), <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (Lca), and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) at rest and following three exercises: conventional cervical flexion (CF), craniocervical flexion (CCF), and a combined craniocervical flexion and cervical flexion (CCF-CF). CCF-CF gave the highest T 2 increase for all muscles. CCF displayed a significantly higher T 2 increase for the Lca compared with the Lco and the SCM. When comparing the CCF and CF, no significant difference was found for the Lca, whereas the Lco and SCM displayed a higher T 2 increase during CF compared with CCF. This study shows that muscle functional MRI can be used to characterize the specific activation levels and recruitment patterns of the superficial and deep neck flexors during different cervical flexion exercises. During CCF-CF, all synergists are maximally recruited, which makes this exercise useful for high-load training. CCF may provide a more specific method to assess and retrain Lca muscle performance compared with CF and CCF-CF. This study highlights the need to differentiate between the Lco and Lca when evaluating their function, since these results demonstrate a clear difference in activation of both muscles...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown altered neck muscle {{function}} in individuals with chronic whiplash associated disorder (WAD). However, we lack real-time investigations with non-invasive methods that can distinguish between the different ventral neck muscle layers. This study investigated deformations and deformation rates in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM), <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (Lcap), and longus colli (Lco) muscles with real-time ultrasonography. Twenty-six individuals with WAD were compared with 26 controls, matched for age and sex. Ultrasound imaging of the SCM, Lcap, and Lco were recorded during 10 repetitive arm elevations. The first and tenth arm elevations were post-process analyzed with speckle tracking. There were few {{significant differences in the}} deformations or deformation rates in the SCM, Lcap, and Lco between the WAD and control group. In controls, deformations and deformation rates showed linear positive relationships between SCM/Lcap, SCM/Lco, and Lcap/Lco which increased from the first arm elevation (R(2)  =  0. 14 - 0. 70); to the tenth arm elevation (R(2)  =  0. 51 - 0. 71). The WAD group showed similar or weaker linear relationship (R(2)  <  0. 19) during the tenth compared to the first (R(2)  <  0. 44) arm elevation except for deformations in Lcap/Lco (R(2)  =  0. 13 - 0. 57). This result indicated that deformations and deformation rates in one muscle were correlated by similar deformations and deformation rates in other neck muscles in the control group, but this interplay between muscles was not found in the WAD group...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{important}} for prospective studies, the reliability of quantitative measures of cervical muscle size on magnetic resonance imaging is not well established. The aim of the current work was to assess the long-term reliability of measurements of cervical muscle size. In addition, we examined the utility of selecting specific sub-regions of muscles at each vertebral level, averaging between sides of the body, and pooling muscles into larger groups. Axial scans from the base of skull to the third thoracic vertebra were performed in 20 healthy male subjects at baseline and 1. 5  years later. We evaluated the semi-spinalis capitis, splenius capitis, spinalis cervicis, <b>longus</b> <b>capitis,</b> longus colli, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalenes and middle with posterior scalenes. Bland-Altman analysis showed all measurements to be repeatable between testing-days. Reliability was typically best when entire muscle volume was measured (co-efficients of variation (CVs) : 3. 3 - 8. 1 % depending on muscle). However, when the size of the muscle was assessed at specific vertebral levels, similar measurement precision was achieved (CVs: 2. 7 - 7. 6 %). A median of 4 - 6 images were measured at the specific vertebral levels versus 18 - 37 images for entire muscle volume. This would represent considerable time saving. Based on the findings we also recommend measuring both sides of the body and calculating an average value. Pooling specific muscles into the deep neck flexors (CV: 3. 5 %) and neck extensors (CV: 2. 7 %) can serve to reduce variability further. The results of the current study help to establish outcome measures for interventional studies and for sample size estimation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Evidence {{suggests}} that the deep cervical flexors (DCFs) are important for {{the control of the}} cervical spine. The craniocervical flexion (CCF) test is a clinical test developed for patients with neck pain disorders based on the action of the DCFs. Because these muscles are deeply situated, it is difficult to reach the DCFs with surface electromyography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to measure these muscles in cross section. The objective of this study was (1) to determine the reliability of MRI for measuring cross-sectional area (CSA) of the longus colli (Lco) and <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (Lea) and (2) to evaluate the changes in CSA during contraction. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects aged 29 +/- 9. 3 years were imaged using MRI. The CSA of the Lco and Lca was evaluated at 4 different levels (CO-C 1, C 2 -C 3, C 4 -C 5, and C 6 -C 7) at rest and during CCF. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficients for the CSA of the Leo and Lea showed good to excellent reliability (0. 73 - 0. 92), except at the C 4 -C 5 level. There was a significant increase in CSA of both Leo (F = 6. 79, P =. 015) and Lea (F = 19. 20, P <=. 001) due to CCF, and this was at different levels. The highest increases in CSA occurred at the C 0 -C 1 level for the Lea (11. 1 %) and at the C 2 -C 3 level for the Leo (17. 4 %). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the action of CCF resulted in a contraction of the Leo and Lea at different levels. The results indicate that MRI is a promising technique to evaluate changes in CSA during contraction...|$|E
40|$|We {{designed}} this experimental study to investigate tissue motions and thus infer the recruitment {{pattern of the}} ventral neck muscles [sternocleidomastoid (SCM), <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> (Lca), and longus colli (Lco) ] at the C 4 -C 5 level in healthy volunteers during isometric manual resistance of the head in flexion in a seated position. This exercise {{is used in the}} physiotherapeutic treatment of neck pain and is assumed to activate the deep ventral muscles, but the assumption has not been clearly evaluated. Neck flexors of 16 healthy volunteers (mean age 24 years, SD 3. 7) were measured using ultrasonography with strain and strain rate (SR) tissue velocity imaging (TVI) during isometric contraction of flexor muscles. TVI involves using Doppler imaging to study tissue dynamics. All three muscles showed a deformation compared to rest. Except for the initial contraction phase, Lco exhibited a lower strain than Lca and SCM but was the only muscle with a significant change in SR between the phases. When the beginning of the contraction phase was analysed, Lco was the first to be deformed among most volunteers, followed by Lca and then SCM. The exercise investigated seems to be useful as a "stabilizing" exercise for Lco. Our suggestion is that in further research, Lco and Lca should be investigated as separate muscles. TVI could be used to study tissue motions and thus serve as an indicator of muscle patterning between the neck flexors, with the possibility of separating Lco and Lca.

In the 2 nd Berlin BedRest Study (BBR 2 - 2), 24 male subjects underwent 60 -day bed rest and performed either no exercise, resistive exercise, or resistive exercise with whole body vibration. Subjects were followed for 2 yr after bed rest. On axial cervical magnetic resonance images from the skull to T 3, the volumes of the semispinalis capitis, splenius capitis, spinalis cervicis, <b>longus</b> <b>capitis,</b> longus colli, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, middle and posterior scalenes, and anterior scalenes were measured. Disc height, anteroposterior width, and volume were measured from C 2 / 3 to T 6 / 7 on sagittal images. The volume of all muscles, {{with the exception of}} semispinalis capitis, increased during bed rest (P < 0. 025). There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups for changes in the muscles. Increased upper and midthoracic spine disc height and volume (P < 0. 001) was seen during bed rest, and disc height increases persisted at least 6 mo after bed rest. Increases in thoracic disc height were greater (P = 0. 003) in the resistive vibration exercise group than in control. On radiological review, two subjects showed new injuries to the mid-lower thoracic spine. One of these subjects reported a midthoracic pain incident during maximal strength testing before bed rest and the other after countermeasure exercise on day 3 of bed rest. We conclude that bed rest is associated with increased disc size in the thoracic region and increases in muscle volume at the neck.

40|$|Study Design. Retrospective {{investigation}} of muscle changes in patients suffering from chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Objectives. To quantitatively compare {{the presence of}} muscle alterations (fatty infiltrate [MFI] and cross-sectional area [CSA]) in the anterior musculature of the cervical spine in a cohort of chronic whiplash patients (WAD II) and healthy control subjects across muscle and cervical segmental level. Summary of Background Data. Magnetic resonance imaging {{can be regarded as}} the gold standard for muscle imaging. There is little knowledge about in vivo features of anterior neck muscles in patients suffering from chronic WAD and how muscle structure differs across the factors of muscle, vertebral level, age, self-reported pain and disability, body mass index, and duration of symptoms. Methods. Reliable magnetic resonance imaging measures for MFI and CSA were performed for the anterior cervical muscles bilaterally in 109 female subjects (78 WAD, 31 healthy control; 18 - 45 years, 3 months to 3 years postinjury). The measures were performed on all subjects for the <b>longus</b> <b>capitis</b> and colli and the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Results. The WAD subjects had significantly larger MFI and CSA for the anterior muscles compared to healthy control subjects (all P < 0. 0001). In addition, the amount of MFI varied by both cervical level and muscle, with the longus capitis/colli having the largest amount of fatty infiltrates at the C 2 -C 3 level (P < 0. 0001). MFI was inversely related to age, self-reported pain/disability, and body mass index but directly proportional to duration of symptoms. Conclusion. There is significantly greater MFI and CSA in the anterior neck muscles, especially in the deeper longus capitis/colli muscles, in subjects with chronic WAD when compared to healthy controls. Future studies are required to investigate the relationships between muscular morphometry and symptoms in patients suffering from acute and chronic WAD. No Full Tex...|$|E
