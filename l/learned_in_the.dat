5|$|Not {{in itself}} {{a part of the}} Wars of Scottish Independence, the battle is {{significant}} for its employment of tactics <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scottish wars in a domestic, English conflict. Both the extensive use of foot soldiers rather than cavalry, and the heavy impact caused by the longbow, represented significant steps in military developments.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley, on the 1846 {{junction}} of the London and Birmingham railway with the Bedford branch, {{was to become}} an important railway town too. In 1850, another branch from Bletchley to Oxford was built, later to become the (Cambridge/Oxford) Varsity Line. Bletchley, originally a small village in the parish of Fenny Stratford, grew to reach and absorb its parent. In Stony Stratford, expertise <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works {{was applied to the}} construction of traction engines for agricultural use and the site of the present Cofferidge Close was engaged in their manufacture.|$|E
5|$|In the {{production}} of the music video, Miyazaki experimented with using computer animation to supplement traditional hand drawn cell-animation. At the time Studio Ghibli did not have its own computer department and the work was outsourced to CG Production Company Links, under supervision of Hideki Nakano. Techniques <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimentation for On Your Mark were later adopted for the creation of Princess Mononoke. Animation director was Masashi Andō. Long time Miyazaki collaborator Michiyo Yasuda was in charge of colour selection. Backgrounds were created by Kazuo Oga. Yōji Takeshige made his debut as Art Director. There is no dialogue in the music video and the two policemen are loosely modeled after Chage and Aska.|$|E
40|$|Magister Educationis - MEdThis study {{investigated}} how workplace educator development programmes prepare workplace educators for their {{roles and responsibilities}} <b>in</b> facilitating <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. Framed by the literature, the research shows that workplace educators’ qualifications prepare them for facilitating <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. The most important findings show that their qualifications have prepared them for their roles and responsibilities <b>in</b> facilitating transformative <b>learning</b> within the workplace. Furthermore, the findings show that their qualifications, roles and responsibilities <b>in</b> facilitating <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace also impacted on workplace educators’ own thinking, prompting them to question their own values and beliefs. This perspective transformation allows for workplace educators better facilitating transformative <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace...|$|R

Key success factors were detailed and lessons learned were elaborated, including several recommendations to both the 2011 championships and the organizing committee for the 2013 championships in Val di Fiemme, Italy. Besides the 2009, 2011, and 2013 organizing committees in attendance, other attendees included the Norwegian Ski Federation, the European Broadcasting Union television, FIS, and the APF marketing partners.|$|E
5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because of lessons <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E

Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E

25|$|Waltrip {{was born}} on February 5, 1947 in Owensboro, Kentucky. Starting his driving career in Go-karts at age 12, Waltrip entered his first stock car race just four years later. Waltrip and his father built a 1936 Chevrolet coupe and headed to a local dirt track near their Owensboro home. The first night out was far from a success as the youngster, barely old enough to drive on the street, Waltrip slammed the wall and heavily damaged the coupe. Waltrip soon left the dirt and found his niche on asphalt where the {{smoothness}} he <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> karts proved a valuable asset.|$|E

Some of the clinical work traditionally performed by residents has been shifted to other healthcare workers such as ward clerks, nurses, laboratory personnel, and phlebotomists. It has also resulted in a shift of some resident work towards home work, where residents will complete paperwork and other duties at home as to not have to log the hours.|$|E
