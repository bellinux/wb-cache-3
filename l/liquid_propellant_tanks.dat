40|$|Many {{spacecraft}} {{are designed}} to spin about an axis along the flight path {{as a means of}} stabilizing the attitude of the spacecraft via gyroscopic stiffness. Because of the assembly requirements of the spacecraft and the launch vehicle, these spacecraft often spin about an axis corresponding to a minor moment of inertia. In such a case, any perturbation of the spin axis will cause sloshing motions in the <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> that will eventually dissipate enough kinetic energy to cause the spin axis nutation (wobble) to grow further. This spinning slosh and resultant nutation growth is a primary design problem of spinning spacecraft and one that is not easily solved by analysis or simulation only.

For asymptotically small slosh amplitudes or conversely large baffle widths, an asymptotic expression for slosh damping was developed and calibrated using historical experimental sub-scale slosh damping data. For the parameter space that lies between region of applicability of the asymptotic expression and the Miles equation, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of slosh damping were used to develop an expression for slosh damping.

40|$|Spin-stabilization {{maneuvers}} {{are typically}} performed by spacecraft entering low-earth orbit to maintain attitude stability. These maneuvers induce periodic fluid movement inside the spacecraft's propellant tank known as fuel slosh, {{which is responsible}} for creating forces and moments on the sidewalls of the propellant tank. These forces and moments adversely affect spin-stabilization and risk jeopardizing the mission of the spacecraft. Therefore, propellant tanks are designed with propellant management devices (PMD's) such as barnes or diaphragms which work to counteract the forces and moments associated with fuel slosh. However, despite the presence of PMD's, the threat of spin-stabilization interference still exists should the propellant tank be excited at its natural frequency. When the fluid is excited at its natural frequency, the forces and moments acting on the propellant tank are amplified and may result in destabilizing the spacecraft. Thus, a computational analysis is conducted concerning diaphragm-implemented propellant tanks excited at their natural frequencies. Using multi-disciplinary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, computational models are developed to reflect potential scenarios that spacecraft propellant tanks could experience. By simulating the propellant tank under a wide array of parameters and variables including fill-level, gravity and diaphragm material and shape, a better understanding is gained as to how these parameters individually and collectively affect <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> and ultimately, spacecraft attitude dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Improving {{structural}} efficiency while reducing manufacturing costs are key objectives when making future heavy-lift launchers more performing and cost efficient. The main enabling technologies are {{the application of}} advanced high performance materials as well as cost effective manufacture processes. This paper presents the status and main results of a joint industrial research & development effort to demonstrate TRL 6 of a novel manufacturing process for large <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> for launcher applications. Using high strength aluminium-lithium alloy combined with the spin forming manufacturing technique, this development aims at thinner wall thickness and weight savings up to 25 % {{as well as a}} significant reduction in manufacturing effort. In this program, the concave spin forming process is used to manufacture tank domes from a single flat plate. Applied to aluminium alloy, this process allows reaching the highest possible material strength status T 8, eliminating numerous welding steps which are typically necessary to assemble tank domes from 3 D-curved panels. To minimize raw material costs for large diameter tank domes for launchers, the dome blank has been composed from standard plates welded together prior to spin forming by friction stir welding. After welding, the dome blank is contoured {{in order to meet the}} required wall thickness distribution. For achieving a material state of T 8, also in the welding seams, the applied spin forming process allows the required cold stretching of the 3 D-curved dome, with a subsequent ageing in a furnace. This combined manufacturing process has been demonstrated up to TRL 6 for tank domes with a 5. 4 m diameter. In this paper, the manufacturing process as well as test results are presented. Plans are shown how this process could be applied to future heavy-lift launch vehicles developments, also for larger dome diameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the performance of a}} propellant tank pressurization system with the pressurant diffuser intentionally submerged {{beneath the surface of the}} <b>liquid.</b> <b>Propellant</b> <b>tanks</b> and pressurization systems are typically designed with the diffuser positioned to apply pressurant gas directly into the tank ullage space when the liquid propellant is settled. Space vehicles, and potentially propellant depots, may need to conduct tank pressurization operations in microgravity environments where the exact location of the liquid relative to the diffuser is not well understood. If the diffuser is positioned to supply pressurant gas directly to the tank ullage space when the propellant is settled, then it may become partially or completely submerged when the liquid becomes unsettled in a microgravity environment. In such case, the pressurization system performance will be adversely affected requiring additional pressurant mass and longer pressurization times. This {{series of tests}} compares and evaluates pressurization system performance using the conventional method of supplying pressurant gas directly to the propellant tank ullage, and then supplying pressurant gas beneath the liquid surface. The pressurization tests were conducted on the Engineering Development Unit (EDU) located at Test Stand 300 at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). EDU is a ground based Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) test article supported by Glenn Research Center (GRC) and MSFC. A 150 ft 3 propellant tank was filled with liquid hydrogen (LH 2). The pressurization system used regulated ambient helium (GHe) as a pressurant, a variable position valve to maintain flow rate, and two identical independent pressurant diffusers. The ullage diffuser was located in the forward end of the tank and was completely exposed to the tank ullage. The submerged diffuser was located in the aft end of the tank and was completely submerged when the tank liquid level was 10 % or greater. The ullage diffuser tests were conducted as a baseline to evaluate the performance of the pressurization system, and the submerged diffuser tests showed how the performance of the pressurization system was compromised when the diffuser was submerged in LH 2.

The interaction of the disturbance forces and torques, caused by the moving fuel, with the solid body and the control system, might lead to an increase in the AOCS actuators commands, which can degrade the vehicle's pointing performances and, in critical cases, generate unstable attitude and orbit control. Thus, it is of major importance to accurately predict the behaviour of <b>liquid</b> <b>propellants</b> sloshing inside spacecraft tanks. This M.

From a defined set of requirements an open source CFD software based on FEM is chosen - Elmer.

The first two test cases deal with rectangular and cylindrical laterally excited tanks where comparators are available - the results of the tests are validated against numerical and experimental results. The final test case is defined to reduce the gap between the simple test cases performed to validate the software and the real sloshing problems faced in space vehicles.

The objective is to carry out a simulation of a time dependent acceleration in influencing a <b>liquid</b> <b>propellant</b> by implementing a suitable varying acceleration model into the momentum equation. For the applications of present interest the acceleration must be interpolated from data to be obtained from an external ASCII �le. Before the �nal test case, the basic functionality and stability of the code is tested with two and three dimensional test cases.

For an accurate interpolation of the acceleration for a varying time step the linear, barycentric Lagrange and Akima interpolation method are selected and tested. The Akima interpolation method proves to be most suitable for the required acceleration model. The accuracy of the model is validated using experimental sloshing results which are based on a lateral excited cylindrical tank.
