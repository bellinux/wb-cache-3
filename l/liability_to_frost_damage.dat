50|$|Spring and Fall: Spring {{and fall}} are {{critical}} seasons for grape development, because {{the plants are}} susceptible <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage,</b> which can injure the fruiting buds.

40|$|Fall frost is {{a serious}} concern to seed corn (Zea mays L.) {{producers}} in the Midwest. A frost event that happens prior to seed maturity can cause physical, biochemical, and physiological changes in the seed. These changes lead to decreased vigor and viability resulting in revenue loss for seed corn producers. Genetics and seed maturity greatly influence seed tolerance <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> The central hypothesis {{of this study is}} that differences in frost tolerance can occur among the same genotype and these differences may be the result of varying seed oil and protein contents. Information gathered from this study may lead to better field management techniques for seed corn producers faced with early fall frost. This project advances our understanding of the mechanisms of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> and seed tolerance <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Chapter 2 discusses seed vigor of five corn hybrids with different levels of seed oil and protein following an early fall frost. Chapter 3 explores freezing characteristics of these same five hybrids during a fall frost...|$|R

2500|$|Cumin {{is grown}} from seeds. The seeds need [...] for emergence, an optimum of [...] is suggested. Cumin is {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage,</b> especially at flowering and early seed formation stages. Methods <b>to</b> reduce <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> are spraying with sulfuric acid (0.1%), irrigating the crop prior <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> incidence, setting up windbreaks, or creating {{an early morning}} smoke cover. The seedlings of cumin are rather small and their vigor is low. Soaking the seeds for 8 hours before sowing enhances germination. For an optimal plant population a sowing density of [...] is recommended. Fertile, sandy, loamy soils with good aeration, proper drainage and high oxygen availability are preferred. The pH optimum of the soil ranges from 6.8 to 8.3. Cumin seedlings are sensitive to salinity [...] and emergence from heavy soils is rather difficult. Therefore, a proper seedbed preparation (smooth bed) is crucial for optimal establishment of cumin.|$|R

In this paper we investigate {{the effect of the}} risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> masonry. The risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> an external building envelope might become less due to the increase in air temperature. However, the risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> might rise as a construction may be wet for a longer time due to the increase in rainfall intensities.

40|$|Frost {{is a large}} issue {{limiting}} {{cereal production}} across the Australian wheat-belt. Successful frost risk management requires an integrated approach involving {{many aspects of the}} farming system, such as sowing time, crop/cultivar selection, stubble management and plant nutrition. A number of commercial chemical products have become available in recent times offering potential crop protection <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> During 2014 at Mintaro, South Australia, four protectant products (anti-transpirant and biochemical products) were applied and one plant growth regulator, Trinexapac-ethyl to wheat plots sown at seven weekly intervals to assess their potential <b>to</b> alleviate <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Several <b>frost</b> events occurred during the growing season. The degree of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> varied across each time of sowing corresponding <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> events at susceptible stages of plant development. Of the chemical protectants tested, none provided any significant reduction in frost induced sterility or gains in yield compared to the untreated control. However, the Trinexapac-ethyl increased the sensitivity of wheat <b>to</b> <b>frost.</b> Average frost induced sterility increased from 42 % of the untreated control to 51 % when applied during stem elongation. This difference in sterility was also reflected in grain yield as the same treatment was 8 % lower yielding than untreated plots. Preliminary results of this study suggested none of the tested chemical anti-transpirant or biochemical products offered any significant improvement in frost tolerance.

40|$|Abstract. Bricks of {{tunnels and}} bridges of Usui Pass railway (Japan) exposed to north are subject <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Average depth of erosion due to {{detachment}} of angular blocks is around 1 – 1. 5 cm.

50|$|Optima ripens very early, {{even before}} other {{varieties}} which are considered as early ripening, such as Müller-Thurgau. Its late budding made it {{popular in the}} Mosel region, since it thus was less prone <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> It can also grow on poor sites, where more demanding grape varieties such as Riesling do not ripen very reliably. It also easily achieves very impressive must weights, resulting in its use as a booster of Prädikat levels and sweetness in cheap German blended wines, primarily in Rheinhessen and Mosel.

40|$|Concrete {{undergoing}} early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in {{cold weather}} will experience significant loss of not only strength, but also of permeability and durability. Accordingly, concrete codes like ACI- 306 R prescribe a minimum compressive strength and duration of curing <b>to</b> prevent <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> {{at an early age}} and secure the quality of concrete. Such minimum compressive strength and duration of curing are mostly defined based on the strength development of concrete. However, concrete subjected <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> at early age may not show a consistent relationship between its strength and durability. Especially, since durability of concrete is of utmost importance in nuclear power plant structures, this relationship should be imperatively clarified. Therefore, this study verifies the feasibility of the minimum compressive strength specified in the codes like ACI- 306 R by evaluating the strength development and the durability preventing the <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> of early age concrete for nuclear power plant. The results indicate that the value of 5 MPa specified by the concrete standards like ACI- 306 R as the minimum compressive strength to prevent the early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is reasonable in terms of the strength development, but seems to be inappropriate in the viewpoint of the resistance to chloride ion penetration and freeze-thaw. Consequently, it is recommended to propose a minimum compressive strength preventing early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in terms of not only the strength development, but also in terms of the durability to secure the quality of concrete for nuclear power plants in cold climates...|$|R

40|$|In Kitami City, Hokkaido, cracks {{have been}} found in bricks, {{seemingly}} due <b>to</b> <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> {{have been found}}. In this research, we considered three different mechanisms of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> such as <b>frost</b> heave phenomenon, one-dimensional freeze-thaw phenomenon, and closed-type freeze-thaw phenomenon. We conducted frost heave experiment and two kinds of laboratory freeze-thaw experiments in order to verify the actual mechanism of the formation of the cracks in the bricks. From the experimental results, it has been confirmed that frost heave phenomenon does not occur in bricks and that cracks does not occur in bricks due to simple one-dimensional freeze-thaw phenomenon. In addition, if bricks do not melt completely during repeated freezing leaving some frozen parts and then the bricks refreeze, the melted parts refreeze surrounded by the frozen parts and cracks then appear in the bricks. In this research, this mechanism of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> has been defined as closed-type freeze-thaw phenomenon.
