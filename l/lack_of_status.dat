25|$|Unlike {{many other}} Scottish Mormaers, he played little {{role in the}} wider society of the Scottish kingdom. Lennox {{at the time was}} a {{frontier}} region between the Scottish Gaelic lands of central Scotland and the Norse Gaelic lands of Argyll, and the Mormaerdom seems to have lacked the status accorded to the other Mormaerdoms. Either because of this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status,</b> or {{because of the lack of}} interest in national affairs, Ailin's attendance was not recorded at the coronation of King Alexander II, at Scone in 1215.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Speedway owner Tony George {{announced}} {{plans for a new}} series, to be called the Indy Racing League. The Indy 500 would serve as its centerpiece. Opinions varied on his motivations, with his supporters sharing his disapproval of the race's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> within CART, the increasing number of foreign drivers (as American drivers were gravitating towards NASCAR), and the decreasing number of ovals in the season series. Detractors accused George of throwing his weight around and using the race as leverage to gain complete control of the sport of open wheel racing in the United States.|$|E

500|$|For example, the {{incident}} with the [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls {{takes place in}} chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. [...] Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes {{in this way is}} that it followed her thematic structure. [...] Angelou's editor, Robert Loomis, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. [...] Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey [...] "to establish a worthwhile self-concept", and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. [...] However, Hagen notes that instead of beginning Caged Bird chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps, Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status.</b> [...] Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose is to demonstrate Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother {{at the end of the}} book.|$|E
2500|$|Heathcliff: Found, presumably orphaned, on {{the streets}} of Liverpool and taken by Mr. Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family. He and Catherine grow close and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its {{consequences}} are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a Byronic hero, but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> is underlined by the fact that [...] "Heathcliff" [...] is both his given name and his surname.|$|E

50|$|Contempt {{has five}} features. Contempt {{requires}} a judgment concerning the appearance or standing {{of the object}} of contempt. In particular, contempt involves the judgment that, because of some moral or personal failing or defect, the contemned person has compromised his or her standing vis-Ã -vis an interpersonal standard that the contemptor treats as important. This may have not been done deliberately but by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status.</b> This <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> may cause the contemptuous to classify the object of contempt as utterly worthless, or as not fully meeting a particular interpersonal standard. Therefore, contempt {{is a response to}} a perceived failure to meet an interpersonal standard. Contempt is also a particular way of regarding or attending to the object of contempt, and this form of regard has an unpleasant affective element. However, contempt may be experienced as a highly visceral emotion similar to disgust, or as cool disregard.|$|E

50|$|Co-workers start noticing him and complimenting him on {{his coat}} and he ventures out into the social world. His hopes are quickly dashed by the theft of the coat.

He is plunged into illness (fever) and cannot function. He dies quickly and without putting up much of a fight.

5000|$|First {{used in the}} {{invasion}} of North Africa, the Mk.5 crews immediately earned a reputation for efficiency under fire and in the worst of weather or sea conditions. Enjoying little priority in fleet maintenance schedules, the LCT crews also gained a reputation for [...] "finding" [...] whatever they needed. Much of this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> within the amphibious forces was because the LCT was the smallest landing craft organized into independent assault flotillas. Almost entirely manned by reservists and draftees, LCT crews operated in a free and easy manner that horrified professional naval officers. By late 1943, most early Mk.5s were relegated to training or harbour duties in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Zoe is an Indian-American {{student who}} embodies the {{stereotype}} of the popular and mean cheerleader. In her previous school, Zoe had numerous boyfriends all of whom believe that she loved them. Initially her concerns in Morning Glory Academy seem to be a continuation of her previous obsessions with cute boys and popularity. She expresses annoyance with the other students, particularly with the earnestness of Casey and the moodiness of Jade. With the boys, she is disdainful of Ike's crude pickup lines and disdainful of Hunter's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status.</b> As the series progresses a darker, and more murderous side to Zoe is seen and it is hinted that she may have a deeper connection to the events at Morning Glory Academy.|$|E
50|$|Immediate {{reaction}} amongst shooters to {{the group}} was mixed, with some embracing the possibilities that a single, consolidated organisation would bring, whilst others raised practical considerations regarding the implementation and impact of a single coherent body, such as the CPSA's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> charity <b>status</b> which would have required substantial restructuring to amalgamate into a new body that {{would be eligible for}} charity status.|$|R

He is above dumpster diving with Dudley, but only because he has already been thrown out of the dumpsters of the more classy establishments.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 {{revision}} of the TMP is currently under revision by S1 Training Development. At this stage the review intends to consolidate the training facilitation, however critics have noted the absence of ELT (Electronic Learning Technologies) within the CadetNet system, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> RTO <b>status,</b> and continued conservative war-like training. Many cadets have labeled the training revision as being passe, and consultation with units has not been conducted.|$|R

5000|$|CRASH awarded Chaos 8 out of 10 in issue 16, praising {{neatness}} of presentation, efficient sound effects, pleasing sprites {{and concluding}} {{that it was}} a very good multiplayer strategy game. Criticisms included the sparseness of the initial playing area, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>status</b> report for the wizards and information on how much damage was being dealt. The reviewer also felt there could have been a wider range of missile attack spells. Sinclair User rated Chaos 4 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "fast-moving and colourful" [...] with simple, functional graphics. It was seen to be complex enough to appeal to players of both Dungeons & Dragons and strategy games. White Dwarf awarded 7 out of 10, finding particular fun in the spells [...] "Magic Fire" [...] and [...] "Gooey Blob" [...] but criticising the poor quality of the instruction booklet.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the arrests}} of D.J Williams, Saunders Lewis and Lewis Valantine for the [...] "tÃ¢n yn llÅ·n" [...] in 1936 {{all three were}} tried on charges of arson in Caernarfon crown court where their pleads were deemed invalid as they all pleaded in Welsh.

At Cardiff Eisteddfod in 1939 a petition was launched by Undeb Cymdeithasau Cymru (The union of Welsh societies) calling for recognition of the Welsh language in the courts. Their presentation of the petition to parliament in 1941 lead to the passing of the Welsh courts act of 1942 and thus the validation of pleas in the Welsh language.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> town <b>status</b> {{continued}} to be a problem - residents of the southern village of Pomfret had to cross for some seven miles through Mortlake before re-entering Pomfret again. Further, at the time Town taxes were levied to support the Church - but the portions of Mortlake Parish within Mortlake Manor laid outside of either Pomfret or Canterbury, and thus couldnât be taxed to support the Church its residents where expected to attend.|$|R
