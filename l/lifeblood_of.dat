Farmers can purchase seedlings, the <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants.

25|$|Thus, {{both the}} Japanese and the Portuguese were {{left out of}} the {{tributary}} trade by {{the first decades of the}} 16th century. By the middle of the century though, Japan and Portugal became the premier suppliers of silver in East Asia by bringing in silver from mines like the Iwami Ginzan in Japan and the Cerro de Potosí in Bolivia. Silver was the <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the Ming Chinese economy, but the Ming government placed many restrictions on mining due to fears that the bullion would pool into private hands. Even without the restrictions, China's silver veins were too small and located too far away in the southwest from the commercialized coastal provinces to keep up with the huge demand. This situation made unofficial dealings with foreigners very profitable and enticing for Chinese merchants, despite the risks and illegality of their trade.|$|E

25|$|Columbia {{received}} its first charter as {{a town in}} 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was the <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> the Columbia community; in 1850 virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.|$|E

After meeting with a group of elves, Cress obtains the legendary Eternal Sword, {{the only thing that can}} stop Dhaos from moving through time, and travel to his invisible fortress for the final confrontation. After finally defeating him, the party learns from a tree spirit named Martel that he is a visitor from a dying planet called Derris Karran, whose world was slowly withering due to the death of its world tree, the source of all mana and <b>lifeblood</b> <b>of</b> everything in it. Attempting to obtain a seed from this planet's world tree, Yggdrasil, Dhaos instead found that its power was fading as well due to the humans' constant misuse of mana-based technology, and decided to wipe them out to save it. As the party members realize that by saving their world they have doomed his, Martel takes pity on their plight and sends a mana seed into space in an attempt to rejuvenate Derris-Kharlan's tree as Cress and his team return to their proper times.|$|E
