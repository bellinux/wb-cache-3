40|$|Objective: To screen {{antitumor}} active compounds, drug-like or <b>leading</b> <b>compounds</b> from Chinese {{traditional and}} herbal drugs. Methods: Eleven coumarin compounds {{isolated from the}} Chinese traditional and herbal drugs were studied for their antitumor activities in vitro by determining the inhibition rates against growth of human bladder carcinoma cell line E-J. Results: It showed that umbelliferone, scoparone, demethylfuropinarine, isopimpinellin, forbesoside, columbianadin, decursin and glycycoumarin inhibited the growth of human bladder carcinoma cell line E-J in vitro and their activities showed a concentration-effect relationship. The inhibitory effects of forbesoside, columbianadin, decursin and umbelliferone, with IC 50 values of 7. 50 × 10 - 7, 2. 30 × 10 - 6, 6. 00 × 10 - 6 and 1. 30 × 10 - 6 mol/L, respectively, were stronger {{than those of the}} other tested compounds. However, xanthotoxin, esculin and sphondin did not inhibit the growth of human bladder carcinoma cell line E-J in this assay condition. Conclusion: These findings indicate that forbesoside, columbianadin, esculin, decursin and umbelliferone would be effective or regarded as potent drug-like or <b>leading</b> <b>compounds</b> against human bladder carcinoma...|$|E

The scarcity of antifungal agents and their limited efficacy contribute to the unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rates associated with these infections. The yeast-to-hypha transition represents the main virulence factor associated with the pathogenesis of C.  albicans infections. In addition, filamentation is pivotal for robust biofilm development, which represents another major virulence factor for candidiasis and further complicates treatment. Targeting pathogenic mechanisms rather than growth represents an attractive yet clinically unexploited approach {{in the development of}} novel antifungal agents. Here, we performed large-scale phenotypic screening assays with 30, 000 drug-like small-molecule compounds within ChemBridge’s DIVERSet chemical library in order to identify small-molecule inhibitors of C.  albicans filamentation, and our efforts led to the identification of a novel series of bioactive compounds with a common biaryl amide core structure.
