5|$|On 8 April 1954, Comet G-ALYY ("Yoke Yoke"), on {{charter to}} South African Airways, {{was on a}} leg from Rome to Cairo (of a longer route, SA Flight 201 from London to Johannesburg), when it crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples {{with the loss of}} all 21 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The Comet fleet was immediately grounded once again and a large investigation board was formed {{under the direction of the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked the Royal Navy with helping to locate and retrieve the wreckage so that the cause of the accident could be determined. The Comet's Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked and Comet 1 <b>line</b> <b>production</b> was suspended at the Hatfield factory while the BOAC fleet was permanently grounded, cocooned and stored.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Model T (colloquially {{known as}} the Tin Lizzie, Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an {{automobile}} produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; some of this was because of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly <b>line</b> <b>production</b> instead of individual hand crafting.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{quarries}} {{around the}} western side of Threlkeld Knotts have worked the microgranite. In addition to the large Threlkeld Quarry there are smaller workings at Birkett Bank, Hilltop Quarries and Bramcrag Quarry. Threlkeld Quarry was opened in 1870 to supply railway ballast for the Crewe to Carlisle railway <b>line.</b> <b>Production</b> increased in the 1890s with material for Thirlmere Reservoir and for roadstone. The quarry closed in the 1980s and now houses the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} contract {{called for}} 11 YC-76 preproduction aircraft, {{and the first}} aircraft would be built and tested at Curtiss-Wright's St. Louis, Missouri Division plant. Subsequently, orders for five C-76 production aircraft and nine revised YC-76As were placed by the USAAF, with <b>line</b> <b>production</b> to commence at the Curtiss-Wright plant in Louisville {{as well as a}} Higgins Aircraft factory in New Orleans, Louisiana. To keep the plywood flexible during construction the factory was kept hot and damp. The prototype YC-76 first flew on May 1, 1943.|$|E
25|$|American auto {{companies}} in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year, but {{did not do so}} until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared. Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers, in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly <b>line</b> <b>production),</b> especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.|$|E
25|$|The ovaries {{are made}} up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be {{developed}} being also influenced by ovariole design. In meroistic ovaries, the eggs-to-be divide repeatedly and most of the daughter cells become helper cells for a single oocyte in the cluster. In panoistic ovaries, each egg-to-be produced by stem germ cells develops into an oocyte; there are no helper cells from the germ <b>line.</b> <b>Production</b> of eggs by panoistic ovaries tends to be slower than that by meroistic ovaries.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{announced}} that Samuel Bayer {{was hired to}} direct the film. According to New <b>Line</b> <b>production</b> chief Toby Emmerich, Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer's hiring, as Bay, Bayer, and director David Fincher came up as commercial directors together. It is Bay's opinion that Bayer had [...] "the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make Nightmare feel like a fresh, visually arresting moviegoing experience". Bayer declined Platinum Dunes' offer; twice. It was not until Bay sent the director an email [...] "talking about the business", and explaining what kind of opportunity {{it would be for}} Bayer that he finally agreed.|$|E
500|$|In 1830 James Nasmyth (son of Alexander Nasmyth) {{visited the}} newly opened Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and on his return to Manchester noted the {{suitability}} of a site alongside the canal at Patricroft for an engineering works. [...] He and his brother leased the land from Thomas de Trafford, and established the Bridgewater Foundry in 1836. The foundry was completed the following year with a design based upon assembly <b>line</b> <b>production.</b> In 1839 Nasmyth invented the steam hammer, which enabled the manufacture of forgings at a scale and speed not seen before. In the same year the foundry started to manufacture railway locomotives, with109 built by 1853. Nasmyth died a wealthy man in 1890.|$|E

2500|$|Machines, in Wiener's opinion, {{are meant}} to {{interact}} harmoniously with humanity and provide respite from the industrial trap we have made for ourselves. Wiener describes the automaton as inherently necessary to humanity's societal evolution. People could be free to expand their minds, pursue artistic careers, while automatons take over assembly <b>line</b> <b>production</b> to create necessary commodities. These machines must be [...] "used {{for the benefit of}} man, for increasing his leisure and enriching his spiritual life, rather than merely for profits and the worship of the machine as a new brazen calf" [...] (p.162).|$|E

New <b>Line</b> <b>production</b> president Toby Emmerich said of Weitz's return: [...] "I think Chris realized that if he didn’t come back in and step up, maybe the movie wasn’t going to get made... We really didn’t have a Plan B at that point." [...] Weitz was attracted back to the project after receiving a letter from Pullman asking him to reconsider. Since his departure, blueprints, production design and visual effects strategies had been put into position, and while Weitz admitted that his fears did not vanish, the project suddenly seemed feasible for the director.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>production</b> <b>line</b> {{imbalances}} {{have been}} observed {{in the pursuit of}} higher profits. A sustainable <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> also called balanced, leads to lower costs, good production environments, and green manufacturing. A decision analysis method, such as <b>production</b> <b>line</b> evaluation, is often employed to help decision makers make sustainable decisions. In this study, a sustainable decision-making model is proposed for the evaluation of engine manufacturing. To solve uncertainties in manufacturing industries while maintaining lower costs and an efficient production environment, evidential reasoning is used in order to evaluate the sustainable <b>production</b> <b>line</b> effectively. First, uncertainties in the engine <b>production</b> <b>line</b> and deficiencies in the existing methods for evaluating the sustainable <b>production</b> <b>line</b> are analyzed. Then, evidential reasoning evaluation of the sustainable engine <b>production</b> <b>line</b> model is proposed and an example is presented; to be specific, the analysis of three <b>production</b> <b>line</b> plans is conducted using evidential reasoning, and plan P 3 is found to be the best. Finally, a FlexSim simulation is used to prove the feasibility of evidential reasoning evaluation, verifying its suitability for achieving sustainable <b>production</b> <b>line</b> evaluation...|$|R
