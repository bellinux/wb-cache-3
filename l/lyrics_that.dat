5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also {{made a conscious decision}} to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.|$|E

5|$|Spiderland is {{the second}} and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was {{released}} on March 27, 1991, through Touch and Go Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word to shouting, the album contains narrative <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{previous}} album, 1989's Mother's Milk {{would become}} the band's second album to enter in the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 {{and at the time}} the biggest of their career. Although the record was mildly successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. He convinced Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, and instructed Kiedis to write <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.|$|E
5|$|Aza Arianao was {{recorded}} over {{five days in}} the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{before going}} to the Archives in autumn 2006, Farrar invited his Gob Iron {{collaborator}} Anders Parker to come with him and look over potential material and the two returned several times over a period of months gathering lyrics for composition before recording together starting on July 14, 2007. As they found <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> interested them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but did not have enough material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade {{with a wave of}} singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft rock stars. Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is a Woody Guthrie tribute album {{performed}} by Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of Guthrie's birth, released through Rounder Records on February 28, 2012. The project was initiated by Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add music to her father's lyrics—specifically, his earliest songwriting years in Los Angeles. Over {{the course of several}} years, he invited the others to collaborate and recorded at a variety of locations across the United States. Each artist wrote music to <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> inspired him and presented it to the collaborators for recording. The result is an album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{on the first two}} albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> might then be rewritten for {{the final version of the}} song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.|$|E

25|$|The hip hop music genre and its {{subculture}} {{has been}} criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. Gangsta rap artists such as Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg have song <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> portray women as sex toys, and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men. Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder. These anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban African-American women. Hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.|$|E
25|$|Mullins had a {{distinctive}} talent {{both as a}} performer and a songwriter. His compositions showed distinction in two ways: unusual and sometimes striking instrumentation, and complex <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> usually employed elaborate metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Livgren was {{a member}} of {{numerous}} bands in the late 1960s and early 1970s and quickly developed a reputation for complex compositions and poetic <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> explored spiritual themes.

25|$|Robert Burns {{worked to}} collect and {{preserve}} Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is The Merry Muses of Caledonia (the title is not by Burns), a collection of bawdy <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> were popular in the music halls of Scotland {{as late as the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|John Lennon {{received}} a letter from a pupil at Quarry Bank High School, which he had attended. The writer mentioned that the English master was making his class analyse Beatles' lyrics. (Lennon wrote an answer, dated 1 September 1967, which was auctioned by Christie's of London in 1992.) Lennon, amused that a teacher was putting so much effort into understanding the Beatles' lyrics, decided to write in his next song the most confusing <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> he could.|$|E
25|$|Christian artists {{generally}} use secular styles, pairing {{them with}} <b>lyrics</b> <b>that</b> display faith and spirituality to varying degrees. Generally speaking, {{the industry is}} influenced by mainstream culture. Musical trends, for instance, follow those of the secular scene, though usually a few years behind. The Christian music industry carries {{the distinction of being}} the only music subculture whose content is labeled by its lyrical dimension rather than its music. Still, music within the industry is sold by its musical style rather than lyrical content.|$|E
