40|$|Do {{the poorest}} neighbourhoods receive the poorest <b>environmental</b> <b>services?</b> This paper explores whether <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> {{provision}} in the UK achieves ‘territorial justice’ with respect to deprived and nondeprived neighbourhoods within cities. Territorial justice is argued to pertain when the distribution of service provision to neighbourhoods reflects levels of need for the service. Focusing on the provision of street-level <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> in four British local authorities, the paper shows that poor and better-off neighbourhoods have different levels of need for <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> It then examines whether the services provided are commensurate with variations in need, using observed cleanliness levels within the neighbourhoods to assess this. The author argues that—despite an increasing policy and practice focus on targeting public services towards deprived neighbourhoods in the UK—environmental service provision does not yet take full account of the complex needs of poor places, meaning {{that they tend to}} be dirtier than their more affluent counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPlanting {{energy crops}} on {{marginal}} land is a potentially attractive way for bioenergy production that retains better land for food crops {{and offers a}} new source of income to poor farmers. Although such lands would be less productive and subject to higher risks, their use for bioenergy plantations could have secondary benefits, such as restoration of degraded vegetation, carbon sequestration and <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> In most countries, however, the suitability of this land for sustainable biofuel production is poorly documented. We summarized and defined the marginal land and then applied the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to diagnose and identify the economic, environmental and social impacts from bioenergy production on marginal land. The results show the strengths include land available, energy crop adaptability and rural economy development, while the weaknesses include economic viability, environmental impacts, and equity and gender concerns. The renewable energy planning target, consideration of food security, biofuel policies and technology development will create the external environment to promote bioenergy production on marginal land, but also rise in fuel price and higher labour cost, natural hazards as well as crisis on financial market will be the threats...|$|E
40|$|Forests provide {{many and}} large benefits, {{including}} cost-efficient climate change mitigation. However international carbon markets have not stimulated {{the demand for}} forestry offsets. Domestic market-mechanisms are emerging in many countries and forests could be highly valued through these policies {{as most of the}} benefits produced by forests are enjoyed locally. Here, a choice experiment explores drivers of valuation and willingness to pay for forest carbon services in voluntary markets in Mexico by comparing the valuation of citizens from four regions to test geographical preference for projects (n = 645). Findings from multinomial-logit models show valuation of forest carbon services is transferable and citizens would pay more for offsets from projects closer to their homes. Proximate forests provide a range of co-benefits to local users, including environmental services and opportunities for recreation. Factors related to valuation include sense of responsibility, previous knowledge of carbon emissions, previous visits to the sites, regional identification and the valuation of <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> (e. g. improvements in local air quality). Knowledge of spatial heterogeneity in valuation of the use of forest services can help to design market-based instruments by identifying highly valued areas for environmental services programs and carbon markets...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{resource}} management research has to evolve from {{a focus on}} plans, maps, and regulations to an acknowledgment of the complex, sometimes chaotic, reality in the field, {{with a large number}} of actors making their own decisions. As outside actors, we can only try to facilitate and support a process of negotiation among the stakeholders. Such negotiation involves understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders, analyzing complementarities in views, identifying where differences may be settled by "science," where science and social action can bring innovative alternatives for reconciliation, and where compromises will be necessary to move ahead. We distinguish between natural {{resource management}} problems at village level, within country, or transboundary, and those that relate local stakeholder decisions to global issues such as biodiversity conservation. Tree-based systems at plot or landscape level can minimize conflicts between private and public interests in <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>services,</b> but spatial segregation of functions is an imperative for the core of global biodiversity values. The complex agroforests developed by farmers as alternatives to food-crop-based agriculture integrate local and global environmental functions, but intensification and specialization may diminish these non-local values. For local biodiversity functions, a medium-intensity "integrate" option such as agroforests may be superior in terms of resilience and risk management. Major options exist for increasing carbon stocks by expanding tree-based production systems on grasslands and in degraded watersheds through a coherent approach to the market, policy, and institutional bottlenecks to application of existing rehabilitation technologies. Agroforestry mosaics may be an acceptable replacement of forests in upper watersheds, provided they evolve into multistrata systems with a protective litter layer. Challenges to INRM research remain: how should the opportunities for adaptive response among diverse interest groups, at a number of hierarchical levels, be included in the assessment of impacts on the livelihoods of rural people...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Forest {{and land}} use change {{contribute}} 18 % of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming. The Conference of Parties (COP) 16 in Mexico increased political commitment to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation and to enhance carbon stock (REDD+). We believe this support will continue at COP 18 in Doha, Qatar. However, various actors including local communities {{may or may not}} support REDD+ depending on, among others, their perceived impacts. To explore this situation, we have developed a systems dynamics model This model comprises sectors of landscape, population, <b>local</b> livelihoods, <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> and government incomes. The model simulates landscape and carbon dynamics and their impacts. We compare “business as usual ” with various REDD+ scenarios. The simulation results are examined by criteria of effectiveness in carbon emission reduction, cost efficiency, equity among involved stakeholders and co-benefit of other activities. This study took Jambi Province of Indonesia as a case study.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{issues of}} social or <b>environmental</b> justice in <b>local</b> urban <b>environmental</b> <b>services,</b> through the particular lens of street cleaning services. While UK policy gives some legitimacy {{to the idea}} that services should be enhanced in disadavantaged areas, it is unclear how much service and resource discrimination are necessary or appropriate. In practice, this equity perspective may not have much impact at local level. An empirical analysis is presented by drawing on a number of large-scale secondary data sources for England, combining individual and area-based data and subjective and objective inspection-based data. These enable us to draw fairly clear conclusions about the pattern of risk and need based on outcomes and their associations with key socioeconomic, demographic, locational, and urban form characteristics of places. It appears that injustice persists in the quality of local environments across urban England. Some evidence on the impact of local spending levels on environmental outcomes is adduced, but the available data limit this within national studies.

The studies provide examples where trade works to accelerate the use of natural resources and to exacerbate unsustainable dependencies by the poor, and other examples where trade has the opposite effect. An important conclusion is that local livelihood and technology choices have important consequences for how environmental resources are used and should be taken into account when designing policies to safeguard fragile ecologies.

During the winter of 2002 there was, successively, heavy rain, air pollution, cold weather and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic in Santiago. Aim: To study the influence of environmental factors and RSV epidemic on pediatric health care demand. Patients and methods: The number of hospital admissions and outpatient consultations for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) from April to October 2002 (Autumn to Spring in Chile), were registered in a public pediatric hospital of Santiago. A respiratory virus surveillance (RSV, adenovirus influenza and parainfluenza virus) was carried out among children admitted for ALRI. Climate conditions and air pollution (number of particles of more than 10 microns/mm 3) values were provided by <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> health <b>services.</b> Results: As expected, a rise in winter hospital admissions and outpatient consultations was detected, that peaked in week 29. This rise coincided with the higher RSV detection week. There was heavy rain in weeks 22, 23 and 30, as well as cold weather in June-July (weeks 23, 24, 26, 27 and 30; mid Winter), that did not increase health care demand.

40|$|Governments {{often use}} fiscal, {{exchange}} rate, monetary policy {{as well as}} export promotion tax increases, privatization, and land reform as part of comprehensive adjustments packages for addressing economic imbalances, balance of payments, and structural weaknesses. Such approaches, however, have come under heavy criticism for failing to recognize the social and environmental costs associated with them. Critics have argued that economic growth, trade liberalization, and increased primary product exports increase pressure on many sectors, including the agricultural and forestry land use sectors. This paper examines {{a number of these}} types of external shocks. This paper makes two arguments. First, from a theoretical economic perspective, although in many cases structural adjustment programs can be expected to affect the domestic forest sector, in other cases they will not. Second, even when there is an impact on the forest, it need not be detrimental to environmental and ecosystem values.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of government environmental performance at the local level. Chinese township governments, the lowest level in the hierarchical government structure, were selected for this exercise. The performance indicators used in the analyses include the efforts of enforcing government environmental regulations and of providing <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> to polluting enterprises. The performance determinants identified include environmental performance of upper-level governments, local development status, industrial employment, income of workers in polluting enterprises, <b>local</b> <b>environmental</b> quality, and public pressure for environmental quality improvement. A survey of 85 townships and interviews of 151 township government leaders were conducted in three provinces of China. The statistical results show that: a) The environmental performance of upper-level governments in China strongly and positively influences the environmental efforts of the township governments. b) Public pressure has created incentives for the township governments to improve their efforts in both enforcing environmental regulations and providing <b>environmental</b> <b>services,</b> while the <b>environmental</b> quality did not show significant impacts. c) Higher employment in industries tends to have a negative influence on the regulatory enforcement, but {{a positive influence on}} <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> provision. d) A higher enforcement effort and a lower service provision are associated with higher wages the workers received from industries. This implies that the industries offering higher wages to the workers are subject to more stringent environmental enforcement but receive less <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> 5) Richer townships tend to have less regulatory enforcement but better <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Decentralization,National Governance,Environmental Economics&Policies,Municipal Financial Management,Environmental Economics&Policies,National Governance,Environmental Governance,Banks&Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management...|$|R

Physical accessibility of natural resources, on the other hand, has generally been {{regarded as one of}} the most important drivers of land-use and land-cover changes. Based on two case studies, this article discusses evidence of the impact of access to services and access to natural resources on household poverty and on the environment. We show that socio-cultural distances are a key limiting factor for gaining access to services, and thereby for improved household welfare. We also discuss the impact of socio-cultural distances on access to natural resources, and show that large-scale commercial exploitation of natural resources tends to occur beyond the spatial reach of socio-culturally and economically marginalised population segments. We conclude that it is essential to pay more attention to improving the structural environment that presently leaves social minority groups marginalised.

40|$|Abstract: Naturalization is a {{relatively}} new management strategy for green areas within urban environments. It presents a great opportunity for urban centers to integrate native species into the landscape. A successful naturalization strategy can significantly reduce city management costs, promote preservation of <b>local</b> species, restore <b>environmental</b> <b>services</b> and encourage more members of these communities to embrace naturalization as a desirable strategy to follow. The information on naturalization that is available for decision makers is very limited; usually based on previous experiences of urban planners. The most common approach to urban naturalization is to establish species native to the region. Native species have specific adaptations to thrive and survive in their natural habitat. By limiting human intervention and reintroducing native species, an area is eventually naturalized, meaning no further management of the area is needed for it to become an assemblage of the naturally occurring landscape. Soils are expected to have a significant role in successful establishment. The experimental approach undertaken in this research was to stop mowing and to plant with native species. The current study is assessing how successfully woody native plant species established in an urban setting using naturalization as a management approach. Soil treatments included soil tillage and no tillage combined with compost and topsoil amendments. Plant species were four shrubs and four trees...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Payment for <b>Environmental</b> <b>Service</b> (PES) is an {{environmental}} regulatory concept {{that as a}} voluntary transaction where a well-defined <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> is being “bought” {{by at least one}} <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> buyer from at least one <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> provider, if and only if the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> buyer secures the <b>environmental</b> <b>service</b> as a conditionality. There is increasing interest and experience in PES in both developed and developing countries. In Asia, PES concept is manifested in forest and/or water resources management policy, such as in China, Japan. In the present state of the world, PES has come to the fore in step with concerns to save the environment in a holistic manner. Now, PES has become a way or a mechanism of stakeholders to maintain and manage the environment by providing economic incentives/compensation from users to providers of <b>environmental</b> <b>services.</b> In Aceh, this mechanism is implemented for protecting river stream area, such as in Krueng Montala, Great Aceh. PES mechanisms should be supported with force of law, also synergized with policies and projects related to integrated water resources management, rural development and rural livelihoods, and land use zoning.
