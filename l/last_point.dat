5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he {{called for an end to}} slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this <b>last</b> <b>point,</b> Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the battle}} was {{received}} in England shortly after news {{of the fall of}} Louisbourg, putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory. The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E
50|$|Convolution {{coefficients}} for the missing first and <b>last</b> <b>points</b> can also be easily obtained. This is also equivalent to fitting the first (m+1)/2 points with the same polynomial, and similarly for the <b>last</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} {{to deal with}} the bill was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would benefit {{of the people of the}} Potteries, that a differential rating system for a fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide a course of action should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This <b>last</b> <b>point</b> was important because without it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|The {{afternoon}} draw {{consisted of}} skins play. Allison Pottinger and Margaretha Sigfridsson {{played in the}} women's skins game. Pottinger held an early lead after four straight skins, but Sigfridsson capitalized on missed shots from Pottinger to win the last four skins and the game. Heath McCormick and Niklas Edin played in the men's skins game, where a series of carryovers saw Edin winning the last skin, worth {{three and a half}} points, and the game. A mixed team of John Morris, Beth Iskiw, Ben Hebert, and Jessica Mair played Tom Brewster, Anna Sloan, Scott Andrews, and Claire Hamilton in the mixed skins game. Morris, who skipped against Brewster, held control over the game and limited Brewster in scoring. Brewster won the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> on a draw to the button, giving Team World an 8–7 edge {{in the first round of}} skins play.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was {{exacerbated}} by {{a shortage of}} coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this <b>last</b> <b>point</b> {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.|$|E

Blanda would score his <b>last</b> <b>points</b> against Philadelphia in his career 22 years and 1 day later on October 17, 1971. Also a placekicker, Blanda {{had one of the}} longest pro {{football}} careers, a total of 26 years.|$|R

Nobel prize winners Wole Soyinka of Nigeria and Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, both attacked Khomeini, and both received death threats as a result, with Mahfouz later getting stabbed in the neck by a Muslim fundamentalist.|$|E
25|$|At {{a meeting}} on 23 May 2009 a {{breakthrough}} was reached; a transitional government and a {{truth and reconciliation commission}} was agreed to be formed, and all former presidents would be allowed to stand in the presidential elections; this <b>last</b> <b>point</b> was seen as controversial, as it might increase instability. However, on 25 May 2009 the party of Didier Ratsiraka withdrew from the talks.|$|E
25|$|A piecewise/composite Bézier {{curve is}} a series of Bézier curves joined with at least C0 {{continuity}} (the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve). Depending on the application, additional smoothness requirements (such as C1 or C2 continuity) may be added. C1 continuous curves have identical tangents at the breakpoint (where the two curves meet). C2 continuous curves have identical curvature at the breakpoint.|$|E

25|$|This <b>last</b> <b>point</b> is very {{difficult}} to prove. Before the Ediacaran, the biostratigraphic markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore {{there is no way to}} prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.|$|E
25|$|Tréhouart {{then used}} the full {{power of the}} {{recently}} passed Law of Suspects. The law ordered arrested not only anyone culprit of disloyalty, but also {{those who had not}} constantly displayed their attachment to the Republic, and even those who had emigrated between 1 July 1789 and 8 April 1792, even if returned to France within delays fixed by law; this <b>last</b> <b>point</b> effectively entrapped many Navy officers of the former French Royal Navy. In consequence, a large number of sailors and officers were arrested.|$|E
25|$|In the 2012 Leinster Senior Hurling Championship Final Kilkenny was {{defeated}} by Galway. Kilkenny bounced back beating Limerick and winning over Tipperary by double scores 4-24 to 1-15. Kilkenny then met Galway in the All Ireland Final, and when Joe Canning scored the <b>last</b> <b>point</b> of the game, he forced a replay (the first since 1959). However Kilkenny showed great character during the replayed All Ireland Final and won on a scoreline of 3-22 to 3-11, their ninth success in thirteen championship seasons.|$|E

This will be the route to Xena's 64 I/O lines, which are dynamically configurable as input, output, or bidirectional. 'Xorro' will allow bridging Xena to external hardware for control purposes, to internal systems, or to other XCore processors. This <b>last</b> <b>point</b> is worth more exploration; XCore is a parallel processing architecture; more XCores can be chained together if more computing power is required.. Reference boards have been made with up to 256 cores, offering a theoretical 102400 MIPS.|$|E
25|$|Before {{winning the}} {{presidency}} in 2002, Lula had been a strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts. In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This <b>last</b> <b>point</b> had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing political consultant Duda Mendonça's advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula became president after winning {{the second round of}} the 2002 election, held on 27 October, defeating the PSDB candidate José Serra.|$|E
25|$|On this <b>last</b> <b>point,</b> Grayling's view is {{that for}} {{historical}} reasons religions have an inflated place {{in the public domain}} out of all proportion to the numbers of their adherents or their intrinsic merits, so that their voice and influence is amplified disproportionately: with the result that they can distort such matters as public policy (e.g. on abortion) and science research and education (e.g. stem cells, teaching of evolution). He argues that winning the metaphysical and ethical debates is already abating the problems associated with (c) in more advanced Western societies, even the US. He sees his own major contribution as being the promotion of understanding of humanist ethics deriving from the philosophical tradition.|$|E
