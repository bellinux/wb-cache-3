40|$|Flutter {{analysis}} of airfoils in transonic flow has traditionally assumed linearity of the aerodynamic <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>moment</b> with motion amplitude. However, the non-linear {{nature of the}} mixed flow, incorporating large amplitude shock wave motion, may significantly invalidate the lipearity assumption. In this thesis, the effect of nonlinear transonic aerodynamics on the flutter analysis is analyzed utilising a simplified linear structural model. The aerodynamic con di ti ons under which these effeds are significant are determined for specific cases using the NA CA 64 AOI 0 airfoil. In order to accurately determine the aerodynamic <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>moment.,</b> an un-steady fuU poten ti al code was developed. This code was joined to an algorithm which integrates the structural equations of motion in time. A flutter analysis {{based on the assumption}} of linear aerodynamics was carried out to determine the neutral stability conditions defined by a set of structural and aerodynamic param-eters. These neutral stability conditions we re then used in the structural equations of motion with nonlinear aerodynamic <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>moment.</b> These equations were then integrated in time to determine the response of the system. If the time re-sponse was not neutrally stabie, then the structural parameter, Jl, the airfoil-to-air mass ratio was varied until the time response was neutrally stable. If the difference in the yalue of the "nonlinear " Jl to "linear " Jl was greater than 10 percent, then that case was considered to exhibit significant nonlinearities...|$|R
