Five times larger than the average federal building in cities of a population of 5,000, the building originally housed 11 governmental departments, services and bureaus. The post office occupied the entire L-shaped first floor, with service and <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> <b>lobbies</b> spanning the length of each wing.

50|$|In many {{post offices}} in the U.S., the PO <b>box</b> <b>lobby</b> is {{separate}} from the window-service lobby, so that the former may be kept open around the clock while the latter is locked after business hours. However, in the U.S. since the 1980s, in cities and large urban areas, post offices have tended to close <b>box</b> <b>lobbies</b> overnight because of the tendency of homeless people to use them for sleeping quarters. As a result, some <b>box</b> <b>lobbies</b> are accessible after-hours by customers who are provided a code to a door keypad. In addition, some post offices are located in rented facilities such as shopping malls. As a result, PO boxes can only be accessed while that facility is open.|$|R

In this study, the <b>Lock</b> <b>Box</b> performance of 25 children with Down syndrome was compared with that of 43 typically developing children, matched for mental age (24 - 36 months). Children in both groups showed similar levels of competence, planfulness and distractibility. However, children with Down syndrome displayed more task-avoidant behavior.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe premise of numerous proposals for improving cash management {{is that the}} Federal Government can save millions of dollars each year. Increasing attention is being given to cash management by the President, Congress, the Department of the Treasury and the federal agencies in the United States. A <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> system is one such cash management technique that provides a substantial savings through the reduction of float time. The Navy's Cash Management Action Plan stresses {{the use of this}} collection mechanism to increase the efficiency of its existing collection systems. This study provides a <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> model {{that can be used in}} the evaluation of potential <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> applications. Using the Navy Regional Accounting and Finance Center, Washington, D. C., as a comparative example, the results of the analysis show that the establishment of a <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> in Atlanta, would provide an estimated savings of over $ 260, 000 to the Federal Government.

40|$|Many firms use <b>lock</b> <b>boxes</b> {{serviced}} by local depository banks {{in an attempt}} to reduce collection float. Likewise, an increasing number of large firms use controlled disbursing to pay their bills, in order to increase and control their disbursement float. Almost all the literature treats the <b>lock</b> <b>box</b> location problem and the disbursement bank location problem separately. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine simultaneously the optimal collection strategies of sellers and the optimal payment strategies of buyers. Our analysis involves multiple periods where the decisions of each party take into consideration the potential strategies of the other. That is, the collection-payment problem is analyzed both as a two-party and a multiple-party game. The rationale for casting the problem in a game theoretic framework is quite simple: When a seller selects <b>lock</b> <b>boxes</b> and depository banks he takes into consideration the fact that his buyers may use controlled disbursing banks. Likewise, when buyers select disbursing banks or branches they realize that the seller may shift the location of the designated <b>lock</b> <b>boxes</b> in response. Obviously, our analysis is relevant primarily for firms that manage large amounts of payments and collections and use sophisticated cash management techniques. cash management, collection float, controlled disbursing, disbursement float, <b>lock</b> <b>boxes,</b> subgame perfect equilibrium...|$|R

Unlike the completely impregnable <b>locked</b> <b>box,</b> this functionality may be achievable in real life, where containers having this property are called "tamper-evident seals". Another physical object with this property is the "scratch-off card", often used in lottery tickets. We show that scratch-off cards {{can be used to}} implement bitcommitment and coin flipping, but not oblivious transfer. Of particular interest, we give a strongly-fair coin flipping protocol with bias bounded by O(1 /r) (where r is the number of rounds), beating the best known bias in the standard model even with cryptographic assumptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the capacity for self-regulation represents a major achievement of childhood {{that is associated with}} social, behavioural and academic competence. Most research has focused on self-regulated academic learning in school-aged children and adolescents, neglecting developmental aspects of self-regulation. This paper reports a longitudinal study of 44 children from early to middle childhood. At age 2, the Goodman <b>Lock</b> <b>Box</b> provided information {{about the extent to which}} children’s approaches were systematic and planful, as opposed to random, impulsive and disorganised. The same measure was used in a modified form at age 8, and two additional measures of planning and self-control were added: the Porteus Maze Test and the Grocery Shopping Task. At both ages, <b>Lock</b> <b>Box</b> competence was related to planfulness, and there was a significant correlation of <b>Lock</b> <b>Box</b> competence across the two ages. However, the various measures of self-regulation were unrelated. Several measurement issues are highlighted, in particular the difficulties associated with making assumptions about the intent and meaning of children’s task behaviours...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we attempt}} to {{formally}} study two very intuitive physical models: sealed envelopes and <b>locked</b> <b>boxes,</b> often used as illustrations for common cryptographic operations. We relax the security properties usually required from <b>locked</b> <b>boxes</b> [such as in bit-commitment (BC) protocols] and require only that a broken lock or torn envelope be identifiable to the original sender. Unlike the completely impregnable <b>locked</b> <b>box,</b> this functionality may be achievable in real life, where containers having this property are called “tamper-evident seals”.  Another physical object with this property is the “scratch-off card”, often used in lottery tickets. We consider three variations of tamper-evident seals, and show that under some conditions {{they can be used}} to implement oblivious transfer, BC and coin flipping (CF). We also show a separation between the three models. One of our results is a strongly fair CF protocol with bias bounded by O(1 /r) (where r is the number of rounds); this was a stepping stone towards achieving such a protocol in the standard model (in subsequent work) ...|$|R
