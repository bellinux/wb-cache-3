40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a battery manufacturing plant where lead was used in the processes of production, to survey the working conditions and safety behaviors, and to measure the airborne <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> contaminated in the workplace and the blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of workers. The survey of working conditions showed that the workers were directly exposed to lead in sections e. g. grid casting, spreading, forming and polishing, assembly and special battery production sections. Some workers in these sections used a cotton mask to protect dust exposure, but most workers did not use any masks. High airborne <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> more than 0. 2 mg/m 3 was frequently measured in these sections. Geometric average of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> slightly increased from 17. 9 µg/dl to 22. 3 µg/dl during 1998 and 2001. However, the geometric average of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> dropped to 17. 4 µg/dl in 2002. No workers had blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> above 60 µg/dl. Workers with different age groups had no significantly different average blood <b>lead</b> <b>level.</b> Workers whose duration of work was between 20 – 29 years had average blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of 21. 5 µg/dl. This group of workers had slightly higher blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> than those whose duration of work was 19 years or less, but with no significant difference. 21 subjects underwent annual health examination and exposure monitoring in 2002. There was no significant relation between airborne <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and blood <b>lead</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{extensive}} use of Lead has led to health problems including CNS, anemia and other occupational poisoning among workers. To determine the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in relation to demographic factors, this study was carried out. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 490 workers at Kooshk Lead and Zinc mine were selected and blood samples were taken. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed according to the NIOSH standard using atomic absorption. Results: The mean, minimum and maximum of blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were 49, 9 and 116 mg/dl, respectively. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in 45. 7 percent of workers was more than permissible limit. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> was not significantly related to age and history of work. The lowest and highest <b>levels</b> of blood <b>lead</b> were 9 & 116 mg/dl, respectively. In contrast, significant relationship was seen between the location of work and blood <b>lead</b> <b>level.</b> The results showed that {{in the majority of}} workers with blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> higher than standard limit, there was a significant relationship between the blood <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> and the hemoglobin concentration. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in 45 % of samples was more than Iranian standards. Conclusion: The work location was the main factor affecting the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> Attention should therefore be focused on the alteration of RBC and Hemoglobin levels during periodic medical examination of worker...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cerebral palsy is {{a common}} motor {{disability}} in childhood. Raised <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> affect cognition. Children with cerebral palsy may have raised <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> further impairing their residual cognitive motor and behavioral abilities. Environmental exposure and abnormal eating habits may lead to increased <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> Aims and Objectives: To measure blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in children with cerebral palsy and compare them with healthy neurologically normal children. To correlate blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> with environmental factors. Material and Methods: Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Participants: Cases comprised 34 children with cerebral palsy, and controls comprised 34 neurologically normal, age- and sex-matched children. Methods: Clinical and demographic details were recorded as per proforma. Detailed environmental history was recorded to know the source of exposure to lead. These children were investigated and treated as per protocol. Venous blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vials for analysis of blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> were estimated by Schimadzu Flame AA- 6800 (atomic absorption spectrophotometer). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. P <. 05 was taken as significant. Results: Mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were 9. 20 ± 8. 31 µg/dL in cerebral palsy cases and 2. 89 ± 3. 04 µg/dL in their controls (P <. 001). Among children with cerebral palsy, 19 (55. 88 %) children had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 5 µg/dL. <b>Lead</b> <b>levels</b> in children with pica were 12. 33 ± 10. 02 µg/dL in comparison to children with no history of pica, 6. 70 ± 4. 60 µg/dL (P =. 029).

40|$|Abstract Background Anemia is {{a health}} problem among infants and children. It is often {{associated}} with a decrease in some trace elements (iron, zinc, copper) and an increase in heavy metals as lead. This study was done to determine the association of blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> > 10 μg/dl, with the increased risk to anemia, also, to investigate the relationship between anemia and changes in blood iron, zinc and copper <b>levels,</b> and measure <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in drinking water. The study is a cross-sectional performed on 60 children. Venous blood samples were taken from the studied population for estimating hematological parameters as well as iron and ferritin levels. The concentrations of zinc, copper, and lead were measured. The studied population was divided into anemic and non-anemic (control) groups. The anemic group was further classified into mild, moderate and severe anemia. The study subjects were also categorized into low and high blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> groups. Findings Approximately 63. 33 % of children had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 10 μg/dl. At the blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> range of 10 - 20 μg/dl, a significant association was found for mild and severe anemia. The blood level of iron and ferritin was found to be significantly lower in high blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and anemic groups than those of the low blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and control groups. <b>Lead</b> <b>level</b> in drinking water was higher than the permissible limit.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a cross-sectional epidemiologic study {{to assess the}} association between blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and hematocrit in 579 one to five year-old children living near a primary lead smelter in 1974. Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 0. 53 to 7. 91 mumol/L (11 to 164 micrograms/dl). To predict hematocrit {{as a function of}} blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> and age, we derived non-linear regression models and fit percentile curves. We used logistic regression to predict the probability of hematocrit values less than 35 per cent.

This relationship was influenced by age, but (in this age group) not by sex; the effect was strongest in youngest children. In one year-olds, the age group most severely affected, the risk of an hematocrit value below 35 percent was 2 percent above background at blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> between 0. 97 and 1. 88 mumol/L (20 and 39 micrograms/dl), 18 percent above background at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of 1. 93 to 2. 85 mumol/L (40 to 59 micrograms/dl), and 40 percent above background at <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of 2. 9 mumol/L (60 micrograms/dl) and greater; background was defined as a blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> below 1. 88 mumol/L (20 micrograms/dl).

PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of children aged 24 to 36 months, born and still resident in Vancouver. The sample was stratified proportionally by the median annual family income in the census tract where each family resided. OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and risk factors for elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> determined from a questionnaire administered to parents. RESULTS: Of {{the children in the}} sample, 42 % (178 / 422) were ineligible or could not be located. Of the remaining children, 73 % (177 / 244) participated and adequate blood specimens were obtained from 172. The mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> was 0. 29 mumol/L (standard deviation 0. 13 mumol/L). (A blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of 1 mumol/L is equivalent to 20. 7 micrograms/dL.)

In 1989 - 1990 we reexamined 79 of these children for measurement of weight, height, and bone <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> by means of in vivo K X-ray fluorescence. To avoid potential confounding by race and chelation history, analysis was restricted to white subjects without a history of lead chelation therapy. A total of 236 subjects provided complete information {{for the study of}} cross-sectional relationship between dentin <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and changes in physical growth: 58 subjects for the study of longitudinal relationship between dentin <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and changes in physical growth and 54 subjects for the study of longitudinal relationship between bone <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and changes in physical growth. Dentin <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> averaged 14. 9 micrograms/g; tibia and patella <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> averaged 1. 2 and 5. 0 micrograms/g, respectively. With control for potential confounders including age, sex, baseline body size, and mother's socioeconomic status, log 10 dentin <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> was positively associated with body mass index as of 1975 - 1978 (beta = 1. 02, p = 0. 03) and increase in body mass index between 1975 - 78 and 1989 - 90 (beta = 2. 65, p = 0. 03). Bone <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were not significantly associated with physical growth. This is the first study relating chronic lead exposure to body mass index. The results suggest that chronic lead exposure in childhood may result in obesity that persists into adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of succimer chelation in reducing blood and brain <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> the relative efficacy of the drug in the two tissues is less well understood. This issue is important because blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> after chelation are used clinically to estimate reductions in the brain, the most critical organ in considering lead-induced neurotoxicity. The present {{study was designed to}} further investigate this issue, using multiple chelation regimens. Long-Evans rats were exposed to one of three lead exposure regimens from birth until postnatal day 40, followed by treatment with succimer (one or two 3 -week regimens) or vehicle. The results indicated that one succimer regimen was significantly superior to vehicle treatment in lowering <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in both blood and brain across the entire 8 -week follow-up period. Similarly, a second succimer regimen offered significant additional benefit relative to one regimen for both blood and brain across the 4 -week follow-up period. However, several findings revealed that succimer-induced reductions in brain lead lagged behind reductions in blood lead and were generally smaller in magnitude. Furthermore, a rebound was detected in blood, but not brain, <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> after both succimer regimens. Given the results of this study, we urge caution in using blood lead as a surrogate for brain <b>lead</b> <b>levels,</b> particularly during and immediately after chelation treatment when reductions in blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> overestimate reductions in brain <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> The present results suggest that, in clinical use, succimer treatment may need to extend beyond the point at which blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> have dropped to an "acceptable" target value in order to effectively reduce brain <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and minimize neurotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> and identify related risk factors among preschool {{children in a}} lead polluted area (Taizhou, China) and provide theoretical support for prevention of lead pollution. Methods. A stratified-clustered-random sampling method was used to {{determine the}} survey sample. Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were determined by the tungsten atomizer absorption spectrophotometer. Results. A total of 2, 018 subjects (average age of 59 months; 1, 087 boys and 931 girls) were included. The arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and median blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of the preschool children were 56. 4 [*]μg/L, 48. 9 [*]μg/L, and 46 [*]μg/L. A total of 8. 8 % children had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> > 100 [*]μg/L and 43. 9 % had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> > 50 [*]μg/L. Mother’s education level, father’s occupation, decorative tableware, exposure to makeup, and the residential floor were all risk factors for elevated blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> (odds ratios of 1. 42, 1. 21, 1. 11, 1. 19, and 1. 27, resp.), while hand washing before eating food was a protective factor (odds ratio of 0. 88). Conclusions. The blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of preschool children in Taizhou were higher than in other areas in China and in developed countries.

40|$|Objective: To {{correlate}} blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> {{and clinical}} manifestations. Participants: Battery workers and painters (occupationally exposed to lead {{in and around}} Mangalore, India) and occupationally unexposed controls. Main outcome measures: We measured the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> by anodic stripping voltammetry, and a clinical examination was carried out on all participants. Results: There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between the lead-exposed group and controls with respect to clinical manifestations. The prominent findings among the lead-exposed group were fatigue, abdominal colic, abdominal discomfort, backache, muscular exhaustability, myalgia and paresthesia, at a blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> ranging from 0. 4 to 116. 6 mg/dL. Conclusions: Such a study on battery workers and painters has not been reported in India.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{cross-sectional}} study was to compare the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of apprentices working in lead-related industries with those of non-apprentice controls and to evaluate the influence of such occupational exposure. The study was conducted between October 2004 and June 2005 in Bursa, Turkey. Subjects included 231 apprentices and 252 male controls, age ranging from 14 – 19 yr old. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels.</b> The overall mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> was 3. 62 µg/dl (95 % CI 3. 39 – 3. 85), the apprentice mean was 4. 99 µg/dl (95 % CI 4. 60 – 5. 38), and the control group mean was 2. 37 µg/dl (95 % CI 2. 22 – 2. 51). The blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of apprentices {{was significantly higher than}} that of controls (p< 0. 05). Results show that occupational exposure increases the blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> of apprentices, although the impact on their immediate health is low.

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{investigate}} blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> in schoolchildren in {{two areas}} of Egypt {{to understand the}} current lead pollution exposure and its risk factors, aiming to improve prevention politicies. Subjects and method: This was a cross-sectional study in children (n = 400) aged 6 - 12 years recruited from two areas in Egypt (industrial and urban). Blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using an atomic absorption method. Detailed questionnaires on sources of lead exposure and history of school performance and any behavioral changes were obtained. Results: The mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> in the urban area of Egypt (Dokki) was 5. 45 ± 3. 90 µg/dL, while that in the industrial area (Helwan) was 10. 37 ± 7. 94 µg/dL, with {{a statistically significant difference}} between both areas (p < 0. 05). In Dokki, 20 % of the studied group had blood <b>lead</b> <b>levels</b> ≥ 10 µg/dL, versus 42 % of those in Helwan. A significant association was found between children with abnormal behavior and those with pallor with blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> ≥ 10 µg/dL, when compared with those with blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> < 10 µg/dL (p < 0. 05).

Information regarding reproductive characteristics and known risk factors for blood lead was obtained using a standard questionnaire by direct interview. The mean age of the population was 54. 7 years (SD = 9. 8), with a mean blood <b>lead</b> <b>level</b> of 9. 2 µg/dL (SD = 4. 7 /dL) and a range from 2. 1 to 32. 1 µg/dL.
