25|$|Since surfing {{was central}} to the first movie, the filmmakers wanted to include it again, but at a higher level. Core and his team <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> {{over the world to}} try to find out where waves were going to hit, and when, before finally {{settling}} on Teahupo'o in Tahiti. However, shooting the scene proved to be challenging since enormous, surfable waves are rare and unpredictable. A set of crew first went to Jaws, a surf break in Maui, months before principal photography began on the film. The team had to wait several days in Teahupo'o for the waves to swell. Luckily, enormous swells arrived. The crew ran nine cameras in the water, on cliffs and on helicopters to capture the action in January 2014. Laird Hamilton, a pioneering big-wave surfer, who also played a minor role in the film, contributed his skills to the shoot. Additionally, Ian Walsh, a surfer from Maui, Billy Kemper, Makua Rothman, and Ahani Tsondru, served as stunt doubles.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} {{was an instant}} classic. Australia made 428 in its first innings. Opening batsman Shane Watson scored a century and Wicket keeper Tim Paine made a 92 to lead the charge. In reply India's top order almost contributed equally with Sachin Tendulkar scoring 98 and Suresh Raina scoring 86. India made 405 in their first innings. Indian bowlers led a surge in the second Innings to rout Australia to 192. India were set a target of 216. Wickets started to fall in the evening of 4th day with Ben Hilfenhaus taking the key wickets of Gambhir, Sehwag and Raina. The score stood at 55/4 {{at the end of}} 4th day's Play with Tendulkar playing with night {{watchman}} Zaheer Khan. Australia started the 5th day well to remove Zaheer Khan first. VVS Laxman who played late down the order because of his back injury joined Tendulkar for the 6th wicket. They improved the scoring rate considerably. However Tendulkar was out for 38 trying to play an upper late cut off Bollinger. MS Dhoni then followed Tendulkar as he was run out following a confusion with Raina who was a by runner for VVS Laxman. The score stood at 122/7. Harbhajan too was out pretty quickly facing just 2 deliveries. It <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> but over for India. India were 124/8 with an injury-ridden VVS Laxman and Ishant sharma at the crease and only Pragyan Ojha to follow. India still needed 92 runs to win with just 2 wickets remaining at lunch. It looked like a lost cause to India.|$|E
500|$|After putting Bangladesh into bat, the Australians soon took early wickets. On a {{pitch that}} was quicker than the Test strip, Bangladesh <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> at sea against {{the pace of}} Lee and Gillespie. They soon crashed to 4/19 and never recovered, {{eventually}} bowled out for 105 in the 34th over. Only three batsmen managed double figures as the pace duo took seven wickets between them. Andy Bichel also chimed in with 2/24.|$|E

2500|$|Australian Rugby writer Philip Derriman records that, [...] "...the English {{broke into}} the open with the ball well inside Australia's half and <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> but certain to score until the player in possession, Rob Andrew, was brought down in a {{magnificent}} diving tackle by John Eales, coming across in cover defence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first quarter}} went by 0-0 {{what looked to}} become another {{defensive}} battle that these two teams have taken part in so many times during their long 10-year war, this soon changed as James Twomey ran for 60 yards for a fantastic rushing touchdown; however, it was called back over a flag, deja vu of last year's regular season game where Twomey was called back on a 70-yard rushing TD against the same opponents. The man to break the deadlock was the new Vikings special teams captain Sean Goldrick (last year's rookie of the year) after he broke tackles and sprinted 45 yards for a TD after Garvey connected with him. The Rebels got the ball back and wanted to level the scores before the half driving down the Vikings pitch bending the Viking d to their limit until the usual dominating Rebels veteran quarterback Dennehy threw a pass that was intercepted by a player who has also been dominating the IAFL for years and years, Vikings captain Liam Ryan, who {{over the years has}} developed the skills to become a take balls out of the air that he has no right to. This stopped the Rebels drive and <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> set for the Vikes to go into the half with an 8-0 lead, with 3 seconds left on the clock of the first half, Marc Ashworth pitched the ball to Adrian Garvey, who ran 61 yards. Garvey had excellent blocking but still had a lot to do, running straight through two Rebels defenders.|$|E

2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have <b>looked</b> <b>all</b> that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
