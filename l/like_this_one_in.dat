500|$|Feynman was not {{the only}} {{frustrated}} theoretical physicist in the early post-war years. Quantum electrodynamics suffered from infinite integrals in perturbation theory. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had unsuccessfully attempted to work around. [...] "Theoreticians", noted Murray Gell-Mann, [...] "were in disgrace." [...] In June 1947, leading American physicists met at the Shelter Island Conference. For Feynman, it was his [...] "first big conference with big men... I had never gone to one <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> peacetime." [...] The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of the Lamb shift, the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron, and Robert Marshak's two-meson hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, but I would say that I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom}} of the Cipressa. I made it across {{at the bottom of}} the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
