2500|$|Civil law is {{the legal}} system used in most {{countries}} around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially codifications in constitutions or statutes passed by government—and custom. Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the Babylonian Codex Hammurabi. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century Eastern Roman Empire whose texts were rediscovered by late medieval Western Europe. Roman law {{in the days of the}} Roman Republic and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class. Instead a <b>lay</b> <b>magistrate,</b> iudex, was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised. Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before. This became known as the Corpus Juris Civilis. As one legal historian wrote, [...] "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before." [...] The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the Theodosian Code and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the University of Bologna used it to interpret their own laws. Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from religious laws such as canon law, continued to spread throughout Europe until the Enlightenment; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the Code Civil, and Germany, with the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the Japanese and Korean legal traditions. Today, countries that have civil law systems range from Russia and China to most of Central and Latin America. With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.|$|E

50|$|The {{position}} {{continued as}} before in Northern Ireland until 1935, when the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) was passed.

Petty Sessions (which later became known as Magistrates' Courts) would henceforth consist solely of a resident magistrate sitting alone. Since the passing of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, two <b>lay</b> <b>magistrates</b> sit with the district judge in Youth Court (criminal proceedings involving children) and Family Proceedings Court (family law) matters, but the judge still sits alone in other matters.

His tenure was marked by conflict with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council over the issue of capital punishment; of the twenty death sentences he handed down in his latter years, the Privy Council granted a stay of execution in all cases which were appealed. An article in a London newspaper poked fun at Brown's style of setting up loudspeakers in the courtroom and delivering [...] "fire and brimstone" [...] judgments which he claimed were divinely inspired; the article was banned from republication in Belize. Towards the end of his tenure as CJ, his health also began to deteriorate, and he suffered from epileptic seizures. He submitted his resignation in November 1997. In early 1998, he was succeeded by George Singh. After his retirement, he worked privately as a consultant with the law firm of Lionel Welch, and also served as an acting Justice of the Supreme Court from 7 April 1999 alongside Wilfred Elrington.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the reason for the}} passage of the 1922 Infanticide Act, arguing that it owes much to the influence and work of women’s policy networks. Historians have disagreed as to why the Act was passed with relative suddenness in the early 1920 s, at a time when infanticide was generally considered a much less pressing social issue {{than it had been in}} Victorian England. Moreover, several Bills brought between 1908 and 1913 proposing that the law on this subject be amended so that women who killed their newborns no longer faced the death penalty had all failed. Importantly, the roles of juror and <b>lay</b> <b>magistrate</b> had become open to women in 1920, following the passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. The public interest generated by a case of newborn murder tried at the Leicester Assizes in 1921 (particularly amongst women’s organizations, including the suffragette group the Women’s Freedom League) led several leading women with political connections to push for a change in the law. Without the pressure these women could bring to bear on civil servants and politicians, attempts to bring in new legislation on infanticide would have been postponed well into the twentieth century...|$|E
40|$|English {{criminal}} procedure was for centuries organised {{on the principle}} that a person accused of a serious crime should not be represented by counsel at trial. When the surviving sources first allow us to see something of how criminal trials in cases of treason and felony were conducted, we see the judges insistently enforcing the prohibition on defence counsel. Into the eighteenth century, the leading treatise on {{criminal procedure}}, Serjeant William Hawkins 2 ̆ 7 Pleas of the Crown, endorsed the rule against defence counsel. Since any defendant 2 ̆ 2 of Common Understanding may as properly [defend himself] {{as if he were the}} best Lawyer 2 ̆ 2, Hawkins explained in 1721, 2 ̆ 2 it requires no manner of Skill to make a plain and honest Defence [...] 2 ̆ 2 The notion that criminal defence was a suitable do-it-yourself activity arose at a time when the whole of the criminal trial was expected to transpire as a lawyer-free contest of amateurs. The prosecution was also unrepresented. The victim of the crime usually served as the prosecutor, aided by other witnesses and sometimes by the lay constable. A <b>lay</b> <b>magistrate,</b> the justice of the peace, organised the prosecution witnesses for trial at a pretrial committal proceeding. Sir Thomas Smith 2 ̆ 7 s celebrated tract, which depicts a trial for robbery conducted in a county assize court in the middle of the sixteenth century, epitomises the criminal trial as an 2 ̆ 2 altercation 2 ̆ 2 between citizen accuser and citizen accused...|$|E
