5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to be burned <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was cast}} as Blue's voice because, of the show's crew, {{she was able}} to sound the most <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> Nick Balaban, who wrote the music for the show along with Michael Rubin, was cast as the voice of Mr. Salt. Balaban {{initially}} used a Brooklyn accent for Mr. Salt before settling on a French accent. Rubin also provided the voice of Mailbox.|$|E
5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know {{him as a man}} that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Stradlin {{recorded}} his sixth album, <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dog,</b> with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria. It was originally {{scheduled for a}} late 2003 release, with just under one thousand promo copies made. However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin—prompted by a fan petition—made it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released Ride On, River, On Down the Road, and <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dog</b> through iTunes.|$|E
25|$|The name arose {{when his}} brother , with voice still unbroken, made queer-sounding appeals for l.b.w. The humorist, Springbok Atholl McKinnon, said they sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> barking, {{and called him}} Pooch. When Graeme joined the provincial eleven they became Big Dog and Little Dog.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970 novel The Chinese Agent {{by author}} Michael Moorcock, a world-renowned jewel-thief more than meets his match when he {{attempts}} to swipe a brooch from a Portobello Road market stall, and is hunted down through the streets <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> by the sharp-eyed market traders.|$|E

25|$|PWDs have a single-layered {{coat that}} does not shed (see Moult), and {{therefore}} their presence is tolerated well among many {{people who suffer from}} dog allergies. Some call PWDs hypoallergenic dogs, but any person with dog allergies who would <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> with these qualities should actually spend time with the animals before purchasing, to test whether the dog is truly non-allergenic to them.|$|E
25|$|African wolves {{frequently}} groom one another, {{particularly during}} courtship, during {{which it can}} last up to ½ hour. Nibbling of the face and neck is observed during greeting ceremonies. When fighting, the African wolf slams its opponents with its hips, and bites and shakes the shoulder. The species' postures are typically canine, and it has more facial mobility than the black-backed and side-striped jackals, being able to expose its canine teeth <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thus, in the 1940s, the Inuit {{were given}} disc numbers, {{recorded}} {{on a special}} leather ID tag, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> tag. They were required to keep the tag with them always. (Some tags are now so old and worn that the number is polished out.) The numbers were assigned with a letter prefix that indicated location (E = east), community, and then {{the order in which}} the census-taker saw the individual. In some ways this state renaming was abetted by the churches and missionaries, who viewed the traditional names and their calls to power as related to shamanism and paganism.|$|E
25|$|The warning bark of a fox sounds much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's,</b> but {{generally}} the vocalisation of foxes is higher and more drawn out than barks of other canids.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that 'QC over-identifies with an 'exotic' militant punk persona to interrogate category-driven capitalist networks, through staging and virally inserting her artistic practice within pop culture, traversing music venues, forging protests and entering art galleries in order to emulate and interrupt the operations of these cultural zones'. Quilla Constance stages interventions across an interdisciplinary practice of paintings, lectures, photographs, live performances, costumes and music videos. Her live performance work has been noted for its 'unflinching physical narrative performed entirely through breath, posture and non-verbal sounds: panting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> sex noises, then laughter, pure guttural anger, and back again'.|$|E
25|$|The peasants {{are fairly}} well off, as {{the soil is}} rich, the {{abundant}} water-supply free, and the taxation comparatively light. It was always interesting to meet them taking their live stock into market. Flocks of sheep with tiny lambs, black and white, pattered along the dusty road; here a goat followed its master <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog,</b> trotting behind the diminutive ass which the farmer bestrode; or boys, clad in the whity-brown native cloth, shouted incessantly at donkeys almost invisible under enormous loads of forage, or carried fowls and ducks in bunches head downwards, a sight that always made me long {{to come to the}} rescue of the luckless birds.|$|E
25|$|On August 29, 1907, John P. Poe Jr., a {{man known}} for being a {{successful}} football player, miner and dedicated soldier, travelled on board the San Juan from Nicaragua to San Francisco. He had previously been arrested in Nicaragua when attempting to volunteer for an upcoming war. In November 1909, the San Juan carried 1,673 tons of cargo and valuable treasure from the Charles Butters Mine in El Salvador. A fireman from the steamer Peru, Robert Latewitz, was also onboard the San Juan, having been removed from his ship due to insanity. Latewitz {{was reported to have}} acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> and walked on all fours across the San Juan's deck.|$|E
60|$|Robert's {{face was}} a study at that moment. His cheeks filled and {{collapsed}} again <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's</b> when it has been rebuked. His colour deepened, and he rattled some money in a trouser pocket.|$|R
60|$|He had halted {{opposite}} a garden, {{and taken}} hold of Shelton by a button of his coat. His eyes, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog's,</b> stared wistfully. It {{seemed as though}} he wished to speak, but feared to give offence.|$|R

25|$|As {{the number}} of prisoners at the camp {{increased}} {{in the summer of}} 1864, the War Department again reduced rations, in retaliation for the Confederates reducing rations for Union prisoners. Rations reportedly no longer lasted quite as long as the period for which they were allotted. A few prisoners reported that prisoners resorted to eating rats. Guards punished anyone caught taking bones from the garbage by tying the bone in the prisoner's mouth and making him crawl around <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> As the length of confinements increased {{due to the lack of}} prisoner exchanges, more fights between prisoners arose. Other prisoners usually broke them up before guards intervened. Work details were still required.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the second}} breakup, Weasel, Vapid, and Panic formed the band the Riverdales and {{experienced}} some notoriety touring with Green Day. By 1996, they rejoined with Jughead and recorded a new Screeching Weasel album Bark <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dog</b> for Fat Mike's Fat Wreck Chords label. The album peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, making it their highest-charting album. However, both Vapid and Panic left by mutual decision after the recording, and Weasel and Jughead {{decided to go}} on without them, adding bassist Mass Giorgini (who had served as the band's producer in the past) and drummer Dan Lumley, both from Squirtgun. Weasel also decided {{for the second time}} that he no longer wanted to play guitar, so guitarist Zac Damon was added.|$|E
25|$|Ferrières {{returned}} to France, and in 1581, by then heavily in debt, joined the King of Navarre, the future Henri IV of France, in Gascony, {{and was named}} by him commander of Casteljaloux, an office which he fulfilled until January 1584. He then went to Saintonge, and despite his age engaged in conflict there between Protestant and Catholic forces. The galleys of a certain Captain Carles were making frequent sorties against the Ile d'Oléron, {{in the course of}} which battles Ferrières was captured in 1586 by Catholic forces and handed over to Carles, who demanded a heavy ransom which Ferrières was unable to pay. In consequence Carles allowed Ferrières, at the age of about sixty-six, 'to die <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> while bound to the magazine {{at the bottom of the}} hold of the captain's galley'.|$|E

25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
25|$|Crocodilians {{are more}} closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to most animals {{classified}} as reptiles, the three families being included in the group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). Despite their prehistoric look, crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles. Unlike other reptiles, a crocodile has a cerebral cortex and a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration. Salt glands are present in the tongues of crocodiles and they have a pore opening {{on the surface of the}} tongue, a trait that separates them from alligators. Salt glands are dysfunctional in Alligatoridae. Their function appears to be similar to that of salt glands in marine turtles. Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths. They often sleep with their mouths open and may pant <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog.</b> Four species of freshwater crocodile climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
