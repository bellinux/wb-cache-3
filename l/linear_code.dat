2500|$|Proof. Any <b>linear</b> <b>code</b> {{that can}} correct any burst pattern of length [...] cannot have {{a burst of}} length [...] as a {{codeword}}. If it had a burst of length [...] as a codeword, then a burst of length [...] could change the codeword to a burst pattern of length , which also could be obtained by making a burst error of length [...] in all zero codeword. If vectors are non-zero in first [...] symbols, then the vectors should be from different subsets of an array so that their difference is not a codeword of bursts of length [...] Ensuring this condition, {{the number of such}} subsets is at least equal to number of vectors.
