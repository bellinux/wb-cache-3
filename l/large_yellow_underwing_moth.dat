50|$|This species {{generally}} has {{the appearance of}} a smaller (wingspan 38-48 mm) version of the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua pronuba. The forewings are equally variable in pattern and colour, from pale clay to reddish clay, light brown to almost black. The stigmata are dark and outlined with pale yellow. The crosslines are weak. The wavy line flows on to the front edge as a no more than dark brown (never black) stain, which is sometimes extended down the enire wavy line. The hindwings are orange-yellow with a broad black sub-terminal band and central discal lunule (usually absent in Noctua pronuba). It is also similar to the lunar <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> Noctua orbona. In the overall impression a broad-winged species.|$|R

25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost <b>moth</b> and <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some insects, notably some Noctuid moths (such as the <b>Large</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing)</b> {{and some}} tiger moths (such as the Garden Tiger), were {{originally}} theorized {{to defend themselves}} against predation by echolocating bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects (a [...] "phantom echo" [...] that might therefore represent [...] "auditory crypsis"), with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming"). Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve [...] "auditory crypsis:" [...] tiger moth species appear to cluster into two distinct groups: one type produces sounds as acoustic aposematism (warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable) or are acoustic mimics of unpalatable moths, and another type that uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a [...] "phantom echo" [...] mechanism underlying sonar jamming but instead pointed towards echo interference.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is 5 - 25 cm {{long and}} it is composed of flowers gathered in dense cylindrical spikes (up to 50 flowers per spike). These inflorescences are scented and genes underlying eugenol (a volatile scent compound) production {{have been identified in}} Gymnadenia conopsea, Gymnadenia odoratissima and Gymnadenia densiflora [...] The flowers are petiolated, placed in the axils of long bracts and reach on average 8 - 14 cm. They have a distinctive three lobed lip and long spurs. Their light scent is similar to cloves. Their colors vary from white and pink to pink-purple, more rarely white. These flowers bloom in the Summer, from June to July. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (entomophily), including moths. The species is almost exclusively pollinated by moths (Lepidoptera). The most common pollinators are the small elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila porcellus), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum), silver Y (Autographa gamma), burnished brass (Diachrysia chrysitis) and <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> (Noctua pronuba). Fruit set is high with an average of 73%. The seeds germination is conditioned by the presence of specific fungi.|$|R
40|$|An area {{of common}} land between the River Stort and the Stort Navigation. About {{two thirds of}} the site is in Essex and a third in Hertfordshire, and {{it is one of the}} finest {{surviving}} unimproved grassland sites in the two counties. Traditional management at Hunsdon Mead has maintained the conditions required by a wide range of flowering plants. In April and May it is yellow with cowslips and marsh marigolds. As May gives way to June colours continually change, as plants such as yellow rattle, ragged robin, lady's smock, meadowsweet, bugle and many others flower in profusion. There are small colonies of green-winged orchid and adder's-tongue fern. Quaking grass and several uncommon sedge species are also present. Eastwick Mead has been more intensively managed over recent years and as a result does not have the diversity found on Hunsdon Mead. However, it is hoped that through appropriate management the Trust can create the right conditions for species to recolonise. All the typical butterflies of hay meadow are found here and the day-flying small <b>yellow</b> <b>underwing</b> <b>moth</b> is also established. Mayflies and dragonflies are abundant. During the winter, when the Mead floods, large flocks of lapwing and golden plover come to feed along with other winter migrants. Why is Hunsdon Mead so rich in wildlife? For over 600 years Hunsdon Mead has been managed on the ancient Lammas system under which local farmers graze their cattle in late summer, after a July hay cut. If it were cut earlier some of the flowering plants would not have time to set seed for the following year. Grazing by cattle and sheep is allowed only between 1 August and 1 March, after which the vegetation is allowed to grow up. The remarkable abundance of wildlife found on the Mead is a result of that management regime, which we are continuing today. We are working to introduce a similar management regime to Eastwick Mead. l Get driving directions l Find nearby public transpor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Plant defense traits require {{resources}} and energy that plants may otherwise use {{for growth and}} reproduction. In order to most efficiently protect plant tissues from herbivory, one widely accepted assumption of the optimal defense hypothesis states that plants protect tissues most relevant to fitness. Reproductive organs directly determining plant fitness, including flowers and immature fruit, as well as young, productive leaf tissue thus should be particularly well-defended. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the cyanogenic potential (HCNp) —a direct, chemical defense—systemically expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), and we tested susceptibility of these organs in bioassays with a generalist insect herbivore, the <b>Large</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>Underwing</b> (Noctuidae: Noctua pronuba). To determine the actual impact of either florivory (herbivory on flowers) or folivory on seed production {{as a measure of}} maternal fitness, we removed varying percentages of total flowers or young leaf tissue and quantified developing fruit, seeds, and seed viability. Results: We found extremely low HCNp in flowers (8. 66 [*]±[*] 2. 19 μmol CN− g− 1 FW in young, white flowers, 6. 23 [*]±[*] 1. 25 μmol CN− g− 1 FW in mature, yellow flowers) and in pods (ranging from 32. 05 [*]±[*] 7. 08 to 0. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 08 μmol CN− g− 1 FW in young to mature pods, respectively) whereas young leaves showed high levels of defense (67. 35 [*]±[*] 3. 15 μmol CN− g− 1 FW). Correspondingly, herbivores consumed more flowers than any other tissue, which, when taken alone, appears to contradict the optimal defense hypothesis. However, experimentally removing flowers did not significantly impact fitness, while leaf tissue removal significantly reduced production of viable seeds. Conclusions: Even though flowers were the least defended and most consumed, our results support the optimal defense hypothesis due to i) the lack of flower removal effects on fitness and ii) the high defense investment in young leaves, which have high consequences for fitness. These data highlight the importance of considering plant defense interactions from multiple angles; interpreting where empirical data fit within any plant defense hypothesis requires understanding the fitness consequences associated with the observed defense pattern...|$|R
