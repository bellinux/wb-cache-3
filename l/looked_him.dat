500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> in the eye and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
500|$|Opening {{with the}} {{disclaimer}} [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed {{in the making}} of this video", Kesha appears sitting next to two unicorns pouring champagne while having a conversation on how she was elected to the parliament of Uzbekistan, [...] "So I grabbed the bear by the throat and I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> right in the eyes, and I said, 'Bear, you have till the count of zero to put some pants on and apologize to the president.'" [...] The music begins and Kesha makes eyes at James Van Der Beek. After the eye contact Kesha grabs one of the unicorns and kisses him then removes her bra and throws it across the room, Van Der Beek then does the same with his bra, puzzling Kesha as to why he was wearing a bra. The music fades in the background as the two then {{make their way to the}} center of the dance floor and exchange words ("Well, well, well. If it isn’t James Van Der Douche.", [...] "I don't appreciate you slander-Beeking my name, Ke dollar sign ha.") before engaging in a gun fight. They begin shooting lasers at one another, killing multiple unicorns. Van Der Beek gets hit in the shoulder and falls. Kesha steps on his arm to stop him from reaching for his gun, as he begs for mercy, which Kesha denies. At the end of the video, it is revealed that Kesha killed Van Der Beek and that she has mounted his head on her wall with the plaque reading, [...] "James Van Der Dead", as she sits with two unicorns laughing. She then frowns at the camera and it switches to Van Der Beek one more time before the screen goes black.|$|E

After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> in the eye, and said, 'Mr. Lubitsch, I'm willing {{to do my best}} but I just can't go on working on this picture if you're going to keep shouting at me.' 'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it – [...] but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing. From then on we got along famously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. He looked over at me, still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1968, {{their first}} album Truth was released; by October it {{had risen to}} number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album {{featured}} Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again {{at the end of}} the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: [...] "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> in the eye and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 1968, Foley {{appeared}} in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{sponsored by the}} local Sheriff's Posse that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> {{in the face and}} said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E
2500|$|Beatty took {{command of}} the cruiser HMS Arrogant in the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1903 and then {{commanded}} the cruiser HMS Suffolk in the Mediterranean Fleet from October 1904. He then became the naval advisor to the Army Council in 1906 and, after having been appointed a naval Aide-de-Camp to the King on 5 November 1908, he became captain of the battleship HMS Queen in the Atlantic Fleet in December 1908. At the request of Alfred Winsloe, the Fourth Sea Lord, {{he was promoted to}} rear-admiral on 1 January 1910 by a special order in council since he had not completed the requisite time as a captain. He was offered the post of second-in-{{command of the}} Atlantic Fleet, but declined it and asked for one in the Home Fleet. As the Atlantic Fleet post was a major command, the Admiralty were very unimpressed and his attitude nearly ruined his career. Beatty, as a rapidly promoted war hero, with no financial worries and with a degree of support in Royal circles, felt more confident than most naval officers in standing firm on requesting a posting nearer home. He was approaching two years on half pay (which would trigger automatic retirement from the navy) when on 8 January 1912 his career was saved by the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. Churchill had met Beatty when Beatty was commander of a gunboat on the Nile supporting the army at the Battle of Omdurman, in which Churchill took part as a cavalry officer. A [...] "probably apocryphal" [...] story relates that as Beatty walked into Churchill's office at the Admiralty, Churchill <b>looked</b> <b>him</b> over and said, [...] "You seem very young to be an Admiral." [...] Unfazed, Beatty replied, [...] "And you seem very young to be First Lord." [...] Churchill – who was himself only thirty-eight years old in 1912 – took to him immediately and he was appointed Naval Secretary.|$|E
