5|$|The {{national}} park center opened in 2001 {{and the park}} was expanded on 23 August 2003. At {{the same time the}} adjacent Øvre Pasvik <b>Landscape</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Area</b> was created, which borders Pasvik Nature Reserve. Thus the five protected areas were connected.

5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the <b>landscape</b> <b>protection</b> <b>area</b> each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The {{population}} of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E

Treriksrøysa, the tripoint cairn located at the intersection of the Finland–Norway–Russia border, is within the park. To the east is Øvre Pasvik <b>Landscape</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Area</b> and Pasvik Nature Reserve, which both lie along the Norway–Russia border.

40|$|The marbled {{crayfish}} or Marmorkrebs, Procambarus fallax (Hagen, 1870) f. virginalis, a parthenogenetic {{freshwater crayfish}} {{belonging to the}} North American cambarids, was recorded in Hungary for the first time. Several specimens of this potentially invasive crayfish were caught at different locations in the thermal Lake Hévíz and its outflows {{in the western part}} of the country. Captured individuals covered a wide size range (5. 5 to 50. 5 mm carapace length) and one was carrying eggs and recently hatched offspring, which suggests that this organism has established a stable and self-sustaining population in the warm habitats of Lake Hévíz area. This finding is of great significance because these habitats belong to the catchment of the Danube River including Lake Balaton, and thus, a significant further spread of the marbled crayfish is likely to happen in Central Europe. Furthermore, the expansion of this crayfish already reached the Kis-Balaton, one of the <b>landscape</b> <b>protection</b> <b>areas</b> of the Balaton Uplands National Park, what could have currently yet unpredictable consequences for this unique wetland biotope...|$|R
