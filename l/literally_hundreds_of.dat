5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing <b>literally</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E

40|$|Shanghai was {{probably}} the first large metropolis to experience large-scale modern warfare in its very midst. Bitter and brutal fighting raged for three months {{in and around the}} city, with intense bombings from ships and planes. The war threw <b>literally</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> thousands of people on the streets. As war expanded to the countryside, millions became refugees. This paper is concerned with the massive and sudden transformation of Shanghai residents into refugees {{and its impact on the}} city and its resources. In the first part, I address the issue of war in Shanghai and its past experience with refugee issues. I argue that 1937 created an entirely new situation no authority was prepared to meet. The second part is devoted to a study of the refugee population, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. In fact, those who found refuge in camps [...] a small part of the refugees – do not reflect the normal structure of the local population. The last part is concerned with the challenges refugee camps had to face to maintain alive a huge destitute population with limited resources in an overcrowded urban space engulfed in war...|$|R

25|$|After many years, Asad {{was again}} invited by another President of Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq, in 1983 {{and that was}} his last visit to this country. When he arrived at Islamabad, which {{he had not yet}} seen, he was {{received}} at the plane with great honour and escorted to the Presidency. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and {{at the request of the}} President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from <b>literally</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.|$|E
25|$|Carns and Sloan {{returned}} to Olympia where they {{joined forces with}} Donna Dresch's Queercore label Chainsaw Records. The Need's unsettling brand of cyborgian deconstructive art rock (and Carns' distinctive artwork) both set them apart and ensured their versatility; they played shows at venues such as DUMBA with such diverse acts as Glass Candy, Tribe 8, Fugazi, and The Ex, and toured with Le Tigre, BS 2000, and Blonde Redhead. Joe Preston joined the band briefly, playing bass and sampler. During this period Carns played drums with The Sub-Debs and later with The Spells. Carns and Sloan both briefly joined Mocket, then Two Ton Boa. With singer Nomy Lamm, the duo formed a highly theatrical surf-garage-punk drag king band called The Teenage Ho-Dads. They also dreamt up the collaborative project KaraNEEDoke, where Carns and Sloan and a rotating cast of players formed a live karaoke band for guest singers. This sense of community involvement, DIY spirit, and willingness to experiment {{led to the creation}} of The Transfused, a full-length rock opera, written with librettist Nomy Lamm. Twelve months in the making, with an original score by Carns and Sloan, a cast of 25, a full backing band, $40,000 in grassroots fundraising, months of rehearsals, and <b>literally</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> volunteers, The Transfused sold out its two-week run at Olympia's Capitol Theater in summer 2000. The first-ever Ladyfest took place in Olympia a month later; Carns organized and emceed the punk cabaret-style Dude-Looks-Like-A-Lady drag show. Soon after, Sloan relocated to Los Angeles; The Need added a new bass player, Dvin Kirakosian, and for a while Carns spent alternate months in Olympia and LA. Their final album, prophetically titled The Need Is Dead, had been released in 2000; the band broke up within a year.|$|E
