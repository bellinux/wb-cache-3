5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{standard}} {{adopted by}} the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over {{which of the two}} scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not [...] "flicker" [...] in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.|$|E

30|$|The imaging {{resolution}} of the display showing the output by the 8 K camera itself with AI Nikkor 50  mm f/ 1.2 S (NIKON CORP.) was about 4000 <b>line</b> widths <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> height on the 8 K display, which indicated an intrinsic performance of 8 K.

With AI AF Nikkor 24  mm f/ 2.8 D we could attain higher resolution but with a smaller field of view. For laparoscopic surgery, {{the field of view}} is required to be as large as possible. Therefore, with priority given to a greater field of view, in this study we selected AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60  mm f/ 2.8 G ED as the lens adapter.|$|R
500|$|The lens' {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} (MTF) metrics for its image resolution (sharpness) {{were described as}} [...] "surprisingly impressive...throughout the entire zoom range" [...] by Photozone.de. The sharpness, in terms of <b>line</b> widths <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> height (LW/PH), is most uniform at 8mm (especially near the f-number of 8 where it is even throughout the image) with strong numbers at the center, borders and corner. [...] Higher focal lengths were less impressive. Optical tests were consistent with lab results pointing to excellent sharpness. However, exposure testing seems to belie the stated f-number capabilities of the lens, since stopping down from widest aperture did not change results, according to Gietler.|$|R

50|$|Taking {{the example}} of a current high {{definition}} (HD) video system, with 1920 by 1080 pixels, the Nyquist theorem states that it should be possible, in a perfect system, to resolve fully (with true black to white transitions) a total of 1920 black and white alternating lines combined, otherwise referred to as a spatial frequency of 1920/2=960 <b>line</b> pairs <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> width, or 960 cycles <b>per</b> <b>picture</b> width, (definitions in terms of cycles per unit angle or per mm are also possible but generally less clear when dealing with cameras and more appropriate to telescopes etc.). In practice, this is far from the case, and spatial frequencies that approach the Nyquist rate will generally be reproduced with decreasing amplitude, so that fine detail, though it can be seen, is greatly reduced in contrast. This gives rise to the interesting observation that, for example, a standard definition television picture derived from a film scanner that uses oversampling, as described later, may appear sharper than a high definition picture shot on a camera with a poor modulation transfer function. The two pictures show an interesting difference that is often missed, the former having full contrast on detail up to a certain point but then no really fine detail, while the latter does contain finer detail, but with such reduced contrast as to appear inferior overall.|$|R

40|$|The Voyager {{imaging system}} is described, noting {{that it is}} made up of a narrow-angle and a {{wide-angle}} TV camera, each in turn consisting of optics, a filter wheel and shutter assembly, a vidicon tube, and an electronics subsystem. The narrow-angle camera has a focal length of 1500 mm; its field of view is 0. 42 deg and its focal ratio is f/ 8. 5. For the wide-angle camera, the focal length is 200 mm, the field of view 3. 2 deg, and the focal ratio of f/ 3. 5. Images are exposed by each camera through one of eight filters in the filter wheel on the photoconductive surface of a magnetically focused and deflected vidicon having a diameter of 25 mm. The vidicon storage surface (target) is a selenium-sulfur film having an active area of 11. 14 x 11. 14 mm; it holds a frame consisting of 800 lines with 800 <b>picture</b> elements <b>per</b> <b>line.</b> <b>Pictures</b> of Jupiter, Saturn, and their moons are presented, with short descriptions given of the area being viewed...|$|R
