The new multi-purpose fluid <b>mixing</b> <b>device</b> can <b>mix</b> two or three kinds of fluid quickly. The device is composed by the fluid jet entrance section, main mixing chamber and export hybrid tube. The fluidic element and the symmetric structure of baffle increase the mixing efficiency and the experimental results showed that the new <b>device</b> of fluid <b>mixing</b> has a good efficiency on mixing. It is characterized by flash fluid mix, adjustable fluid density, easy-to-use, small size and easy maintenance.

40|$|The {{measurements}} of a turbulent swirl {{flow in the}} subchannels of a 5 x 5 rod array having typical <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> at the MATIS-H (Measurements and Analysis of Turbulence In Subchannels-Horizontal) facility have been analysed using a commercial CFD code of STAR-CCM+ 4. 02 with a unit grid model having no unmatched grid interface. The main objectives of this analysis {{is to establish a}} proper CFD analysis methodology to this kind of very complicated turbulent swirling flow in a subchannel since previous results show that a predicted turbulent swirl flow within 5 times of hydraulic diameter length from the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> tip shows different results, which are dependent on the models chosen, such as the turbulent model, wall function model, the y+ value, and the numerical model for a convection term. In the MATIS-H experiment, the intrinsic features of turbulent flow along the elevation, which shows distinct characteristics very sensitively by depending on the types of the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> (split and swirl types), were measured by 2 -D LDA (Laser Doppler Anemometry) at the condition of Re= 48, 000 in the water loop being operated at 35 o C and 1. 5 bar. A series of sensitivity analyses shows that a very dense mesh distribution along the stream-wise direction around the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> is recommended to use for resolving a drastic change of the turbulent intensity due to a strong swirl flow induced by the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> And it is also shown that a non-linear or secondorder closure model is required to adopt for properly predicting the anisotropic characteristics of the turbulent flow structures caused by the <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> in the sub-channel. 1...|$|R

The reaction between lanthanum(III) and methyl thymol blue was used as a model reaction for a comparison study of <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> Column and open-tubular reactors were included in the study. <b>Mixing</b> <b>devices</b> were compared on the basis of the straight line fit of At versus the natural logarithm of the concentration of injected La(III).

40|$|Detailed {{turbulent}} flow profiles have been {{measured on a}} square sub-channel geometry with typical <b>mixing</b> <b>devices.</b> For a fine examination of the lateral flow structure on a sub-channel geometry with 2 -D LDA, a 5 x 5 rod bundle array was fabricated as 2. 6 {{times larger than the}} real bundle size.

40|$|Abstract. The {{efficiency}} {{of a set}} of <b>mixing</b> enhancement <b>devices</b> on an array of Jets In Cross-Flow (JICF) is studied using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The baseline flow is a rectangular channel flow on which five JICF’s are installed on each wall (upper and lower). <b>Mixing</b> <b>devices</b> are fixed tabs installed upstream of the jets. Instantaneous analyses of the LES fields reveal two large vortical structures developing downstream of the <b>mixing</b> <b>device.</b> These structures strongly enhance mixing. Comparisons of the statistically averaged LES predictions against experimental results validate the predictions. The <b>mixing</b> <b>devices</b> provide a better spatial and temporal homogeneity of the gas mixture at the exit of the main duct. Even though full temporal and spatial homogeneity of the gas mixture prior to combustion is not guaranteed with this design, the probability of finding strong inhomogeneous zones is reduced. More generally, this study confirms the power of LES to help design actuating devices for flow and mixing control.

40|$|During a {{cell culture}} in a bioreactor, the cells {{are exposed to}} the shear {{stresses}} mainly generated in the culture medium by the <b>mixing</b> <b>device.</b> Beyond a critical shear stress, this exposition induces cell damages. Therefore, the limitation of the shear stress is an important criterion for the design of bioreactors. An accurate modeling of the flow and the induced shear stresses in the medium is a tool to achieve an effective design of a bioreactor. In this work, a new design of a <b>mixing</b> <b>device</b> is considered. The aims of this work are to develop a methodology to study the flow and the induced shear stresses in the device, to study and to model the relation between the flow, the induced shear stresses and the cell viability, to use the developed model as an optimization tool, and to study the design of the bioreactor <b>mixing</b> <b>device</b> and its scale-up. In a first step, the flow and the induced shear stresses in the device are simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics. In a second step, the model of the influence of the flow and the induced shear stresses on the cell viability is established by a comparison between the computed flow and the induced shear stresses and experimental measurements of cellular viabilities for different impeller rotation speeds.
