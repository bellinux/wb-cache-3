5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking {{would not be}} tolerated, the smell of marijuana <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana for uses including {{but not limited to}} medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|While Wellesley was {{preoccupied with}} re-taking the gun line, Pohlmann rallied his {{infantry}} and redeployed {{them into a}} semicircle with {{their backs to the}} Juah; their right flank across the river and their left in Assaye. However, most of the Maratha cannon, which had inflicted heavy losses on Wellesley's infantry, had been captured or lay abandoned on the battlefield. Reluctant to join the fray, the Maratha cavalry <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance to the west. Most were Pindarries: loosely organised and lightly armed horsemen whose traditional role was to cut down fleeing enemy troops, harass convoy lines and carry out raids into enemy territory. They were not trained to attack well-formed infantry or heavily armed European cavalry, and did not play a further part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia has {{inspired}} scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, {{that can be}} reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns a freedom fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia {{as a woman who}} created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.|$|E

5|$|Carus's death, amid a {{successful}} war with Persia and in mysterious circumstances – he was believed (perhaps {{as a result}} of later Diocletianic propaganda) to have been struck by lightning – left his sons Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from his post in Gaul as imperial commissioner and arrived there by January 284, becoming legitimate Emperor in the West. Numerian <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East. The Roman withdrawal from Persia was orderly and unopposed. The Sassanid king Bahram II could not field an army against them as he was still struggling to establish his authority. By March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health: he issued the only extant rescript in his name there, but after he left the city, his staff, including the prefect (Numerian's father-in-law, and as such the dominant influence in the Emperor's entourage) Aper, reported that he suffered from an inflammation of the eyes. He traveled in a closed coach from then on. When the army reached Bithynia, some of the soldiers smelled an odor emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and inside they found Numerian dead. Both Eutropius and Aurelius Victor describe Numerian's death as an assassination.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} located 150mi (240km) south of Lafayette, Louisiana as it drifted northward and winds were {{estimated}} to have peaked at 50mph (85km/h). However, in the post-season, {{it was determined that}} Arlene peaked near landfall with winds of 60mph (95km/h). As Arlene neared the coast, the storm began to weaken due to the interaction with land. Arlene made landfall about 40mi (65km) southeast of Lafayette, Louisiana at 2100UTC (4 p.m.CST). The operational landfall intensity was 50mph (85km/h) but it was lowered to 45mph (75km/h) in the post season. Upon making landfall, Arlene became the earliest landfalling tropical cyclone in Louisiana history. Arlene weakened quickly to a tropical depression shortly after landfall. The storm further degenerated to a remnant area of low-pressure on the afternoon of May 31. The remnant of the storm <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern United States until June 2, when it dissipated over South Carolina. Although the original low pressure system dissipated, a new, non tropical center formed further north over Virginia. This new low quickly tracked northeast, brushing the southern coast of New England before moving over Nova Scotia and losing its identity on June3.|$|E

25|$|Puck {{suggests}} a secret history of these routes, for unsurprisingly they attracted long extant folk lore, running {{not only through}} the physical countryside but also through the invisible geography, the 'mental terrain', of pre-industrial country-folk.

25|$|While {{his appeal}} <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Court's docket, Tanaka's medical {{condition}} deteriorated. He {{announced his retirement}} from politics in October 1989, {{at the age of}} 71, in an announcement made by his son-in-law Naoki Tanaka. The announcement ended his 42-year career in politics; the remnants of his faction, now led by former Prime Minister Takeshita, remained the most powerful bloc within the LDP {{at the time of his}} retirement. In 1993, a number of members of his faction broke away from the LDP to form part of an Eight-party Alliance government under Morihiro Hosokawa.|$|E
25|$|He gave up {{painting}} in about 1770 {{to concentrate on}} literary pursuits. His health was shattered by an accidental dislocation of the right arm and his second wife's death in 1782. With unflinching pertinacity, he struggled until he had completed a likeness of the king upon which he was engaged at the time, and then started for his beloved Italy. He left a series of 50 royal portraits {{to be completed by}} his assistant Reinagle. For several years he <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, his constitution finally broken. He died at Dover on 10 August 1784.|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} fleet {{carried a}} large number of soldiers, intended by Napoleon to be used to attack British possessions in the Caribbean. Villeneuve felt however that his orders were not clear, and remained at Fort-de-France, hoping to be joined by a fleet under Honoré Ganteaume, which unbeknownst to him had been unable to break the blockade of Brest. For two weeks Villeneuve <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay, until finally being persuaded by Villaret de Joyeuse to use his forces to capture Diamond Rock, a thorn in his side for the past seventeen months. Villeneuve gave Captain Julien Cosmao of the 74-gun Pluton command of the expedition. He was to take his ship, the 74-gun , the 36-gun Sirène, a corvette, schooner, eleven gunboats, and between three and four hundred soldiers (in addition to the ships' crews), and retake the rock.|$|E
25|$|The {{main body}} of the work states at the {{beginning}} that it assumes prior knowledge of Immanuel Kant's theories, and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of transcendental idealism {{than any of the other}} later German Idealists. However, the book contains an appendix entitled critique of the Kantian philosophy, in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's ethics and significant parts of his epistemology and aesthetics. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school of Plato or he is already familiar with Indian philosophy.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bloody}} Battle of Eylau on 7 and 8 February 1807, Napoleon's forces <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} {{so that the}} emperor could claim a victory. However, his soldiers clamored {{for an end to}} the fighting. Instead of the usual shouts of Vive l'Empereur (long live the emperor), cries of Vive la paix (long live peace) were heard in the bivouacs when the emperor passed by. On 17 February the French began their withdrawal westward into winter quarters. By the 23rd the French reached their cantonments, with Bernadotte's I Corps on the left, Soult's IV Corps in the center, and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps on the right. Ney's VI Corps occupied an advanced position at Guttstadt, while the Imperial Guard and the Reserve Cavalry occupied the rear area around Ostróda (Osterode). Napoleon stationed the V Corps in a position to cover Warsaw. Marshal Pierre Augereau's decimated VII Corps was broken up and its survivors were allotted to the other corps.|$|E

25|$|Greco-Buddhist art is {{the artistic}} manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a {{cultural}} syncretism between the Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed {{over a period of}} close to 1000 years in Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, and the Islamic conquests of the 7th century CE. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE. Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as apsaras. Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the Corinthian capital appearing.|$|E
25|$|Majstorović {{was also}} vice-captain at Basel {{and led the}} team out {{whenever}} Ivan Ergić was not playing. Majstorović had an excellent scoring record at Basel, averaging nearly one goal every seven games. He regularly <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposition's penalty area when attacking corners and due to his great heading ability, he usually converted high balls {{into the back of}} the net. He is also a spot-kick specialist and scored the winner for Basel in the 2007 Swiss Cup final by netting from the penalty spot in the 93rd minute. He showed his love for Basel and their passionate fans by kissing the badge on his shirt as his goal celebration. At the end of the 2007–08 season, he was Basel's second top goal-scorer with 10 goals, behind 12-goal Marco Streller. The explanation for his many goals is because during his time with Basel, Majstorović became the club's first choice penalty taker. In January 2008, he was set to move to Turkish club Trabzonspor but the move fell through.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{explosion}} on 19December, re-entry to the mine {{was carried out}} by mine rescue teams wearing breathing apparatus, until it was established that it was safe for the AWRE men to return. They found that the stemming in the crosscut had failed to contain the blast, which had destroyed the cables and control equipment for the second charge. This was repaired and the second explosion scheduled for 15January 1960. The evening before it was due, a group of Greenside men were finishing off some sandbagging. Two of these, who were not experienced underground workers, went off during their mid-evening break to visit a stope at the northern end of the mine, to collect pieces of white spar. They failed to return, and were found dead, overcome by gases that had <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stope. The test was halted while more work was done to improve the extraction of gas from the explosion. The second test finally took place on 29April 1960. Venting the mine and checking for gases was carried out very thoroughly this time, and it was August 1960 before control of the mine was returned to the Greenside company.|$|E

25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed from the closet, the smell of {{decomposition}} still <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apartment. Knorr became concerned that the smell and physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings out of the home and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of lighter fluid on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor from the closet to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to keep a low profile. In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Shortly after Robert, Jr.'s arrest, Knorr left Las Vegas and relocated to Salt Lake City.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, the Tanana River at Nenana crested at 14.64feet. This total {{was more}} than four feet above flood stage and was the third-highest water level ever {{recorded}}, falling short of a 15.9-foot mark in 1948 and the record 18.9-foot mark recorded during the flood of 1967. The town shipyard was submerged under three feet of water, and the town's clinic was moved from its interim location in the fire station to the town airport after floodwater threatened the station. Town leaders encouraged residents to evacuate to higher ground until the flood receded. Nenana High School was saved from flooding by just eight inches of elevation. Water lapped around the school's base, but did not enter the school itself due to that small margin. High water <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town until August 3, when a National Weather Service forecaster felt confident enough to say, [...] "The worst is over." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1914, a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals {{upheld the}} verdict against the Curtiss company, which {{continued}} to avoid penalties through legal tactics. Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision, {{and much to}} the frustration of company executives, he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly. In fact, {{he was planning to}} sell the company and departed in 1915. In 1917, with World War I underway, the U.S. government pressured the industry to form a cross-licensing organization, the Manufacturers Aircraft Association, to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents, including the original and subsequent Wright patents. The Wright-Martin company (successor to the Wright company) and the Curtiss company (which held a number of its own patents) each received a $2million payment. The [...] "patent war" [...] ended, although side issues <b>lingered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts until the 1920s. In a twist of irony, the Wright Aeronautical Corporation (another successor) and the Curtiss Aeroplane company merged in 1929 to form the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, which remains in business today producing high-tech components for the aerospace industry.|$|E
