The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research effort involves {{a comparison between}} the actual repair parts demand data generated by the forklifts at Naval Supply Center, Oakland, California, during calendar year 1975 and the allowance quantities of the applicable allowance parts lists (API's). The comparison is accomplished from three perspectives: the first perspective evaluates the degree of correlation between <b>line</b> <b>items</b> demanded and the <b>line</b> <b>items</b> appearing in the APL's; the second perspective provides a projection {{of the effect of}} increased forklift operating hours on the quantities demanded among those demands for <b>line</b> <b>items</b> allowed by the APL's; and the third perspective identifies those <b>line</b> <b>items</b> for which demand generated rendered the quantities demanded significantly different from the quantities allowed by the APL's. As a result of these comparisons and the low correlation between demand data and allowance projections, it is hypothesized that the crucial variable contributing to this low correlation is the low utilization of the equipments in terms of annual operating hours. The conclusion reached is that APL's for forklifts, as presently formulated, are a support planning document of dubious value in situations of low equipment utilization such as observed in this study.

25|$|When {{asked how}} this {{proposed}} legislation {{was different from}} the 1996 <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Congress {{attempted}} {{to enhance the}} president's veto power with the <b>Line</b> <b>Item</b> Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.|$|E
