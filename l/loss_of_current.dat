50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the way ESEM works, the resolution is preserved relative to the SEM. That is because the resolving power of the instrument is determined by the electron beam diameter which is unaffected by the gas over the useful travel distance before it is completely lost. This has been demonstrated on the commercial ESEMs that provide the finest beam spots by imaging test specimens, i.e. customarily , in both vacuum and gas. However, the contrast decreases accordingly as the electron probe loses current with travel distance and increase of pressure. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> intensity, if necessary, can be compensated by increasing the incident beam current which is accompanied by an increased spot size. Therefore, the practical resolution depends on the original specimen contrast of a given feature, on the design of the instrument that should provide minimal beam and signal losses and on the operator selecting the correct parameters for each application. The aspects of contrast and resolution have been conclusively determined in the referenced work on the foundations of ESEM. Further, in relation to this, we have to consider the radiation effects on the specimen.|$|E

The present study shows the following results: the diffusion of molecular formic acid through the bipolar membrane explains quantitatively the presence of sodium formate in the sodium hydroxide solution. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> acid <b>current</b> efficiency is only due to diffusion of molecular acid through both anion-exchange and bipolar membranes. The sodium hydroxide current efficiency is determined by acid diffusion through the bipolarmembrane andOH− leakage through the cation-exchange membrane. The flux of acid diffusion through the membranes is proportional to acid concentration and depends on sodium hydroxide concentration for bipolar membrane and on sodium formate concentration for anion-exchange membrane. The flux rates vary with temperature. A model based on mass balance is proposed to describe the bipolar membrane electrodialysis. Some experimental parameters like volume variations are needed.

The contribution {{of this research is}} to propose a framework to improve components of Information Quality (IQ) with Automated Information System (AIS) for the fashion retail business in a practical way via a case study of a logistics distribution firm in Thailand. The core set of information quality and Benefits/Costs (BC) quantitative and qualitative analysis of IQ have been presented through a case study which can be obtained by using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) model. Several designed procedures in AIS have been upgraded to minimise mismatched data. The major result indicates that, based upon the BC analysis, a fully-integrated IQ system should be invested.

40|$|There are {{competing}} theoretical explanations and conflicting empirical {{evidence for the}} IPO underpricing phenomenon in family firms. The behavioral agency model predicts that loss-averse family firms discount their shares more than non-family firms {{in order to minimize}} <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> socioemotional wealth (SEW). By contrast, the endowment effect in prospect theory suggests that family owners maximize their financial wealth (FW) by including SEW in their perceptions of firm value and demanding a higher IPO price to relinquish it. We reconcile these seemingly incompatible predictions by adding insights on the dynamic properties of the reference point in decision framing. Conceiving IPO pricing as a two-stage gamble, we theorize that initial SEW losses entailed by the listing decision increase the disposition of family owners to underprice IPO shares to possibly offset these losses, or to “break even”. In doing so, we advance the behavioral agency model with the aversion to loss realization logic to explain how the decision frames and preferences of family owners change during the IPO process, depending on initial <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> SEW and new expectations of future SEW.
