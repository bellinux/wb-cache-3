While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by a <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation and concentration, and were in position.

A <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E

The known breeding area is about 23.3million km2 (9million sq mi), which is a <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable.

When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} <b>large</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
