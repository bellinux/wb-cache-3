5|$|On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand {{subsidiary}} Holden New Zealand {{announced that}} {{production at the}} assembly plant based in Trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone assembly line due to <b>low</b> <b>output</b> volumes. During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.|$|E
5|$|Rocks have a {{porphyritic}} texture. Basaltic andesites typically contain {{less than}} 10% crystals while dacites generally {{have more than}} 20% crystals. The Alconcha group lavas of the first one million years are crystal-poor and lack biotite; later lavas contain biotite and more crystals.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> and mortality in decompensated heart failure. INTRODUCTION: Introduction: Patients with decompensated heart failure {{have a high}} mortality rate, especially those patients with <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output.</b> However, this clinical presentation is uncommon, and its management is controversial. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 452 patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60 years, and 64. 6 % were men. <b>Low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> was present in 281 (63 %) patients on admission. Chagas disease {{was the cause of}} heart failure in 92 (20. 4 %) patients who had higher B type natriuretic peptide levels (1, 978. 38 vs. 1, 697. 64 pg/mL; P = 0. 015). Predictors of <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> were Chagas disease (RR: 3. 655, P< 0. 001), lower ejection fraction (RR: 2. 414, P< 0. 001), hyponatremia (RR: 1. 618, P = 0. 036), and renal dysfunction (RR: 1. 916, P = 0. 007). Elderly patients were inversely associated with <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> (RR: 0. 436, P = 0. 001). Predictors of mortality were Chagas disease (RR: 2. 286, P< 0. 001), ischemic etiology (RR: 1. 449, P = 0. 035), and <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> (RR: 1. 419, P = 0. 047). CONCLUSIONS: In severe decompensated heart failure, predictors of <b>low</b> cardiac <b>output</b> are Chagas disease, lower ejection fraction, hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction. Additionally, Chagas disease patients have higher B type natriuretic peptide levels and a worse prognosis independent of lower ejection fraction...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's <b>low</b> <b>output,</b> Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

25|$|Historically, many {{headphones}} had {{relatively high}} impedance, often over 500ohms {{in order to}} operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers.

25|$|By {{combining}} both gas {{and steam}} cycles, high input temperatures and <b>low</b> <b>output</b> temperatures can be achieved. The {{efficiency of the}} cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. This large range means that the Carnot efficiency of the cycle is high. The actual efficiency, while lower than this, is still {{higher than that of}} either plant on its own. The actual efficiency achievable is a complex area.|$|E
25|$|Headphones are {{available}} with low or high impedance (typically measured at 1kHz). Low-impedance headphones {{are in the range}} 16 to 32ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600ohms. As the impedance of a pair of headphones increases, more voltage (at a given current) is required to drive it, and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases. In recent years, impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered CMOS-based portable electronics. This has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics. Consequently, newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively <b>low</b> <b>output</b> impedance.|$|E

25|$|Production {{aircraft}} featured {{several different}} types of engines, leading to various mark numbers being applied to the Vimy {{to distinguish between the}} emerging subtypes. The use of different engines was often down to their availability, relatively few engines from Rolls-Royce Limited were used upon the Vimy during 1918 due to <b>low</b> <b>output</b> levels from that manufacturer, while other manufacturers also struggled to keep up with engine demand during that same year. At one point, there was considerable enthusiasm for powering the Vimy with American Liberty L-12 engines instead due to it being a plentiful alternative at the time; however, while specified as such for production aircraft, all orders for the Liberty-equipped Vimy were terminated in January 1919 and no examples were ever completed. The BHP Puma was another engine that had been intended for use on the Vimy, but the Puma was cancelled without any aircraft being fitted with the engine.|$|E
25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at <b>low</b> <b>output</b> RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E
