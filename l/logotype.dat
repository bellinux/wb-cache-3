5|$|Early in pre-production, Spielberg {{hired the}} film title {{designer}} Dan Perri {{to design a}} <b>logotype</b> for Close Encounters. Perri, who had previously worked on The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), produced a <b>logotype</b> in Handel Gothic typeface, with only a script to work from. Spielberg was delighted with the result, and applied the logo to all production stationery and crew shirts. Unusually in filmmaking, Spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over the film's entire branding, and asked Perri to design the advertising campaign and title sequence for Close Encounters based on his logo. Perri later went on to design titles {{for a number of}} other major Hollywood pictures, including Star Wars (1977), Raging Bull (1980), and Airplane! (1980).|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (<b>logotype,</b> product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E

The <b>logotype</b> {{was given}} to Chanel by the Château de Crémat, Nice, and was not registered as a trademark until the first Chanel shops were established. Along with other makers, Chanel is a target of counterfeiters. China is prime supplier. An authentic classic Chanel handbag retails from around US$4,150, while a counterfeit usually costs around US$200. Beginning in the 1990s, all authentic Chanel handbags were numbered.|$|E

However, the official {{name of the}} institution remains the University of Durham and the official coat of arms is unchanged. The same year, St Mary's College had its first mixed undergraduate intake. In October 2006, Josephine Butler College, a long-standing development, opened its doors to students as Durham's newest college - the only purpose-built self-catering college for students within Durham.

25|$|While {{the film}} was in production, a logo was {{commissioned}} from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as The Exorcist (1973), Taxi Driver (1976). Perri devised a foreshortened STAR WARS <b>logotype</b> consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees.|$|E
25|$|Theology {{still had}} precedence, {{but in the}} {{privileges}} of 1593, {{the importance of a}} university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium Regium in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the <b>logotype.</b>|$|E

Five different dies are known to have been so reused, and Bowers estimates a mintage of 118,975pieces. Spindel estimates that only 0.2%–0.3% of the pieces have survived to the present.|$|E
