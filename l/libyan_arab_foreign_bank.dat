One American man, Daniel Cohen, who lost his daughter on Flight 103 was particularly outspoken against the film, calling Francovich a [...] "Libyan dupe" [...] and [...] "at best a journeyman film maker." [...] A December 1993 Financial Times article revealed that Hemar Enterprises was owned by Metropole Hotels, controlled by Tiny Rowland. Shortly after the indictment of Libya in the Pan Am Flight 103 incident, Rowland had sold a percentage of his interests to the <b>Libyan</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Foreign</b> Investment Company (Lafico), controlled by the Government of Libya.

[...] She added that the film [...] "looked like an amateur production" [...] and was [...] "so bad, so silly, that I wonder if we had wasted our time trying to stop it." ...|$|R
