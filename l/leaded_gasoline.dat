5|$|Studies {{have found}} a weak link between lead from <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and crime rates.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

Diesel fuel, although unleaded, was also dyed a brown color.|$|R

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. <b>Leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Robert Kehoe was a research-based {{physician}} firmly {{convinced of}} his scientific findings. historical recordshows a career not only {{devoted to the}} defense of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline’s</b> use, but also one that insisted lead be kept out of children’s toys. [...] Kehoe, a pioneer in occupational and environmental medicine who was the first to assemble a multidisciplinary team of physicians, analytical chemists, toxicologists, industrial hygienists and engineers to study occupational and environmental health problems, retired in 1965. Kehoe Hall of the Kettering Lab Complex at the University of Cincinnati, completed in 1963, is named in his honor. Kehoe retired in 1965. He became Professor Emeritus of Occupational Medicine at the university upon his retirement. He died in Cincinnati in 1992 at the age of 99.|$|R

5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasolines,</b> poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is under pressure by the EPA {{to phase out}} <b>leaded</b> aviation <b>gasoline,</b> but traditional unleaded fuels do not work in aircraft. Purdue’s National Test Facility for fuels and propulsion in the Department of Aviation Technology has been working to help develop standards for, and certify, a replacement fuel. A bio-based synthetic fuel has been recently developed at The Purdue Research Park,as a drop in replacement for aviation gasoline. Unfortunately, at present the American Society of Test and Measurement (ASTM) has no specification for approving non-petroleum aviation fuels, but {{is in the process}} of creating that new specification...|$|R
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> was the {{predominant}} type {{available in the}} first years of the Wankel engine's development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is designed to reduced the wearing of seal and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of gasoline's lubricating qualities. As <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the gasoline to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. Experienced users advise, even in engines with electronic fuel injection, adding at least 1% of oil directly to gasoline as a safety measure in case the pump supplying oil to combustion chamber related parts failed or sucked in air. A SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and cooling fins.|$|E
25|$|First European {{countries}} started replacing lead {{by the end}} of the 1980s and {{by the end of}} the 1990s <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> {{was banned}} within the entire European Union. Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the United States and South Africa. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.|$|E
40|$|The problem being faced is {{that there}} exists little data in a {{collective}} location surrounding aviation gasolines. In recent years {{it has been observed}} that most involved in the general aviation community are unaware of efforts and solutions underway to replace current <b>leaded</b> aviation <b>gasoline.</b> The point of this research was to collect and distill the history of aviation gasoline, some alternatives and their shortcomings, and indicate where the industry is headed.

Removal of [...] of contaminated soil, at a projected cost of $426,938 has been proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The soil would be removed from an area that used to contain five 25,000-gallon underground storage tanks reportedly used to store <b>leaded,</b> high-octane aviation <b>gasoline</b> had been previously removed. The area, known as site 8 and located some 1500 ft from residential areas, was formerly used for flight-line fueling operations in the early 1940s.|$|R
25|$|Cars with {{diesel engines}} are not popular in Russia, {{accounting}} for just 7.6% of all sales as of 2015, compared {{to half of}} the market in much of Western Europe. There are 145,000 natural gas vehicles in Russia as of 2016, or 0.3% of all vehicles in the country. The sale of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> was outlawed in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{countries}} in the world have phased out automotive leaded fuel. In 2011 six countries were still using leaded gasoline: Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea, Algeria, Iraq and Yemen. It was expected {{that by the end of}} 2013 those countries would ban <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> but it has not occurred. Algeria will replace leaded with unleaded automotive fuel only in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Policies {{to manage}} lead differ between nations, {{particularly}} between the {{developed and developing}} world. Use of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> has been reduced or eliminated in most developed nations, and lead levels in US children have been substantially reduced by policies relating to lead reduction. Even slightly elevated lead levels around the age of 24 months are associated with intellectual and academic performance deficits at age 10 years.|$|E
40|$|Flying {{in a small}} piston-engine plane bears little {{resemblance}} to flying in a commercial jet. There are no lines at the airport, no baggage checks, and often less legroom once you duck inside the cabin. You can feel every bump in the tarmac as the plane heads down the runway, every rumble of the engine. Once you are aloft there’s no denying the improbability of flight; the low cruising altitude offers detailed views of the land passing below. The experience is more like traveling in an airborne car than in the insulated cocoon of an airliner. For passengers like this writer, it’s also much more fun. There’s another less obvious difference. Unlike commercial jets, which use kerosene-based jet fuel, piston-engine aircraft still mostly run on <b>leaded</b> aviation <b>gasoline,</b> or avgas. In fact, avgas {{is one of the}} few fuels in the United States that still contain lead, 1 leaving it the single largest source of lead emissions in the country, according to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 2, 3 Concern over the health effects of lead has sparked a contentious effort to finally get the lead out of avgas—something the aviation and petroleum industries have been attempting for more than two decades, to no avail...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact that}} natural gas imports could have on fuel emissions in northern Mexico. We discuss the problem created in the 1980 s when a shift from natural gas to residual oil in industrial processes increased emissions of air pollutants significantly. The benefits of substituting <b>leaded</b> for unleaded <b>gasoline</b> in the 1990 s are discussed also. In July 1992 the Mexican government announced {{for the first time}} since oil nationalization that private companies in Mexico are allowed to directly import natural gas. The transportation of natural gas, however, remains reserved only for Pemex, the national oil company. This opens the possibility of reducing the burning of high-sulphur residual oil in both the industrial and the energy production sectors in Mexico, particularly in the northern region where only 6. 7 % of the of the country's natural gas is produced. Natural gas imports have also opened the possibility of using compressed natural gas (CNG) in vehicles in northern Mexico. ...|$|R
25|$|Spirits were marketed in Mexico. They were badged as Chryslers {{rather than}} Dodges, since the Dodge brand {{at the time}} was used only on trucks. The Spirit was {{introduced}} in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5L engine operating on <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> equipped with a carburetor, a tubular exhaust header, and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's U.S.-market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late-1970s.|$|E
25|$|Power {{comes from}} {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
25|$|As a {{gasoline}} (petrol) additive, benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when tetraethyl lead replaced {{it as the}} most widely used antiknock additive. With the global phaseout of <b>leaded</b> <b>gasoline,</b> benzene has made a comeback as {{a gasoline}} additive in some nations. In the United States, concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%. European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.|$|E
40|$|Deterioration {{and repair}} of lead paint on steel {{structures}} {{can result in}} contamination of the ambient environment but other sources of lead such as from past use of <b>leaded</b> paint and <b>gasoline</b> and industrial activities can also con- tribute to the contamination. Using a combination of high precision lead isotopic tracing, detailed paint examina- tion, including with scanning electron microscopy, and soil deconstruction we have compared paint on a steel bridge and bulk soil and lead-rich particles separated from soil. The majority of Pb found in the paint derives from Australian sources but some also has a probable US origin. The isotopic data for the bulk soils and selected particles lie on a mixing line with end members the geologically ancient Broken Hill lead and possible European lead which is suggested {{to be derived from}} old lead paint and industrial activities. Data for gasoline-derived par- ticulates lie on this array and probably contribute to soil Pb. Although paint from the bridge can be a source of lead in the soils, isotopic tracing, paint morphology and mineralogical identification indicate that other sources, in- cluding from paint, gasoline and industrial activities, are contributing factors to the lead burden. Even though physical characteristics and elemental composition are the same in some particles, the isotopic signatures dem- onstrate that the sources are different. Plots using 206 Pb/ 208 Pb vs 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios, the common representation these days, do not allow for source discrimination in this investigation...|$|R

[...] The optional Pistol-Grip 4-speed Hurst manual shifter could be coupled to the 340, 400, and 440 Magnum engines. The Ramcharger hood scoop was discontinued, as well as optional lower geared performance rear axle ratios and extra heavy duty suspensions.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} toxicological studies, both {{experimental and}} epidemiological, {{that appeared in}} international literature in the period 1990 - 1997 and included both <b>leaded</b> and unleaded <b>gasolines</b> {{as well as their}} components and additives. The aim of this overview was to select, arrange, and present references of scientific papers published during the period under consideration and to summarize the data in order to give a comprehensive picture of the results of toxicological studies performed in laboratory animals (including carcinogenic, teratogenic, or embryotoxic activity), mutagenicity and genotoxic aspects in mammalian and bacterial systems, and epidemiological results obtained in humans in relation to gasoline exposure. This paper draws attention to the inherent difficulties in assessing with precision any potential adverse effects on health, that is, the risk of possible damage to man and his environment from gasoline. The difficulty of risk assessment still exists {{despite the fact that the}} studies examined are definitely more technically valid than those of earlier years. The uncertainty in overall risk determination from gasoline exposure also derives from the conflicting results of different studies, from the lack of a correct scientific approach in some studies, from the variable characteristics of the different gasoline mixtures, and from the difficulties of correctly handling potentially confounding variables related to lifestyle (e. g., cigarette smoking, drug use) or to preexisting pathological conditions. In this respect, this paper highlights the need for accurately assessing the conclusive explanations reported in scientific papers so as to avoid the spread of inaccurate or misleading information on gasoline toxicity in nonscientific papers and in mass-media messages...|$|R
