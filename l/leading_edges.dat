Upon the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of its faired main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942.

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> it was clarified by comparison that different <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> compared to a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> respectively. That is, the semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> or elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> employed in a centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength. This paper aims to provide the reference significance the structural optimization and reliability improvement of a large flow centrifugal compressor...|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> is {{so highly}} swept, this <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> {{separation}} develops into a vortex structure which rolls around the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and eventually sits over the upper surface (as on a delta wing aircraft). This mechanism {{is enhanced by}} making the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the aerofoil in this region relatively sharp.|$|R
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|The thorax of the {{butterfly}} {{is devoted to}} locomotion. Each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs). The second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings. The <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins. The forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts. The front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.|$|E

5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E
5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and high wing loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E

The new spar structure of the Tempest V also allowed up to 2,000lb (907kg) of external stores to be carried underneath the wings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for designing the compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with composite material is proposed {{based on the}} topology optimization. Firstly, an equivalent constitutive relationship of laminated glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plates has been built based on the symmetric laminated plate theory. Then, an optimization objective function of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was used to minimize the least square error (LSE) between deformed curve and desired aerodynamics shape. After that, the topology structures of wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of different glass fiber ply-orientations were obtained by using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model and sensitivity filtering technique. The desired aerodynamics shape of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was obtained based on the proposed approach. The topology structures of wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> depend on the glass fiber ply-orientation. Finally, the corresponding morphing experiment of compliant wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with composite materials was implemented, which verified the morphing capability of topology structure and illustrated the feasibility for designing compliant wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> The present paper lays the basis of ply-orientation optimization for compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap and locking and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap and locking and releasing mechanism, a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R

50|$|A {{hinged flap}} which folds {{out from under}} the wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> while not forming a part of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing when retracted. This {{increases}} the camber and thickness of the wing, which in turn increases lift and drag. This {{is not the same as}} a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> droop flap, as that is formed from the entire <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Invented by Werner Krüger in 1943 and evaluated in Goettingen, Krueger flaps are found on many modern swept wing airliners.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{spanwise}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing, {{a means of}} controlling the position and strength of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, is analyzed by numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Thin-Layer Navier Stokes equations. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet is simulated by defining a permeable boundary, corresponding to the jet slot, where suitable boundary conditions are implemented. Numerical results agree favorably with experimental measurements. It is found {{that the use of}} spanwise <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing not only magnifies the size and strength of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, but also moves the vortex cores outboard and upward. As a result, the increase in lift comes primarily from the greater nonlinear vortex lift. The presence of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet stream displaces the flow outboard, thereby increasing the effective aspect ratio of the delta wing. However, blowing causes earlier vortex breakdown, thus decreasing the stall angle...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data show}} that the {{phenomenon}} of a separation induced <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex {{is influenced by the}} wing thickness and the shape of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Both thickness and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shape (rounded rather than point) delay the formation of a vortex. Existing computer programs used to predict the effect of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex do not include a procedure for determining whether or not a vortex actually exists. Studies under NASA Contract NAS 1 - 15678 have shown that the vortex development can be predicted by using the relationship between the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> suction coefficient and the parabolic nose drag. The linear theory FLEXSTAB was used to calculate the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> suction coefficient. This report describes the development of a method for calculating <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> suction using the capabilities of the higher order panel methods (exact boundary conditions). For a two dimensional case, numerical methods were developed using the double strength and downwash distribution along the chord. A Gaussian quadrature formula that directly incorporates the logarithmic singularity in the downwash distribution, at all panel edges, was found to be the best method...|$|R

25|$|Although not {{designated}} a stealth fighter, measures {{were taken to}} reduce the Typhoon's radar cross section (RCS), especially from the frontal aspect. An example of these measures is that the Typhoon has jet inlets that conceal {{the front of the}} jet engine (a strong radar target) from radar. Many important potential radar targets, such as the wing, canard and fin <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> are highly swept, so will reflect radar energy well away from the front sector. Some external weapons are mounted semi-recessed into the aircraft, partially shielding these missiles from incoming radar waves. In addition radar-absorbent materials (RAM), developed primarily by EADS/DASA, coat many of the most significant reflectors, such as the wing <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> the intake edges and interior, the rudder surrounds, and strakes.|$|E
50|$|However, since a round <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> {{decreases}} an airfoil's {{susceptibility to}} flow separation, a sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> {{implies that the}} airfoil will {{be more sensitive to}} changes in angle of attack. Therefore, to increase lift at lower speeds, aircraft that employ supersonic airfoils also use high-lift devices such as <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and trailing edge flaps.|$|R
