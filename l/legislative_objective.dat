Using national data from the 2003 – 4 School and Staffing Survey, we found that charter schools attained these <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives</b> when compared with regular schools, although increases in teacher influence and school autonomy were modest. Although charter schools have been implemented much as intended by legislation, other {{research has shown that}} charter schools in general have not improved student achievement—a major objective of charter school legislation.

25|$|On August 11, 2015, Lessig {{announced}} that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by Labor Day 2015. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access. As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary <b>legislative</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Rothstein J then {{considered}} {{whether the}} provision minimally impaired the impugned right {{to freedom of}} expression.

However, any claimant seeking action under the Securities Act will be able to successfully use only one.|$|E

5000|$|Next, Rothstein J {{considered}} {{whether the}} section 14(1)(b) limitation on free expression was rationally {{connected to the}} legislation's purpose.

40|$|Private {{activities}} and government regulatory actions or inaction can have {{impacts on the}} environment and on human health. Scientific uncertainty about such impacts compounds the problems that confront policymakers. In environmental and natural resource management areas subject to scientific uncertainty, policy development can be enhanced by clarifying precautionary decision making processes, {{and the role of the}} Precautionary Principle itself. There is widespread confusion about the meaning and influence of the many versions of the Precautionary Principle. The most widely adopted versions, based on the United Nations’ ‘Rio definition’, seek to ensure that uncertainty about potentially serious hazards does not justify ignoring them. More prescriptive versions can mandate precautionary action without recourse to an assessment of the costs and benefits. Importantly, precautionary measures can be adopted without reference to the Precautionary Principle where, for instance, <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives</b> relating to ecological sustainability and human health apply. The versions of the Principle adopted in Australia, which reflect the ‘Rio definition’, permit precautionary measures but do not specify the nature or the extent of precaution to be applied. Decision makers therefore apply precaution through risk management frameworks that take account of uncertainty. Efficient and effective implementation of precaution requires decision makers to take account of the full range of relevant factors, including the magnitude, nature and severity of potential harm, as well as the economic, social, environmental, and health costs and benefits. Two case studies – fisheries management and licensing of releases of genetically modified organisms – illustrate how precaution has been applied in Australia. The different risk management frameworks adopted reflect variations in <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives,</b> knowledge bases, and types of hazards. Confusion about the role of the Precautionary Principle may have contributed to public and industry dissatisfaction with some precautionary decisions. Decision makers are improving the transparency and accountability of their processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} that this paper addresses is whether age discrimination laws are justified {{for the protection}} of older workers from a societal and economic point of view.

Both the positive and negative impacts of the ADEA on older workers and cost efficiency objectives of employers are evaluated. Despite certain of its limitations in protecting older workers and increase in costs to employers, the enactment of the ADEA has been instrumental in initiating policies that address the changing demographic of an aging workforce and prompting a transformation in human resource practices towards older workers...|$|R

Shapiro in 1978 pointed out that Rehnquist had avoided joining rational basis determinations for years, except in one case, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld. Rehnquist eschewed the Court majority's approach to equal protection, writing in dissent in Trimble v.

40|$|Privacy {{legislation}} in the United States is distributed throughout separate documents that empower different federal authorities to regulate industry. Federal authorities in turn develop corresponding regulations intended to ensure that organizations satisfy <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives.</b> Organizations in regulated industries (e. g. healthcare and financial institutions) face significant challenges when developing policies and systems that are properly aligned with relevant privacy regulations. We analyze privacy regulations derived from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that affect information sharing practices and consumer privacy in healthcare systems. Our analysis shows specific natural language semantics that formally characterize rights, obligations, and the meaningful relationships between them required to build value into systems. Furthermore, we evaluate semantics for rules and constraints necessary to develop machine-enforceable policies that bridge between laws, policies, practices, and system requirements. We believe {{the results of our}} analysis will benefit legislators, regulators and policy and system developers by focusing their attention on natural language policy semantics that are implementable in software systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} ways that the Commissioner of Taxation may {{indirectly}} obtain priority over unsecured creditors. This {{is contrary to the}} principle of pari passu, a principle endorsed by the 1988 Harmer Report as one that is a fundamental objective of the law of insolvency. As the law and practice of Australia's taxation regime evolves, the law is being drafted {{in a manner that is}} inconsistent with the principle of pari passu. The natural consequence of this development is that it places at risk the capacity of corporate and bankruptcy laws to coexist and cooperate with taxation laws. This article posits that undermining the consistency of Commonwealth <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives</b> is undesirable.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{has continued}} to generate unpleasant challenges for health and eco-nomic development in Nigeria. Some of these problems include deforestation, pollution, global warming and improper pesticides. Despite environmental laws and policies targeted at ameli-orating these problems, the situation in Nigeria seems degenerating owing {{to the fact that}} these laws are not effectively enforced. This paper analyzes the use of environmental laws by different enforcement agencies in Nigeria, the methods of enforcement these agencies invoke, and the chal-lenges they face in enforcing the relevant laws. These challenges include low-level constitutional provision for environmental protection, roles and conflicts in environmental management, undue adherence to legalism by the courts and absence of mandatory disclosure of information. Thus, the <b>legislative</b> <b>objectives</b> remain unachieved because enforcement is superficial; excessive time exists between non-compliance and enforcement; available punishment for non-compliance is inade-quate; injured parties are not properly compensated; and some environmental crimes receive administrative instead of remedial measures or criminal punishments.
