40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} assess the degree of <b>lead</b> <b>absorption</b> by lead workers 19 of Versenate was given orally and lead {{concentration}} determined in early morning specimens of urine collected {{before and after the}} dose. In non-exposed workers only small increases of lead concentration (up to 80 !Jog/I) were found after Versenate. Increasing concentrations of urine lead were found after Versenate in men in whom standard tests for <b>lead</b> <b>absorption</b> showed increasing degrees of absorption. Levels of urine lead up to 1500 !Jog/l were found in men who were judged by other criteria as fit to continue working whereas when the standard tests showed excessive absorption the lead excretion post Versenate exceeded 1760 !Jog/I. The results of this test (the Versenate provocation test) were reproducible when it was carried out on twelve men at weekly intervals.
