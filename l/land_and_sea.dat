5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan issued <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> warnings. The Tainan City Government {{and three}} county governments closed for one day. All {{domestic}} flights to offshore islands were canceled, and rail service was interrupted. Later, airlines canceled 12flights in Japan {{due to the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, {{probably}} in the reign of Theophilos, stretching from the junction of the <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both this wall and the gate were demolished in 1868.|$|E

5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea,</b> in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Charles I of Naples {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Split and Šibenik against Omiš pirates in June and September 1274. The citizens of Omiš responded by {{an alliance with}} Venice in August, in accordance with a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and Semen. This triggered conflict on the <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea.</b> Sterling had {{a light and}} a heavy attack, which could be {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> targets. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E

5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold {{and the lack of}} provisions.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{launched}} his attack on November 16. He led an assault from three sides: the north, east and south. Tides in the Harlem River prevented some troops from landing and delayed the attack. When the British moved against the defenses, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. Patriot {{forces on the}} north side offered stiff resistance to the Hessian attack, but they too were eventually overwhelmed. With the fort surrounded by <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea,</b> Colonel Magaw chose to surrender. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 were taken as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In early 31BC, Antony and Cleopatra were {{temporarily}} {{stationed in}} Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the Adriatic Sea {{under the command}} of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and marched south. Trapped on <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea,</b> deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to codify, {{preserve}} and pass on the lessons of warfare at <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> from past experience, {{through the use of}} military manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{irregular}} parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik {{consists of}} four strong fortresses at its most significant points. To the north is the strong circular Minčeta Tower, and to {{the east side of}} the city port is the Revelin Fortress. The western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, and the strong, freestanding, St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as Lovrijenac), protects the western side of the city from possible <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> assaults. The large and complex St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.|$|E
5|$|The swift {{spread of}} Islam across Western Asia and North Africa {{encouraged}} an unprecedented growth in trade and travel by <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> {{as far away}} as Southeast Asia, China, much of Africa, Scandinavia and even Iceland. Geographers worked to create increasingly accurate maps of the known world, starting from many existing but fragmentary sources. Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (850–934), founder of the Balkhī school of cartography in Baghdad, wrote an atlas called Figures of the Regions (Suwar al-aqalim).|$|E

5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea,</b> pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea</b> walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June, the French bombarded {{the fort}} from <b>land</b> <b>and</b> <b>sea.</b> The fort's {{garrison}} fought back, and its commander, Rechberg, managed {{to bring in}} more ammunition from Floriana. On 12 June, the bombardment of the fort continued, but by then the French had captured Valletta, Floriana, and Fort Manoel. The Maltese militia left the fort, reducing its garrison to 80 men. By the end of the day, the ammunition had run out, and parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment. When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape, the French captured them, and the fort was in French hands by 13 June.|$|E
