40|$|Native {{trees and}} fruit have great {{importance}} in culture of small centers and rural areas, as well as, homemade liqueurs. However, some strategies such as marketing research are necessary to help for products development or even modifications to existing products. The objective was to know the habits related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages and to evaluate the consumer's interest about fruit liqueurs, {{as well as to}} develop and standardize and characterize a pineapple liqueur, besides assessing the sensorial characteristics of the same. The most of the interviewees do not have the habit of consuming fruit <b>liqueurs,</b> <b>with</b> beer being the preferred alcoholic beverage. Interest in trying a fruit liqueur was almost unanimous among respondents demonstrating the existence of a niche market for fruit liqueur. Consumers testing had no significant difference between all attributes, but it was being observed well-acceptance for all formulations with scores ranging from 6. 80 to 7. 20 and different concentrations of pineapple do not interfere with the sensorial characteristics of the product. Thus, it was concluded that the production of pineapple <b>liqueurs</b> <b>with</b> lower levels of fruit (30 %) are accepted and contribute to the economy of production. </p...|$|R
