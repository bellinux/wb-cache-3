5|$|RAD {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{researched}} and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity</b> about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.|$|E

5|$|The legal {{responsibility}} for recreational diving service providers is usually limited {{as far as}} possible by waivers which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational buddy divers is unclear and {{has been the subject of}} considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity,</b> buddy diving is recommended by recreational diver training agencies as safer than solo diving, and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying there was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity</b> over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he {{did not ask for}} clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity</b> about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between role stress, emotional exhaustion, and a supportive coworker climate among health care workers, by adopting a multilevel perspective. Methods: Aggregated data of 738 health care workers nested within 67 teams of two Italian hospitals were collected. Multilevel regression analysis with a random intercept model was used. Results: Hierarchical linear modeling showed that a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> role <b>clarity</b> was significantly linked to emotional exhaustion at the individual level. At the unit level, the cross-level interaction revealed that a supportive coworker climate moderated the relationship between <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> role <b>clarity</b> and emotional exhaustion. Conclusion: This study supports previous results of single-level burnout studies, extending the existing literature with evidence on the multidimensional and cross-level interaction associations of a supportive coworker climate as a key aspect of job resources on burnout...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to determine which job characteristics are associated with burnout and 2) to determine the mediating role of negative work-home interference (WHI) in the relationship between job characteristics and burnout within a nursing environment. Random samples (n = 300) were taken of nurses working in the Johannesburg, Klerksdorp, Krugersdorp, Pretoria and Potchefstroom areas. The results of the regression analyses indicated that the main job characteristics that predict exhaustion were pressure and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, role <b>clarity,</b> colleague support and financial support. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> role <b>clarity,</b> colleague support and financial support were the main job characteristics that predict mental distance. Negative WHI played a partially mediating role in the relationship between job characteristics and burnout...|$|R

25|$|Although India House had stated {{its goals}} in The Indian Sociologist, the threat {{arising from the}} {{organisation}} was initially not considered serious by either Indian intelligence or British Special Branch. This was compounded by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity</b> and communication from the Department of Criminal Intelligence operating in India under Charles Cleveland, and Scotland Yard's Special Branch. Lack of direction and information from Indian political intelligence, compounded by Lord Morley's reluctance to engage in postal censorship, led to Special Branch underestimating the threat.|$|E

40|$|Persian {{architecture}} is characterised by shapes and patterns, {{which can be}} analysed through mathematical models. Beside 2 D patterns, many of the traditional geometric ornaments are realised on 3 D surfaces such as domes or vaults. Literature mainly addresses the 3 D problem {{by means of a}} 2 D scheme, which is an important and synthetic representation but is not exhaustive and <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarity.</b> This paper proposes a framework based on the integration of 2 D drawings, as in the traditional approach, and a photogrammetric 3 D model based on a sample of standard resolution images (tourist pictures). The framework is tested on a muqarnas, a characteristic Persian ornament, in order to study and analyse its modular design and hierarchy of elements. As a case study, the entrance iwan of the Shah Mosque in Isfahan, Iran, is considered. The result is a link between the 3 D patterns and the geometry of architectural elements, which completes and overcomes their schematic 2 D representation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to assess and review {{fixed-line}} telecom customers' perception of the quality of after-sales services provided by Ethiopian Telecom. Design/methodology/approach – The paper was conducted on telecom customers who are in Addis Ababa using self-administered questionnaires sent to a sample of 450 respondents. In addition to this, interviews were conducted with managers and selected employees to provide supporting data. The data were processed, analyzed and interpreted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Findings – The results show some degree of customer dissatisfaction, but not to the extent expected. Dissatisfied customers point at <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarities</b> <b>of</b> bills and delays in making decisions on complaints as some of the main reasons for their dissatisfactions. Other reasons include telephone interruptions during rainy seasons, old cables and networks, and damaged and stolen cables, which combined, increase the frequency of faults and interruptions. Nearly 40 percent of respondents have negative assessments of the role of employees in delivering good quality after-sales service. Practical implications – Despite the fact that some improvements have been shown in recent reports, Ethiopian Telecom has a long way to go in achieving its objectives with respect to customers' satisfaction. Originality/value – Previous studies on telecommunication in Africa have not focused on service delivery and customer satisfaction. The paper, therefore, contributes to filling a research gap in telecommunication studies in Africa in general and in Ethiopia in particular.

40|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>clarities</b> in {{estimating}} the residual stress {{threat to the}} structural integrity has led to conservative assumptions in the current design of welds. The complexities become more {{in the case of}} multiaxial loading of welded structure, considering fracture or fatigue. To what extent the residual stresses influence the performance of a welded structure, depends on how stable they are under service loads. Finite element analyses are used here to describe the development of welding residual stresses in tubular joints and their relaxation under multiaxial loading. It is observed that the effect of the torsion load is more significant than the effect of tension load in releasing of the residual stresses. For pure tensile loading, the relaxation of the residual stresses are negligible as long as the applied load is lower than 50 % of the yield strength of the material. For a combined tension-torsion loading of 75 % of the yield strength, the residual stresses are almost completely released, and in the weld zone they become compressive...|$|R
