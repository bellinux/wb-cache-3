40|$|The {{behavior}} <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> used in hoisting is {{not well}} understood. In an effort to improve this understanding, the structure <b>of</b> round-strand wire <b>ropes</b> was analyzed. This report provides a generalized mathematical model that completely describes the geometry of the wires. It consists of two sets of vector equations and is valid for any round-strand wire <b>rope.</b> One set <b>of</b> equations is used to trace the paths of wires that have {{the form of a}} single helix; the other is used for the paths of double helical wires. The specific model for a 33 -mm 6 X 19 Seale, independent wire rope core (IWRC), right regular lay wire rope was presented as an example. The paths and the geometric properties of the wires, which include the path length per <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> strand, the curvature, and the torsion, were determined from this model. The effects of strain deformation were analyzed, resulting in a system of equations for determining the structural parameters <b>of</b> the deformed <b>rope.</b> In future work, the model could be used to analyze wire <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> different constructions so that a more scientifically based understanding <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> behavior can be established.

50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types <b>of</b> stranded <b>ropes</b> only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The <b>lay</b> direction <b>of</b> the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the <b>lay</b> direction <b>of</b> the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> is called ordinary lay rope if the <b>lay</b> direction <b>of</b> the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the <b>lay</b> <b>of</b> the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|R

The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R
