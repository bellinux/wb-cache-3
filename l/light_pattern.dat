40|$|Image-based relighting (IBL) {{has become}} a popular {{research}} topic in both computer graphics and signal processing. IBL is the technique that renders images of a scene under different lighting conditions without prior knowledge of the object geometry and surface properties in the scene. Simply put, IBL collects images of the scene under all possible lighting conditions and process these images to render {{an image of the}} scene under a new lighting condition. To be practical, IBL strives {{to reduce the number of}} images that need to be captured, and most IBL algorithms do so by estimating the surface reflectance function (SRF) of the scene, which represents the response of each pixel in the scene to lighting from various directions. IBL hence becomes the problem of estimating the SRF using a number of <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> to illuminate the scene. To minimize the number of <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> needed, we propose to use a statistical approach, principal component analysis (PCA), and show that the most efficient <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> should be the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the SRFs, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In addition, we show that discrete cosine transform (DCT) -based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> perform as well as the optimal PCA-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> for typical SRFs, especially for scenes with Lambertian surfaces. Both the PCA-based and the DCT-based methods outperform existing IBL algorithms with fewer <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|With {{image-based}} relighting (IBL), one can render realistic relit {{images of}} a scene without prior knowledge of object geometry in the scene. However, traditional IBL methods require {{a large number of}} basis images, each corresponding to a <b>lighting</b> <b>pattern,</b> to estimate the surface reflectance function (SRF) of the scene. In this paper, we present a statistical approach to estimating the SRF which requires fewer basis images. We formulate the SRF estimation problem in a signal reconstruction framework. We use the principal component analysis (PCA, [1]) to show that the most effective <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> for the data acquisition process are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the SRFs, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. In addition, we show that for typical SRFs, especially when the objects have Lambertian surfaces, DCT-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns</b> perform as well as the optimal PCA-based <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns.</b> We compare SRF estimation performance of the statistical approach with traditional IBL techniques. Experimental results show that the statistical approach can achieve better performance with fewer basis images. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an automated approach to correcting for colour inconsistency in underwater images collected from multiple perspectives during {{the construction of}} 3 D structure-from-motion models. When capturing images underwater, the water column imposes several effects on images that are negligible in air such as colour-dependant attenuation and <b>lighting</b> <b>patterns.</b> These effects cause problems for human interpretation of images and also confound computer-based techniques for clustering and classification. Our approach exploits the 3 D structure of the scene generated using structure-from-motion and photogrammetry techniques accounting for distance-based attenuation, vignetting and <b>lighting</b> <b>pattern,</b> and improves the consistency of photo-textured 3 D models. Results are presented using imagery collected in two different underwater environments using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). I...|$|R
