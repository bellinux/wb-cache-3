40|$|Abstract: Pavement design methods {{assume that}} the tire-pavement contact stress {{is equal to the}} tire {{inflation}} pressure and is uniformly distributed in the vertical direction over the contact area. However, because of these assumptions, this uniform stress model does not correctly estimate pavement surface strains, which are used to determine the top-down fatigue cracking. To precisely account for the actual contact stress, this paper evaluates the transverse <b>strains</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strains</b> at the pavement surface by applying measured 3 -D non-uniform stresses. Critical strains due to 3 -D stresses are compared to those caused by the uniform stress. Results show that critical tensile strains develop at the edge or {{in the vicinity of the}} contact area.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{obtain a}} more {{detailed}} description of the stress-free state of the intestinal wall, <b>longitudinal</b> residual <b>strain</b> measurements are needed. Furthermore, data on longitudinal stress-strain relations in visceral organs are scarce. The present study aims to investigate the <b>longitudinal</b> residual <b>strain</b> and the <b>longitudinal</b> stress-strain relationship in the rat small intestine. Methods The longitudinal zero-stress state was obtained by cutting tissue strips parallel to the longitudinal axis of the intestine. The longitudinal residual stress was characterized by a bending angle (unit: degrees per unit length and positive when bending outwards). Residual strain was computed from the change in dimensions between the zero-stress state and the no-load state. <b>Longitudinal</b> stresses and <b>strains</b> were computed from stretch experiments in the distal ileum at luminal pressures ranging from 0 – 4 cmH 2 O. Results Large morphometric variations were found between the duodenum and ileum with the largest wall thickness and wall area in the duodenum and the largest inner circumference and luminal area in the distal ileum (p 0. 5). The <b>longitudinal</b> residual <b>strain</b> was tensile at the serosal surface and compressive at the mucosal surface. Hence, the neutral axis was approximately in the mid-wall. The <b>longitudinal</b> residual <b>strain</b> and the bending angle was not uniform around the intestinal circumference and had the highest values on the mesenteric sides (p α constant increased with the pressure, indicating the intestinal wall became stiffer in longitudinal direction when pressurized. Conclusion Large <b>longitudinal</b> residual <b>strains</b> reside in the small intestine and showed circumferential variation. This indicates that the tissue is not uniform and cannot be treated as a homogenous material. The longitudinal stiffness of the intestinal wall increased with luminal pressure. <b>Longitudinal</b> residual <b>strains</b> {{must be taken into account}} in studies of gastrointestinal biomechanical properties. </p...|$|R

40|$|Chain-die forming {{is a new}} {{sheet metal}} forming {{technology}} proposed which has the capability to fabricate advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) variable cross-section profiles. The existing research reveals that the control of <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain</b> and web-warping are two significant issues which determine {{the success of the}} fabrication of AHSS variable cross-section profiles. In this paper, both analytical and numerical methods are employed to analyse the <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain</b> and web-warping in Chain-die-formed AHSS sections with variable widths. By contrast to the existing analytical modelling in regards to flexible roll forming of irregular profiles, in this study, as Chain-die forming can be considered a continuous stamping process, the analytical models are purely established on the basis of geometric relationships between the pre-cut sheet and forming tools. In theory, no <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain,</b> id est maximum web-warping, could occur. No web-warping, id est maximum <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain,</b> could also arise. The real situation is included between such two extremes, and they are strongly dependent on some critical geometric parameters of the pre-cut sheet and forming tools. This is seen to be consistent with the simulation and experimental results. Subsequently, due to different forming mechanisms and loading processes, the severity and characteristics of the <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain</b> and web-warping of chain-die-formed AHSS sections with variable widths show distinct differences compared with those of flexible-rolled-formed profiles. Finally, Chain-die forming has been further proved to maximally reserve the material’s elongation as the redundant deformation is almost avoided during the forming process. This study provides an effective mathematical expression to analyse and predict <b>longitudinal</b> plastic <b>strain</b> and web-warping of chain-die-formed AHSS variable cross-section profiles. It is expected to be useful to tooling designers to quickly assess the severity of a Chain-die forming process in the tooling design stage in order to shorten the tooling development time...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether subendocardial and transmural myocardial infarction {{can be identified}} and differentiated using the peak circumferential and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strains</b> measured by fast strain-encoded (SENC). Methods: Nineteen patients with ischemic heart diseases underwent imaging with fast SENC and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI at 3 T. Fast SENC measurements were performed in three short-axis slices (basal, mid-ventricular and apical levels) and one long-axis view (four-chamber) to assess peak longitudinal and circumferential systolic strains. Results: All patients showed myocardial infarction {{with an average of}} 7 positive LGE segments. A total of 304 segments for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strains</b> (LS) and 114 segments for circumferential strains (CS) could be analysed. Positive LGE segments showed lower peak CS and LS compared with the no-LGE segments (P < 0. 0001 for both). Segments with subendocardial infarction showed reduced CS and LS compared with the no-LGE segments (P < 0. 0001 for both). There was a significant difference in CS between subendocardial and transmural infarct segments (P = 0. 03), but no significant difference in LS between them (P = 0. 64).

50|$|Most fishes bend as a simple, {{homogenous}} beam during swimming via contractions of longitudinal red {{muscle fibers}} and obliquely oriented white muscle fibers within the segmented axial musculature. The fiber strain (εf) {{experienced by the}} longitudinal red muscle fibers {{is equivalent to the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> (εx). The deeper white muscle fibers fishes show diversity in arrangement. These fibers are organized into cone-shaped structures and attach to connective tissue sheets known as myosepta; each fiber shows a characteristic dorsoventral (α) and mediolateral (φ) trajectory. The segmented architecture theory predicts that, εx > εf. This phenomenon results in an architectural gear ratio, determined as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> divided by fiber strain (εx / εf), greater than one and longitudinal velocity amplification; furthermore, this emergent velocity amplification may be augmented by variable architectural gearing via mesolateral and dorsoventral shape changes, a pattern seen in pennate muscle contractions.

5000|$|Strain {{in three}} dimensions: Basically, any object or body is three dimensional, {{and can be}} {{deformed}} in different directions simultaneously. Strain {{can be described as}} a tensor with three principal strains (εx, εy and εz in a Cartesian coordinate system), and six shear strains components. In the heart, it has been customary to describe the three principal strain components as longitudinal (in the direction of the long axis of the ventricles), circumferential (in the direction of the ventricular circumference), and transmural (the deformation across the wall. Transmural deformation has also been called [...] "radial", but this is unfortunate as in ultrasound in general the term radial describes [...] "in the direction of the ultrasound beam"). However, as the heart muscle is incompressible, the three principal strain must balance; (εx + εy + εz = 1. As the ventricle contracts in systole, there is longitudinal shortening (negative strain), circumferential shortening (negative strain) and transmural (wall) thickening (positive strain). Due to this, {{and the fact that the}} left ventricle in normal conditions contract with a relatively invariant outer contour, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> contains the main information, while transmural strain (wall thickening) is a function of wall shortening, wall thickness and chamber diameter, while circumferential shortening is mainly a function of wall thickening.
