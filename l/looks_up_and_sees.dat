As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E

60|$|Bennet {{has come}} down very quietly. Fanny, from where he stands, {{is the only one}} who sees him. He stands looking at her, his features, as ever, immovable. At sight of him her eyes and mouth open wider and wider. The words die away from her tongue. Vernon has turned away to put a log on the fire, and so has not seen her expression-- only hears her sudden silence. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Bennet.|$|E
6000|$|Upward and southward ever: but whither, who can tell? They hardly {{think of}} the whither; but go like sleep-walkers, shaken out of one land of dreams, only to find {{themselves}} in another and stranger one. All around is fantastic and unearthly; now each man starts as he sees the figures of his fellows, clothed {{from head to foot}} in golden filigree; <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the yellow moonlight through the fronds of the huge tree-ferns overhead, as through a cloud of glittering lace.

There he sat--this tall, fair chap {{who had been in the}} place so long--with his big pocket-book on the table in front of him, and even from where I was I could see that there was a great pile of bank-notes sticking out from it.
