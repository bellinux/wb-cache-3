500|$|Lori Grimes accuses Andrea of {{participating}} {{very little in}} household tasks. Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, {{a few days before the}} song's radio and digital release.|$|E
500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This is definitely not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E
50|$|Trump stated he {{had liked}} both Charmaine and Tarek and thought them both {{intelligent}} with a <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> for them, but {{felt it was}} too obvious that they both had to go, since they both made far too many errors to continue the process.|$|R

But I've {{no doubt of}} this--if you were to tie her up with ropes ever so, I don't in the least doubt but what she'd get out." [...] Archie was awe-struck, and made two or three strokes after this but then he plucked up his courage and asked a question--"Where do you suppose they get it from, Doodles?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the band conducted on August 22, 2010 guitarist Brendt Allman answered a question about the probability of touring again after the European dates as follows: [...] "It's tough to say because there's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people's lives, but if we can do it once, we can probably do it twice." ...|$|R

50|$|While these central {{characters}} {{go about}} their goals, the town of Devarakonda itself has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on: the village panchayat which seldom takes care of its own people, a thriving 7 seater auto business run corruptly, with the conspirators in this case being two influential people in the town.|$|E
5000|$|Reasons for loss: Although {{they loved}} Cyndi's {{idea for the}} celebrity room and liked the {{pictures}} Bret took of New York, the team made the apartment look cheaper than Zen, there were <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on inside the apartment, and frankly the executives really disliked the master bedroom that has the color [...] "seafoam green".|$|E
50|$|The Love of {{the title}} is much more about love of {{mathematics}} than love of another person, as Frenkel provides a detailed story {{of what it is}} like to fall in love with mathematics, then pursue this deeply, ending up doing mathematics at the highest level. Along the way, there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> different <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in the book, all of them quite interesting.|$|R
5000|$|Coppinger {{admitted}} in 2015 that when Exeter were relegated, {{he was very}} close to quitting football. He said: “I had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> negative <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in my life. I had a fear of failing - and also a fear of success. The way I was going and the way I was thinking, before I met Terry a motivational speaker, {{it was only a matter}} of time before I came out of football.” ...|$|R
5000|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, guitarist the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. The separation had a major effect {{on the development of}} the song, as Bono channelled their pain into the lyrics. Bono said [...] "there were <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> other <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on internally within the band and outside it, and I was working through all of that", noting that the Edge's separation from Aislinn was just one component of that. Thematically the song is about unrequited love, jealousy, obsession, and possessiveness.|$|R

50|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. Lollu express {{criticized the}} film {{comparing it to}} Lion King. Thiraipadam.com wrote:"Diwaan boasts {{of one of the}} most shoddy screenplays and atrocious editing in recent times. The movie has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on, which is usually a good thing since it contributes to the pace of the movie. But the director fails to keep a rein on things and the movie soon spirals out of his control. There are just too many loose ends and unanswered questions".|$|E

5000|$|The Style Council {{took a more}} overtly {{political}} approach than The Jam {{in their}} lyrics, with tracks such as [...] "Walls Come Tumbling Down!", [...] "The Lodgers", and [...] "Come To Milton Keynes" [...] being deliberate attacks on 'middle England' and Thatcherite principles prevalent in the 1980s. During this period, Weller was also instrumental {{in the formation of}} Red Wedge with Billy Bragg. He later said that this began to detract from the music: [...] "We were involved with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> political <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on at that time. I think after a while that overshadowed the music a bit".|$|R
5000|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium and in the subsequent press conference, where Räikkönen said his pole position start was {{an important factor in}} his victory: [...] "This circuit is very difficult to overtake. The start is the best place and when you have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> with the safety car you might be lucky or very unlucky, so the best place to try to win is always from the front. It was good yesterday and it really helped us today." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{real-time}} applications with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on, combat flight simulators {{are among}} the most computer and graphics demanding applications at any given time, and many sim fans are constantly upgrading their hardware, including the most advanced graphics cards.

5000|$|Everyone has a say. Efforts on everyone’s part, so just a team effort. There was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on at {{that time}} that it was the natural thing to do.

We all still put in the same efforts as we did the day we started. That was the main idea, that it’s kind of a cooperative effort. Everyone has a say on the matter.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to an all new lineup, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> were <b>going</b> to be different. McCain had worked with Howard Benson on Damage, {{but this time he}} wanted to produce the new album himself. After being the sole songwriter in the band for years, McCain teamed up with Green in co-writing songs. Not wanting to replicate the last album, they decided to go another direction, add musical elements that weren't tapped into previously, and not include another [...] "Bounce" [...] or [...] "Get Paid" [...] on the record. In McCain's words, lyrically the record is telling the story of the past year of his and Toryn's life.|$|R
2500|$|Leno {{himself was}} among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers [...] "destructive to the franchise" [...] despite O'Brien's {{success in the}} advertiser-friendly {{demographics}} combined with his significantly smaller salary compared to Leno's pointing to profitability. In fact, Leno's comment was in stark contrast with his own assessment of O'Brien's performance {{less than three months}} prior: [...] "Personally, I think Conan is doing fine. He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> other <b>things</b> <b>going</b> that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing. It's a little too early to tell".|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2008 offseason Peters was unhappy with his contract and did not report to any of the Bills offseason workouts including the teams' mandatory minicamps.

[...] "I thought Jason would be at our mandatory minicamp, but that’s a decision he’s made and he’ll be fined," [...] Jauron said. [...] "I wish he was here, obviously.

[...] Baird Searles described Krull as [...] "an unpretentious movie [...] [...] [...] with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good <b>things</b> <b>going</b> for it," [...] noting the film as [...] "very beautiful, in fact, a neglected quality in these days when it seems to have been forgotten that film is a visual medium." ...|$|R

It's a post-war baroque melodrama, creaky as wooden steps in a mildewed house ... It was too wooden a presentation to generate anything but a few sparks ... It's a somber story, with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> heavy-handed <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on. The complexities of the heroine's character were well presented. The analyst's comments about her stealing to get even with Mrs. Willis seemed to be a reasonable explanation, if taken at face value ... The Locket only had some glitter but not enough substance. Though, as muddled as it was, it still kept me alert wanting to know what gives. The problem is I never satisfactorily found out what gives." ...|$|R
