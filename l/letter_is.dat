5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E

Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E

5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate in Finland {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm.

5|$|The second kingdom {{appears to}} be a {{powerful}} and prosperous political center, kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, but the most important source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements.

5|$|The {{subject matter}} of the third <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of the}} second letter, and some {{scholars}} have explained this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report.

5|$|This <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> seen as {{the final}} salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift {{found it necessary to}} publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; {{it may be}} as early as 784 or as late as 791.

Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter of}} Hadrian written from Egypt to his {{brother-in-law}} Servianus is quoted at length (and {{was accepted as}} genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century). Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son Lucius Aelius Caesar: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136. The <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have been}} published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the History, in another suspect passage. A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the Patriarch, head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, Gamaliel.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} pronounce otherwise.

The final <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E
