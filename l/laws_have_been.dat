5|$|<b>Laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{passed in}} many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{national}} drug <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> amended {{to reflect the}} terms of the convention; examples include the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the US Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, Australia Poisons Standard (October 2015), the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of 1996, and the Japanese Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law of 2002. The possession and use of psilocybin is prohibited under almost all circumstances, and often carries severe legal penalties.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Customarily, men are {{the head}} of the {{household}} and from this role stems dominance within different cultures in South Africa. <b>Laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> passed and constitutions made to create and uphold equality between men and women. However, amongst the culture these ideals of equality aren't commonly practiced. Women are gradually gaining more recognition within the culture.|$|E
25|$|More recently, <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> instated {{to protect}} the dwindling populations of bears; however, as stated in Return of the Grizzly by David Whitman, these laws have {{increased}} the tensions between bears and humans. While this allows bear populations to recuperate, it also prevents people from killing bears that have invaded their property and killed their livestock.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, many <b>laws</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created which criminalize the {{circumvention}} of DRM, communication {{about such}} circumvention, {{and the creation}} and distribution of tools used for such circumvention.
