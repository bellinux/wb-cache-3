50|$|Christopher Street {{is named}} after Charles Christopher Amos, the owner <b>of</b> the <b>inherited</b> <b>estate</b> which {{included}} {{the location of the}} street. Amos is also the namesake of nearby Charles Street, and of the former Amos Street, which is now West 10th Street.|$|R
50|$|Its remote {{location}} was ideal for the Cistercians, whose desire was {{to follow a}} strict life of prayer and self-sufficiency with little {{contact with the outside}} world. The patron, Walter Espec, settled another Cistercian community, founding Wardon Abbey in Bedfordshire on unprofitable wasteland on one <b>of</b> his <b>inherited</b> <b>estates.</b>|$|R

60|$|SIR PETER. And {{abuse the}} Public for {{allowing}} merit to an act whose only {{object is to}} snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious Relief of usury! and give the minor a chance <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> his <b>estate</b> without being undone by coming into Possession.|$|R

50|$|He died 1884, aged 85, unmarried. His nephew, Joshua Sydney Davey (1842-1909), son <b>of</b> Stephen <b>inherited</b> his <b>estate</b> at Bochym in the Parish of Cury.|$|R
5|$|Richard Fitzalan, the Earl <b>of</b> Arundel, <b>inherited</b> the <b>estate</b> but by 1397 {{the castle}} was in ruins. The {{surrounding}} settlement remained small and never became a borough, although the priory prospered.|$|R
50|$|In 1788, {{he became}} the 15th chief of Clan MacDonell <b>of</b> Glengarry, <b>inheriting</b> huge <b>estates</b> from Glengarry in the Great Glen to Knoydart on the Atlantic. In 1790. he entered University College, Oxford.|$|R
500|$|Additionally, the act {{raised the}} value <b>of</b> <b>inherited</b> <b>estates</b> and gifts {{that could be}} {{sheltered}} from taxation. Gingrich has been credited with creating {{the agenda for the}} reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the [...] "Contract with America", which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate, however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration. Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.|$|R
50|$|Ingeborg {{married her}} lover Canute Porse (d. 1330), a noble {{from less than}} royal circles, in 1327. While Canute was allowed to become Duke of Halland and holder <b>of</b> Ingeborg's <b>inherited</b> <b>estates,</b> her {{marriage}} was another reason why Swedes, and also increasingly Norwegians, did not allow Ingeborg to use her governmental power in these kingdoms. The year of her marriage, Ingeborg was stripped from her power also in the Norwegian regency council.|$|R
50|$|Her eldest son, Prince Albert <b>of</b> Prussia, <b>inherited</b> her <b>estate,</b> {{included}} the Schloss Reinhartshausen. In 1940, her grandson, Prince Frederick Heinrich of Prussia -Albert's son- owned the property. Today the Schloss Reinhartshausen is a 5-stars hotel.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} the second but eldest {{surviving}} son of Sir Edward Croft of Croft Castle and his second wife Catherine Herbert, daughter of Sir Richard Herbert <b>of</b> Herefordshire, <b>inheriting</b> the <b>estate</b> on his father's death in 1562.|$|R
50|$|Moore gained {{considerable}} wealth by subdividing {{and developing}} other parts <b>of</b> his large <b>inherited</b> <b>estate</b> in {{what became known}} as the residential neighborhood of Chelsea. Before this, the urbanized part of the city ended at Houston Street on Manhattan island. For 10 years, Moore also served as a board member of the New York Institution for the Blind.|$|R
5000|$|Stephen and Richard Davey were [...] "adventurers" [...] in the {{development}} of Cornish mines, during the boom period. They acquired an ancient manor house and estate at Bochym in Cury. Richard Davey's nephew, Joshua Sydney Davey (1842-1909), son <b>of</b> Stephen <b>inherited</b> his <b>estate</b> at Bochym.|$|R
50|$|He {{divorced}} {{his first}} wife to Martha (née Voice Bartos) and subsequently was married to heiress Celeste (née Gottesman, 1913-2013), who had in 1935 married Jerome John Altman. The Bartoses became generous philanthropists, concentrating on culture, particularly twentieth-century art of which they were an avid collectors, filling their Park Avenue (Manhattan) apartment in New York City. Celeste became fabulously wealthy as a result <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> her father, Samuel Gottesman (1885-1956), a Hungarian émigré who had become a pulp-paper merchant and financier.|$|R
5000|$|Born {{into the}} royal Ji family (...) , {{he was the}} eldest son of the Duke of Zhou. Instead <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> his father's <b>estate</b> in Zhou, he was granted the newly {{established}} State of Lu centered at Qufu. He {{is thought to have}} ruled Lu from around 1042 to 997 BC. His posthumous name was the Great Duke ( [...] , Tàigōng).|$|R
2500|$|Eadnoth the Younger had one brother, Godric (died 1013), and {{at least}} two sisters, Ælfwaru (died 1007) and Ælfwyn, all <b>of</b> whom <b>inherited</b> <b>estates</b> [...] (in {{addition}} to a fishery) from their father. Eadnoth, by contrast, became a monk at Worcester Abbey, where his mother's kinsman Oswald was bishop, and thus could not inherit anything. Eadnoth appears {{for the first time in}} the 980s when, according to the Liber Benefactorum Ecclesiae Ramesiensis, he supervised the repair of the western tower of Ramsey Abbey. Eadnoth became Abbot of Ramsey in 992, having probably already taken over Eadnoth the Elder's duties as prior from at least 991, if not earlier.|$|R
50|$|Louis-François-Henri de Menon {{retired to}} his estates in the South of Mayenne, in the {{province}} of Anjou, in the commune of Villiers-Charlemagne. He is known for his dissertation on the deforestation. <b>Of</b> the <b>inherited</b> <b>estate,</b> an area located in Baugé about 1000 hectares, in 1737 most of which was still uncultivated. He improves the land by clearing (removal of forest), and adding drainage, turing it into a model estate. He cleared the heather, that covered most of the land around the town of Villiers, and created pathways to make the land more productive. Forty years later his territory had become one of the richest {{in the province}}.|$|R
50|$|As {{a second}} son, Edward Bromley can {{have had little}} {{expectation}} <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> substantial <b>estates.</b> He was installed in a modest property of the Bromley patrimony at Shifnal, which became his seat: {{he was known as}} “of Shifnall Grange” in his early career. When Sir George Bromley died in 1589, the estates passed to his first son, Francis Bromley, who thus held land at Hodnet, Wistanswick, and Allerton, as well as his mother's estate of Hallon and other lands in the Bridgnorth area. He survived for less than two years. The Bromley estates then passed to his young son, Thomas.|$|R
5000|$|Wokefield Park {{was sold}} in 1742 to Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge. [...] The Earl's grandson, Henry Paget, 2nd Earl <b>of</b> Uxbridge, <b>inherited</b> the <b>estate</b> before selling it to Bernard Brocas (of nearby Beaurepaire) before the latter's death in 1777. [...] Around this time, John Rocque's map of Berkshire shows that the estate was {{landscaped}} with avenues, woodland and water.|$|R
60|$|Tobin and me, {{the two of}} us, {{went down}} to Coney one day, for there was four dollars between us, and Tobin had need of distractions. For there was Katie Mahorner, his sweetheart, of County Sligo, lost since she started for America three months before with two hundred dollars, her own savings, and one hundred dollars from the sale <b>of</b> Tobin's <b>inherited</b> <b>estate,</b> a fine cottage and pig on the Bog Shannaugh. And since the letter that Tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of Katie Mahorner. Tobin advertised in the papers, but nothing could be found of the colleen.|$|R
50|$|Past {{the ruins}} <b>of</b> the jointly <b>inherited</b> <b>estate</b> (a Ganerbentum) the castle {{courtyard}} features {{the remains of}} the palas in the southwest, the castle well and the Late Gothic castle chapel. The extensive vaulted cellars, some hewn out of the rock, were largely closed off during the restoration work for bat conservation reasons, and are only accessible on special occasions. The cellars under the palas and the above-ground vault of the Ganerben residence next to the bergfried are freely accessible.|$|R
5000|$|Pringle died in Edinburgh on 19 August 1754, [...] "in his eightieth year", and {{was buried}} in the Old Kirkyard at Selkirk. His widow Ann, who was sole {{executor}} <b>of</b> his <b>estate,</b> <b>inherited</b> a life-rent on lands purchased with her dowry, giving her an annual income of 2,000 merks.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Hertfordshire, {{probably}} at Braughing. His father was a tenant of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl <b>of</b> Suffolk, who <b>inherited</b> <b>estates</b> in Hertfordshire from his mother, and Meriton himself was born under the Earl's roof. He was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, graduated B.A. in 1585, M.A. in 1588, and was on 4 July 1589 elected fellow of Queens' College. There he filled the post of junior bursar, 1596, senior bursar 1597, and proceeded B.D. in 1596, and D.D. in 1601.|$|R
25|$|He {{fell out}} of favour with the Queen in the early 1580s and was exiled from court after {{impregnating}} one of her maids of honour, Anne Vavasour, which instigated violent street brawls between De Vere's retainers and her uncles. De Vere was reconciled to the Queen in 1583, but all opportunities for advancement had been lost. In 1586, the Queen granted De Vere a £1,000 annuity to relieve his financial distress caused by his extravagance and selling off his income-producing lands for ready money. After his wife's death, he married Elizabeth Trentham, one of the Queen's maids of honour, {{with whom he had}} an heir, Henry de Vere. He died in 1604, having lost the entirety <b>of</b> his <b>inherited</b> <b>estates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gaudí drew {{inspiration}} for Casa Figueras from the medieval castle that once {{stood on the}} same site, built for King Aragon in the early 15th century. When King Aragon died without an heir in 1410, his widow, Margaret <b>of</b> Prades, <b>inherited</b> the <b>estate.</b> Following her death, the castle fell into decline and was passed {{from hand to hand}} over centuries until Jaume Figueres purchased the estate in 1900.|$|R
50|$|In 1736, the Landgraves <b>of</b> Hesse-Darmstadt <b>inherited</b> the <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> the extinct Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg, again contested {{by their}} Kassel cousins. Hesse-Darmstadt gained {{a great deal}} of {{territory}} by the secularizations and mediatizations authorized by the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803. Most notable was the acquisition of the Duchy of Westphalia, formerly owned by the Prince-Archbishop of Cologne, as well as territories from the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz and the Prince-Bishop of Worms.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-13th {{century the}} MacKenzies of Ord were granted {{lands in the}} west of Scotland by King Alexander III. In 1820 Thomas MacKenzie <b>of</b> Ord <b>inherited</b> the <b>estate</b> {{embarked}} on rejuvenating the area. A large portion of MacKenzie's land was devoted to the cultivation of barley, as such he decided to lease the land for a distillery to be built, this would also provide year round employment for local men.|$|R
5000|$|The present château {{was built}} on the site of a castle that was {{destroyed}} in 1793 during the French Revolution. The Arc-en-Barrois area belonged in 1622 to Nicolas de L'Hospital, Duke of Vitry; it was bought in 1679 from his son by Count Morstein who ceded it in 1693 to Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, whose son Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke <b>of</b> Penthièvre, <b>inherited</b> the <b>estate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lloyd {{was born}} in Durban in South Africa, the son of Walter John Lloyd and his wife, Carmen Craig Stewart Murray. Ian Lloyd's great-grandfather, Capt. Walter Lloyd (1823-1878), had emigrated from his native Wales to the British colony of Natal, as it then was, {{in the middle of}} the nineteenth century; the Lloyd family's ancestral home, Coedmore, is {{situated}} in Cardiganshire. As the third of four sons, Walter Lloyd had no real prospect <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> the <b>estate</b> and therefore had to make his own way in the world, choosing the armed forces, over the Church and the Law - the other two options usually favoured by younger sons of the gentry - as his means of doing so.|$|R
50|$|A mark of such newly settled {{conditions}} in the Duchy of Rome is the Domusculta Capracorum, the central Roman villa that Adrian assembled from a nucleus <b>of</b> his <b>inherited</b> <b>estates</b> and acquisitions from neighbors in the countryside north of Veii. The villa is documented in Liber Pontificalis, but its site was not rediscovered until the 1960s, when excavations revealed the structures on a gently-rounded hill that was only marginally capable of self-defense, but fully self-sufficient for a mixed economy of grains and vineyards, olives, vegetable gardens and piggery with its own grain mill, smithies and tile-kilns. During the 10th century villages were carved out of Adrian's Capracorum estate: Campagnano, mentioned first in 1076; Formello, mentioned in 1027; Mazzano, mentioned in 945; and Stabia (modern Faleria), mentioned in 998.|$|R
50|$|By this point, he {{had been}} {{defrauded}} <b>of</b> his <b>inherited</b> <b>estates</b> by both Visigoths and his fellow Romans. Paulinus contemplated leaving Gaul entirely and resettling on lands in Greece that belonged to his mother, but his wife refused to make the voyage. Beginning some time after his forty-fifth birthday, his family began to die, beginning with his mother, then his mother-in-law, and then his wife. His two sons died before him; only his daughter possibly survived him, having married years before and gone to live in North Africa. Alone, Paulinus moved to Marseilles, to live on a small property he still owned. Yet he lost even this last possession in a mortgage, and was saved from utter destitution only by the opportune purchase of this property by a wealthy Visigoth.|$|R
5000|$|Among the <b>estates</b> he <b>inherited</b> {{from his}} uncle was the Talbot family's main home, Heythrop Park, which burned down in 1831. After the fire, John moved {{the family to}} another <b>of</b> his <b>inherited</b> <b>estates,</b> in Staffordshire. The house had {{originally}} been known as Alverton Lodge, and had been enlarged by the 15th Earl, who enclosed the park and started creating the formal valley gardens to create [...] "Alton Abbey" [...] (the name [...] "Abbey" [...] was chosen because it was fashionable -the site had no religious connections). John continued his uncle's work at Alton, developing and expanding the house and estate further; he renamed it Alton Towers. John was a [...] "patron of the Gothic revival" [...] and commissioned noted Gothic revival architect Augustus Pugin {{to work at the}} towers.|$|R
5000|$|Billy met a {{woman and}} her son, Miss Annie Wilson and Harry, from Melbourne, Australia, and soon after turning 21 he married her on 29 January 1877. Annie was the {{daughter}} of John Wilson, Esquire of Melbourne, Australia. The family, though, [...] "was not pleased" [...] with the marriage. They entertained [...] "lavishly" [...] and traveled between their homes at Churchill and Eaton Square. Within 9 years <b>of</b> <b>inheriting</b> his father's <b>estate,</b> William took out a loan for £60,000.|$|R
5000|$|Sal·la {{was the son}} of Isarn, semi-independent viscount of Conflent. His brother Bernat and Bernat's son Arnau, both viscounts in {{succession}} after Isarn, make no appeal to comital authority in all their surviving documents. Sal·la was perhaps named after his uncle Sal·la, founder of Sant Benet de Bages and [...] "perhaps the greatest frontier magnate in tenth-century Catalonia after the counts". Throughout their lives, Sal·la and his brother Bernat endeavoured by exchanges and divisions <b>of</b> their patrimony (<b>inherited</b> <b>estates)</b> to consolidate the former's lands in Urgell and the latter's in Conflent and Ausona, around their respective power bases.|$|R
