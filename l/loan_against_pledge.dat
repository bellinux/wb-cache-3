50|$|While {{awaiting}} his 'examination', {{a kind of}} interrogation, in September 1573, {{he wrote}} to the English diplomat Henry Killigrew and Cecil for help. Melville said his enemies were destroying his reputation, {{saying that he had}} hindered peace, and knew all the secret dealings between France, England and Scotland. He said he had never been happy to receive help from Flanders. Melville hoped for English political intervention for his release. On 19 October 1573 Melville was questioned about negotiations for the marriage of Mary Queen of Scots to John of Austria, her escape from Lochleven Castle, her good and jewels, her proposed marriage to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, the siege of Edinburgh Castle and those who supplied it with silver or gave <b>loans</b> secured <b>against</b> <b>pledges</b> of Mary's jewels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{renovation}} of Theater for the New City {{came at a}} great cost to {{its relationship with the}} community in 2000 when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sold the air rights above the theater (which the City had retained) to a developer. TNC was at that time in default of a <b>loan</b> borrowed <b>against</b> a <b>pledged</b> grant from the Manhattan Borough President's Office, which never materialized. The City put a lien against TNC in 1997 and unable to find a major donor to pay off the $519,634 lien, TNC was forced to agree to the construction of a 12-story tower above their space in order to have the lien forgiven. [...] The Faustian deal was somewhat sweetened by giving TNC an extension on their mortgage and allowing the theater to have one seat on the condo board. Being vastly taller than the 6-story tenement buildings prevalent in the Lower East Side, the condo tower was seen {{as a threat to the}} character of the neighborhood and construction in 2000 occurred amidst great protest. The tower became even more of a controversy when the developer hired non-union workers to build the tower.|$|R
