5|$|Michael Armstrong {{was born}} into an Irish {{traveller}} family in Longford, Ireland. His mother went into labour with him while driving, so his partially sighted father took over the wheel but crashed the car into a <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> {{on the way to}} the hospital; Michael was delivered in the back seat. The Armstrong family moved to Ballymun, Dublin, and, when Michael was age nine, to Manchester, England.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{was born}} in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father {{modified}} his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. When Schumacher crashed it into a <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> in Kerpen, his parents {{took him to the}} karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.|$|E

25|$|On 17 July 1991, Manser climbed unaided {{to the top}} of 30-foot high <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> {{outside of}} the G7 media centre in London. After {{reaching}} the top, he unrolled a banner that displayed a message about the plight of Sarawak rainforests. He chained himself to the <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> {{for two and a half}} hours. His protest also coincided with protests by Earth First! and the London Rainforest Action Group. Police used a hoist to reach the top of the <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> and cut his chains. Manser climbed down the <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> without force at 1:40 PM. He was then taken to the Bow street police station and held until the G7 summit ended at 6:30 PM, when he was released without being charged with an offense.|$|E
25|$|For {{the brief}} {{period of time that}} Jadis is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. This is {{demonstrated}} when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a <b>lamp</b> <b>post.</b> The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.|$|E
25|$|However {{publication}} order reflects Lewis's {{strategy for}} drawing readers {{into the world}} of Narnia. In the book he wrote first, Lucy Pevensie's discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in The Magician's Nephew and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe, and the <b>lamp</b> <b>post.</b> Indeed, the narrative of The Magician's Nephew appears to assume that the reader has already read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and is now being shown its beginnings.|$|E
40|$|The {{street lights}} on Hamilton St. were {{installed}} in 1916 and remained until the 1970 s when revitalization ended up junking the ornate <b>lamp</b> <b>posts.</b> The flower bowl <b>lamp</b> <b>posts</b> were suggested by Mayor Alfred L. Reichenbach’s wife, Maude, {{after returning from}} a trip abroad. This photograph, taken in 1965, shows the original posts. In the 1990 s the city sought the original manufacturer of the <b>lamp</b> <b>posts</b> and had them recreated exactly. The tall building on the horizon is the Pennsylvania Power 2 ̆ 6 Light building. Completed in 1928, it remains the tallest building in Allentown and is embellished with exterior designs by Ukrainian sculptor Alexander Archipenko. [URL]...|$|R

This project is to replace every traffic light along Grand avenue in exception of the traffic signals at 14th st. and at Waverly. These new traffic signals are to match the new <b>lamp</b> <b>posts</b> and to give the street a more classic look.|$|R

25|$|Lewis had {{originally}} intended only {{to write the}} one Narnia novel, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. However, when Roger Lancelyn Green asked him how a <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> came to be standing {{in the midst of}} Narnian woodland, Lewis was intrigued enough by the question to attempt to find an answer by writing The Magician's Nephew, which features a younger version of Professor Kirke from the first novel.|$|E

25|$|All the {{characters}} immediately feel awe for Aslan. Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan {{with an iron}} bar that she tore from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song {{is so great that}} even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning <b>lamp</b> <b>post,</b> and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims the power of his song will last for a few days.|$|E
25|$|When {{artificial}} light affects organisms and ecosystems {{it is called}} ecological light pollution. While light at night can be beneficial, neutral, or damaging for individual species, its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems. For example, some species of spiders avoid lit areas, while other species are happy to build their spider web directly on a <b>lamp</b> <b>post.</b> Since lamp posts attract many flying insects, the spiders that don't mind light, gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it. This is a simple example {{of the way in}} which species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed by the introduction of light at night.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt was}} also {{made in the}} late 18th century {{to improve the quality}} of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a <b>lamp</b> <b>post,</b> gave off a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E

25|$|The Latter Days (Hodder & Stoughton, 1953), re{{published}} as Latter Days at Colditz, {{also published}} {{with the title}} Men of Colditz: Whilst his first book ended with Reid and Wardle shaking hands under the first Swiss <b>lamp</b> <b>post,</b> the sequel follows the trials and tribulations of the escape committee until the eventual liberation of the castle by U.S. troops on 15 April 1945. It gives even more anecdotal insight into the events following his escape, including the French Tunnel and the Colditz Glider, or the occasion when the entire Dutch contingent unhooked their P.O.W. railway carriage {{from the rest of}} the train unbeknownst to the German guards. This last part of the Dutch prisoners cannot be confirmed by any Dutch reference about PoWs. Reid probably refers to the mass escape of Dutch officers from train transports towards the end of the war when they were transported from Stanislau to Neubrandenburg.|$|E
500|$|Both bridges {{are made}} of {{concrete}} and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated {{by a series of}} fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as [...] "integral lighting". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.|$|E
500|$|C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien {{are among}} the authors that have frequented Malvern. Legend states that, after {{drinking}} in a Malvern pub one winter evening, they were walking home when it started to snow. They saw a <b>lamp</b> <b>post</b> shining out through the snow and Lewis turned to his friends and said [...] "that would make a very nice opening line to a book". The novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by Lewis later used that image as the characters enter the realm of Narnia.|$|E
