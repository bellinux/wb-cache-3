This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of galectin-3 is elevated in {{the circulation of}} patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer. It has also been identified bound to glycans {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells. In cancer patients whose cancer has metastasised, galectin-3 is higher still, suggesting that this galectin has a crucial role in metastasis. Galectin-3 also binds to MUC-1, a very large transmembrane mucin, which on cancer cells changes expression from <b>long</b> <b>core</b> 2 type O-glycosylation to shorter core 1 type O-glycosylation. Core 2 glycans terminate in galactose or sialic acid, whereas core 1 is branched and has potential for large carbohydrate extensions. High levels of MUC-1 are associated with poor prognosis and increased potential of metastasis. This cancer-associated MUC-1 is a natural ligand for galectin-3. In normal cells, MUC-1 has distinct polarisation and acts as a protective barrier around the cell, reducing cell-cell interactions. In breast cancer cells, it is hypothesised that galectin-3 has high affinity for cancer-associated MUC-1, causing depolarisation and breaking the cell's protective shield. This exposes small adhesion molecules {{on the surface of the}} cell, which interact with adhesion proteins on endothelial cell walls, such as E-selectin, promoting intravastion into the blood stream. Experiments shows that overexpression of MUC-1 alone is not enough to increase metastatic potential, and in fact it inhibits tumour cell entry into the blood stream. It requires the presence of upregulated galectin-3 in addition to MUC-1 to increase invasive and metastatic properties of the cancer. This is supported by other studies showing that inhibition of galectin-3 in human breast cancer cells lose their malignancy in vitro. This may provide a clue towards developing therapeutics for cancer, such as galactin-3 inhibitors.|$|E

Oxygen and nitrogen dynamics were investigated by measuring inflowing and outflowing water. The experimental design allowed determinations of vertical profiles of aerobic respiration, nitrification, and coupled and uncoupled denitrification and ammonification.

In the sandy soil, net nitrogen removal occurred in cores of 14 cm and longer; in the <b>longest</b> <b>core,</b> 40 % was removed.

5000|$|A marine nuclear {{propulsion}} plant must {{be designed to}} be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which {{might have to be}} undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium oxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for <b>long</b> <b>core</b> life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a [...] "burnable poison" [...] in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the [...] "nuclear poison" [...] increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact reactor pressure vessel is extended by providing an internal neutron shield, which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.|$|E
50|$|The best {{understood}} galectin {{in terms of}} cancer is galectin-3. Evidence suggests that galectin-3 plays a considerable part in processes linked to tumorigenesis, including transformation to a malignant form, metastasis and increased invasive properties of tumour cells. There is some significant evidence that galectin-3 is involved in cancer since it interacts with oncogenes such as Ras and activates downstream signalling that promotes proliferation. It can also regulate some of the proteins of the cell cycle, such as cyclin E and c-myc, which may give it additional tumorigenic properties.The concentration of galectin-3 is elevated in the circulation of patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer.

The objectives were to evaluate if a simple kinematic wave model could be used {{to characterize}} drainage under conditions of by-passing flow and to investigate the variability of runoff generation under wet and dry antecedent conditions in this well structured soil. Cores were taken to depths of 0. 4 and 0. 7 m, with six cores obtained from each depth. Results show that variations in soil structure between cores have a greater influence on the hydrologic response than variations in antecedent water content. It may be inferred that, in this soil, good structural continuity substantially enhances soil drainage and, in consequence, decreases surface runoff.

40|$|As {{a result}} of climate change {{and more than a}} hundred years of fire suppression, the risk of catastrophic {{wildfires}} in the western United States has increased dramatically. This is especially true in the dry ponderosa pine forests of the eastern Cascades. The Taylor Bridge fire, which occurred in such an environment, burned during the summer of 2012. By the time of its containment it had burned approximately 23, 000 acres east of the town of Cle Elum, Washington, and consumed 61 homes. This created the ideal situation in which to study charcoal accumulation into lake sediments following fire.
