5|$|Chen's case {{received}} sustained international attention, {{with the}} U.S. State Department, the British Foreign Secretary, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International issuing appeals for his release; the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> designated him {{a prisoner of}} conscience. Chen is a 2007 laureate of the Ramon Magsaysay Award and in 2006 {{was named to the}} Time 100.|$|E
5|$|McMahon also {{wrestled}} in traveling circuses. He {{was part}} of Adam Forepaugh's Circus, and he competed for P. T. Barnum's circus for over two years. With the <b>latter</b> <b>group,</b> he wrestled over 300 pre-arranged matches against Ed Decker. He also continued in regular competition outside the circus; in his final match, he defeated Jim Cowley on March 2, 1891. McMahon died in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen {{compounds}} {{have been}} well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment. Pnictide and carbide compounds have also attracted interest because of {{their presence in the}} fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs, although the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> has not had nearly as much research as the former.|$|E
50|$|The <b>latter</b> <b>grouping</b> {{are treated}} by WCSP as {{synonyms}} of A. tenuior var. tenuior.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> (which {{has gained}} wider {{awareness}} in historical research) was the Squires of Vehkalahti ('Vehkalahden knaapit').|$|R
25|$|The main {{concerns}} of the <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> are often related to their legal status, a public perception of criminal activity, and general discrimination associated with being non-Japanese.|$|R
5|$|The {{neighboring}} Osages {{were not}} so affected, as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present-day Illinois. With superior weaponry, they drove between the Southern Pawnees and the Wichitas, pushing the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> southward to the Red River. The Pawnees moved northward into Nebraska, possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before eating. The <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the {{diversification of}} reptiles contributed into {{a decline in}} terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the <b>latter</b> <b>group.</b> These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E
50|$|None of {{the ministers}} {{had served in}} the {{previous}} cabinet. The government was intended to be inclusive, with representation from the nationalist and the religious parties, the <b>latter</b> <b>grouping</b> being represented by the PSII.|$|R
50|$|The group disbanded in 2001. Fergusson and Rodney Linderman later {{formed the}} group 25 Cromwell Street, {{playing in the}} style of Burn Witch Burn and {{incorporating}} several of the <b>latter</b> <b>group's</b> songs into its set.|$|R
50|$|In 1874 the Oregon Pioneer Association {{offered to}} merge with the Oregon Historical Society, but the offer was declined, {{apparently}} due to the <b>latter</b> <b>group's</b> intention to limit itself to historical study rather than fraternal interaction.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease is rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the <b>latter</b> <b>group.</b> It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This {{has been attributed to}} seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity and temperature.|$|E
5|$|Libyan {{activism}} began generating {{concerns in}} the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). The insurgents split {{on the issue of}} Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan Hissène Habré. The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by Goukouni Oueddei. The <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> soon renamed itself People's Armed Forces (FAP).|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the <b>latter</b> <b>group,</b> with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E
5000|$|The çeng {{belongs to}} the family of {{instruments}} known in organology as [...] "open harps," [...] which are further divided into the [...] "bow harps" [...] and the [...] "square harps." [...] The çeng is in the <b>latter</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|The under-23 {{category}} roughly {{corresponds with}} {{the age of}} athletes found competing in college athletics, although in the <b>latter</b> <b>grouping</b> there is a required academic element for student-athletes and typically no upper age limit (in the case of adult learners).|$|R
5000|$|In Laos {{there are}} four {{categories}} of persons held in confinement. Aside from common criminals, there are political, social, and ideological deviants. The crimes of the three <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> are often vaguely defined, their arrests arbitrary, and their length of confinement ambiguous.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Coolidge {{signed the}} bill, {{which became the}} Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This {{was the first time}} {{commemorative}} coin legislation covered more than one issue. A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins to be drawn at face value on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> of banks had in 1923 distributed the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E
5|$|The set of four, large hanging gongs is {{confined}} {{mainly to the}} Maguindanao. Scholars says the Maranao used to use the gandingan but the instrument has disappeared from usage in Maranao ensembles of today. The Tausug have a gandingan-type gong with a narrow-rim called a buahan or huhagan. {{one of the three}} agungs used in the Tausug kulintang ensemble. The Samal have something similar called a bua. Other gongs similar to the gandingan are the handheld gongs of the Subanon (gagung sua) and Tiruray (karatung) used in their agung ensembles, the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> sometimes substituting Maguindanao gandingan gongs for their karatungs.|$|E
50|$|The Saiqalgar are now {{divided into}} groups, {{those who are}} now mainly small to {{medium-sized}} farmers, and a smaller groups who are still involved with the polishing and furbishing of metals. Among the <b>latter</b> <b>groups,</b> a small number have taken to the manufacture of fireworks.|$|R
25|$|The torsion {{subgroups of}} K2i+1(Z), and {{the orders of}} the finite groups K4k+2(Z) have {{recently}} been determined, but whether the <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> are cyclic, and whether the groups K4k(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver's conjecture about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for more details.|$|R
25|$|Parkour was {{developed}} in France, primarily by Raymond Belle, and further by his son David and the <b>latter's</b> <b>group</b> of friends, the self-styled Yamakasi, during the late 1980s. The discipline was popularised in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, documentaries, and advertisements featuring the Yamakasi.|$|R
5|$|Volcanoes in Indonesia {{are part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The 150 entries in the list below are grouped into six {{geographical}} regions, four of which belong to the volcanoes of the Sunda Arc trench system. The remaining two groups are volcanoes of Halmahera, including its surrounding volcanic islands, and volcanoes of Sulawesi and the Sangihe Islands. The <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> is in one volcanic arc together with the Philippine volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Within the genus, the yellow-tailed {{and the two}} Western Australian white-tailed species, the short-billed and long-billed black cockatoo, {{form the}} {{subgenus}} Zanda. The red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos form the other subgenus, Calyptorhynchus. The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile food begging calls {{and the degree of}} sexual dimorphism. Males and females of the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> have markedly different plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
50|$|The torsion {{subgroups of}} K2i+1(Z), and {{the orders of}} the finite groups K4k+2(Z) have {{recently}} been determined, but whether the <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> are cyclic, and whether the groups K4k(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver's conjecture about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture for more details.|$|R
5000|$|A {{tour of the}} U.S. {{later that}} year failed to bring them any {{commercial}} success there, but after meeting Brian Wilson some members guested on a Beach Boys session, {{which resulted in the}} eventual release of the <b>latter</b> <b>group's</b> single [...] "It's OK" [...] in 1976.|$|R
50|$|During {{this period}} in British naval architecture, the 74-gun third rates {{were divided into}} two {{distinct}} groupings: the 'large' and 'common' classes. The Canada class ships belonged to the <b>latter</b> <b>grouping,</b> carrying 18-pounder guns on their upper gun decks, as opposed to the 24-pounders of the large class.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for {{a bill that would}} reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the <b>latter</b> <b>group</b> come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The <b>latter</b> <b>group,</b> comprising many young boyars who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} hindlimb proportions, Teleocrater is {{more similar to}} silesaurids, pseudosuchians, and early archosaurs than lagerpetids or ornithodirans, in that the {{metatarsus}} is not particularly lengthened {{with respect to the}} femur and tibia. The lengthening of the metatarsus in the <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> probably represent adaptations to running.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{the region}} has been {{referred}} to as part of Greater India, as seen in Coedes' Indianized States of Southeast Asia, which refers to it as [...] "Island Southeast Asia"; and within Austronesia or Oceania, due to shared ethnolinguistic and historical origins of the <b>latter</b> <b>groups</b> (Micronesian and Polynesian groups) being from this region.|$|R
25|$|On October 20, 2015, Tribune Broadcasting {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with former WTTV owner Sinclair Broadcast Group to carry the <b>latter</b> <b>group's</b> science fiction-focused multicast network Comet on its stations in Indianapolis, Hartford and Denver. When the network launched on October 31, 2015, WTTV debuted a digital subchannel on virtual channel 4.3/29.3 {{to serve as an}} affiliate of Comet.|$|R
