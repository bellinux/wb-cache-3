25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> virus.|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including bluetongue, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, <b>louping</b> <b>ill,</b> tick-borne encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{divergence}} {{times have}} been made for several of these viruses. The origin of these viruses appears {{to be at least}} 9400 to 14,000 years ago. The Old World and New World dengue strains diverged between 150 and 450 years ago. The European and Far Eastern tick borne encephalitis strains diverged about 1087 (1610–649) years ago. European tick borne encephalitis and <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> viruses diverged about 572 (844–328) years ago. This latter estimate is consistent with historical records. Kunjin virus diverged from West Nile virus approximately 277 (475–137) years ago. This time corresponds to the settlement of Australia from Europe. The Japanese encephalitis group appears to have evolved in Africa 2000–3000 years ago and then spread initially to South East Asia before migrating to the rest of Asia.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Moredun {{go back to}} the years {{following}} World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s <b>Louping</b> <b>Ill</b> and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of <b>Louping</b> <b>Ill</b> which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.|$|E

50|$|Flaviviridae is {{a family}} of viruses that {{encompasses}} well known viruses such as West Nile virus and Dengue virus. The genus Flavivirus has a prototypical envelope protein (E-protein) on its surface which serves as the target for virus neutralizing antibodies. E protein {{plays a role in}} binding to receptor and could play a role in evading the host immune system. It has three major antigenic domains namely A, B and C that correspond to the three structural domains II, III and I. Structural domain III is a putative receptor binding domain and antibodies against it neutralize the infectivity of flaviviruses. Mutations that lead to antigenic differences {{can be traced to the}} biochemical nature of the amino acid substitutions as well as the location of the mutation in the domain III. For example substitutions at different amino acids results in varying levels of neutralization by antibodies. If mutation in a critical amino acid can dramatically alter neutralization by antibodies then WNV vaccines and diagnostic assays becomes difficult to rely on. Other flaviviruses that cause dengue, <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> and yellow fever escape antibody neutralization via mutations in the domain III of the E protein.|$|E

40|$|The genomic RNA of <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> virus coding for capsid, premembrane, membrane, and {{envelope}} proteins was cloned and sequenced.

With the capsid and membrane proteins, the degree of homology between <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> and the western subtype was greater than that between the two subtypes, indicating very close evolutionary relationships between <b>louping</b> <b>ill</b> and the western subtype of tick-borne encephalitis.
