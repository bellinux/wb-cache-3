5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the Larsen Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E

He obtained <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> land in Saltfleet Township and Barton Township with various petitions and grants, and small lots in Newark and York. From Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, he received leases on ten square miles of land in return for his surveys of land along the Grand River.|$|E

5|$|Crossing north through Amherst still, NY78 and Transit Road {{becomes a}} mix of {{commercial}} and residential, passing <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> fields north of Swormville. A short distance to the north, NY78 intersects with the northern terminus of NY263 (Millersport Highway).

5|$|Due to {{the threat}} of landslides, 5,500 {{households}} were evacuated across the Amami Islands on August27. One home was destroyed and 1,065 residences were evacuated in Tokunoshima. Eight people were injured across the island and 549 sought refuge in public shelters. In Yonabaru, the typhoon's storm surge and large swells flooded coastal highways and inundated nearby buildings. <b>Large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> roads were also washed away by the storm. Cellphone service was lost late on August26 throughout much of Okinawa Prefecture.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century onwards {{the town}} walls were often adapted for new uses or simply demolished. As early as 1641, the chapel above East Gate had been leased out to private tenants. By 1707, part of God's House tower {{was being used}} as a prison; from 1786 it became the {{official}} town gaol. As the century progressed, East Gate was demolished in 1774, South Gate was mostly demolished in 1803 and Biddles Gate shortly afterwards, along with <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> adjacent wall.|$|E

The center propeller is totally buried, while the force of the impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|Sukarno {{continued}} to command loyalty from <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> {{the armed forces}} {{as well as the}} general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup.

5|$|Swakeleys House is a Grade I-listed 17th-century {{mansion in}} Ickenham, London Borough of Hillingdon, built in 1638 {{for the future}} Lord Mayor of London, Sir Edmund Wright.

The {{property}} changed hands many times over the years and at one time was home to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Sports Association. <b>Large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the grounds were sold off in 1922 and developed as suburban housing.|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. <b>Large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War a {{large number}} of {{concrete}} pillboxes were built as part of the GHQ Line - Blue to defend against an expected German invasion; many of these are still visible {{along the banks of the}} canal. They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct.

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|<b>Large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> {{the city}} {{dating from the}} 1960s have been either {{demolished}} and re-developed or modernised {{with the use of}} glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into modern apartments, Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration programmes, and million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed. The 169-metre tall, 47-storey Beetham Tower, completed in 2006, is the tallest building in the UK outside London and when finished was the highest residential accommodation in Europe. In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only supercasino in the UK, however plans were officially abandoned in February 2008.|$|E

A radar system is {{installed}} later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> a {{chromosome}} becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra {{copies of a}} gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, the Germans had {{launched}} Operation Luttich, a desperate and ill-prepared armoured thrust towards Mortain, beginning on 6August 1944. This was halted {{within a day}} and, despite the increasingly dangerous threat presented by the Anglo–Canadian advance on Falaise, the German commander Field Marshal Günther von Kluge was prohibited by Hitler from redeploying his forces. Thus, as American armoured formations advanced towards Argentan from the south, the Allies were presented {{with an opportunity to}} encircle <b>large</b> <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> the German Seventh Army. The First Canadian Army was ordered south, while the Americans prepared to move on Chambois on 14August. Simonds and Crerar quickly planned a further offensive that would push through to Falaise, trapping the German Seventh Army in Normandy.|$|E
