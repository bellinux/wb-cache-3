5|$|The first {{institute}} {{for higher education}} in the village was the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, which Walter Law helped establish on his Briarcliff Farms in 1900. The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and <b>livestock</b> <b>care.</b> In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later {{due to a lack of}} funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college's first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the State Education Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor's degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus. The Briarcliff Grade School building, which housed the village public school from 1909 to 1980, became known as the Pace University Village Center. During Pace's occupation, the building housed the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society and the Village Youth Center. Pace University operated the school building until its demolition in 1996, and the Briarcliff College campus until 2015. At the Briarcliff Lodge property, the Edgewood Park School operated from 1936 to 1954, and King's College subsequently operated there from 1955 to 1994, also using the lodge building and other dormitories and academic buildings.|$|E

In this work, we apply wireless sensor networks devices to this problem that has hitherto received little attention. We analyze three points of the solution space. At one extreme, group membership information is proactively and collectively maintained by each node in the group. At the other extreme, the dissemination of group membership updates is triggered reactively by relying on a lower-level neighbor discovery protocol. In the middle lies a solution borrowing ideas from the two extremes. We compare our solutions through simulation of synthetic scenarios and real-world mobility traces of humans. I...|$|R

40|$|Indigenous {{knowledge}} {{systems of}} <b>livestock</b> <b>care</b> {{and health care}} is the only asset {{in the hands of}} the small holder farmers to mitigate the impact of climate change on livestock production. This study explores the role of indigenous knowledge systems of <b>livestock</b> <b>care</b> and veterinary care in the face of climate change. Developing countries such as Zimbabwe bear the brunt of climate change due to poor mitigation capacity. Small holder farmers are more affected by climate change than large scale commercial farmers because it is difficult for them to diversify to other livestock species which are tolerant to climate shocks. However ethno-veterinary knowledge is not evenly distributed in society. Gender, age and social class are major determinants of the amount of knowledge that one has. The elderly have more knowledge on ethonoveterinary practices because the knowledge is experiential. Specialists like ethno veterinary herbalists also have more knowledge on ethno veterinary methods because of their specialized skills. Government departments like the department of Veterinary Services are stumbling blocks to the development and utilisation of ethno veterinary medicines because they dismiss them as unapproved and based on mythology. Instead, farmers are encouraged to use modern veterinary medicines. However, the use of ethonoveterinary methods persists because of their ready availability and affordability. Climate change has increased the number of disease in livestock; this makes ethonoveterinary medicine more relevant and useful to adapt livestock production to climate change. This study exposes the need for adaptive mechanisms if small livestock production is to remain viable under the growing threat of climate change...|$|E

Whether they choose to preserve and protect those grounds, or use them for other purposes, green burial can allow future generations greater flexibility in how they will use the land that our living have left to them.|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{drugs are}} fed to animals at low levels to treat diseases, to promote growth, and to {{increase}} feed efficiency. Incorporating low levels of antimicrobial drugs in livestock feeds {{has been shown to}} be a factor stimulating the development of antimicrobial drug resistant bacteria in livestock. Since many of the drugs used to treat livestock are the same as or are related to drugs used in human health care, there is concern that resistant organisms may pass from animals to humans through the handling of animals or food derived from animals. The movement of pathogens from animals to humans, and vice versa, has been documented, but the extent to which it has occurred or could occur is unknown. Although it is estimated that as little as 10 percent of the problems of drug-resistant pathogens in humans originate in <b>livestock</b> health <b>care</b> practices, there is currently considerable debate about the frequency and costs of human disease outbreaks resulting from animals infected with drug-resistant pathogens. Several European countries have banned the growth-promoting use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock production as a precautionary measure to prevent resistant organisms from passing from animals to humans. This report presents preliminary estimates suggesting that discontinuing the use of antimicrobial drugs in hog production would initially decrease feed efficiency, raise feed costs, reduce production, and raise prices to consumers.

It covers more than 60 of the most important diseases and problems faced by livestock holders that occur in camels, cattle, chickens, dogs, donkeys, goats and sheep. For each disease or problem, the manual gives the signs, causes, prevention measures and a range of traditional treatments.
