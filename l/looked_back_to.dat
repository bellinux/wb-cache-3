25|$|The {{modern era}} has {{unfolded}} {{in the shadow}} of the French Revolution. Almost all future revolutionary movements <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Revolution as their predecessor. Its central phrases and cultural symbols, such as La Marseillaise and Liberté, fraternité, égalité, ou la mort, became the clarion call for other major upheavals in modern history, including the Russian Revolution over a century later.|$|E

After the 1972 earthquake and Somoza's apparent corruption, the ranks of the Sandinistas were flooded with young disaffected Nicaraguans who no longer had anything to lose.|$|E

25|$|On the East Coast, {{members of}} the hip hop {{community}} <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration. Mafioso influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of Scarface, became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic gangster fashions such as bowler hats, double-breasted suits, silk shirts, and alligator-skin shoes ("gators").|$|E
25|$|Sunline then ventured {{north to}} Sydney {{to tackle the}} Doncaster Handicap (1,600 metres). Despite taking on older horses for the first time, and {{starting}} from a wide starting gate, Sunline was sent {{out one of the}} shortest-priced favourites in the race's long history, at 10/9 (approximately $2.10). Sunline went straight to the front and never <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> score by one-and-three-quarter lengths. She became just the fourth filly to win in the modern history of the race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century a {{competition}} {{was held in}} Florence for a plan to roof the central crossing of the huge, unfinished Gothic Cathedral. It was won by the artist Brunelleschi who, inspired by domes {{that he had seen}} on his travels, such as that of San Vitale in Ravenna and the enormous dome of the Roman period which roofed the Pantheon, designed a huge dome which is regarded as the first building of the Renaissance period. Its style, visually however, is ribbed and pointed and purely Gothic. It was Renaissance (a rebirth) in its audacity {{and the fact that it}} <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Roman structural techniques.|$|E

25|$|Neo-Gothic and Arts and Crafts artists {{working in}} {{northern}} England {{in the last}} half of the 19thcentury were in some ways rebelling against the uncontrolled progress, noise, smoke, mechanisation and materialism of the Industrial Revolution. They <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a more spiritual Golden Age of Romantic fairy stories of magic, knights and castles, and revelled in hand-made artefacts. Many of Barber's works reflect this, with their castellated towers and interiors of elegant carvings and jewel-coloured glass, all of which he designed and commissioned himself. However all this had to be paid for, and clients' money was often ultimately sourced from the great mills and sweated labour of Victorian West Yorkshire; an example of this is Spring Hall, Halifax, designed by Barber and funded by Tom Holdsworth of John Holdsworth & Co. Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} the two states became a major irritant, and in November 1997 a border {{committee}} {{was set up to}} try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, on independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, and they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states.|$|E

500|$|Throughout much of 2007, Clinton and Giuliani led in {{national}} polls for their parties' respective nominations, and media reports often <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the 2000 [...] "race that wasn't" [...] as {{a preview of}} what might lie in wait for the entire nation in 2008. [...] Such extrapolating ended with the Giuliani campaign's precipitous decline and January 2008 withdrawal. Clinton as well failed to gain the 2008 nomination and, in June 2008, she finished in a close second place to Illinois Senator Barack Obama.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' biographer, Johnny Rogan, {{noted that}} the album [...] "stood alone as a work almost {{completely}} divorced from the prevailing rock culture. Its themes, mood and instrumentation <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> another era {{at a time when}} the rest of America was still recovering from the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy." [...] Ultimately, the Byrds' experimentation with the country genre on Sweetheart of the Rodeo was slightly ahead of its time, to the detriment of the band's commercial fortunes, as the international success of country rock-flavored bands like The Eagles, America and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show during the 1970s demonstrated.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} Etchmiadzin Cathedral—classified as [...] "a four-apsed square with ciborium," [...] and called Էջմիածնատիպ Ejmiatsnatip [...] "Etchmiadzin-type" [...] in Armenian {{architectural}} historiography—was not common in Armenia {{in the early}} Medieval period. The now-destroyed St. Theodore Church of Bagaran, dating from 624 to 631, was the only known church with a significantly similar plan and structure from that period. In the 19th century, during an architectural revival that <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Armenia's past, the plan of Etchmiadzin Cathedral began to be directly copied in new Armenian churches. Some notable examples from this period include the narthex of the St. Thaddeus Monastery in northern Iran, dating from 1811 or 1819–30, and the Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shusha, dating from 1868.|$|E

2500|$|Venizelos {{tried to}} advance his reform {{program in the}} realms of {{political}} and social ideologies, of education, and literature, by adopting practically viable compromises between often conflicting tendencies. In education, for example, the dynamic current in favor of the use of the popular spoken language, dimotiki, provoked conservative reactions, which led to the constitutionally embedded decision (Article 107) in favor of a formal [...] "purified" [...] language, katharevousa, which <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> classical precedents.|$|E
2500|$|In 1789 France {{fell into}} revolution, {{and the world}} has never since been the same. The French Revolution {{was by far the}} most momentous {{upheaval}} of the whole revolutionary age.

From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.|$|E
