In addition, within the above two frameworks, few studies apply stochastic solvency ratio models to predict corporate liquidity crisis.

The solvency ratio model can simulate many solvency ratio paths and then the solvency ratio distributions of each future period. With the information of solvency ratio distribution and the criteria of insolvency (when solvency ratio is less than one), we can obtain both the probability of a company’s short-term credit risk and the expected ratio of <b>liquidity</b> <b>gap</b> in future periods. To perform a multi-period firm’s short-term credit risk analysis, this solvency ratio model needs only publicly available information of corporate finance and the industrial economic state (i. e. the industrial cyclicality information) ...|$|E

A small system is estimated containing eight variables that theoretically have {{an important role in the}} transmission mechanism. The paper then attempts to decompose the movements of each of these variables into a small number of independent underlying forcing processes or 'shocks', with a well-defined economic interpretation. In addition to identifying shocks to productivity, domestic demand, external demand and the foreign exchange risk premium, the paper distinguishes between several types of monetary shock. In particular, a distinction is made between 'permanent' monetary policy shocks, attributable to changes in the underlying nominal target of the authorities, and 'temporary' policy shocks, reflecting either policy 'errors' or transitory deviations from the authorities' reaction function. A financial intermediation shock is also identified reflecting changes in the provision of credit by the banking system and the degree of financial liberalisation. The paper goes on to demonstrate some of the practical uses of the model, which include estimating output and <b>liquidity</b> <b>gaps,</b> historical decompositions of the data and conditional forecasting. ...|$|R

40|$|Liquidity and {{solvency}} {{have been}} called the"heavenly twins"of banking (Goodhart, Charles,'Liquidity Risk Management', Financial Stability Review [...] Special Issue on Liquidity, Banque de France, No. 11, February, 2008). Since these"twins"interact in complex ways, it is difficult [...] particularly at times of crisis [...] to distinguish between them, especially {{in the presence of}} information asymmetries (Information asymmetry occurs when one party has more or better information than the other, creating an imbalance of power, giving rise to adverse selection and moral hazard). An insolvent bank can be liquid or illiquid, and a solvent bank may be at times illiquid. In the latter case, insolvency is not far away, since banking is grounded in information and confidence, and it is confidence which in the end determines liquidity. In other words, liquidity is very much endogenous, determined by the general condition of a bank, as well as the perception of it by the public and market participants. Dealing with liquidity risk is more challenging than dealing with other risks, since liquidity is the result of all the operations of a bank and it is fundamentally a relative concept which compares segments of the balance sheet on the asset and liability sides. It does not deal with absolutes, like arguably the concept of capital and it explains why there is not an internationally recognized"Liquidity Accord". This Working Paper addresses key concepts like market and funding liquidity and basic tools to address liquidity issues like cash flows, <b>liquidity</b> <b>gaps</b> and some selected financial ratios.

40|$|When {{managers}} {{choose not}} to disclose all the relevant information in their possession in their financial statements, there is an information gap between the managers and users and consequently a lack of transparency. We model the degree of transparency observed when disclosures of foreign exchange (FX) risk management in financial statements are compared to managerial information on FX risk management policy, as evidenced in questionnaire responses. In this comparative study of US and UK firms we find incomplete disclosure in both samples but with differing aspects. In the US case, the information gap is lower where the information has higher relevance or firms with higher financial risk (greater leverage) are signalling the extent of risk, but the gap is greater where firms are in competitive product markets. For the UK sample, the information gap is significantly lower where firms have higher financial risk or higher <b>liquidity</b> but the <b>gap</b> is greater where the shares are more closely held.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the role of Shari’ah {{compliant}} sustainable investing in the light of the credit crisis and catastrophic climate change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses that the climate change, natural resource shortages, fuel crisis and global financial crisis, etc. will not go away just because there is a recession. In this regard, Shari’ah compliant finance has a broader responsibility to consider societal goals and should be preparing for the post-credit crunch world. The paper evaluates the performance of Shari’ah compliant sustainable funds using the traditional measures of performance in relation to risk-adjusted benchmarks to see if there is any ethical effect. Findings – The paper advocates that preventing future market meltdowns and avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a new era of longterism in Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The study assesses the performance of the Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The result shows that Shari’ah compliant funds outperformed the conventional benchmark and therefore, the challenge for Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing is not to become like conventional investing but, rather, to replace. Research limitations/implications – Shari’ah compliant sustainable finance is a recent phenomena and therefore, rigorous analytical predication of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing variables are at present not possible using evolutionary and complex system approaches; however, such system can be fruitfully studied in future through simulation methods and certain types of econometric modeling when the long-term data will be made available. Originality/value – As the credit crunch has evolved into a full-blown economic crisis, many have turned to the Shari’ah compliant finance to provide a route map out of recession. With an increasing number of conventional banks and corporations struggling to find funds to support their businesses, Shari’ah compliant financial institutions represent a potential solution to bridge the <b>liquidity</b> <b>gap</b> in the global markets.

40|$|The common wisdom argues that, in general, large trades cause large price changes, while small trades cause {{small price}} changes. However, for {{extremely}} large price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the <b>liquidity</b> (especially price <b>gaps</b> on the limit order book) {{is a more}} influencing factor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price impacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price variations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the trade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the outstanding volumes at the bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of prices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these microscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled trades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled trades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have quantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up to 44 % of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high liquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a large price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a more influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. Our results shed new lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{underlying}} causes of the debt crisis that only surfaced with Mexico’s unilateral moratorium on her foreign obligations in 1982. The paper investigates the evolutionary trend of LDC debt and the consequences for lenders, borrowers and the international financial system. The motivation of the research is to develop sound analytical understanding of the mechanics of debt accumulation as groundwork for further study of macroeconomics of debt and debt relief. The paper observes that the third world’s debt crisis resulted from an exponential increase in external indebtedness disproportionate to the debt service capacities of developing countries. The collapse of commodity prices, high interest rates and appreciation of the US $ further tightened their internal fiscal positions and balance of payments, forcing them to re-finance maturing debt from fresh loans. The paper also observes that western bankers ignored signals of an imminent debt crisis and worsened the debt portfolio of third world countries by refinancing maturing loans with shorter maturities. These countries remained {{on the brink of}} default until convergence of multiple maturities and inadequate availability of new finance caused a capital reversal. The paper argues that although developing countries had used some of the loans to finance unproductive investments [including militarization] the lenders also brought the crisis upon themselves as a result of ‘obsession’ lending aimed at offloading surplus petro-dollars deposited in western banks by oil exporting countries. Although lending was justified by apprehension to fearful consequences for world trade and political stability [if the purchasing power of the third world evaporated as a result of discontinuation of lending] the paper emphasizes the role of ‘uncritical herd instincts’ of lenders in the debt crisis. The paper concludes that the failure of the loans represent miscalculations on both sides of a transaction and distortions in the lending process itself, hence the debt crisis deserved mutual cooperation of the lenders and the borrowers. However, the closure of all financial markets to defaulting economies prevaricated cooperative resolution and, in fact, precipitated the crisis. The paper emphasizes that developing country economies are fatally dysfunctional with long standing ills that are only concealed by capital inflows; hence unilateral action of lenders in halting the supply of finance while demanding repayments opens a <b>liquidity</b> <b>gap</b> resulting in consistent economic contraction. international economics, debt, third world, debt crisis. lending, borrowing, foreign debt, external debt...|$|E
