5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale <b>lettuce</b> production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} <b>lettuce,</b> with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem <b>lettuce</b> in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, <b>lettuce</b> becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} iceberg <b>lettuce,</b> 95 percent of the <b>lettuce</b> grown and consumed in the US was crisphead <b>lettuce.</b> By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem <b>lettuce</b> was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.|$|E
5|$|Due to its short {{lifespan}} after harvest, <b>lettuce</b> {{was originally}} sold relatively {{close to where}} it was grown. The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of <b>lettuce</b> and resulted in a significant increase in availability. During the 1950s, <b>lettuce</b> production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of <b>lettuce,</b> replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
40|$|In preemergence (PREE) {{herbicide}} testing, {{all three}} <b>lettuces,</b> head, romaine, and red leaf, exhibited some tolerance to carfentrazone, sulfentrazone, flumetsulam, rimsulfuron, and thifensulfuron while giving effective weed control. In postemergence (POST) testing, cloransulam and flumetsulam controlled weeds {{at the lowest}} applied rates while <b>lettuces</b> were safe to cloransulam at 0. 01 lb AI/A and flumetsulam at 0. 03 lb AI/A. Imazamox was safe on <b>lettuces</b> at 0. 01 lb AI/A and controlled weeds at 0. 007 lb AI/A. For broccoli, sulfentrazone, fluroxypyr, and thifensulfuron applied PREE demonstrated reasonable safety and weed control. Cloransulam, flumetsulam, and fluroxypyr applied POST on broccoli exhibited adequate crop safety and good weed control...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} is to assess the {{microbiological}} impact of irrigation water on <b>lettuces</b> produced on two urban agricultural sites and sold on markets; 6 and 7 %, respectively, of <b>lettuces</b> coming from the sites of Pikine and Patte d’Oie were Salmonella spp. positive. <b>Lettuces</b> irrigated with shallow groundwater (‘‘Ce´anes’’ water) were more contaminated (8 % at both Pikine and Patte d’Oie sites) compared to those irrigated with wastewater (4 % at Pikine) or well water (5 % at Patte d’Oie). As for the <b>lettuces</b> in marketplaces, their contamination seems {{to depend on the}} type of treatment occurring before sale. <b>Lettuces</b> previously washed in the ‘‘Ce´anes’’ were more contaminated than those rinsed with tap water at the marketplace. Salmonella spp. have been isolated from all marketplaces. However, the rates of contamination in markets surrounding Patte d’Oie are higher (9 and 11 % at Grand Yoff and Dalifort) than those surrounding Pikine (4 and 2 % at Zinc and Sham) or Rufisque, the control (2 %). Our results confirm that the reuse of wastewater in irrigation is an alternative to animal manure. Its risk of microbial contamination can be significantly reduced by washing the vegetables with tap water before they are sold...|$|R
5|$|<b>Lettuce</b> also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, <b>lettuce</b> drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding <b>lettuce</b> tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated <b>lettuce</b> is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted <b>lettuce</b> (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen <b>lettuce</b> and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lettuce</b> {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head <b>lettuce,</b> loose-leaf <b>lettuce,</b> and romaine (or cos) <b>lettuce.</b> <b>Lettuce</b> was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lettuce</b> is {{the only}} member of the Lactuca genus to be grown commercially. Although China is the top world {{producer}} of <b>lettuce,</b> the majority of the crop is consumed domestically. Spain is the world's largest exporter of <b>lettuce,</b> with the US ranking second.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lettuce</b> {{was first}} {{cultivated}} {{by the ancient}} Egyptians who turned it from a weed whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. <b>Lettuce</b> spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name , from which the English <b>lettuce</b> is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and <b>lettuce</b> appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|$|E
5|$|A BLT (Bacon, <b>Lettuce,</b> and Tomato) {{is a type}} {{of bacon}} sandwich. The {{standard}} BLT is made up of four ingredients: bacon, <b>lettuce,</b> tomato, and bread.

However, despite {{high levels of}} bacteria being found on ready-to-eat <b>lettuce</b> products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (<b>lettuce)</b> genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly <b>lettuce.</b> L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated <b>lettuce.</b> <b>Lettuce</b> is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} of <b>lettuce</b> {{over the}} centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of <b>lettuce</b> is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns. However, genetically modified <b>lettuce</b> is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
