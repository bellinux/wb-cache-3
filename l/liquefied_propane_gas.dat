40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{focuses on the}} study of the {{dispersion}} and combustion of a vapor cloud resulting from the escape of LNG and LPG. The consumption of natural gas and LPG is clearly growing, and is based on multiple storage facilities and different types of transport. The possibility of a release and the subsequent vapor cloud formation is significant. The application of appropriate measures to ensure safety in terminals and facilities related to these products is essential to the community safety. An important aspect is the management of the emergency once the cloud has reached the stationary state (the time to reach this state depends on wind velocity, but is usually very short). In this situation, any information about the position of the flammable region of the cloud can be very helpful. A historical analysis of accidents involving vapor cloud fires has been carried out. 176 accidents have been analyzed, which have yielded information on the causes, origins and consequences of such events. A dispersion safety factor (DSF) has been proposed as a tool to help in the decision process under these circumstances. The parameter DSF is the ratio between the distance reached by the lower flammability limit and that of the visible cloud. The results obtained for the dispersion safety factor with the DEGADIS code agree fairly well with the evidence from experimental data obtained at large scale. This factor is strongly dependent on the atmospheric relative humidity. Thus, when high relative humidity prevails, the cloud will be visible for some distance beyond the flammable region (DSF 1). In this case, the flammable vapor cloud will not be visible at the location of any potential ignition source. Two expressions have been proposed to estimate the parameter DSF for a release of LNG according to the range of HR. The same treatment has also been applied to the case of a spill of <b>liquefied</b> <b>propane</b> <b>gas</b> cooled at atmospheric pressure. With respect to the combustion of the flammable vapor cloud, a new expression has been obtained, which determines the flame speed {{as a function of the}} wind speed, based on various large scale tests conducted with LNG between 1968 and 1982; this expression gives a better fit for high wind speeds. A relatively simple model of the flash fire has been developed based on the dispersion of the cloud as a function of fuel properties and atmospheric conditions (stability and wind velocity). The size of the flames will depend on the size of the cloud, being higher that the latter. It has been observed from the available data experiments, that the flame height increases proportionally to the visible cloud. Postprint (published version...|$|E

30|$|The seismic {{response}} of tanks {{has been widely}} studied in the past, starting from the pioneering studies of Housner (1957, 1963). In particular, Housner (1957) first presented the simplified formulae to compute the dynamic pressures developed on accelerated liquid containers and successively (Housner 1963) studied the dynamic behavior of ground-supported elevated water tanks considering equivalent spring–mass systems. Current practice for the seismic design of storage tanks is mainly based on Appendix E of API 650 (2007) standard and on Eurocode 8 (1998). Generally speaking, {{there are many different}} types of equipment used for the storage of liquids and gases. The characteristics of the different tanks adopted mainly depend on: (a) the quantity of fluid being stored, (b) the nature of the fluid, (c) the physical state of the fluid and (d) the temperature and pressure. In industrial plants, gases are usually stored under high-pressure, often in liquid form since the volume is largely reduced. Spherical storage is preferred for storage of high-pressure fluids. A sphere is usually characterized by even distribution of stresses on the surface and by the smaller surface area per unit volume than any other shapes. These tanks are usually named Horton sphere and are used for storage of compressed <b>gases</b> such as <b>propane,</b> <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> or butane in a liquid–gas stage.|$|R

Clean Cities contributes to the energy, environmental, and economic security of the United States by supporting local decisions to reduce our dependence on imported petroleum. Established in 1993 {{in response to the}} Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, the partnership provides tools and resources for voluntary, community-centered programs to reduce consumption of petroleum-based fuels. In nearly 100 coalitions, government agencies and private companies voluntarily come together under the umbrella of Clean Cities. The partnership helps all parties identify mutual interests and meet the objectives of reducing the use of petroleum, developing regional economic opportunities, and improving air quality. Clean Cities deploys technologies and practices developed by VTP. These include idle-reduction equipment, electric-drive vehicles, fuel economy measures, and renewable and alternative fuels, such as natural <b>gas,</b> <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> (<b>propane),</b> electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and biogas.
