5|$|Black Hawk {{and most}} {{of the leaders of the}} British Band were not {{immediately}} captured following the conclusion of hostilities. On 20 August, Sauk and Fox under Keokuk turned over Neapope and several other British Band chiefs to Winfield Scott at Fort Armstrong. Black Hawk, however, remained elusive. After fleeing the battle scene with White Cloud and a small group of warriors, Black Hawk had moved northeast toward the headwaters of the <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> River. The group camped for a few days and was eventually counseled by a group of Ho-Chunk, which included White Cloud's brother, to surrender. Though they initially resisted the pleas for surrender, the group eventually traveled to the Ho-Chunk village at <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> and prepared to surrender. On 27 August 1832, Black Hawk, White Cloud and the remnants of the British Band surrendered to Joseph M. Street at Prairie du Chien.|$|E

5|$|By 13 January, {{all of the}} French fleet {{had been}} {{accounted}} for except the small brig Mutine, which was blown {{all the way to}} Santa Cruz and was captured there in July, and the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme. Droits de l'Homme had been among the ships under Bouvet in Bantry Bay and then with those that carried on to the Shannon, but as the fleet broke up she became separated. With provisions running low and landings still impossible, Captain Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse determined to return to France independently. Progress was slow as Droits de l'Homme was overloaded with 1,300 men, including 800 soldiers under General Jean Humbert. She was further delayed when she encountered and captured a small British privateer named Cumberland. As a result, <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> had only reached Ushant by 13 January, where he encountered the same fog that had enabled Révolution and Fraternité to reach safety.|$|E
5|$|Warhop {{was born}} in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi-professional teams {{sponsored}} by the railway company. He drew the attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin–Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82–20 win–lost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29–7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{acquired}} Wisconsin in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Massachusetts {{claimed the}} territory {{east of the}} Mississippi River between the present-day Wisconsin-Illinois border and present-day <b>La</b> <b>Crosse,</b> Wisconsin. Virginia claimed the territory north of <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> to Lake Superior and all of present-day Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. Shortly afterward, in 1787, the Americans made Wisconsin {{part of the new}} Northwest Territory. Later, in 1800, Wisconsin became part of Indiana Territory. Despite the fact that Wisconsin belonged to the United States at this time, the British continued to control the local fur trade and maintain military alliances with Wisconsin Indians.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding {{a line of}} crawler tractors. In 1929, it {{acquired the}} <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> Plow Works of <b>La</b> <b>Crosse,</b> Wisconsin. The <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him {{to think about the}} use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.|$|E

Past Herington, K-4 continued east on modern U.S. Route 56 to Council Grove, where it then followed {{a series of}} now unnumbered roadways to rejoin its present alignment at Eskridge. From Eskridge to west of Topeka, K-4 was identical to its current routing; however, {{at the intersection of}} SW Auburn Road and SW 21st Street, where K-4 currently continues north to access Interstate 70, K-4 turned east, following SW 21st Street into Topeka. At Topeka Boulevard, K-4 turned north, following the street out of the city.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the incessant}} criticism, Carpenter {{was seen as}} being easily re-elected in 1875. Nevertheless, a {{surprise}} bolt by disgruntled Republicans combined with votes by calculating Democrats resulted in the election of Angus Cameron, a <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> Republican.|$|E

25|$|Some {{priests in}} the Diocese of <b>La</b> <b>Crosse</b> {{have claimed that}} Burke's {{leadership}} there was divisive.
