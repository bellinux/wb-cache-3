50|$|In linguistics, {{critical}} <b>language</b> <b>awareness</b> (CLA) {{refers to}} an understanding of social, political, and ideological aspects of language, linguistic variation, and discourse. It functions as a pedagogical application of a critical discourse analysis (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice. Critical <b>language</b> <b>awareness</b> as a part of language education teaches students how to analyze the language that they and others use. More specifically, critical <b>language</b> <b>awareness</b> is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance.|$|E

30|$|To further {{confirm the}} {{findings}} obtained by Bardovi-Harlig et al. (2015), Peters and Pauwels (2015) explored whether vocabulary-focused instruction, {{in which the}} formulaic sequences are the explicit focus of teaching, {{has the potential to}} boost <b>language</b> learners’ <b>awareness</b> and use of academic formulaic sequences or not. The participants in the study were 29 Dutch-speaking learners of English as a foreign language at a Flemish Dutch-medium university in Belgium. The intervention was organized in three consecutive weeks. The learning materials that were used in the intervention consisted of two types of activities: recognition activities and cued output activities. The activities were designed according to the principle of ‘focus on forms’ vocabulary instruction or explicit vocabulary learning. Three types of tests at different levels of sensitivity were developed: a recognition test, a cued output test, and a writing test. The three tests were used as pre-test and post-test. Finally, language learners’ end-of-year assignments were also analyzed {{in terms of the number}} of formulaic sequences used. The findings of the study suggested that explicit vocabulary-focused instruction of academic formulaic sequences has the potential to boost <b>language</b> learners’ <b>awareness,</b> cued output, and spontaneous use of formulaic sequences.|$|R
