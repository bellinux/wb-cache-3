25|$|The neuron {{doctrine}} is the now fundamental idea that neurons {{are the basic}} structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century.

40|$|A IF-FISH {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} characterize <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> populations within complex dental plaque samples.

50|$|However, {{the theory}} was refuted by later {{observations}} of a Spanish pathologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, using a staining technique discovered by Golgi, {{which showed that}} nervous tissue, like other tissues, is made of <b>discrete</b> <b>cells.</b> This neuron doctrine {{turned out to be}} the correct description of the nervous system, whereas the reticular theory was discredited.|$|R
40|$|The {{striatum}} {{contributes to}} many cognitive processes and disorders, but its cell types are incompletely characterized. We show that microfluidic and FACS-based single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse striatum provides a well-resolved classification of striatal cell type diversity. Transcriptome analysis revealed ten differentiated, distinct cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal, immune, and vascular cells, and enabled {{the discovery of}} numerous marker genes. Furthermore, we identified two discrete subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that have specific markers and that overexpress genes linked to cognitive disorders and addiction. We also describe continuous cellular identities, which increase heterogeneity within <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> types. Finally, we identified cell type-specific transcription and splicing factors that shape cellular identities by regulating splicing and expression patterns. Our findings suggest that functional diversity within a complex tissue arises from {{a small number of}} <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> types, which can exist in a continuous spectrum of functional states...|$|R

Unlike other poriferans, hexactinellids do not possess the ability to contract. Another unique feature of glassy sponges is that their tissues are made up almost entirely of syncytia.

40|$|Olfactory bulb periglomerular (PG) {{cells are}} {{heterogeneous}} {{with respect to}} several features, including morphology, connectivity, patterns of protein expression, and electrophysiological properties. However, these features rarely correlate with one another, suggesting that the differentiating properties of PG cells may arise from multiple independent adaptive variables rather than representing <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> classes. We use computational modeling to assess this hypothesis with respect to electrophysiological properties. Specifically, we show that the heterogeneous electrophysiological properties demonstrated in PG cell recordings can be explained solely by differences in the relative expression levels of ion channel species in the cell, without recourse to modifying channel kinetic properties themselves. This PG cell model can therefore {{be used as the}} basis for diverse cellular and network-level analyses of olfactory bulb computations. Moreover, this simple basis for heterogeneity contributes to an emerging hypothesis that glomerular-layer interneurons may be better described as a single population expressing distributions of partially independent, potentially plastic properties, rather than as a set of <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> classes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Today, many {{chips are}} {{designed}} with predefined <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> libraries. In this paper we present a new fast gate sizing algorithm that works natively with <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> choices and realistic timing models. The approach iteratively assigns signal slew targets to all source pins of the chip and chooses discrete layouts of minimum size preserving the slew targets. Using slew targets instead of delay budgets, accurate estimates for the input slews are available during the sizing step. Slew targets are updated by {{an estimate of the}} local slew gradient. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we propose a new heuristic to estimate lower bounds for the worst path delay. On average, we violate these bounds by 6 %. A subsequent local search decreases this gap quickly to 2 %. This two-stage approach is capable of sizing designs with more than 5. 8 million cells within 2. 5 hours and thus helping to decrease turn-around times of multi-million cell designs. I...|$|R

For example, a multipotent blood stem cell is a hematopoietic cell (HSC)—and this cell type can differentiate itself into several types of blood cell types like lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, etc., {{but it is still}} ambiguous whether HSC possess the ability to differente into brain cells, bone cells or other non-blood cell types (need citation).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis is aimed at the elucidation {{of the role of}} the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in hippocampal neuroplasticity and functioning. To achieve this, we have developed a novel method to specifically knockdown GR in a <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> population of the mouse brain. In this thesis I report silencing of GR expression selectively in a population of neuronal progenitors and immature neurons of the dentate gyrus, using RNA-interference (RNAi) delivered by a lentiviral vector. Characterization of these cells resulted in the discovery that GR knockdown causes a striking modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and remodelling of hippocampal circuitry. Functional studies further revealed consequences of GR knockdown for contextual memory performance and behavioural coping strategies during stressful conditions. The results demonstrate the feasibility to apply RNAi in <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> populations for study of the action mechanism of glucocorticoids underlying control of neuroplasticity and behaviour.

Vector is one of the important types of spatial data, only by discretization, can it be applied in grids system to make process and analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{to select a}} good set of gate sizes for the primitive gates of a standard cell library. A measurement error on a gate is dened to quantify the discrepancy resulting from replacing the size required by a synthesis sizing algorithm with a size available in a <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> library. The criterion for gate size selection {{is a set of}} gate sizes that minimizes the cumulative error of a prescribed measurement. Optimal solutions to the gate size selection problem targetting size and delay measurements are presented for cases when the probability distribution and the delay equations are simple. A realistic probability distribution is obtained using a sample space of gates derived fromagroup of designs that is synthesized under the semi-custom synthesis methodology [1]. A -match &quot; (minimizing delay error) and a &quot; (minimizing size error) set of gate sizes are obtained numerically, and are subsequently realized as <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> libraries. The previous group of designs are synthesized using the two selected cell libraries and two other cell libraries, one with -spacing &quot; of cell sizes and the other with -spacing &quot; of cell sizes. The -match &quot; library gives the best overall slack and area results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Laser capture microdissection {{enables the}} {{isolation}} of single cells or small cell groups from histological sections under direct microscopic observation. Combined with quantitative PCR or microarray, {{it is a very}} powerful approach for studying gene expression profiles in <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> populations. The major challenge for such studies is to obtain good quality RNA from small amounts of starting material. Results We have developed a simple, flexible, and low-cost method for simultaneously producing RNA from <b>discrete</b> <b>cell</b> groups in embryonic day 15 mouse brain. In particular, we have optimized the following key steps in the procedure: staining, cryosectioning, storage of sections and harvesting of microdissected cells. We obtained the best results when staining 20 μm-thick sections with 1 % cresyl violet in 70 % ethanol and harvesting the microdissected tissue in RNA stabilization solution. In addition, we introduced three stop-points in the protocol which makes the tedious process of laser capture microdissection more flexible, without compromising RNA quality. Conclusion Using this optimized method, we have consistently obtained RNA of high quality from all four simultaneously microdissected cell groups. RNA integrity numbers were all above 8, and long cDNA fragments (> 1. 2 kb) were successfully amplified by reverse transcription PCR from all four samples. We conclude that RNAs isolated by this method are well suited for downstream quantitative PCR or microarray studies. </p...|$|R
