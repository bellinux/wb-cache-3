5|$|Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector, {{which was}} usually run by oligopolies of old family firms and {{required}} political connections to prosper {{was faced with}} foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, focusing on designing new products and relying on low <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and technology.|$|E
5|$|Faced with {{increasing}} competition from Japan and elsewhere, {{and the need}} to cut <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and invest heavily in order to counteract this, in 1966 J B S Gabriel recommended the group be taken over. TI made an offer to buy the company and its subsidiaries for the sterling equivalent of US$30M and in 1967, as a TI company and with the Gabriels no longer involved, it announced an export order of gear processing machine tools to the USSR worth £1.8M.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with the influx of immigrants.|$|E

5|$|Open-air cages {{installed}} in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in the life expectancy of its residents, but the potential for expansion and improvement after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing dilapidation. The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new Gibbon Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.|$|E
5|$|With urban regeneration, high-value {{service sector}} {{industries}} such as corporate services and financial services haven taken root in Northern England, with major hubs around Leeds and Manchester. Call centres – attracted by low <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and a preference for Northern English accents among the public – have replaced heavy industry as major employers of unskilled workers, with more than 5% of workers in all Northern England regions working in one.|$|E
5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs.</b> German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|Increasing labour export {{from the}} Philippines {{coincided with the}} {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

50|$|In {{this method}} cost is absorbed as {{a percent of}} the <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> or the wages. (Overhead cost/Labour cost)x 100If the <b>Labour</b> <b>cost</b> is 5000 and the {{overhead}} cost is 1000 then the absorption cost is 20%. If the <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> of one job is 500 it will have to absorb 20% i.e. 100 as the overhead cost making the total cost to be 600. This method can be used in service industry where the major input is the skilled or unskilled labour. For the proper calculation labour rates need to be constant and the skill and efficiency of the labourer need to be identical.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{makes two}} simple points. First, labour demand depends on product wage or <b>labour</b> <b>cost.</b> Hence, demand-side {{explanations}} for the rise in inequalities such as skill-biased technical change and job polarization should be tested using data on <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> and not net wage or posted wage. Contrary to previous studies, we find evidence of skill-biased technical change in France when we measure wage inequality in terms of <b>labour</b> <b>cost.</b> In that respect, France is no exception. Second, the French case provides a clear evidence that changes in taxation can have very significant effect in converting market inequalities into consumption or net wages inequalities. In France, net wage inequalities have decreased by about 10 %, while <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> inequalities have increased by 15 % over the 1976 - 2010 period. This fact provides support both for the supporters of the skill-biased technical change explanations of the secular increase in wage inequalities, as well to {{those who believe that}} institutions could have significant impact on inequalities in disposable incomes...|$|R
25|$|Another {{factor for}} the losses was poor revenue management. MAS {{substantially}} lagged its peers on yield. Some of this gap was {{due to differences in}} traffic mix, with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and revenue management, sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Morever, MAS had one of the lowest <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> per available seat kilometres (ASK) at USD0.41, compared to other airlines such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines at USD0.59 and USD0.60 respectively. Despite low <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> however, the ratio of ASK revenue to this cost was, at 2.8, much lower than Singapore Airlines, where the ratio is 5.0, and slightly higher than Thai Airways There are other factors listed in the later-revealed Business Turnaround Plan of Malaysia Airlines, all leading to the net loss of RM1.3 billion in the year 2005.|$|E
