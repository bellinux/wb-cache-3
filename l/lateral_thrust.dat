25|$|In medieval Europe, bridge {{builders}} improved on the Roman structures {{by using}} narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios on bridges. Gothic pointed arches were also introduced, reducing <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust,</b> and spans increased {{as with the}} eccentric Puente del Diablo (1282).|$|E
25|$|Constructions {{such as the}} {{acclaimed}} Florentine segmental arch bridge Ponte Vecchio (1345) combined sound engineering (span-to-rise ratio of over 5.3 to 1) with aesthetical appeal. The three elegant arches of the Renaissance Ponte Santa Trinita (1569) constitute the oldest elliptic arch bridge worldwide. Such low rising structures required massive abutments, which at the Venetian Rialto bridge and the Fleischbrücke in Nuremberg (span-to-rise ratio 6.4:1) were founded on thousands of wooden piles, partly rammed obliquely into the grounds to counteract more effectively the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vault (French voûte, from Italian volta) is an {{architectural}} term for an arched form {{used to provide}} a space with a ceiling or roof. The parts of a vault exert <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> that requires a counter resistance. When vaults are built underground, the ground gives all the resistance required. However, when the vault is built above ground, various replacements are employed to supply the needed resistance. An example is the thicker walls used {{in the case of}} barrel or continuous vaults. Buttresses are used to supply resistance when intersecting vaults are employed.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{the size}} of the windows meant {{reducing}} the wall area considerably, something which was made possible only by the extensive use of flying buttresses on the outside. These buttresses supported the considerable <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusts</b> resulting from the 34m high stone vaults, higher and wider than any attempted before in France. These vaults were quadripartite, each bay split into four webs by two diagonally crossing ribs, unlike the sexpartite vaults adopted in many earlier Gothic cathedrals such as at Laon.|$|R
60|$|Clearly, {{dead weight}} {{can only be}} {{resisted}} by the buttress acting as a prop; for a buttress on the side of, or towards the weight, would only add to its effect. This, then, forms the first great class of buttressed architecture; <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusts,</b> of roofing or arches, being met by props of masonry outside--the thrust from within, the prop without; or the crushing force of water on a ship's side met by its cross timbers--the thrust here from without the wall, the prop within.|$|R
50|$|This, however, came at {{the cost}} of high <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusts</b> even for a {{segmental}} arch bridge. This problem was solved by a particularly innovative construction of the abutments which were built onto 2000 wooden piles, 400 of which were rammed obliquely into the grounds. A very similar arrangement of the abutments had also been implemented slightly earlier at the Rialto bridge, leading to speculations about a technology transfer from Venice, with which Nuremberg shared close trade links. A recent in-depth research, however, stresses the originality of the Fleisch Bridge on grounds of technical differences between the two bridges.|$|R
25|$|The main façade of {{the church}} faces onto the Via del Quirinale (formerly the Via Pia), as does Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane further down the road. Unlike San Carlo, Sant’Andrea is set back from {{the street and the}} space outside the church is {{enclosed}} by low curved quadrant walls. An oval cylinder encases the dome, and large volutes transfer the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust.</b> The main façade to the street has an aedicular pedimented frame at the center of which a semicircular porch with two Ionic columns marks the main entrance. Above the porch entablature is the heraldic coat of arms of the Pamphili patron.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, of course, to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel {{down the length of}} the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E

2500|$|The {{landside}} is {{the flat}} plate which presses against and transmits the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> of the plough bottom to the furrow wall. It helps {{to resist the}} side pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the mouldboard. It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the furrow sole, is known as heel [...] A heel iron is bolted {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E

Substituting {{walls or}} pillars for the brackets, we may carry the {{projection}} as far out as we choose, and form the perfect porch, {{either of the}} cottage or village church, or of the cathedral. As we enlarge the structure, however, certain modifications of form become necessary, owing to the increased boldness of the required supporting arch. For, as {{the lower end of}} the gabled roof and of the arch cannot coincide, we have necessarily above the shafts one of the two forms a or b, in Fig. L., of which the latter is clearly the best, requiring less masonry and shorter roofing; and when the arch becomes so large as to cause a heavy <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust,</b> it may become necessary to provide for its farther safety by pinnacles, c.|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. It is, however, {{very seldom}} that lateral force in {{architecture}} is equally distributed. In {{most cases the}} weight of the roof, or the force of any <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust,</b> are more or less confined to certain points and directions. In an early state of architectural science this definiteness of direction is not yet clear, and it is met by uncertain application of mass or strength in the buttress, sometimes by mere thickening of the wall into square piers, which are partly piers, partly buttresses, as in Norman keeps and towers. But as science advances, the weight to be borne is designedly and decisively thrown upon certain points; the direction and degree of the forces which are then received are exactly calculated, and met by conducting buttresses of the smallest possible dimensions; themselves, in their turn, supported by vertical buttresses acting by weight, and these perhaps, in their turn, by another set of conducting buttresses: so that, in the best examples of such arrangements, the weight to be borne may be considered as the shock of an electric fluid, which, by a hundred different rods and channels, is divided and carried away into the ground.|$|E
50|$|The tendency, {{especially}} of fold mountains (e. g. the Cordilleras) to produce roughly parallel chains {{is due to}} their rock structure and the propulsive forces of plate tectonics. The uplifted rock masses are either magmatic plutonic rocks, easily shaped because of their higher temperature, or sediments or metamorphic rocks, which have a less robust structure, that are deposited in the synclines. As a result of orogenic movements, strata of folded rock are formed that are crumpled out of their original horizontal plane and thrust against one another. The longitudinal stretching of the folds takes place {{at right angles to}} the direction of the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting.</b> The overthrust folds of a nappe belt (e.g. the Central Alps) are formed in a similar way.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stability}} of earth retaining structures in flood prone areas {{has become a}} serious problem in many countries. The two most basic causes of failure arising from flooding are scouring and erosion of {{the foundation of the}} superstructure. Hence, a number of structures like bridges employ scour-arresting devices, e. g., gabions to acting on the piers and abutments during flooding. Research was therefore undertaken to improve gabion resistance against lateral movement by means of an interlocking configuration instead of the conventional stack-and-pair system. This involved simulating <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusts</b> against two dimensionally identical retaining wall systems configured according to the rectangular and hexagonal gabion type. The evolution of deformation observed suggested that the interlocking design exhibits better structural integrity than the conventional box gabion-based wall in resisting lateral movement and therefore warrants consideration for use as an appropriate scour-arresting device for earth retaining structures...|$|R
40|$|Taxonomies are {{a useful}} method for {{providing}} structure when grouping {{large numbers of}} individual near-earth space objects in near-Earth orbits. In particular, <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting,</b> longitudinal thrusting, and drifting may be directly linked to detectable changes in the orbital elements that affect object location and orientation. The purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} fully-automated taxonomy of the geosynchronous objects based on dynamical principles. Groups of objects are found using clustering methods; as such, two clustering methods are compared for constructing the taxonomy. The first is an adaptive k-means algorithm that does not require a priori information. It is compared to an agglomerative clustering algorithm that utilizes limits on cluster sizes to form distinct clusters. The effectiveness of the automated taxonomy is determined by comparison with the European Space Agency 2 ̆ 7 s DISCOS database and clusters from the Geosynchronous yearly report. ...|$|R
60|$|The most remarkable, however, of all {{the wonders}} of Babylon--though perhaps not built till after Cyrus's time--were what were called the hanging gardens. Although called the hanging gardens, they were not {{suspended}} in any manner, as the name might denote, but were supported upon arches and walls. The arches and walls sustained a succession of terraces, rising one above another, with broad flights of steps for ascending to them, and on these terraces the gardens were made. The upper terrace, or platform, was several hundred feet from the ground; so high, {{that it was necessary}} to build arches upon arches within, in order to attain the requisite elevation. The <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> of these arches was sustained by a wall twenty-five feet in thickness, which surrounded the garden on all sides, and rose as high as the lowermost tier of arches, upon which would, of course, be concentrated the pressure and weight {{of all the}} pile. The whole structure thus formed a sort of artificial hill, square in form, and rising, in a succession of terraces, to a broad and level area upon the top. The extent of this grand square upon the summit was four hundred feet upon each side.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. When porches of this kind, {{carried by}} walls, are placed close together, as {{in cases where}} there are many and large entrances to a cathedral front, they would, in their general form, leave deep and uncomfortable intervals, in which damp would lodge and grass grow; {{and there would be}} a painful feeling in {{approaching}} the door {{in the midst of a}} crowd, as if some of them might miss the real doors, and be driven into the intervals, and embayed there. Clearly it will be a natural and right expedient, in such cases, to open the walls of the porch wider, so that they may correspond in slope, or nearly so, with the bevel of the doorway, and either meet each other in the intervals, or have the said intervals closed up with an intermediate wall, so that nobody may get embayed in them. The porches will thus be united, and form one range of great open gulphs or caverns, ready to receive all comers, and direct the current of the crowd into the narrower entrances. As the <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> of the arches is now met by each other, the pinnacles, if there were any, must be removed, and waterspouts placed between each arch to discharge the double drainage of the gables. This is the form of all the noble northern porches, without exception, best represented by that of Rheims.|$|E
60|$|Each male animal {{uses his}} weapons {{in his own}} {{peculiar}} fashion. The common ram makes a charge and butts with such force with the bases of his horns, that I have seen a powerful man knocked over as easily as a child. Goats and certain species of sheep, for instance the Ovis cycloceros of Afghanistan,[305] rear on their hind legs, and then not only butt, but “make a cut down and a jerk up, with the ribbed front of their scimitar-shaped horn, as with a sabre. When the O. cycloceros attacked a large domestic ram, who was a noted bruiser, he conquered him by the sheer novelty of his mode of fighting, always closing at once with his adversary, and catching him across the face and nose with a sharp drawing jerk of his head, and then bounding {{out of the way}} before the blow could be returned.” In Pembrokeshire a male goat, the master of a flock which during several generations had run wild, was known to have killed several other males in single combat; this goat possessed enormous horns, measuring 39 inches in a straight line from tip to tip. The common bull, as every one knows, gores and tosses his opponent; but the Italian buffalo is said never to use his horns, he gives a tremendous blow with his convex forehead, and then tramples on his fallen enemy with his knees—an instinct which the common bull does not possess.[306] Hence a dog who pins a buffalo by the nose is immediately crushed. We must, however, remember that the Italian buffalo has long been domesticated, and {{it is by no means}} certain that the wild parent-form had similarly shaped horns. Mr. Bartlett informs me that when a female Cape buffalo (Bubalus caffer) was turned into an enclosure with a bull of the same species, she attacked him, and he in return pushed her about with great violence. But it was manifest to Mr. Bartlett that had not the bull shewn dignified forbearance, he could easily have killed her by a single <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust</b> with his immense horns. The giraffe uses his short hair-covered horns, which are rather longer in the male than in the female, in a curious manner; for with his long neck he swings his head to either side, almost upside down, with such force, that I have seen a hard plank deeply indented by a single blow.|$|E
40|$|Metallic tendons are {{frequently}} used in arches and vaults {{to absorb the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting</b> forces due to gravity loads or inertial forces caused by an earthquake. Traditional tendons, however, have some limitations (e. g. sensitivity to temperature variations, buckling under compression, etc.). Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{can be used to}} enhance the performances of metallic tendons both in service and seismic conditions. This is achieved with the tensioning control block (TCB) system. The basic components of TCB are pre-strained superelastic SMA wires, in series with the metallic tendon. The number and diameter of the SMA wires is selected based on the force levels to reach. The length is optimised with respect to the thermal behavior of the system. A number of theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to fully understand the thermal and mechanical behavior of TCB. In the paper, the main outcomes of these studies are described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Basal Unit of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex {{preserves}} {{evidence of}} a protracted deformation and accretion history. The earliest recognizable events record the construction of ocean crust and the generation of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex in a slow-spreading ridge-axis environment. The initial stages of deformation involved {{the development of a}} sub-horizontal crustal-scale shear zone and its progressive deformation by ductile thrusting and folding. Subsequent deformation progressed with the out-of-sequence stacking of ocean lithosphere in which detachment, initiated at mid-crustal levels, culminated in mantle decoupling as thrust slices were derived from progressively deeper crustal levels. The progressive emplacement of a coherent slice of ocean lithosphere over previously accreted units and the generation of a dynamothermal aureole are consistent with models suggesting rapid overthrusting of young ocean lithosphere. Evidence from the dynamothermal aureole indicates that syn-emplacement extensional collapse of the complex occurred in response to thrust loading. Foreland-directed oVsliding and <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting</b> mark the final stages in the collapse of the complex...|$|R
40|$|A large section {{near the}} village of Hongurei on the Pechora River, ca. 100 km inland from the Barents Sea coast, reveals the {{following}} stratigraphic record of the last glaciation: The lowest units are lacustrine silt overlain by fluvial sand. These two units are repeated by glaciotectonic upthrusting from the NW. On top of this stacked succession is a till where fabric measurements reflect ice movement from the NE. Above the till is a partly laminated glaciolacustrine clay, probably deposited during the deglaciation of the site. We interpret the two ice flow directions to reflect a single ice advance. The Hongurei site is situated on the eastern rim of a marginal lobe of the Markhida moraine complex. Upthrusting from the NW is interpreted as <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting</b> along the eastern flank of the NE-SW-oriented lobe, whereas the NE till fabric shows flow direction of the same glacier moving across the site. A maximum age for the last ice advance is given by optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates of the fluvial sand below the till, dated to 85 ka at this site, but about 60 ka at other sites along the lower Pechora area...|$|R
60|$|X. But {{whether this}} be granted me or not, the fact is, that every idea {{respecting}} size, proportion, decoration, or construction, {{on which we}} are at present {{in the habit of}} acting or judging, depends on presupposition of such materials: and as I both feel myself unable to escape the influence of these prejudices, and believe that my readers will be equally so, it may be perhaps permitted to me to assume that true architecture does not admit iron as a constructive material,[7] and that such works as the cast-iron central spire of Rouen Cathedral, or the iron roofs and pillars of our railway stations, and of some of our churches, are not architecture at all. Yet it is evident that metals may, and sometimes must, enter into the construction to a certain extent, as nails in wooden architecture, and therefore as legitimately rivets and solderings in stone; neither can we well deny to the Gothic architect the power of supporting statues, pinnacles, or traceries by iron bars; and if we grant this I do not see how we can help allowing Brunelleschi his iron chain around the dome of Florence, or the builders of Salisbury their elaborate iron binding of the central tower.[8] If, however, we would not fall into the old sophistry of the grains of corn and the heap, we must find a rule which may enable us to stop somewhere. This rule is, I think, that metals may be used as a cement but not as a support. For as cements of other kinds are often so strong that the stones may easier be broken than separated, and the wall becomes a solid mass without for that reason losing the character of architecture, there is no reason why, when a nation has obtained the knowledge and practice of iron work, metal rods or rivets should not be used in the place of cement, and establish the same or a greater strength and adherence, without in any wise inducing departure from the types and system of architecture before established; nor does it make any difference except as to sightliness, whether the metal bands or rods so employed, be {{in the body of the}} wall or on its exterior, or set as stays and cross-bands; so only that the use of them be always and distinctly one which might be superseded by mere strength of cement; as for instance if a pinnacle or mullion be propped or tied by an iron band, it is evident that the iron only prevents the separation of the stones by lateral force, which the cement would have done, had it been strong enough. But the moment that the iron in the least degree takes the place of the stone, and acts by its resistance to crushing, and bears superincumbent weight, or if it acts by its own weight as a counterpoise, and so supersedes the use of pinnacles or buttresses in resisting a <b>lateral</b> <b>thrust,</b> or if, in the form of a rod or girder, it is used to do what wooden beams would have done as well, that instant the building ceases, so far as such applications of metal extend, to be true architecture.|$|E

40|$|Deep-sea sediments {{deposited}} {{at or near}} an actively spreading {{mid-ocean ridge}} experience a distinctly different thermal history than sediments deposited in other marine geotectonic settings. For sediments of a given age the impact of high heat flow decreases with increasing distance from the ridge. This simple relation is superimposed in the active spreading ridge along the margin of Southern Chile—the Chile Triple Junction—by the process of sediment accretion. Both processes, heat flow and <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusting,</b> strongly modify the mechanical behavior of sediment accreted. The original intent was to study the mechanical state of accreted sediment recovered during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 141, both unaltered and altered diagenetically by hydrothermal fluids, to differentiate the effects of thermal and mechanical diagenesis. The research program included high-pressure oedometer as well as triaxial testing to quantify {{the relative importance of}} both diagenetic processes for shear strength and consolidation behavior. Unfortunately, whole-round core samples available from Leg 141 appeared to be inadequately preserved and {{only a limited number of}} specimens could be used for mechanical testing. Therefore, most of the pre-cruise goals could not be attained. This paper reports the results of oedometer as well triaxial tests obtained from a restricted testing program...|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{technique}} for {{the renewal of}} historic building wooden roofs is presented. The solution {{can be used for}} the strengthening of existing wooden roofs against excessive <b>lateral</b> <b>thrusts</b> on the peripheral wall or for the recovery of the attics, as it allows removing the existing structural elements, such as possible wooden truss-works of no artistic value. With minor adaptations, the solution can be addressed to enhance the building seismic performance.

The technique is based on the construction of a thin folded shell, overlaying the existing pitches. Emphasis is given to lightweight folded shells, obtained by overlaying thin plywood panels on the existing roof rafters and planks, without modifying the overall architectural layout. The technique conceptual design is discussed and a simplified analytical method is proposed, which allows for the clarification of the role of each structural component and can be adopted for the folded shell proportioning and design. The analytical results are validated against numerical results obtained with reference to some case studies. Ultimately, emphasis is given to the detailing, whose correct execution is mandatory for the success of the proposed structural intervention...|$|R
