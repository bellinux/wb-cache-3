5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's {{chief of}} staff and {{commander}} of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser on bad air reconnaissance and poor <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
5|$|The paper, first {{owned by}} the Reid family, {{struggled}} financially {{for most of its}} life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper's early years. However, it enjoyed prosperity during World War II {{and by the end of}} the conflict had pulled close to the Times in ad revenue. A series of disastrous business decisions, combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Reid family, left the Herald Tribune far behind its rival.|$|E

5|$|Hananu {{meanwhile}} left Aleppo, {{which had}} served as his urban base, {{and went to the}} village of Baruda to regroup and continue the revolt, rallying support around his <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> active ′iṣābāt in the western Aleppo countryside. The revolt subsequently expanded to include four other ′iṣābāt, namely al-Sa'dun's ′iṣābā (over 400 rebels) in the Jabal Qusayr area near Antioch, Umar al-Bitar's ′iṣābā (150 rebels) in Jabal Sahyun in the mountains around al-Haffah northeast of Latakia, the ′iṣābā in Jabal Zawiya (200 rebels) under commander Mustafa al-Hajj Husayn and Najib Uwaid's ′iṣābā (250 fighters) around Kafr Takharim in Harim District. Al-Sa'dun's area of operations were centered in Jabal Qusayr, but extended as far north as al-Amuq, as far south as Jisr al-Shughur, as far east as Darkush and far west as the Kesab area.|$|E
5|$|The {{record of}} events during the mid {{part of the}} twelfth century {{suggests}} that Leinster-based overkings of Dublin enjoyed {{the cooperation of the}} indigenous leaders of Dublin, and the emergence of the Meic Torcaill during this period may well fit into such a context. When an indigenous ruler was not to be found, however, the Dubliners seem to have sought <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Isles, rather than endure a non-Leinster overking, as evidenced by the aforesaid episode concerning Gofraid. Mac Murchada's considerable authority in Dublin at this point is apparent through several ecclesiastical grants, foundations, and appointments. Furthermore, two major military operations undertaken by Dublin's forces in 1164 and 1165 were almost certainly conducted under Mac Murchada's authority. The former campaign, recorded by the thirteenth/fourteenth-century texts Brut y Tywysogyon and Brenhinedd y Saesson, concerned naval manoeuvres off Wales, in the service of Henry II, King of England (died 1189). The latter campaign, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, consisted of involvement in the ill-fated invasion of mainland Scotland, launched by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles (died 1164).|$|E
25|$|The Muslim {{community}} in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided {{the bulk of the}} invading armies, clashed with the Arab <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia, the Ebro River valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada.|$|E

25|$|De Lerma's role as royal {{favourite}} {{at court}} was {{further complicated by}} the rise of various 'proconsuls' under Philip III's reign – significant Spanish representatives overseas, who came to exercise independent judgement and even independent policies in the absence of strong <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> centre. The challenges to government communication during the period encouraged aspects of this, but the phenomenon was much more marked under Philip III than under either the reign of his father or son.|$|E
25|$|Robing {{symbolizes the}} passing of the student <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> senior class to the junior class. The {{specific}} origin of the robing ceremony is not known, but it may have occurred as early as 1902.

Since 2007, Robing has been held on the Friday of Midnight March with Class Ring Ceremony.|$|E
25|$|The {{left wing}} won {{control of the}} New York Joint Board, the body that coordinated the {{activities}} {{of all of the}} New York City ILGWU locals in all aspects of the industry, that year. When it called a general strike on July 1, 1926 Dubinsky was given a nominal role in the strike, reflecting his power base in the cutters' union, but was largely sidelined. That strike was a disastrous failure, leading to the rout of leftist <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Joint Board and ultimately from the industry, other than the independent International Fur Workers Union.|$|E

25|$|Thatcher now faced, arguably, {{her most}} serious rival yet after the 1983 general election, when Michael Foot {{resigned}} as Leader of the Labour Party and was succeeded by Neil Kinnock. With {{a new leader}} at the helm, Labour were clearly determined to defeat the Conservatives at the next election and for virtually the entirety of Thatcher's second ministry it was looking a very serious possibility, as {{the lead in the}} opinion polls constantly saw a change in <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives to Labour, with the Alliance occasionally scraping into first place.|$|E
25|$|He was succeeded as Lord Protector {{by his son}} Richard. Although {{not entirely}} without ability, Richard had no power base in either Parliament or the Army, {{and was forced to}} resign in May 1659, ending the Protectorate. There was no clear <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> various factions that jostled for power during the {{short-lived}} reinstated Commonwealth, so George Monck, the English governor of Scotland, at the head of New Model Army regiments was able to march on London, and restore the Long Parliament. Under Monck's watchful eye the necessary constitutional adjustments were made so that in 1660 Charles II could be invited back from exile to be king under a restored monarchy.|$|E

25|$|In 1904 {{the first}} missionary workers, led by Mrs. Mary Bennett made their {{appearance}} in Awka-Etiti. The first C.M.S mission church {{was built in}} Iruowelle village. In 1913 the Roman Catholic mission was also introduced to the Town, which built a church and a school. These two churches rapidly led to a conversion {{of the majority of}} Awka-Etiti citizens to Christianity. In 1944 the Awka-Etiti Improvement Union (A.I.U) was formed, which was the governing body of Awka-Etiti, taking over the mantle of <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional Council of Elders meeting (Okwu Azu-Oji). The name of the town was officially changed to Awka-Etiti by the A.I.U in 1946.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{he ran for}} re-election, facing Bob Imbrie, {{grandson}} of the homesteader who established Imbrie Farm. Hughes won re-election to a second four-year term with 72% of the vote. During his second term he traveled to Mexico for a conference held by the Mexican government where he also hoped to find a city to partner with as sister cities. The city also worked to revise the city’s charter, but kept the two-term limit and basic role of the mayor the same. Hughes earned a Certificate of Achievement in <b>Leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National League of Cities in 2007 and {{served as president of}} the League of Oregon Cities.|$|E
25|$|Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, {{which was}} not capped, was in the unusual {{position}} of being unable to set a rate due to the actions of dissenting councillors from the majority group combining with the opposition. The council had a <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> right-wing of the Labour Party; council leader John Riley argued that the rates were high enough and that ratepayers ought {{not to have a}} massive increase. However two left-wing Labour councillors Chris Rackley and Thérèse Shanahan announced that they would join with the opposition Liberal group to support a 'no cuts' budget. Their stance attracted others and the Labour budget was defeated with nine Labour councillors voting against it.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} the key {{measures}} that have been implemented in the 3 years since the SARS crisis ended was greatly increased commitment and <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government to tackle public health problems. During the SARS epidemic, governmental and communist party leaders at all levels—from Paramount leader Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabo {{and members of the}} State Council down to village leaders—were involved in tackling a single public-health issue. The epidemic and its eventual control convinced Chinese leaders that the government should be much more involved in addressing public-health problems. After the SARS epidemic, the State Council developed a mechanism to oversee public-health emergencies directly. The State Council has also involved itself with other pressing public-health challenges, including HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, occupational safety, and environmental health.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1910s Larramendi was already {{recognized}} as an important figure in the party, {{though he did not}} rise to executive structures either nationwide or on the regional Castilian basis and was rather considered a young man for the future. The setting changed dramatically when following the end of World War One the claimant was released from his confinement in Austria and early 1919 arrived in Paris to reclaim party <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mellistas. The conflict exploded in expulsion of de Mella and massive defections of his supporters, many of them occupying key positions in Carlist structures; command chain of the party was decimated. Political delegate of the king in Spain, marqués de Cerralbo, resigned; he was only provisionally replaced by Pascual Comín, who upon appointment declared he was not prepared to stay at the helm longer than provisionally.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{impact of}} the treaty on the {{functioning}} of the EU left many questions open (uncertainties which have led to calls for another new treaty in response to the economic crisis in the late 2000s). When its impact is assessed, the biggest winners from Lisbon have been Parliament, with its increase in power, and the European Council. The first months under Lisbon have arguably seen a shift in power and <b>leadership</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commission, the traditional motor of integration, to the European Council with its new full-time and longer-term President. The split between the Commission and European Council presidents involved overlap, potential rivalry and unwieldy compromises, such as both presidents attending international summits, in theory each with their own responsibilities, but inevitably with a considerable grey area. There was some expectation that the posts may be merged, as allowed under new treaty, in 2014 when their two mandates expired.|$|E
