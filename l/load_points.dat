At <b>loading</b> <b>point</b> E, a V-shaped shear band has been preliminarily formed. Compared with the velocity variation, the interface cohesion is weaker during the pre-peak stress fluctuation stage, so the shear strain in coal body is changed more intensely {{in the middle of the}} interface and the deformation velocity of monitoring points present greatly negative fluctuation. When <b>loading</b> to <b>point</b> F, the inverted V-shaped shear bands evolved from the middle of the interface exhibit evidently and the restrictions on end face disappear.

Some users {{said that}} it was so significant that it might have been more appropriate to have called it [...] "E-Tag 2.0". For the first time, Extensible Markup Language (XML) was utilized to format the data transferred between E-Tag applications, finally replacing the base CSV data transfer format based on its ancestral NERC Tag 1.0 spreadsheet/e-mail origins. The TSIN database was expanded to include generation and <b>load</b> <b>points</b> which were matched with PSEs that had rights to schedule them, and also included complex associations that enforced matched sets of PORs and PODs with TPs. E-Tag 1.7 also greatly expanded the time frame flexibility of an E-Tag by allowing extensions and modifications with comprehensive approval processes, layering of multiple OASIS requests for transmission rights, and also fully automated the tag curtailment functions from the IDC so that individual manual tag curtailments were no longer necessary.|$|E
5000|$|TRA's {{tickets were}} printed on {{traditional}} Edmondson presses until Japan's NEC supplied a computerized ticketing and reservation {{system in the}} late 1980s. Almost all stations are divided into paid (platform) and unpaid (waiting room) areas. Normally, ticket examiners govern platform access, checking and punching tickets as passengers enter. Conductors perform onboard ticket checks near peak <b>load</b> <b>points</b> or every ~100 miles, verifying that passengers hold train-class appropriate tickets, and dispense step-up and zone extension fares from portable ticket printers.Examiners also control access to unpaid areas at destinations, ensuring all passengers paid full distance-based fares. Used tickets are collected and not returned to passengers unless cancelled by stamps (similar to postmarks). Those arriving without appropriate tickets (i.e. requiring [...] "fare adjustments") are assessed 50% penalties, giving passengers incentives to find conductors on board to purchase step-up fares. Tickets are validated at origin, destination, and sometimes en-route; evasion thus would requireelaborate two-ticket schemes or exiting from paid area without going through fare control.

The maximum load {{and the location}} of cracks formed during failure were measured for testpieces with fibers oriented at various angles to the beam axis. Since most of the beams failed near {{one or more of the}} <b>load</b> <b>points,</b> the strength of the beams was evaluated in terms of a proposed model for the local stress distribution. In this model, an exact solution to the problem of a localized contact force acting on a unidirectionally reinforced half plane is used to describe the local stress field. The stress singularity at the <b>load</b> <b>points</b> is treated in a manner similar to the stress singularity at a crack tip in fracture mechanisms problems. Using this approach, the effect of fiber angle and elastic material properties on the strength of the beam is described in terms of a load intensity factor. For fiber angles less than 45 deg from the beam axis, a single crack is initiated near one of the <b>load</b> <b>points</b> at a critical value of the load intensity factor. The critical load intensity factor decreases with increasing fiber angle. For larger fiber angles, multiple cracks occur at locations both near and away from the <b>load</b> <b>points,</b> and the load intensity factor at failure increases sharply with increasing fiber angle...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} system problems, such as planning, loss minimization, and energy restoration, usually involve the phase balancing or network reconfiguration procedures. The determination of an optimal phase balance is, in general, a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel reconfiguration of the phase balancing using the fuzzy logic and the combinatorial optimization-based implementation step back to back. Input to the fuzzy step {{is the total}} load per phase of the feeders. Output of the fuzzy step is the load change values, negative value for load releasing and positive value for load receiving. The output of the fuzzy step is the input to the load changing system. The load changing system uses combinatorial optimization techniques to translate the change values (kW) into number of <b>load</b> <b>points</b> and then selects the specific <b>load</b> <b>points.</b> It also performs the inter-changing of the <b>load</b> <b>points</b> between the releasing and the receiving phases in an optimal fashion.
