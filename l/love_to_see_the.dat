500|$|Murasaki {{seems to}} have been unhappy with court life and was {{withdrawn}} and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Sei Shōnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in-waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saishō, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> snow here".|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the {{property}} was acquired by M Gabaee, an affiliate of the Charles Co. Rumors spread that the new owner planned to convert {{the property}} into a Walgreens Drug Store. [...] A representative of the owner told the Los Angeles Times: [...] "We're in negotiations so everything is preliminary. [...] We plan to keep the structure. The building is absolutely gorgeous. We want to maintain that but {{we also want to}} find what's going to work. We're looking forward to rejuvenating it." [...] Preservationists expressed concerns that the new plans would preserve the outer shell of the building but gut or significantly alter the building's interior. [...] In particular, concerns were raised that the theatre's soaring interior and proscenium arch would be replaced with a dropped ceiling. The founder of the East Los Angeles Center for the Performing Arts proposed converting the theatre into a performing arts venue: [...] "It's an amazing theater. [...] We were trying to get support to renovate {{and turn it into a}} performing arts venue. There's a drugstore on every corner here. I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> developer team up with us to preserve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I {{shall never}} forget that night at Ranelagh,' said Venetia, half {{with a smile and}} half with a sigh. 'How {{interesting}} he looked! I <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> people stare at him, and to hear them whisper his name.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had ceased}} to roar, but snarl upon snarl escaped his panting throat. The public delighted in him. They <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ferocious brute maddened by these tortures, beside which the agony of Tantalus was but the misery of a child.|$|R
50|$|Luca dedicates {{interest}} and <b>love</b> <b>to</b> {{the art of}} painting, and he has quickly shown, with unusual ease, how to win pictorial, compositional problems, and issues related to drawing. All as means to attain what is beautiful in the landscape. But he didn't pursued the modern canons of imitation, formulae that are in vogue nowadays. He <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hills, the trees, the houses, and aims at a pleasant beauty, that can show to men what God created for us with so much love.|$|R
2500|$|By way of {{explanation}} for this, on 19 September 1938 a statement {{was given to}} the Daily Express by Roland St John Braddell (1880–1966), then legal adviser in Malaya. He said: [...] "As far as I am concerned, I should <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Sultan of Johore married to this most charming lady, Miss Lydia Hill." [...] He added that the Sultan could not marry at present because there was no mosque in Genoa where he was staying, because he could do nothing without the permission of the British Government, and because the Sultan was ill: [...] "He nearly died recently in Johore", having [...] "become ill with heart trouble and gout". The lawyer had been instructed to take his wife and daughter and accompany Cissie to Genoa, because she kept the Sultan [...] "cheered and tranquil". [...] She had performed an African dance for the Sultan, and accompanied him on a two-hour drive along the coast. Although the Sultan had previously announced an engagement in Malaya, the lawyer now said that he would inform the Press if and when any marriage were to occur. Such an engagement was not unique in east Kent in the 1930s. George Henry Milles-Lade, 4th Earl Sondes who lived at Sheldwich, married Pamela McDougall on 17 October 1939; she was understood to have been previously a Bluebell Girl.|$|E

60|$|Last night I lingered {{long without}} My last of <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Alas! <b>the</b> moon-white window-panes Stared blindly back on me.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{episode in}} Season 1 {{included}} preliminary challenges, banter from news conferences, and O'Neal and his rival negotiating a handicap. In each episode Shaq and his competitor do {{some form of}} charity work. Shaq mentions quite often that he <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> smile on the little kids' faces. The laughs come from [...] "trash talking," [...] but [...] "when it comes to competing, there is no joking," [...] O'Neal says.|$|R
60|$|Once {{stirred up}} to the point of action, there was no lack of energy among these {{northern}} Eskimos. Kayaks, lines, and spears were got ready, and oomiaks were launched; for women and children <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sport, though they did not join in it. Everywhere bustle and excitement reigned, and the hubbub was not a little increased by the agitated dogs, which knew well what was a-foot, and licked their lips in anticipation.|$|R

6000|$|Ask of the {{sea-bird}} if it {{loves the}} sea, Ask of the roses if {{they love the}} rain, Ask of the little lark, that will not sing Till day break, if it <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> day:- And yet, these are but empty images, Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire So great that all {{the waters of the}} main Can not avail to quench it. Will you not speak? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you didn't think, at all events," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Skimpole, [...] "to this effect: 'Harold Skimpole <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sun shine, <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> {{hear the}} wind blow, <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> watch the changing lights and shadows, <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> hear the birds, those choristers in Nature's great cathedral. And {{does it seem}} to me that I am about to deprive Harold Skimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only birthright!' You thought nothing to that effect?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 1956, Premier Nikita Khrushchev {{delivered}} a speech condemning Stalin's cult of personality {{in front of}} the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He told the audience: [...] "Stalin <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> film The Unforgettable Year of 1919, in which he was shown on the steps of an armored train and where he was practically vanquishing the foe with his own saber. Let Kliment Voroshilov, our dear friend, find the necessary courage and write the truth about Stalin; after all, he knows how Stalin had fought." [...] In March, the pro-Stalin protesters in the 1956 Georgian demonstrations included re-screenings of the film in their list of demands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--I am so sorry!" [...] cried Lucetta, with {{a nervous}} titter. Farfrae tried to laugh; {{but he was}} too much in <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{incident}} in any but a tragic light.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{money from}} the clouds. I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll stand {{ourselves}} a little jaunt. Let's go and spend a day at Oxford, shall we? I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> colleges." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How I should <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Cupids {{in their}} dear little fools' caps!' Maimie cried, and away {{she ran to}} look for them very recklessly, for the Cupids hate to be laughed at.|$|E
6000|$|He, {{by custom}} patriarchal, [...] <b>Loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beaker sparkle; [...] And {{he thought the}} wine improved, [...] Tasted by the lips he loved-- [...] By the kindly lips he loved.

5000|$|Andrew Leonard {{writing for}} Salon has said, [...] "Bryce recapitulates how the press, the analysts, Enron's board of {{directors}} and its shareholders all bought into Enron's vision of itself. There were obvious reasons, as he points out, for the widespread collusion. The analysts worked for companies that also wanted Enron's investment banking business. The directors had companies of their own that were doing deals with Enron. <b>The</b> shareholders <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> stock price go up and up, and the business press, well, the business press loves a winner!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Users {{who played}} with this {{hardware}} fitted would hear the speech chip say [...] "R, R, R, I an complete" [...] (using the letter [...] "R" [...] repeated for the laugh, and [...] "an" [...] instead of [...] "am"), as this was the closest thing it could say. Programmer Peter Johnson {{said at the time}} [...] "I knew very few gamers would have that speech chip fitted, but I would have <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> expression of surprise on their faces the first time they heard the DeathStar speak." ...|$|R

60|$|Time {{after time}} James ran his almighty eye over his army. He loved them. He <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> feel that his table was pressed down, that it groaned under their weight. He <b>loved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pence, like innumerable pillars of cloud, {{standing}} waiting to lead on into wildernesses of unopened resource, while the silver, as pillars of light, should guide {{the way down}} the long night of fortune. Their weight sank sensually into his muscle, and gave him gratification. The dark redness of bronze, like full-blooded fleas, seemed alive and pulsing, the silver was magic as if winged.|$|R
40|$|Esther Klages, alumna of George Fox via Cascade College, was an {{essential}} {{member of the}} campus community for many years. Esther volunteered her time, energy, and enthusiasm to the support of this place, a college she loved dearly. Ms. Klages is remembered on campus in the dining hall and plaza named in her honor, and also on a plaque on the Centennial Tower, which {{was made possible by}} her generous contribution. Esther also took the time to stuff envelopes for campus mailings, offer a listening ear to students, and attended many events on campus.

60|$|In the {{succeeding}} days Pan paced up the work, from dawn until dark. A week more saw the long fence completed. It was an obstacle few horses could leap. Pan {{thought he would}} <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> stallion that could do it.|$|E
60|$|I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> holy ones air their smug pieties {{and admire}} them and smirk over them, {{and at the}} same moment frankly and {{publicly}} show their contempt for the pieties of the Boer--confidently expecting the approval of the country and the pulpit, and getting it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} your ambition. Ah, can I not read your noble soul?

Would you not love that, my daughter?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} out for a moment, <b>love,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> about <b>the</b> chaise," [...] I said to Alicia. She {{suddenly}} looked up at me with an anxious searching expression.

6000|$|The tongue that scarce {{had learned}} to claim An {{entrance}} to a mother's heart By that dear talisman, a mother's name, Sleeps all forgetful of its art!

Peep timidly from out its nest, His lips, the while, Fluttering with half-fledged words, Or hushing to a smile That more than words expressed, When his glad mother on him stole And snatched him to her breast! Oh, thoughts were brooding in those eyes, [...] 40 That would have soared like strong-winged birds Far, far into the skies, Gladding the earth with song, And gushing harmonies, Had he but tarried with us long! Oh stern word--Nevermore! ...|$|R
