40|$|A {{practical}} label-free {{method for}} the rapid determination of small-molecule {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC) using a fixed-angle <b>light-scattering</b> <b>technique</b> is described. Change in 90 ° light scattering at a fixed wavelength of incident radiation with increasing bacterial quorum molecule concentration and the observation of a break point is used to determine CMC. In our study, this technique is utilized to investigate the aqueous CMC of previously uncharacterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing signaling molecules (QSSM) belonging to the n-acylhomoserine lactone and 2 -alkyl- 4 -quinolone classes. Several were found to form micelles within a physiologically relevant concentration range and potential roles of these micelles as QSSM transporters are discussed. The influence of temperature {{and the presence of}} biological membranes or serum proteins on QSSM CMC are also investigated and evidence is obtained to suggest the QSSMs studied are capable of both membrane and serum protein interaction. This demonstrates that the fixed-angle <b>light-scattering</b> <b>technique</b> outlined can be used simply and rapidly to determine small-molecule CMC under a variety of conditions...|$|E

40|$|White {{kidney bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{contains}} {{two kinds of}} a-amylase inhibitors, one heat-stable (aAI-s) and one heat-labile (aAI-u). aAI-s has recently been revealed to be a tetrameric complex, o^p,, with two active sites [Kasahara et aL (1996) J. Biochem. 120, 177 — 183]. The present study was undertaken to reveal the molecular features of aAI-u, which is composed of three kinds of subunits, a, p, and y. The y-subunit, {{in contrast to the}} a- and p-subunits that are indistinguishable from the a- and p-subunits of aAI-s, was found to correspond to a subunit of an a-amylase inhibitor-like protein, which has been identified as an inactive, evolutionary intermediate between arcelin and the a-amylase inhibitor in a P. vulgaris defense protein family. The polypeptide molecular weight of aAI-u determined by the <b>light-scattering</b> <b>technique,</b> together with the polypeptide molecular weights of the subunits, suggests that aAI-u is a trimeric complex, afiy. The inhibition of aAI-u by increasing amounts of porcine pancreatic a-amylase (PPA) indi-cates that an inactive 1 : 1 complex is formed between aAI-u and PPA.

These <b>light-scattering</b> <b>techniques,</b> MS-DWS and SMLS, have been used in comparison to the classical rheology to study acid milk gel formation and syneresis detection. A systematic study of the effects of heat treatment of milk on the formation of acid gels was conducted. Results obtained by DWS and rheology showed excellent correlation in good agreement with the existence of a link between particle dynamics measured by DWS and the macroscopic viscoelastic response of the gel. Moreover, both light scattering techniques showed ability to detect gel shrinkage due to their high sensitivity to particle mobility. DWS allowed evidencing wheying-off along the tubes’ glass walls, while SMLS performed well in detecting syneresis on gel surface or confined in localized zones of the glass walls. The results were discussed in light of a proposed model considering gel syneresis as regards of gel properties. <b>Light-scattering</b> <b>techniques</b> proved to be very efficient tools to detect syneresis in acid milk gels and thus can be of great interest in preventing this mechanism...|$|R

The stationary correlation-frequency analysis laser <b>light-scattering</b> <b>technique</b> {{was used to}} assess the magnitude of the CBF stimulatory responses induced by aerosolized 10 (- 5) M fenoterol (sympathomimetic), and 10 (- 8) M and 10 (- 6) M methacholine (parasympathomimetic) delivered to the whole lungs of eight barbiturate-anesthetized beagles. The nonstationary correlation-frequency analysis laser <b>light-scattering</b> <b>technique</b> was used to measure the effect on tracheal CBF of increasing the cytosolic calcium ion concentration with a calcium ionophore, A 23187. Aerosolized A 23187 was delivered to the isolated tracheal lumens of eight beagle dogs in cumulative doses ranging from 10 (- 9) M to 10 (- 6) M. Administration of the ionophore synchronized the CBF with a period of 5. 3 min. Dose dependencies were observed in both the time to the peak CBF stimulation and the magnitude of the stimulatory response. The magnitude of CBF stimulation was inhibited by prior administration of aerosolized nifedipine (2 mg/ml), a voltage-operated calcium channel blocker. The A 23187 -induced modulation period of tracheal CBF, was unchanged by nifedipine. These are the first data to demonstrate that the magnitude and periodicity of CBF are two independent coupled processes. The cooperativity of these two processes could be determined in the effectiveness of mucociliary transport...|$|E

The light-scattering method is only applicable to larger particles (no point-scatterers) and is easily extended to biological objects.

In addition, the kinetic analysis shows that the process of vesicle formation lasts for a long time.

We are able to quantify the resonant optical and materials properties of nanoscale (∼ 50 nm) and wavelength-scale (∼ 1 μm) metallic antennas as well as high-refractive-index semiconductor antennas.
