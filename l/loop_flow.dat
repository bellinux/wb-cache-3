The problem should be solved very efficiently. We have formulated the <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> problem in fuzzy environment, as a multi-objective optimization problem using fuzzy set theory and fuzzy decision making rules. Then the resulted single objected optimization problem is solved using differential evolution (DE). Then a sets of simulations are done {{to figure out the}} most efficient parameter values of DE to fit our problem. DE is one of the evolutionary search methods. The parameter settings play an important role on reducing the required time and getting better solution to the problem.

In this paper, the methodologies to calculate parallel flows for both market and non-market entities including market flows are investigated in order to identify the cause of potential <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> issue in the congestion management process. In an interconnected system, the parallel flow identification is a complex issue because transmission congestion can be affected by all the entities of the system. To deal with it, the impact of market operation on <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> is analyzed through market flow. In addition, for a system consisting of both market and non-market entities, the parallel flow due to the market flow methodology is investigated in details.

40|$|Grid {{congestion}} management is gaining importance {{in certain parts}} of the European electricity grid. The deployment of renewable electricity sources at locations with a weak grid connection and far from the load centers can lead to overloading of transmission lines. Redispatching, i. e., rearranging scheduled generation and consumption, might be needed to obtain a feasible and safe operational state of the electricity system. This paper studies the impact of three parameters on the redispatching quantities and costs: (1) <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> through the electricity system, (2) an increase in renewable generation in remote areas, and (3) a curative and preventive N- 1 security criterion. Towards this aim, a dedicated generation scheduling model is developed, consisting of a day-ahead market and a redispatch phase. The Belgian power system is considered as case study. Three general conclusions can be drawn from this paper. First, {{it is important to consider}} <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> when quantifying redispatching, especially in a highly interconnected electricity system as the European system. The case study shows that <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> can more than double the need for redispatching. Second, transmission grid constraints might restrict the deployment of renewables in certain areas. Third, relaxing the N- 1 security criterion in congested grid areas from preventive to curative can drastically reduce the redispatch costs. status: publishe...|$|R

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques have been employed in the present work to study the hydrodynamics in a tank stirred by a Rushton turbine. The effect of the impeller clearance on the velocity field and mixing has been investigated. It has been shown that at a low impeller clearance, the Rushton turbine generates a flow field that evolves from the typical two loops to a single <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> pattern similar to that of an axial impeller. This single <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> pattern resulted in an increase in axial flow and a decrease in mixing time at a constant power number. It has been found that a draft tube can be used with a single Rushton turbine, at a low clearance to aid axial flow and mixing, and this resulted in 50 % reduction in mixing time. There was a good comparison between laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) experimental and CFD simulation flow fields, both of which showed that the draft tube improved mixing in the tank by suppressing secondary circulation loops...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} model that estimates <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> rate, heat removal, and stability parameters for the General Electric Simplified Boiling Water Reactor SBWR was developed. The three parameters above {{used to be}} calculated individually each by a separate code. The initial approach in loop thermal hydraulic modelling was the steady state solution of the SBWR loop mass, energy, and momentum equations. The power-to-flow map obtained proved to be quite comparable with the Natural Circulation in Boiling Water Reactor (NATBWR) code developed by EPRI, {{in addition to that}} of General Electric. At low power levels buoyancy forces are the controlling factor in determining the <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> rate, while at high power levels two-phase friction losses become the dominating one. Evaluation criteria necessary for comparing different loop geometries performance have been the "minimum critical heat flux ratio (MCHFR) " and the "decay ratio. " The predicted flow, from the DFM, at different power levels was used later in a parametric study to answer an important question of which combination of core and riser heights are to be selected that meets both the stability and critical power ratio limits. By modelling bubble time delay through riser in the loop momentum equation, a loop damping coefficient as a measure of loop stability, with higher damping meaning a more stable loop was calculated. Results indicated that during normal operation the SBWR loop is pretty damped. Finally, a detailed code that consists mainly of a fuel pin model, reactor point kinetics for the time dependent reactor normalized power with one group of delayed neutrons, and coolant channel mass, energy, and momentum equations is considered. Reactivity feedbacks from voids and fuel temperature, (Doppler effect), were considered. The loop momentum equation was modified to account for bubble time delay in the riser. After a small perturbation in reactivity, fuel temperature, core average void, and <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> rate were shown to reach equilibrium values after a period of time equivalent to the transit time of the bubble through the riser.

40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} was to conduct an experimental analysis in which a THUNDER™ (Thin Unimorph DrivER) actuator was used to adjust the flow of air through a specified cross sectional area inside a Plexiglas housing. The THUNDER™ actuator was developed over ten years ago as a high displacement piezoelectric actuator. It is a curved, bilayer actuator made up of a piezoelectric layer (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) and a stainless steel layer. In this study, the THUNDER™ is the prime mover in an air flow control valve. The valve is made up of a flow channel that allows air to pass {{over the top of the}} actuator. When voltage is applied to the actuator, causing the piezo ceramic layer to expand or contract, the curvature of the actuator changes, thus changing the orifice area in the valve and causing a change in flow. Testing is done with single and dual flow loop arrangements. In the dual flow loop, one flow line contains the control valve while the other is a bypass line. The valve is used to balance flow between the lines. Both lines have adjustable outlet valves so that the valve can be tested under a wide range of flow conditions. Pressure transducers were placed along the experimental setup to observe various pressures conditions in the system. Two flow meters were used to measure either the single <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the corresponding flow rate in each line of the dual flow loop. Several lids for the control valve were manufactured and tested to reveal that alternative channel geometries could lead to increased performance over a specific range. The test results showed that the THUNDER™ control valve could modulate the air flow by as much as 16 % at 4. 4 SCFM (125 LPM) in single <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> and 30 % at 2. 3 SCFM (65 LPM) in dual <b>loop</b> <b>flow</b> for inlet pressures up to 25 PSI (172 kPa) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper raises {{awareness}} {{of the presence of}} closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in the solutions of published algorithm for maximising the throughput flow in networks. If the rooted commodity is interchangeable commodity, a closed parasitic loop can effectively be present even if the routed commodity does not physically travel along a closed loop. The closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> are highly undesirable <b>loops</b> of <b>flow,</b> which effectively never leave the network. Parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> increase the cost of transportation of the flow unnecessarily, consume residual capacity from the edges of the network, increase the likelihood of deterioration of perishable products, increase congestion and energy wastage. Accordingly, the paper presents a theoretical framework related to parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in networks. By using the presented framework, it is demonstrated that the probability of existence of closed and dominated <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in networks is surprisingly high. The paper also demonstrates that the successive shortest path strategy for minimising the total length of transportation routes from multiple interchangeable origins to multiple destinations fails to minimise the total length of the routes. It is demonstrated that even in a network with multiple origins and a single destination, the successive shortest path strategy could still fail to minimise the total length of the routes. By using the developed theoretical framework, it is shown that a minimum total length of the transportation routes in a network with multiple interchangeable origins, is attained if and only if no closed parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> and dominated <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> exist in the network. Accordingly, an algorithm for minimising the total length of the transportation routes by eliminating all dominated parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> is proposed...|$|R

The paper shows that complex networks dispatching {{the same type of}} interchangeable commodity exhibit parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> and the commodity {{does not need to be}} physically travelling around a closed contour for a parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> to be present. Consequently, a theorem giving the necessary and sufficient condition for a parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> on randomly oriented source-destination paths in a plane has been formulated and a simple expression has been obtained for the probability of a directed <b>flow</b> <b>loop.</b> A closed-form expression has also been derived for determining the probability of a parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> on a fixed lattice with flows whose directions are random. The results demonstrate that even for a relatively small number of intersecting flow paths, the probability of a directed <b>flow</b> <b>loop</b> is very large, which shows that the existence of directed <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in large and complex networks is practically inevitable. Consequently, a simple and efficient recursive algorithm has also been proposed for discovering and removing parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> in real networks. The paper also shows that for any possible number and for any possible orientation of straight-line flow paths on a plane, it is always possible to choose the flows in the paths in such a way, that no parasitic <b>flow</b> <b>loops</b> are present between the points of intersection.

40|$|The number N {{of stable}} fixed points of locally coupled Kuramoto models {{depends on the}} {{topology}} of the network on which the model is defined. It {{has been shown that}} cycles in meshed networks {{play a crucial role in}} determining N, because any two different stable fixed points differ by a collection of <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> on those cycles. Since the number of different <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> increases with the length of the cycle that carries them, one expects N to be larger in meshed networks with longer cycles. Simultaneously, the existence of more cycles in a network means more freedom to choose the location of <b>loop</b> <b>flows</b> differentiating between two stable fixed points. Therefore, N should also be larger in networks with more cycles. We derive an algebraic upper bound for the number of stable fixed points of the Kuramoto model with identical frequencies, under the assumption that angle differences between connected nodes do not exceed π/ 2. We obtain N≤∏_k= 1 ^c[2 · Int(n_k/ 4) + 1], which depends both on the number c of cycles and on the spectrum of their lengths {n_k}. We further identify network topologies carrying stable fixed points with angle differences larger than π/ 2, which leads us to conjecture an upper bound for the number of stable fixed points for Kuramoto models on any planar network. Compared to earlier approaches that give exponential upper bounds in the total number of vertices, our bounds are much lower and therefore much closer to the true number of stable fixed points.
