25|$|Following {{the disputed}} presidential {{election}} of 1876, Carpenter {{was hired by}} supporters of the Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden to examine Louisiana's vote counts and argue for victory over Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. Carpenter's first-hand accounts of the corrupt Republican state administration gave the Democrats some reason for hope, but ultimately the partisan make-up of the special electoral commission (7 Republicans, 6 Democrats) and its refusal to <b>look</b> <b>behind</b> the certified counts made many of their rulings a forgone conclusive win for Hayes.|$|E

25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to <b>look</b> <b>behind</b> you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

25|$|Man {{found dead}} on the {{mountains}} – Early on Wednesday morning {{it was reported that}} two men, named John Litt and John Vickers, who had been following the Blencathra hounds the previous day had not returned. Litt had been last seen on the bog about 200 yards west of Raven Crag where he had been, with other, resting and watching the hounds in the valley below. … Although he seemed somewhat fatigued he did not complain, and the hunters, absorbed in the chase did not <b>look</b> <b>behind.</b> When his absence from home was known a number of willing volunteers went to search for him. … Mr David Powley at once proceeded to Mr Oliver, the shepherd on Castlerigg Fell, who probably was the last person in Litt’s company, and the two immediately struck for the point where Mr Oliver parted from the deceased. They took a dog with them and it found the body not fifteen yards from the place they were making to. The searchers were: Messrs C. C. Thompson, Thos. Hodgson (Station Road), J. W. Grisdale, Thos. Harrison, David Powley, Joseph Bouch, Geo. Atkinson, Isaac Wren, Joseph Bristo, Benjamin Hodgson, A. G. Pettit, and Wm. Wood.|$|E

500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content.

500|$|Rob Owen, {{television}} {{editor of}} the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said that the documentary provided an interesting, entertaining and detailed <b>look</b> <b>behind</b> the scenes of the show. Owen {{said that this was}} [...] "rare, because TV doesn't usually reveal details about itself. It's nice to see PBS pulling back the curtain on its competition, and I wish it happened more often." [...] Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News praised it, calling it [...] "a documentary as rare to public TV as Homicide is to commercial television", but said that it [...] "falls short of being definitive" [...] because it cannot address all elements of the series due to its brief running time. Several commentators praised the humorous scene in the documentary in which Yoshimura goes line-by-line through his script and replaces curse words based on orders from NBC censors.|$|E
