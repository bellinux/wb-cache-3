25|$|The {{radar signal}} was <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> <b>target</b> and its data was {{wirelessly}} transmitted to a ground receiver that {{was connected to}} the artillery servomechanism feedback control system, causing the servo to accurately modify its angular position and maintain it for an optimum amount of time, long enough to fire at the calculated (predicted) coordinates of the target and thus successfully track the target.|$|R
50|$|Zero Gunner is a shoot 'em up {{developed}} by Psikyo and released in 1997. The arcade game allows for eight-way movement using a joystick and supports {{up to two}} players at a time. It was notable for its <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>targeting</b> mechanic that allowed players to rotate around targets. The game was succeeded by a sequel, Zero Gunner 2 for the Sega NAOMI/Dreamcast.|$|R

50|$|Designed for all-round defence against {{simultaneous}} {{air attacks}} from multiple targets, the Umkhonto-IR missile {{is the first}} vertically launched infrared-homing surface-to-air missile, also the first IR-homing missile to use lock-on-after-launch. Upon launch, the missile flies to a lock-on point, following on-board inertial navigation. The missile then activates its two-colour IR-seeker (variant of U-Darter AAM's seeker) and <b>locks</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Target</b> updates are received via data link, enabling the missile to counter evasive manoeuvres by the target.|$|R

50|$|Jupiter Strike (Zeitgeist in Japan) is a 3D - {{scrolling}} shooter {{game for}} the PlayStation developed by Taito. Taito published the Japanese version, while Acclaim published the American and European version. A Microsoft Windows version was also released worldwide. The player takes control of a futuristic fighter jet that has two main weapons. Unlike other scroll shooters this game {{does not have any}} power ups. Instead the player's ship has a laser sub-weapon that homes into <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> <b>targets.</b> The player must battle against extraterrestrial ships which can range from small fighters to large mother ships.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanical}} tracking platform holds the optical imaging system and {{is responsible for}} manipulating the optical imaging system {{in such a way}} that it always points to the target being tracked. The dynamics of the {{mechanical tracking}} platform combined with the optical imaging system determines the tracking system's ability to keep the <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> a <b>target</b> that changes speed rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Infrared {{guidance}} {{systems in}} heat-seeking missiles {{are designed to}} track strong sources of infrared radiation - heat - such as aircraft engines, helping missiles to home in <b>on</b> their <b>targets.</b> IRCM systems {{are based on a}} modulated source of infrared radiation with a higher intensity than the target itself. When a missile seeker observes this modulated radiation, it interferes with or obscures the modulated signal from the aircraft and renders the missile incapable of maintaining a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{tactical}} pilot typically experiences {{difficulty in}} maintaining an accurate <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> multiple-interacting <b>targets</b> {{in the presence}} of clutter. If the pilot is trained to focus on object features and predict the relative motions of targets, the anticipated target tracking methodology allows the pilot to identify multiple targets simultaneously. By assessing features, the paper seeks to demonstrate how feature recognition enhances multisensor integration of multitarget scenarios. 1. 0 INTRODUCTION The problem of multitarget tracking i...|$|R
50|$|This mode of {{operation}} was common to both the service variants of the MASURCA, the mod 2 and the mod 3. The mod 2 was relatively primitive, the missile {{had no way of}} perceiving the target other than through the proximity fuse, the missile operating in effect as a command guided one, the accuracy of the missile dependent on the tracking systems ability to maintain a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> which could become indistinct with increasing range, altitude and speed of the target.|$|R
2500|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a [...]38 snub nose, a pistol, a magnum, a Tommy gun, and a shotgun, as well as {{projectiles}} such as Molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the players have complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, when the player locks a target, a targeting reticule appears on-screen. The longer the player is <b>locked</b> <b>on,</b> the smaller the reticule gets, allowing for more precise aiming. Within the lock-on system, the player also has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the reticule can be moved around the <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> <b>target,</b> allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have five weak points: their two knees and their two shoulders, plus their groin. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight. Hitting the groin accomplishes the same effect as a knee shot, also stunning the target.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the game}} is based around third-person shooting, with the player able to wield a pistol, a magnum, a tommy gun, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle, as well as {{projectiles}} such as molotov cocktails and dynamite. The game features both a lock-on system and a manual aiming system. In the manual system, the player has complete freedom to aim wherever they wish. In the lock-on system, the player can lock onto a target, but still has a certain degree of freedom to aim manually; the targeting reticule can be moved around the <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> <b>target,</b> allowing the player to target specific areas. If the reticule turns red, the player has found a weak point. All enemies have four weak points - their two knees and their two shoulders. If the player shoots one of their knees, the enemy will {{no longer be able to}} run, but will continue to shoot back. If the player hits a shoulder, the enemy won't be able to fire back or fight.|$|R
25|$|As soon at the TTR was <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> to a <b>target,</b> {{an analog}} {{computer}} (later digital) continually computed a suitable intercept {{point in the}} sky and an expected 'time to fly' of the missile based on information from the TTR and basic performance information about the missile. This information was displayed on plotting boards.|$|R
50|$|Obtaining an armlock {{requires}} {{effective use}} of full-body leverage in order to initiate and secure a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>targeted</b> arm, while preventing the opponent from escaping the lock. Therefore, performing an armlock is less problematic on the ground, from positions such as the mount, side control, or guard. Armlocks {{are more difficult to}} perform when both combatants are standing up, though the stand-up variants are a focus in certain systems such as Chin Na. Furthermore, a failed armlock can sometimes result in the opponent escaping and obtaining a dominant position.|$|R
50|$|The Maverick missile {{is unable}} to <b>lock</b> onto <b>targets</b> <b>on</b> its own; {{it has to be}} given input by the pilot or weapon systems officer (WSO) after which it follows the path to the target autonomously, {{allowing}} the WSO to fire and forget. In an A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, for example, the video fed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. A crosshair on the head-up display is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target while the missile will then automatically recognize and <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> to the <b>target.</b> Once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. This fire-and-forget property is not shared by the E version that uses semi-active laser homing.|$|R
40|$|Social {{anxiety is}} {{characterized}} by fear of evaluative interpersonal situations. Many studies have investigated the perception of emotional faces in socially anxious individuals and have reported biases in the processing of threatening faces. However, faces {{are not the only}} stimuli carrying an interpersonal evaluative load. The present study investigated the processing of emotional body postures in social anxiety. Participants with high and low social anxiety completed an attention-shifting paradigm using neutral, angry and happy faces and postures as cues. We investigated early visual processes through the P 100 component, attentional fixation on the P 2, structural encoding mirrored by the N 170, and attentional orientation towards stimuli to detect with the P 100 <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> <b>target</b> occurrence. Results showed a global reduction of P 100 and P 200 responses to faces and postures in socially anxious participants as compared to non-anxious participants, with a direct correlation between self-reported social anxiety levels and P 100 and P 200 amplitudes. Structural encoding of cues and target processing were not modulated by social anxiety, but socially anxious participants were slower to detect the targets. These results suggest a reduced processing of social postural and facial cues in social anxiety...|$|R
50|$|In the evening, Dani's P-18 long-distance {{radar set}} malfunctioned at 19:05, {{almost the same}} time when four F-117s {{prepared}} for take-off from Aviano Air Base to attack targets in Belgrade. The repaired P-18 radar returned to air by 19:50 and started to emit lower frequency. Lt. Col. Dale Zelko's plane (tail number 82-0806) and three other F-117 flying northbound were acquired at 20:40 local time and so the SA-3 battery's fire control radar went on air. The UNV radar emitted at high frequency for 2 x 20 seconds, but it was unable to obtain a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>targets.</b>|$|R
50|$|MICA {{can also}} be {{employed}} as a short-range surface-to-air missile. It is available in a ground-based version, VL MICA, fired from a truck-mounted box launcher, and a naval version, VL MICA-M, fired from a ship-fitted vertical launch system. On October 23, 2008, 15:30, at CELM, Biscarosse (Landes), a VL MICA missile successfully performed the last of its 14 test firings meaning it is now ready for mass production. The target drone was flying at low level, over the sea, 12 km away; despite this distance, MICA, equipped with an active radar seeker, <b>locked</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> and shot it down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} 25 weapons, the {{majority}} of which are unique to specific vehicles. The vehicles primary cannon can be fired with the Square button and has an infinite amount of ammunition, although they do need to recharge after extended periods of use. The Circle button uses the ships secondary weapons, such as bombs, missiles ( [...] both guided and unguided [...] ), rockets or an electronic jammer.

40|$|This paper explores {{techniques}} for multiple views target tracking in a maritime environment using a mobile surveillance platform. We utilise an omnidirectional camera to capture full spherical video and use an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) {{to estimate the}} platform?s ego-motion. For each target {{a part of the}} omnidirectional video is extracted, forming a corresponding set of virtual cameras. Each target is then tracked using a dynamic template matching method and particle filtering. Its predictions are then used to continuously adjust the orientations of the virtual cameras, keeping a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>targets.</b> We demonstrate the performance of the application in several real-world maritime settings...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft flybys {{of small}} solar system bodies provide {{important}} science {{return in the}} form of images of the target body taken around closest approach. In order to maximize the number of images taken of the target, an autonomous closed-loop tracking system has been developed to maintain <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> during the flyby. The system uses images to estimate the spacecrafts target-relative position and attitude, which is then used to point the camera. The system has been successfully used twice: the Deep Space 1 flyby of comet Borrelly and the Stardust flyby of asteroid Annefrank. This paper describes in detail the tracking algorithms and flight results...|$|R

Results of the study show {{that the use of}} fuzzy set models gives results comparable to those requiring human assistance, e. g. <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> to false <b>targets,</b> and better results when the problem is caused by noise and/or bias, or unexpected errors in the state vector at initial acquisition...|$|R
30|$|A GPS {{receiver}} {{will shift}} the incoming L 1 signals in time until a correlation peak is detected for a known PRN. During this period, the receiver will {{begin the process}} of retrieving the Navigation Message for that satellite. The time shift necessary to obtain the correlation peak is used to resolve the distance between the satellite and the GPS receiver. This process is continued in parallel for multiple and different PRNs, so the GPS receiver can obtain data for multiple different satellites. Because each PRN is designed to appear random, the correlator will only <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> satellite as having a correlation peak for that PRN (i.e. the PRNs are orthogonal).|$|R
5000|$|The Federation of American Scientists {{claims the}} MiG-29 is equal to, {{or better than}} the F-15C in some areas such as short aerial engagements because of the Helmet Mounted Weapons Sight (HMS) and better {{maneuverability}} at slow speeds. This was demonstrated when MiG-29s of the German Air Force participated in joint DACT exercises with US fighters. The HMS was a great help, allowing the Germans to achieve a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> any <b>target</b> the pilot could see within the missile field of view, including those almost 45 degrees off boresight. [...] It was not until 2003 that the USAF and US Navy achieved Initial Operational Capability of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System.|$|R

50|$|Vessels of the California-class cruisers, Virginia-class cruisers and Kidd-class {{destroyer}} {{had their}} Tartar systems upgraded to modification 14 or 15 standard which {{enabled them to}} employ the Standard Missile 2 {{as part of the}} New Threat Upgrade (NTU) program. The New Threat Upgrade equipped vessels could utilize the inertial guidance systems on the SM-2 and time share illumination radars for semi-active homing in the terminal phase of the intercept, increasing the number of targets the Tartar system could attack at the same time. The New Threat Upgrade Tartar ships could function nearly as well as Aegis Combat System equipped vessels, except for dealing with saturation missile attacks. The NTU still requires the AN/SPG-51 radar to acquire a <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target</b> and illuminate it just before intercept.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} weapon {{used the}} body of a K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') K-5 guidance and propulsion systems but increased the warhead from 13 kg to 100 kg. [...] This had the big advantage of allowing the new weapon to be fitted to any aircraft capable of firing the K-5. Design began in 1966, so the project was known as Kh-66 or Izdeliye 66 ('Article 66'). The Kh-66 was a beam-riding weapon that was tested on a MiG-21PFM and entered production in 1968 for that aircraft. The Kh-66 was only an interim solution as it required the launch aircraft to dive towards the <b>target</b> to maintain <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> the <b>target.</b> Flight testing of the Kh-66 began in 1967 and it entered service on 20 June 1968.|$|R
