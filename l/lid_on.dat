25|$|Manchuria's economy boomed while {{chaos and}} {{uncertainty}} reigned {{in the rest}} of China. An especially ambitious project was to break the Japanese monopoly on cotton textiles by creating a large mill, which, much to Japan's sorrow, succeeded. The government also invested in other enterprises, among them quite a number of Sino-Japanese companies. During this time the Fengtian Army successfully kept a <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> Manchuria's many bandits. Various railway lines were built, among them the Shenyang-Hailong line, which opened in 1925. In 1924 Wang amalgamated three regional banks into the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, and became its General Director. By this he tried to create a development bank {{and at the same time}} keep accurate records of military spending.|$|E
25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it. Set had measured Osiris in his sleep and made {{sure that he was}} the only one who could fit the box. Several tried to see whether they fit. Once it was Osiris's turn to see if he could fit in the box, Set closed the <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and brought it back to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E

500|$|Ben Burtt, {{the sound}} effects supervisor, made {{extensive}} use of traditional foley work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of the Republic serials. He selected a [...]30-30 Winchester rifle {{for the sound of}} Jones' pistol. Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and baseball gloves with a baseball bat to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, {{and the sound of the}} boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous Wilhelm scream when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on Star Wars. He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within.|$|E

Three days after the race, Roush Fenway Racing was given penalties for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing", [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules", and a device or duct work that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another, or to the outside of the car. The penalties included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for Edwards' crew chief Bob Osborne, who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30, 2008, and placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order. Edwards was allowed to keep the victory; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. On March 12, Roush Fenway Racing {{announced it}} would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the season}} premieres of most {{television}} series in September, a common practice by television networks would be to send screeners of pilots of new shows to critics. On August 18, The CW notified critics {{that they would not}} be releasing the premiere episodes, saying, [...] " [...] have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere. We're not hiding anything... simply keeping a <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> 90210 until 9.02, riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night, and letting all our constituents see it at the same time." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the decision was an indication of the low quality of the episodes, but pointed out that the pilot may not have been finished in time for a screener release, which was later confirmed to be the case. Despite not having watched the episode, the Parents Television Council said in a statement that [...] "if Gossip Girl is any indication of what 90210 will look like, advertisers have plenty of reason to steer clear of the show... No reputable advertiser should even consider sponsoring the show without viewing the content in advance." [...] "We're Not in Kansas Anymore", along with the following episode, averaged 4.9 million viewers throughout the two-hour broadcast on September 2. This gave The CW its highest-rated premiere ever in the adults 18-49 demographic with a 2.6.
