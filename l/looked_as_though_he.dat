25|$|For {{a couple}} of years in the late 1940s, Tremlett <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> might be the answer to some of England's post-war cricketing woes. A tall, curly-haired all-rounder, Tremlett had a whippy fast-medium bowling action that moved the ball off the pitch and was a pugnacious {{right-handed}} batsman, strong at driving.|$|E
25|$|England {{managed to}} push {{on with the}} job of {{restoring}} some pride to their innings {{on the morning of}} the fifth day, thanks largely to the heroics of Jack Russell. From his overnight 47 not out, Russell soon pushed past fifty, and his partner Emburey <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> wasn't going to surrender his wicket easily either. They batted throughout the morning adding to their overnight partnership of 64. Russell looked confident, and it seemed Australia's bowlers were lost for ideas on how to remove the pair. The looked as though they were willing to bat the day out and save the match. They soon took England past Australia's total, and set about building a lead, but with less than a days play remaining, an English victory looked out of the question. Emburey brought up his fifty, his first of the series. The pair looked to be quite comfortable, however soon after they had taken England past 200, Australia finally got the breakthrough they had sought. Alderman produced a brilliant outswinger which cut off the pitch, collecting the top of Emburey's off-stump, clean bowled for a well made 64.|$|E
25|$|Against Bradman's Invincibles in 1948, Compton was England's {{standout}} {{performer in}} a losing cause. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he scored 184 {{in the second}} innings after Australia had established a first innings lead of 344, and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> might save the match for England until he lost his balance to a short-pitched ball from Miller and hit his wicket. In the Third Test at Old Trafford, Compton scored an unbeaten 145 in the first innings, when no other batsman made more than 37. He had scored only four runs when, while facing a bumper barrage from Ray Lindwall, he edged the ball onto his forehead. Compton was forced off {{the ground with a}} cut head, given two stitches, and ordered to rest despite wanting to return to the crease. He eventually came back out when England was teetering at 119 for 5 and enabled the team to reach 363. This was the only match that England did not lose, and if so much time had not been lost to the weather they might have won it. In the series he made 562 runs at 62.44, against fierce fast bowling from Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{were set}} {{a target of}} 239 for victory, and {{although}} {{that would have made}} it the highest-scoring innings in the match, they had five sessions in which to do it. However, what followed was a master-class in bowling from Broad, who took seven wickets for 44 runs in just 11 overs – his best Test figures – as New Zealand were bowled out for 68, their sixth-lowest score in Tests against England. Only BJ Watling and Neil Wagner managed to make it into double figures, theirs being two of the three wickets that Broad did not manage to take. Watling was not helped by a knee injury he had picked up on day 3 that meant McCullum had to keep wicket {{for the rest of the}} innings, but he nevertheless came out to bat, only to be caught in the slips off Anderson for 13. Wagner's wicket was the last to fall; it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> would be caught after hitting the ball straight up in the air to long leg, but the fielder missed the catch. In the confusion that followed, the ball was thrown back to Anderson at the bowler's end with Wagner stranded mid-pitch in the middle of his second run. With that, the day's play concluded with 14 wickets in less than two sessions and England went 1–0 up in the two-match series.|$|E
500|$|Then, I {{looked over}} and saw this man on the extreme right aisle sort of {{galloping}} to the podium. He was tall, he was thin, {{and the way he}} was galloping it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was going someplace much more important than the podium. ... He got to the podium—and I sat up straight. I was impressed with him.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford was at last {{successful}} in the 1902 election, when he ran in the newly created riding of Strathcona. His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, though this time he supported a two-province integration of the Northwest Territories into Confederation, rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, {{on the grounds that}} a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable. [...] It at first <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> would run unopposed; however, at the last minute local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him. Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival John R. Boyle, and won an easy victory.|$|E

2500|$|The backlands {{had little}} in the way of law and order, even the few police in {{existence}} were usually in the pocket of a local [...] "Coronel" [...] - a leading landowner who was also a regional political chief - and would usually take sides in any dispute. Indeed, the poorer portion [...] of the backlands population were generally badly treated by the paramilitary police, and would often prefer the presence of bandits in their settlements over that of the police. In such a society disputes between neighbours could quickly escalate into violent feuding. Virgulino's [...] family fell into a deadly feud with other local families. His father twice moved his family to avoid the escalating dispute, first to Nazaré, and then to Água Branca in the State of Alagoas. These moves proved to be fruitless as violence followed the family, with Virgulino and his brothers Antônio and Levino gaining reputations as troublemakers. Eventually José Ferreira was killed in a confrontation with the police on May 18, 1921. Virgulino sought vengeance and proved to be extremely violent in doing so. He became an outlaw, a cangaceiro, and was incessantly pursued by the police (whom he called macacos or monkeys). Virgulino had acquired the nickname 'Lampião' as early as 1921, allegedly because he could fire a lever-action rifle so fast, that at night it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was holding a lamp.|$|E
