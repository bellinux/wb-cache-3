5|$|Eddie Barlow, {{one of the}} South African {{members of}} the Rest of the World team, {{suggested}} to Sobers {{towards the end of}} the English series that the West Indian might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration {{across the hall from}} the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fiancé Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E

25|$|The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland {{sets out}} a number of {{proposed}} actions that the Scottish Government would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2013, {{the airport}} was {{helped by the}} {{province}} with a 4.5 million Euro contribution. The airport {{was very close to}} bankruptcy during this period. Later on, in March 2014, the same province of Limburg, believed that closure was never an option. They decided that they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the airport.|$|E
25|$|Combining open {{defecation}} {{with other}} activities: Some people walk {{early in the}} morning to look after their farms. Some consider it as a social activity, especially women who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some time to go out of their homes. While {{on their way to the}} fields for open defecation they can talk to other women and take care of their animals.|$|E

25|$|In late 1941 {{and early}} 1942, {{he came into}} contact with the {{resistance}} circle about Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. Bolz readily declared that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over a ministerial post in the new government after Hitler was overthrown. Goerdeler put him down as Culture Minister in the cabinet that he foresaw having to put together. Among other things, this would have meant that Bolz would be taking Goebbels's place.|$|E
25|$|O’Neil's Question is very {{conflicted}} {{on how far}} to go in enforcing justice, often feeling {{tempted to}} kill. He resists this temptation during his time in Hub City, realizing {{that part of his}} desire to go so far is just to see what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a life. His relationship with his mentor, Aristotle Rodor, is one of many things that keep him from going over the edge and back towards the darkness he had shown in his youth on the streets of Hub City.|$|E
25|$|A {{natural use}} of the turbocharger— and its {{earliest}} known use for any internal combustion engine, starting with experimental installations in the 1920s— is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air quickly falls off. At 5,486 m (18,000ft), the air is at half the pressure of sea level and the airframe experiences only half the aerodynamic drag. However, since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure, the engine normally produces only half-power at full throttle at this altitude. Pilots would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the low drag at high altitudes to go faster, but a naturally aspirated engine does not produce enough power at the same altitude to do so.|$|E

25|$|I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this {{opportunity}} to express my personal thanks {{and that of the}} American people for the services which you have performed over a period of the last six years. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization represents an endeavor on the part of fifteen free nations, the success of which is vital to the security and well-being of the United States. Thus, the position of Commander of one of the major commands of this organization {{is one of the greatest}} responsibility. The leadership and judgment which you have displayed in this capacity have been a source of deep satisfaction to me personally, and I know has won the great admiration not only of the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but of all the Free World.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
500|$|I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{some one}} family [...] to study thoroughly, principally {{with a view}} to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am {{strongly}} of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.|$|E

500|$|The {{excellence}} {{of the orchestra}} attracted leading international conductors. In its second season guest conductors included Richard Strauss, Felix Weingartner and Bruno Walter, followed, in later seasons, by Serge Koussevitzky, Beecham and Mengelberg. Arturo Toscanini, widely regarded {{at the time as}} the world's leading conductor, conducted the BBC SO in 1935 and later said that it was the finest he had ever directed. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1937, 1938 and 1939, and declared, [...] "This is the orchestra I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> round the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawson has said, {{regarding}} {{playing the}} role of Darren, [...] "I love playing the bad lad. He's my alter ego". In 2010 speaking of his ten-year tenure on the serial Dawson said he felt he like he was [...] "turning a bit into Ken Barlow" [...] and added that he enjoyed playing Darren more each year. Dawson added that he was [...] "still learning" [...] and did not take his role for granted. He stated, [...] "I’m not ignorant enough to think I can just go off and be a Hollywood star! I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on some more challenges for Darren".|$|E
500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would {{have to put up}} the shutters... And so I came to the Second Test in Sydney ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.|$|E

500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that I will ever make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Brown {{published}} the anti-psychiatry comics essay [...] "My Mom was a Schizophrenic", {{in which he}} examines society's role in mental illness, and questions the medical profession's accepted beliefs about it. [...] The six-page strip came with two pages of end notes gathered from his research. [...] Brown enjoyed this project and thought he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on another in which he could [...] "cram {{a lot of research}} into a comic strip". [...] When he came across Siggins' biography of Riel, he had been working on the experimental Underwater series, a project on which he felt he had lost his way. [...] His father died in late 1997, and he decided he did not [...] "want to waste [...] time with projects that weren't working out". [...] In 1998, he turned his attention to Riel, putting the unpopular Underwater series on hold.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) seeks {{advice from}} {{others in the}} office on how to start a {{relationship}} with Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt), the woman he socialized with at the Valentine's Day singles mixer at the office (from the previous episode, [...] "Blood Drive"). Andy (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynne, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam (Jenna Fischer), on the other hand, suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynne visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her {{that she has a}} nice smile and he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says [...] "Nice...boobs", but Lynne seems flattered by the statement.|$|E
50|$|Maradonna (Shanthnoo) is an aimless youngster who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> waste {{his time}} doing {{practically}} {{nothing other than}} fooling around. For him everything in life is Oru Rasam (just fun). He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the easy way out}} and lacks focus in his life.|$|R
5000|$|Ask {{questions}} {{instead of}} giving direct orders. No one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> orders. If we offer suggestions, rather than orders, it will boost others confidence {{and allow them to}} learn quickly from their mistakes.|$|R
