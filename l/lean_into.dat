25|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass of a bicycle and its rider must <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> a turn to successfully navigate it.

25|$|The most {{important}} {{function of the}} correct lead is for balance. While they are unimportant on a straight line, they can greatly influence the athletic ability of a horse on turns, especially if the turn is tight or performed at speed. Horses naturally lean in to the direction they are turning. Since they extend their lead-side legs further out, they may use them to balance themselves as they <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> that direction. So, if on the right lead while taking a right turn, the right hind will be positioned more under the body, and the right foreleg more {{in front of the}} body, to act as a stabilizer as the horse turns.|$|E
500|$|The first title {{considered}} for the album was Runaway Train. Malcolm suggested using {{a photograph of a}} famous 1895 derailment for the cover, but reconsidered after he found that Mr. Big had used it for their album <b>Lean</b> <b>into</b> It. According to Angus, Runaway Train was rejected was because it had been used by many musicians, including Elton John, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton, and he [...] "wanted something unique, new, different". So he suggested Black Ice, which refers to gigs played during winter in Scotland. He said, [...] "it rolled off the tongue" [...] and it reminded him of [...] "radio warnings up north of black ice." [...] Angus was inspired to write the eponymous song by a similar warning heard on his car radio during production.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And {{then we have a}} conversation with them about how we'd like to portray that, and then we try to <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Articulated {{cars have}} a number of advantages. [...] They save on the total number of wheels and trucks, {{reducing}} costs and maintenance expenses. [...] Further, movement between cars is safer and easier than with traditional designs. [...] Finally, it is possible to implement tilting schemes such as the Talgo design which allow the train to <b>lean</b> <b>into</b> curves. The chief disadvantage is that failure of a single car disables the entire set, since individual cars cannot be readily switched {{in and out of the}} consist.|$|E

Combined with other shear sense indicators such as δ-objects, oblique foliations establish the movement sense quite clearly.|$|R
