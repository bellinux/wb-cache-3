40|$|AbstractIn the world's {{semi-arid}} regions, {{high crop}} demands have produced short term economic incentives to convert food production on native grasslands to dryland row crop food production, while genetic enhancements and equipment {{have reduced the}} risk of crop failure. The objectives of this paper were to discuss (1) the importance of considering the long-term sustainability of changing land use in semi-arid regions; (2) the impact of extreme climatic events on ecosystem functioning; and (3) factors contributing to higher crop yields in semi-arid regions. Semi-arid regions contain fragile areas where extreme climate events may be a tipping point that converts an apparent sustainable system to a non-sustainable ecosystem. However, semi-arid regions also contain zones where “better” management practices have reduced the agricultural impacts on the environment, increased soil carbon levels, and stimulated economic development. Research suggests that food production can be increased by enhancing the productivity of existing cropped <b>land.</b> However, this <b>statement</b> does not infer that crop production on all existing cropped lands in semi-arid regions is sustainable.

Measurement results on a chassis dynamometer were used to determine VOC profiles for exhaust gas emissions of passenger cars for different vehicle and fuel types and different driving modes. Further measurements resulted in emission factors and VOC profiles for lignite burning in residential stoves. Using remote sensing techniques benzene emission factors of gas stations and the efficiency of gasoline vapour recovery systems were measured. To improve the quality and the spatial and temporal resolution of emission data, emission models were improved or modified. This was done by elaborating and applying new methods for important emission source categories (e. g., solvent use, road traffic, small combustion) as well as including new data sources in the calculation routines (e. g. emission <b>statements,</b> <b>land</b> use data, import/export indices of solvents). Simultaneously considerable progress was made improving temporal and spatial allocation functions and VOC profiles. With these improvements a large number of anthropogenic emission data sets for 14 different grid projections in Germany and Europe have been generated.

40|$|Home {{ownership}} {{has been}} recognized by many academic researchers as the preferable tenure compared with renting. As extolled by many policy decision makers, the benefits of home owning against renting received substantial benefits which has tangible constructive profitable impacts such as capital appreciation and intangible benefits such as life contentment, social stability, security of tenure, raised self-esteem, sense of belongings, civic participation, improved physical health and better child outcomes. In fact, few studies havebeen conducted in a Chinese society whether these perceived benefits are also confessed by home owners or potential buyers. Given the strong empirical studies in Western countries, it gives particular interest to explore further and undertake research pertaining to social benefits of home ownership in Hong Kong to ascertain the benefits derived. In Hong Kong, home ownership was promoted by the government since the Long Term Housing Strategy in 1987. However, government had re-positioned its home ownership policy after the Asian Financial Crisisin 1997. Government clarified that the housing objectives would focus on provision of public rental housing to low income group {{and at the same}} time minimize its intervention in the private property market by maintaining adequate land supply to sustain an unprejudiced and steady operating atmosphere in the private property market. In fact, the housing policy was shifted from public-led to market-led approach. The Secretary for Housing, Planning and <b>Lands</b> released a <b>Statement</b> on Housing Policy with nine measures were introduced to stablilize the housing market including suspension of production and sale of HOS flats indefinitely and sale of government land can only be applied through the application list. As such, people’s aspiration for home ownership was destructed due to shortage of housing supply and the aggregate demand for home ownership had pushed up the housing price which falls outside most people’s affordability. This paper attempts to explore if social implications of home ownership would have impact on one’s willingness to become home owner by comparison between two target groups of respondents including home owner and renter. The result of the survey and individual interview indicate that home ownership not only brings individual benefits to home owners or potential buyers such as personal fulfillment, wealth accumulation and life satisfaction but also generates societal benefits of maintaining stability, supportive to government and strengthening sense of belonging to the society. It is worthwhile and justified for the Hong Kong Government to accord top priority to materialize people’s desire for home ownership of its spillover individual and social benefits. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
50|$|In June 2013, Mr. Justice Rennie of the Federal Court of Canada {{ruled in}} a {{declaration}} of federal policy, in Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), that expropriation is a viable option, one of several alternatives available to the government under the law:1 The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte (the applicant) occupy the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory (Indian Reserve No. 38) in southeastern Ontario. This territory {{is part of the}} original Mohawk Tract granted to the Six Nations by Treaty 3½, the Simcoe Deed of 1793.2 The Culbertson Tract is a 923-acre parcel of land within the Mohawk Tract. The applicant alleges it was wrongfully alienated by the Crown in 1837. The Minister accepted this claim for negotiation in accordance with criteria of the Specific Claims Policy (the Policy) in 2003. A decade later, the claim remains unresolved.3 The applicant submits that the Minister is in breach of his fiduciary duty to negotiate in good faith. The applicant seeks a declaration that, as an aspect of his duty to negotiate in good faith, the Minister must consider all possible options including the acquisition of third party interests in the Culbertson Tract and returning the land to the applicant. The applicant seeks an order directing that the Minister negotiate on this basis.4 The Minister does not dispute the obligation to negotiate in good faith, which is derived from the honour of the Crown; rather the Minister characterizes this application as an attempt to force a particular negotiation position on the Crown and a breach of the confidentiality provisions of the protocol governing negotiations.5 While this case engages questions of Aboriginal law, it fits equally into orthodox principles of administrative law. The Minister has publicly committed to a policy and has a broad discretion under that policy as to how he will negotiate. In the exercise of that discretion, the Minister must have regard to the Policy’s parameters and terms. This requirement is not new law, nor is it unique to Aboriginal law; rather it is simply the application of settled principles of administrative law.6 The Minister has publicly stated that the Policy does not permit a land-based settlement, only financial compensation. This is incorrect. The Policy explicitly contemplates the acquisition and return of <b>land.</b> The Minister’s <b>statements</b> suggest that he either misunderstood or refused to acknowledge the scope of the settlement options open to him.7 While it is for the Minister to decide what negotiation position he will take, the duty to negotiate in good faith precludes him from publicly mischaracterizing the Policy. The distinction in the end, is narrow, but real. It is the difference between saying I cannot do something as opposed to saying I can do something but choose not to do so.8 The Court cannot interfere with the negotiations or mandate that the Minister take a specific negotiation position. Under the Policy the Minister may negotiate on the basis of land, monetary compensation or a mix of each, in any proportion he considers appropriate. However, in light of the Minister’s public statements, declaratory relief is appropriate. I accept the applicant’s argument that the Minister’s mischaracterization of the Policy affects the perception of other residents in the broader community, who may in turn see the applicant as intransigent and demanding. Misstating the tools available to the Minister may in fact impede settlement and reconciliation. Therefore, a declaration to clarify the governing Policy has some utility.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the {{beneficial}} use of dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence in lowlands and delta areas is explored. The major constraints for beneficial use of sediments are the contaminant concentrations, {{and the proper}} managing {{of supply and demand}} of  sediments (Chapter 1). When sediments are transferred from waterways to upland conditions, a series of processes take place that transform the waterlogged sediments into aerated soils, a process known as ripening. To understand the relation between the sediments and the soils formed, physical/chemical and biological processes were studied at three scales: laboratory scale, mesoscale, and field scale. The knowledge obtained with these experiments can provide guidelines to effectively use dredged sediments to reverse land subsidence. In the laboratory experiments, the environmental conditions were controlled, leading to constant water content and optimal oxygen concentration for biological processes. In the mesoscale experiment, the environmental parameters such as wind, precipitation and temperature, were not controlled as the 1 m 3 containers used for these experiments were placed outside, in open air conditions. Still, the water level could be monitored and controlled, and the subsidence of the dredged sediment could be monitored. In the field experiment, the environmental and filling conditions could not be controlled but the changes occurring in the deposit were monitored. In the first laboratory experiment (Chapter 2) the behaviour of dredged sediments with varying particle size distribution and organic matter content was studied. The dredged sediments were dewatered using suction chambers and then submitted to biochemical ripening during 141 days. The five types of dredged sediments had similar overall behaviour. The most significant observation was that most volume lost during dewatering and biochemical ripening was due to shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization. Furthermore, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification, i. e., more stable compounds were formed. The soils formed from biochemical ripening of dredged sediments had very stable aggregates and the load-bearing capacity was enough to sustain cattle and tractors. The second laboratory experiment (Chapter 3) was designed to investigate the influence of mixing compost and the solid fraction of swine manure (low in nutrients) with dredged sediments on dewatering and biochemical ripening. When the supply of dredged sediments is too low to compensate for land subsidence, bio-wastes, such as compost and manure, can be mixed with the sediments to reverse land subsidence. The results of this experiment confirm that most volume lost during ripening was due to shrinkage and not due to organic matter mineralization. Adding compost or the solid fraction of manure to the dredged sediments enhances the changes in the type of organic matter and CO 2 production, i. e., the addition results in increased rates of organic matter mineralization which is described in the literature as the priming effect.  In addition, the undrained shear strength of the mixtures of sediments with compost or manure was three times higher than the measured values for the sediments alone, meaning that organic amendments will improve the characteristics of the soil formed from ripening of sediments. The mesoscale experiment (Chapter 4) was performed during 400 days in 1 m 3 containers which allowed to control the water level. Two scenarios were tested: upland deposits in which the sediments are allowed to dry; and underwater deposits in which the water level is always 2 cm above the sediments. It was expected that the upland deposit conditions would lead to a higher subsidence than the underwater conditions. However, subsidence of the sediments was very similar for the two scenarios. Also in these experiments it was observed that most subsidence could be attributed to shrinkage and not organic matter mineralization, and the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification. Furthermore, the water balance indicated that evapotranspiration results in higher loss of water than drainage. Still, in this case the undrained shear strength after 400 days of experiment was not enough to sustain cattle or tractors even though it increased with time. The monitored field scale upland deposit of dredged sediments (Chapter 5) is located in the Wormer- en Jisperveld area – North Holland, the Netherlands. The deposit was filled in two stages reaching a maximum height of sediments of 195 cm. After 17 months of monitoring, the subsidence of the sediments was 119 cm to which an extra subsidence of 19. 5 cm of the underlying soil due to the overburden pressure was added. The results observed in the upland deposit are in line with the laboratory and mesoscale results since subsidence could also be attributed to shrinkage and no significant changes in the organic matter content were observed. However, {{in the case of the}} upland deposit, the type of organic matter changed in the direction of humification during the first 8 months (March to November), then stabilized during 7 months (November to June), and changed in the direction of mineralization afterwards. The outcomes of this research indicate that dredged sediments have the potential to reverse <b>land</b> subsidence. This <b>statement</b> is supported by the consistent results showing that the decrease in volume of dredged sediments is caused by shrinkage and not to organic matter mineralization as traditionally reported (Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5). In addition, in places where composted and stable bio-wastes are available, these can be added to dredged sediments to further reverse land subsidence. Still, in this case special attention should be given to the potential priming effect (Chapter 3). Finally it is recommended to adapt the current practices of disposal of dredged sediments in upland deposits, since 19. 5 cm of subsidence observed for the underlying soil in the upland deposit (Chapter 5), was caused by the overburden pressure of the dredged sediment. From the point of view of avoiding/reversing land subsidence it is recommended to spread thin layers (in the order of cm) of sediments over the land, although this might lead to an increase in the time and costs for the stakeholders involved in dredging and in managing the water boards...|$|R
