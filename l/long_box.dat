60|$|So {{the days}} went on, till one evening Jacob Meyer {{appeared}} with two Scotch carts laden with ten <b>long</b> <b>boxes</b> {{that looked like}} coffins, and other smaller boxes which were very heavy, {{to say nothing of}} a multitude of stores.

5000|$|The first yatate were <b>long</b> <b>boxes,</b> {{with the}} ink {{compartment}} in {{the axis of}} the pen.

60|$|The dolls took a nap of some hours, {{and were}} roused by a general {{tumbling}} {{out on a}} long shelf, where many other parcels lay, and lively men sent letters and papers flying here and there as if a whirlwind was blowing. A <b>long</b> <b>box</b> lay beside the dolls who stood nearly erect leaning against a pile of papers.

60|$|Among {{the graves}} moved {{the form of}} a man clothed in a white sheet, which the wind blew and flapped coldly every now and then.

60|$|At length, {{with a long}} breath, {{he backed}} out and closed the door. Going to the barn, he found a cow {{standing}} at an empty manger, and some hens and pigs frozen in the hay.

60|$|So Jonas {{brought down}} the box trap that night. It was a <b>long</b> <b>box,</b> about {{as big as a}} cricket, with a tall, pointed back, which looked like a steeple; so Rollo called it the steeple trap. It was so made that if the {{squirrel}} should go in, and begin to nibble some corn, which they were going to put in there, it would make the cover come down and shut him in. They fixed the trap {{on the end of the}} log, and Jonas observed, as he sat on the log, that he could see the barn chamber window through a little opening among the trees. Of course he knew that from the barn chamber window he could see the trap, though it would be too far off to see it plain.|$|E

"Well, the {{relations}} {{they wanted a}} big funeral, but corpse said he was down on flummery--didn't want any procession--fill the hearse full of mourners, and get out a stern line and tow him behind.

He was just set on having things {{the way he wanted}} them, and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans. He had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions; then he had the minister stand up behind a <b>long</b> <b>box</b> with a table--cloth over it, to represent the coffin, and read his funeral sermon, saying 'Angcore, angcore!' at the good places, and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him, and all the hifalutin; and then he made them trot out the choir, so's he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing 'Pop Goes the Weasel,' because he'd always liked that tune when he was downhearted, and solemn music made him sad; and when they sung that with tears in their eyes (because they all loved him), and his relations grieving around, he just laid there as happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it; and presently he got worked up and excited, and tried to join in, for, mind you, he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line; but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself his breath took a walk.|$|E
