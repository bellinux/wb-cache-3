We analytically identify behavioral tax effects for {{different levels of}} <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions, tax rate and prospect theoretical biases (loss aversion, probability weighting and reference dependence) and find tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions significantly bias investor perception, even more heavily than the tax rate. If <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions are rather generous, investors are very loss averse or assign a huge weight to loss probabilities, taxation {{is likely to increase}} the preference value of risky investments (behavioral tax paradox). Surprisingly, the identified significant perception biases of tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions occur under both high and low tax rates and thus are relatively insensitive to tax rate changes. Finally, we identify huge differences in behavioral tax effects across countries indicating that tax <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions crucially determine the perceived tax quality of a country for risky investments. Our analysis is relevant for policy makers discussing future tax reforms as well as for investors assessing risky investment opportunities. asymmetric taxation,investment decisions,loss offset restrictions,perception bias,risktaking,tax effects,tax losses,prospect theory,behavioral taxatio...|$|E
40|$|This note {{develops}} a behavioral {{explanation for the}} existence of an asymmetric tax treatment of gains and losses when investors are loss averse. We find that <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules should be more restrictive for investors which are (1) more risk averse in case of gains, (2) less risk seeking in case of losses, or (3) more loss averse. Our findings have important policy implications. Tax authorities often implement identical <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules for different investor clienteles. However, there should be specific <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> rules for investors who differ in risk attitude as well as in loss aversion.

30|$|The {{effect of}} the EBITDA-based IDR on the {{organizational}} form depends on the cash flow distribution and is, therefore, theoretically undetermined. Moreover, if we assume corporate <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions, both forms of IDR always distort the decision between limited and unlimited liability firms. The effect of corporate <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions is threefold: first, due to the missing <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> for corporations, IDR are ineffective in case of losses. This privileges the corporation. Second, a tax exemption of a default gain that could compensate for the restricted interest deductibility is not effective due to the missing <b>loss</b> <b>offset.</b> Third, due to the missing <b>loss</b> <b>offset,</b> creditors will receive lower payments {{in the case of}} insolvency. This increases the expected default gain and the risk premium. This in turn leads to a higher {{effect of the}} IDR. In contrast to the first effect, the other two effects discriminate against the corporation. Thus, the total effect is undetermined and depends on the distribution of the cash flows, the leverage ratio, and the risk-free interest rates as we additionally illustrate in Monte Carlo simulations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} particular <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> limitations on intrastate and cross-border investment decisions. Investment can be realized in the investor’s domestic business, in a foreign branch or in a foreign subsidiary. The relative impact on the optimal real investment alternative compared to the optimal financial investment alternative indicates the investment incentives of tax law asymmetries. Integrating an initial loss carryforward {{at the time of}} investment creates a special decision situation. Varying <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> parameters typically induces ambiguous effects that depend on the combination of all parameters under consideration. On average, a domestic minimum tax and a time limit on loss carryforwards tend to depress real investment. However, it is possible to find counter-examples. Real investment projects with decreasing cash flows and expected infra-marginal projects {{are less likely to be}} discriminated against than projects with increasing cash flows and expected marginal projects, respectively. An initial loss carryforward generates a domestic lock-in effect that may be intensified by <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> limitations.

However, the potential deadweight losses owing to imperfect offset has not been fully explored. This paper develops a framework whereby that investigation can be carried out and utilizes numerical simulations to investigate the size of potential losses. Results show that when the government and private sector are equally efficient in handling market risk, welfare losses owing to the absence of offset provisions could be substantial. Under plausible assumptions about attitudes towards risk and time preference, and with a capital income tax rate of forty percent, over sixty cents per dollar of tax revenue raised would be dissipated. In contrast, full <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> would reduce that loss to approximately fourteen cents. capital income taxation, uncertainty, deadweight loss, <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> provisions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the response of}} corporate tax revenues to the business cycle, the so called ‘cyclicality of corporate tax revenues’. It distinguishes between {{the impact of the}} business cycle in recessions and booms and calculates the asymmetry in tax revenues response. It also explains the heterogeneous nature of the asymmetries using a new index of <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> generosity provisions. We find that the short run contemporaneous impact of business cycle on corporate tax revenues is quite strong in normal times, but much lower in booms. The asymmetry of cyclicality between booms and recessions is persistent and points to larger responses in recessions. We also show how sensitive tax revenue responses are to different recession and boom thresholds. Importantly, we find that <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> generosity provisions enhance this asymmetry in the cyclicality of corporate tax revenues. Countries that are more generous in terms of <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> provisions experience much more volatile response of corporate tax revenues to business cycle during recessions, magnifying the asymmetry of cyclicality. As a result the automatic stabilizer impact of corporation tax will differ between booms and recessions, being stronger and more effective in the latter, especially in countries that offer more generous loss-offset provisions...|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of our study we extend a model {{previously}} used by Blaufus and Hundsdoerfer (2008) and Blaufus and Mantei (2014) to incorporate leverage-based as well as EBITDA-based IDR. In a baseline model we will assume full <b>loss</b> <b>offset,</b> full deductibility of interest expenses as well as full taxability of default gains and show that this will lead to organizational form neutrality if tax rates for both forms are identical. Integrating IDR in the model, we find opposing effects: first, a dividend effect which privileges the corporation {{due to the fact}} that IDR increase only the corporate income tax burden but not shareholders’ taxes. Second, a default gain effect which arises if default gains and interest expenses are treated asymmetrically. If default gains (arising due to failure in debt redemption) are taxed to a higher extent than interest is deductible, this discriminates against the corporation. We demonstrate that organizational form neutrality can only be achieved in the case of leverage-based IDR and requires a full <b>loss</b> <b>offset,</b> a symmetric treatment of interest and default gains as well as either a legal form dependent IDR or absence of shareholder taxation which is in contrast to actual legal regulations. If we consider corporate <b>loss</b> <b>offset</b> restrictions, IDR always distort the choice of organizational form.|$|E
