500|$|The T.F. Mk IV (B-46), {{as the new}} {{development}} was designated, featured larger tail surfaces for better low-speed control. The enlarged rudder was horn balanced and the vertical stabilizer was offset three degrees to port to counteract the four-bladed Rotol propeller's torque. The wings now featured hydraulically operated dive brakes on both upper and lower surfaces. The aircraft's wings were now stressed to carry one [...] bomb under each wing or a [...] drop tank or eight RP-3 rockets. The frame that held the torpedo {{was connected to the}} undercarriage so that it pivoted nose-downward to increase ground clearance with the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended</b> and pivoted upward to reduce drag while in flight. A [...] fuel tank could be fitted on the centreline in lieu of the torpedo. The Mk IV first flew on 17 May 1945, and was the first version of the Firebrand to enter mass production, with 170 built, although 50 more aircraft were cancelled.|$|E

50|$|After {{the plane}} was lifted off the runway, the C829 circuit breaker was closed, and the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was <b>extended,</b> using the {{alternate}} system. The plane was then towed to the LOT maintenance hangar, for repairs and further investigation.|$|R
50|$|During this phase, {{there was}} a sharp nose-up pitch {{attitude}} change, with the aircraft at low altitude, seeming to be losing speed. It then dived with a slight angle {{to the right and}} crashed. The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was <b>extended.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the ship}} had {{stabilized}} in the proper attitude for firing, Lovell would deploy the LEM's <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>extending</b> its four spidery legs {{to get them out}} of the way of the descent engine. Next the computer, relying on other instructions Haise typed into it, would fire four of Aquarius's attitude jets for 7.5 seconds. This procedure, known as ullage, was intended to jolt the spacecraft slightly forward and force the descent engine fuel to the bottom of its tanks, eliminating bubbles and air pockets. After that, the main descent engine would ignite automatically firing at 10 percent thrust for 5 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 September 2009, a Contact Air Fokker 100 hit {{the runway}} without {{part of its}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended.</b> One flight {{attendant}} was injured.|$|E
5000|$|As the Tupolev {{came closer}} Captain Peter [...] "Trenky" [...] Trenkner {{sitting in his}} {{aircraft}} on the apron noticed that the landing Tupolev didn't have its <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended.</b> He shouted into the radio several times: [...] "Go around, Malev, go around!" [...] (audible on the CVR recording).|$|E
50|$|The {{airplane}}, with <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended,</b> {{struck the}} ground on its right side. A severe fire broke out immediately. The airplane slid along, losing various parts, struck and knocked over the airport perimeter fence then crossed a road before coming {{to a halt in}} flames. An alert was immediately sounded by the control tower.|$|E

50|$|A belly landing, {{pancake landing}} or gear-up landing occurs when an {{aircraft}} lands without its <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> fully <b>extended</b> and uses its underside, or belly, as its primary landing device. Normally the term gear-up landing refers to incidents {{in which the}} pilot forgets to <b>extend</b> the <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> while belly <b>landing</b> refers to incidents where a mechanical malfunction prevents the pilot from <b>extending</b> the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|The XT-37 was aerodynamically clean, {{so much so}} that a speedbrake {{was fitted}} behind the {{nosewheel}} doors to help increase drag for landing and for use in other phases of flight. Since the short <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> placed the engine air intakes close to the ground, screens pivoted over the intakes from underneath when the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was <b>extended,</b> to prevent foreign object damage.|$|R
50|$|A less radical {{design by}} Dr. John E. Younger {{featured}} all-metal construction; the aircraft was built as an all-metal, low-wing, retractable gear, twin engine transport with a triple vertical tail supporting a dual (biplane arrangement) horizontal stabilizer. The wing used a large box-spar construction with corrugated skin panels. The partly retracting <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended</b> automatically when the throttle was closed.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{standard}} production F-104 Starfighters were obtained (including F-104D two-seat versions) {{and used by}} the ARPS to simulate the low lift/high drag glide approach path profiles of the X-15 and the projected X-20 Dyna-Soar program. These maneuvers were commenced at 12000 ft where the F-104 engine was throttled back to 80% power; and with the flaps, speedbrakes and <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended,</b> the aircraft was established in a 30˚ dive with a pull-out for the landing flare starting at 1500 ft above the ground. These glide approaches gave little room for error.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the landing}} gear was retracted, [...] "burning rubber was brought into close {{proximity}} with hydraulic and electrical system components", causing the failure of both hydraulic and pressurisation systems that led to structural damage and loss of control of the aircraft. The Transportation Safety Board later concluded, [...] "had the crew left the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended,</b> the accident might have been averted". Fuel, [...] "probably introduced {{as a result of}} 'burn through' of the centre fuel tank", intensified the fire, which eventually consumed the cabin floor. People began falling out of the aircraft when their seat harnesses burned through. [...] "Despite the considerable destruction to the airframe, the aircraft appeared to have been controllable until just before the crash." ...|$|E
25|$|NR12048 {{modified}} with retractable undercarriage. Entered in the 1932 Bendix Trophy, but withdrawn after a {{belly landing}} {{due to the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> failing to <b>extend</b> forced withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|The game is {{rendered}} in 3D, but with insignificant buildings in 2D. All {{of the aircraft}} are detailed with logos and artwork, with real movements such as a visible rudder movement when the rudder is activated, and the full movement of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> while <b>extending</b> and retracting. There is no visible damage, however.|$|R
50|$|Witnesses {{recalled}} {{that one of}} its engines exploded and caught fire just seconds after take off. The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was still <b>extended</b> when this happened. It then rose sharply and stalled.|$|R
50|$|Since {{considerable}} {{work had}} already been done on the P.1101 design, the RLM decided to continue reduced funding in order for Messerschmitt to carry out experimental flights, testing the swept back wing at anticipated speeds up to Mach 1. The worsening war situation led to the expedited, but risky, approach of building a full-scale prototype in parallel with detail construction and continuing statistical calculation, while existing components such as the wings (Me 262), <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (<b>extended</b> Bf 109), and flight components were utilized where feasible. It was also intended for the test flights to be conducted with 35, 40, and 45 degree wing sweep. Production of the V1 prototype was begun at Messerschmitt's Bavarian Oberammergau Complex with a projected first flight in June 1945.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{consisted of}} a crew module designed by extending the Gemini B exterior cone to a 419-cm-diameter heat shield and a cargo propulsion module. Recovery of the crew module would be effected {{by means of a}} gliding parachute (parawing). The parametric analysis and point design of the parawing were accomplished by Northrop- Ventura Company under a subcontract, and the contents of their final report were incorporated into the document. The landing attenuation of the spacecraft would be accomplished by a skid <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended</b> {{from the bottom of the}} crew module, allowing the crew to land in an upright position. The propulsion functions of transfer, rendezvous, attitude control, and retrograde would be performed by a single liquid propellant system, and launch escape would be provided by a large Apollo-type launch escape system.|$|E
5000|$|On takeoff, only 50% {{engine power}} was {{necessary}} for a takeoff ground roll of about 2000 ft. Climbing at 25-30 degrees, the RB-57Ds could reach 50000 ft in just 15 minutes.

40|$|Photograph of {{downward}} {{view of a}} "Chateau Thierre Aeroplane", a World War I aircraft, {{in flight}} over Argone Forest and French trenches, ca. 1914 - 1918. The SPAD biplane has two circle insignia, {{one on each side}} of its wings. There are several stripes that run diagonally across the body of the plane and around its nose. In the middle of the plane's body, there is a symbol of an eagle(?) with its wings spread, tips pointing up. The fixed <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extends</b> below the plane. The terrain that the plane is flying over appears to be undeveloped land. Several horsemen and horse-drawn carriages can be seen on a long straight road. Beyond this road is a forest.

5000|$|On 25 June 2001, an Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante {{operated}} by Airtex Aviation on a charter flight from Sydney to Griffith suffered an engine fire en route. Believing {{the fire to}} be extinguished after taking initial action, the pilot elected to land at Young Airport. On finding Young under fog, the pilot diverted to Cootamundra. Between the towns, the aircraft cabin filled with smoke from the fire which had flared up again in the engine nacelle. During the emergency landing, only the aircraft's right main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended</b> and the aircraft skidded to a stop on grass next to the runway. The pilot and all 8 passengers evacuated safely, however the investigation revealed delays in the emergency response to the accident, including an Ambulance that was initially unable to access the airfield as the emergency gate was locked.|$|E

50|$|September 21, 1992, KORL, CESSNA 210L, N777BK, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Flight {{was unable}} to get safe {{indication}} for <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended</b> while approaching destination airport. Flight returned to departure airport. After accomplishing emergency procedures for gear extension, gear safe indication was still not obtained. Pilot determined all hydraulic fluid had been lost. Flight was landed with the nose gear locked and the main gears partially extended. Post-landing examination revealed right main gear hydraulic actuator had failed due to overstress along metal grain boundaries and at area of low wall thickness. All hydraulic system pressures {{were found to be}} normal and no other landing gear system failures were found. After failure of the gear actuator all normal and emergency system fluid was lost through the actuator. Probable cause(s): Failure of the right main landing gear actuator due to overstress for undetermined reasons which resulted in loss of all landing gear system hydraulic fluid which in turn resulted in the pilot being unable to extend and lock the landing gear.|$|E
50|$|Electric taxiing {{was invented}} by Delos Aerospace and {{patented}} in the US in 2007. Electric taxiing will significantly reduce aircraft fuel burn which {{is estimated to be}} as high as 27% of total fuel burn for a 90-minute flight where waiting in queue adds to the time on the ground. Also tire pre-spin allows for reduced impulse stress applied to the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> thus <b>extending</b> useful lifetime for the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> and reduces tire wear, while improving passenger comfort.|$|R

40|$|A {{ditching}} {{investigation was}} made of a l/l 2 -scale dynamically similar model of the Douglas F 4 D- 1 airplane to study its behavior when ditched. The model was landed in calm water at the Langley tank no. 2 monorail. Various landing attitudes, speeds, and configurations were investigated. The behavior of the model was determined from visual observations, acceleration records, and motion-picture records of the ditchings. Data are presented in tables, sequence photographs, time-history acceleration curves, and attitude curves. From {{the results of the}} investigation, it was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at the lowest speed and highest attitude consistent with adequate control (near 22 deg) with landing gear retracted. In a calm-water ditching under these conditions the airplane will probably nose in slightly, then make a fairly smooth run. The fuselage bottom will sustain appreciable damage so that rapid flooding and short flotation time are likely. Maximum longitudinal deceleration will be about 4 g and maximum normal acceleration will be about 6 g in a landing run of about 420 feet, In a calm-water ditching under similar conditions with the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>extended,</b> the airplane will probably dive. Maximum longitudinal decelerations will be about 5 - 1 / 2 g and maximum normal accelerations will be about 3 - 1 / 2 g in a landing run of about 170 feet...|$|E
