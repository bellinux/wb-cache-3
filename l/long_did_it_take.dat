The answer returned clear and sharp; then its echo cracked under the hollow cliff, and crossing and recrossing the ravine, it died at last far away, like the muffled peal of a bell-buoy. Again I heard the blended yelping of the hounds, and closer at hand. I saw a long, low cliff above, and decided that the hounds were running {{at the base of}} it. Another chorus of yelps, quicker, wilder than the others, drew a yell from me. Instinctively I knew the dogs had jumped game of some kind. Satan knew it as well as I, for he quickened his pace and sent the stones clattering behind him.|$|E

Not very <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> Ellen to see that Colter's object was to hide their tracks. He zigzagged through the forest, {{avoiding}} the bare spots of dust, the dry, sun-baked flats of clay where water lay in spring, and he chose the grassy, open glades, the long, pine-needle matted aisles. Ellen rode at their heels and it pleased her to watch for their tracks. Colter manifestly had been long practiced in this game of hiding his trail, and he showed the skill of a rustler. But Ellen was not convinced that he could ever elude a real woodsman. Not improbably, however, Colter was only aiming to leave a trail difficult to follow and which would allow him and his confederates ample time to forge ahead of pursuers. Ellen could not accept a certainty of pursuit. Yet Colter must have expected it, and Springer and Wells also, for they had a dark, sinister, furtive demeanor that strangely contrasted with the cool, easy manner habitual to them.|$|E

I remember that 's the way you arrived at Baden when we were there together; the first thing we knew, you were standing in the midst of us. Do you remember that evening when you presented yourself? You came up and touched Gordon on the shoulder, and he gave a little jump. He will give another little jump when he sees you to-day. He gives a great many little jumps; I keep him skipping about! I remember perfectly the way we were sitting that evening at Baden, and the way you looked at me when you came up. I saw you before Gordon--I see a good many things before Gordon. What did you look at me that way for? I always meant to ask you. I was dying to know." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{he ran to the}} nearest stream to wash himself, but to his horror, when he caught sight of his face, he saw his nose had grown the colour of an apple, and reached nearly to his waist. He started back {{thinking}} he was dreaming, and put up his hand; but, alas! the dreadful thing was true. 'Oh, why does not some wild beast devour me?' he cried to himself; 'never, never, can I go again amongst my fellow-men! If only the sea had swallowed me up, how much happier it had been for me!' And he hid {{his head in his hands}} and wept. His grief was so violent, that it exhausted him, and growing hungry he looked about for something to eat. Just above him was a bough of ripe, brown nuts, end he picked them and ate a handful. To his surprise, as he was eating them, he felt his nose grow shorter and shorter, and after a while he ventured to feel it with his hand, and even to look in the stream again! Yes, there was no mistake, it was as short as before, or perhaps a little shorter. In his joy at this discovery Tiidu did a very bold thing. He took one of the apples out of his pocket, and cautiously bit a piece out of it. In an instant his nose was as long as his chin, and in a deadly fear lest it should stretch further, he hastily swallowed a nut, and awaited the result with terror. Supposing that the shrinking of his nose had only been an accident before! Supposing that that nut and no other was able to cause its shrinking! In that case he had, by his own folly, in not letting well alone, ruined his life completely. But, no! he had guessed rightly, for in no more time than his nose had taken to grow <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to return to its proper size. 'This may make my fortune,' he said joyfully to himself; and he gathered some of the apples, which he put into one pocket, and a good supply of nuts which he put into the other. Next day he wove a basket out of some rushes, so that if he ever left the island he might be able to carry his treasures about.|$|E

We find that both the Harvard and Yale forecasters were systematically too optimistic, yet nothing in the data suggests that the optimism was unwarranted. ...|$|E

This includes two moderate sized shallow strike-slip earthquakes with high peak ground acceleration in the epicentral area. After the earthquakes a survey on earthquake intensities was carried out by the Earthquake Engineering Research Centre of the University of Iceland. The survey also included questions addressing safety issues, as well as demographic information. The data dealt with herein cover a total of 249 respondents in the epicentral area. In the analysis presented the main emphasis is on the following three questions. Did you manage to seek shelter inside a house during the earthquake? Did you manage to keep your balance? How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> for you to recover? The main finding is that the data indicate a tendency towards gender depend-ent earthquake perception, which in some cases appears to be a statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. The task of archaeologists is {{to infer}} the {{cultural}} processes {{at work in}} the (often distant) past, based on an examination of the artifactual, biological, and environmental evidence of human civilizations that remains today. Ancient monuments, like other cultural constructions, can reveal clues about the societies that created them, provided researchers ask suitable questions and devise appropriate strategies for discovering the answers. Initial archaeological surveys of monumental buildings are typically designed to answer "what" types of questions: investigators describe, measure, and map the structures they uncover. The next generation of research generally deals with "how" questions, for example, how were monuments built? How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to construct them? How much labor was required? How did the buildings function? Eventually, archaeologists begin to explore the more difficult "why" questions. Why did ancient societies begin to construct monuments? Why did monumental construction persist, in some cases for hundreds of years? Finally, why did monument building decline and disappear...|$|E
40|$|Bose-Einstein condensation, or BEC, has a {{long and}} rich history dating from the early 1920 s. In this article we will trace briefly over this history {{and some of the}} {{developments}} in physics that made possible our successful pursuit of BEC in a gas. We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this dis-cussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of “How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work? How <b>long</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> you and why? ” We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what makes BEC in a dilute gas so interesting, unique, and experimentally challenging. 1 The notion of Bose statistics dates back to a 1924 paper in which Satyen...|$|E
