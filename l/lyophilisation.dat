40|$|Basidiomycetes present {{specific}} problems {{with regard to}} their preservation, because most of them do not form resistant propagules in culture but exist only as mycelium. Usually these fungi can only be preserved by serial transfer on agar (labour-intensive procedures that can increase the danger of variation or loss of physiological or morphological features), or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (expensive). Cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C and <b>lyophilisation</b> could be good alternatives. In this work we set up and tested six protocols of cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C, and 12 protocols of <b>lyophilisation</b> on 15 isolates of white-rot fungi (WRF) belonging to 10 species. The tested protocols were mainly characterized by the use of different growth media, protectants, time and number of perfusion with protectants and finally by the typology and origin of the samples to be cryopreserved (mycelium/agar plug, whole colony) or to lyophilise (mycelium/agar plug, mycelium fragment, whole colony). Cryopreservation and <b>lyophilisation</b> outcomes were checked, at morphological (macro- and microscopic features), physiological (growth rate and laccase, Mn-independent and Mn-dependent peroxidases activities) and genetic level (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms analysis - AFLP). Vitality of all fungi was successfully preserved by all cryopreservation protocols at - 80 degrees C, and by two <b>lyophilisation</b> methods. Our results showed that cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C did not produce morphological changes in any isolate, while two isolates were affected by <b>lyophilisation.</b> None of the physiological features were lost, even though growth rate and enzyme activities were somehow influenced by all preservation methods. AFLP analysis showed that only the two isolates that varied in their morphology after <b>lyophilisation</b> produced a different DNA fingerprint pattern in comparison with that obtained before <b>lyophilisation.</b> These findings provide evidence that cryopreservation at - 80 degrees C and <b>lyophilisation</b> are suitable alternatives to liquid nitrogen cryopreservation for preservation of some WRF strains.

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2016 - 2017, Tutor: José María Gutiérrez GonzálezLyophilisation is {{a special}} method of {{dehydration}} carried out {{through a process of}} sublimation. Particularly in the food sector, this operation is increasingly used because it always ensures the quality of food. This technique is widely used in fruit, high protein foods and juices. In contrast, the disadvantage of this method is its high cost. This leads to a major constraint: economically speaking, freeze-dried foods are not available to everyone. Furthermore, to carry out the <b>lyophilisation</b> process it is necessary to operate under very low temperature conditions, which is an additional reason why, from the energy standpoint, it is a very expensive process. For all these reasons, the aim of this research is the energy optimization of <b>lyophilisation</b> and the study of the possible integration of the refrigeration cycle in the <b>lyophilisation</b> process. This study consists in the following stages: • Bibliographical study about <b>lyophilisation</b> parameters. • Selection of refrigerant fluids to be studied. • Simulation with ASPEN to select the best refrigerant and the best conditions. The bibliographical study has permitted to establish that the <b>lyophilisation</b> parameters generally use a range between - 5 °C for the sublimation chamber, assuring to be below the triple point, and 20 °C to remove the final adsorbed water. For the condensation chamber, the temperature fluctuates between - 10 °C and - 50 °C, assuring enough driving force for vapour transfer. The refrigerants selected through the study have been: R 32, ammonia, R 152 A, R 1270 A and R 134 A, which are the most generally used satisfying environmental concerns by avoiding chlorinated compounds. After ASPEN simulations and having compared variables such as power, energy consumption and operation time, depending on temperature difference, it can be concluded that although these parameters vary depending on the refrigerant used, the greater the temperature difference, the more power consumption. The greater temperature difference implies the less drying time, whilethe energy consumption, which is power multiplied by time, could present a minimum. However, according to the temperature differences studied, only refrigerant R 152 A and ammonia present a minimum. Taking into account energy considerations and operating safety, the R 32 refrigerant has been chosen as the best one for carrying out the <b>lyophilisation</b> process, since this refrigerant operates at sublimation and condensation temperatures of - 2 °C (7, 6 bars) and - 40 °C (1, 8 bars), respectively, which are reasonable temperatures for carrying out the <b>lyophilisation</b> process. Consumption of energy is not too high, and pressures implied are appropriate from the operation safety point of view...|$|E

The addition of residual moisture (values between 7. 5 % and 10 % w/w) resulted in rapid collapse except for trehalose and decreasing SC purity for all formulations. In a separate experiment disaccharide formulation solutions show a slight but significant reduction (< 3 % with sucrose and maltose) in transfection efficiency when compared to pDNA dissolved in water.

The turbidities of five other plasmas were determined before and after <b>lyophilisation.</b> The turbid components of fresh and reconstituted lyophilised plasmas were studied using electron microscopy. The effects of turbidity on five types of coagulometer were determined by adding varying concentrations of a turbidity enhancing material. RESULTS: Reconstituted lyophilised plasmas were more turbid than normal plasmas, because of agglomerated liposomes.

The analysis showed that TCA or thermal treatment significantly reduced the degree of degradation and that these pre-treatment protocols were more effective than treatment with either protease inhibitors or <b>lyophilisation.</b> This study establishes standardised sample preparation methods for the reproducible analysis of protein patterns by 2 -D PAGE in yeast, and may also be applicable to other proteomic analyses such as gel-free-based quantitation methods...|$|E
40|$|RH 1 {{is a novel}} aziridinylbenzoquinone alkylating agent, {{which is}} {{activated}} in tumour cells by DT diaphorase. In common with previous aziridinylbenzoquinones, RH 1 exhibits limited aqueous stability and solubility. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the pharmaceutical properties of RH 1 with a view to preparing a suitable formulation for clinical trial. Stability in a neutral phosphate-buffered solution was poor with a degradation half-life of 50 h at 55 degreesC, indicating that <b>lyophilisation</b> was preferable. The reaction kinetics indicated a similarity with previous studies for base-catalysed degradation of aziridinylbenzoquinones. Intrinsic aqueous solubility at 0. 5 mg mL(- 1) may be increased in solvent systems or by the use of polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or complexing agents like hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). In the latter case this increased solubility by an order of magnitude to around 5 mg mL(- 1). Four potential formulations based on <b>lyophilisation</b> of RH 1 (1 mg mL(- 1)) from buffered solution (pH 7, 0. 01 m NaH 2 PO 4) containing either 50 mg mL(- 1) mannitol, 40 mg mL(- 1) dextran, 20 mg mL(- 1) PVP or 50 mg mL(- 1) HPBCD were prepared and examined forstability characteristics. All formulations exhibited a temperature-dependent degradation. The mannitol and dextran formulations had limited stability and degraded rapidly at all temperatures. The PVP and HPBCD formulations degraded at elevated temperatures but remained stable for up to twelve months at 4 degreesC. Examination of the degradation kinetics in the latter systems demonstrated similarity to the solution degradation mechanism, while in the former alternative degradation pathways appeared to be occurring. The chemical stability of RH 1 in lyophilised formulations is dependent upon the excipient employed and storage temperature. Either the PVP or HPBCD formulation would be suitable clinical trial formulations of RH 1. The results indicate that the choice of <b>lyophilisation</b> excipient for aziridinylbenzoquinones cannot be based on previous literature studies of related agents...|$|E

For dry matter determination, lyophilised subsamples were subjected to a drying procedure at 103 °C for at least 4 h.

Due to the treatment with pH, the polymers, and in particular SELP- 1020 -A, were already highly pure. Precipitation with 20 % ammonium sulphate allowed for both purification and concentration of the samples {{and in this way}} avoided high volumes for dialysis and subsequent <b>lyophilisation.</b> Furthermore, no protein losses were detected by SDS-PAGE, indicating high recovery rates of recombinant protein.|$|E
