40|$|Waste {{retrieval}} {{operations were}} successfully completed in two large underground radioactive waste storage tanks in 1997. The US Department of Energy (DOE) and the Gunite Tanks Team worked cooperatively during two 10 -week waste removal campaigns and removed approximately 58, 300 gallons of waste from the tanks. About 100 gallons of a sludge and <b>liquid</b> <b>heel</b> remain {{in each of}} the 42, 500 gallon tanks. These tanks are 25 ft. in diameter and 11 ft. deep, and are located in the North Tank Farm in the center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Less than 2 % of the radioactive contaminants remain in the tanks, proving the effectiveness of the Radioactive Tank Cleaning System, and accomplishing the first field-scale cleaning of contaminated underground storage tanks with a robotic system in the DOE complex...|$|E
40|$|Technologies were {{investigated}} to determine viable processes for removing mercury from the calciner (NWCF) offgas {{system at the}} Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Technologies for gas phase and aqueous phase treatment were evaluated. The technologies determined are intended to meet EPA Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) requirements under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Currently, mercury accumulation in the calciner off-gas scrubbing system is transferred to the tank farm. These transfers lead to accumulation in the <b>liquid</b> <b>heels</b> of the tanks. The principal objective for aqueous phase mercury removal is heel mercury reduction. The system presents a challenge to traditional methods {{because of the presence}} of nitrogen oxides in the gas phase and high nitric acid in the aqueous scrubbing solution. Many old and new technologies were evaluated including sorbents and absorption in the gas phase and ion exchange, membranes/sorption, galvanic methods, and UV reduction in the aqueous phase. Process modifications and feed pre-treatment were also evaluated. Various properties of mercury and its compounds were summarized and speciation was predicted based on thermodynamics. Three systems (process modification, NOxidizer combustor, and electrochemical aqueous phase treatment) and additional technology testing were recommended...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe J-shaped {{gas-lift}} well showed complex dynamic phenomena. The downward inclination of the J-shaped well introduces periodic waves {{over time}} {{as a result of}} mixing gas and liquid. This behavior introduces periodic fluctuations of the superficial gas and liquid velocities along tubing. The velocity fluctuation is due to the accumulation of <b>liquid</b> in the <b>heel</b> of the inclined section of J-shaped well and the development of reservoir gas pressure to overcome the accumulated liquid column making the J-shaped gas-lift well to be prone to production under slugging regime. The investigation here is addressing two aspects with the objective to optimize the gas-lift performance. The first addresses the production behavior and the mechanism that leads to development of slugging regime in the J-shaped well. Secondly it addresses the effect of the gas composition of the gas-lift on the production performance. Different gas-lift gas composition causes the gas and liquid compositions to change with the pressure and temperature profile in the production tubing. Gas-lift contains C 1 as a major component. The work here shows that a fraction of 0. 15 nC 5 combined with C 1 gives highest oil production rates. In the contrary, high content of 0. 20 iC 4 with C 1 give lowest oil rates. This outcome would assist in designing optimum gas-lift injection system...|$|R
