40|$|Objectives: Recent {{literature}} has identified {{a number of}} potential advantages in wearing <b>loupes</b> for dental hygienists, including improved quality of care and ergonomics. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine dental hygienists' opinions about wearing <b>loupes.</b> Methods: A short online survey was distributed to all dental hygienists who had recently participated in a study investigating the efficacy of <b>loupes</b> on musculoskeletal disorders; all had only worn <b>loupes</b> for a 6 -month period, and prior to the study had not worn <b>loupes.</b> All of those invited completed the survey (n = 12), achieving a 100 % response rate. Results: The majority of respondents noted that the <b>loupes</b> were adaptable to wear; however, only one-quarter of hygienists surveyed were wearing them often following the study. Respondents identified that the biggest advantage to <b>loupes</b> was calculus removal (91. 7 %), and most indicated that they felt the quality of their work increased when wearing <b>loupes</b> (75 %). The biggest disadvantage to wearing <b>loupes</b> was the adjustment period (50 %), with limited depth of vision, headache, vertigo and infection control noted by at least one-third of respondents. Conclusions: This study revealed that hygienists identify both benefits and limitations to wearing <b>loupes,</b> and therefore, ongoing support may be required for hygienists adopting their use in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} reasons for adopting magnifying <b>loupes</b> for operative dentistry: to enhance visualization of fine detail, {{to compensate for}} the loss of near vision (presbyopia) and to ensure maintenance of correct posture. The wearing of <b>loupes</b> is becoming an accepted norm amongst qualified practitioners and increasingly in the undergraduate population. However, further research is required before evidence-based recommendations can be made about their effectiveness in achieving the three principles. Compared to the medical literature, there is a paucity of studies on the use of <b>loupes</b> in dentistry. This article presents an overview of the well-documented (but under-researched) optical and ergonomic benefits of wearing <b>loupes</b> and highlights special circumstances where the use of <b>loupes</b> would be inadvisable. The article concludes with a review of the small number of studies on magnifying <b>loupes</b> specifically for restorative dentistry.

50|$|<b>Loupes</b> are an {{essential}} tool in both numismatics, {{the study of}} currency, and the related practice of coin collection. Coin collectors frequently employ <b>loupes</b> for better evaluation {{of the quality of}} their coins, since identifying surface wear is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a coin. Uncirculated coins (coins without wear) can command a substantial premium over coins with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Numismatists can also employ <b>loupes</b> to identify some counterfeit coins that would pass a naked-eye visual inspection.|$|R
25|$|If {{a stereo}} {{binocular}} microscope has been used, a final assessment using a 10x <b>loupe</b> is performed {{before the final}} judgment is made on {{the clarity of the}} stone.

The decision is then made on the grade of the diamond.|$|E
25|$|GIA clarity grading is {{performed}} under 10x magnification with darkfield illumination. The GIA Laboratory uses as standard equipment binocular stereo microscopes which {{are able to}} zoom to higher magnifications. These microscopes are equipped with darkfield illumination, {{as well as an}} ultraviolet filtered overhead light. When grading {{is performed}} using a 10x handheld <b>loupe,</b> darkfield illumination is more difficult to achieve. The grader must use a light source {{in such a way that}} the base of the stone is lit from the side, and the crown of the stone is shielded from the light.|$|E
25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond {{is at the}} top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond nanorods, are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the microscope or <b>loupe)</b> by its highly lustrous facets (described as adamantine) which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|E

500|$|Some early Scientology biographies {{present a}} fictitious family {{heritage}} for Hubbard. According to an account {{published in the}} Church of Scientology's Ability magazine in 1959, Hubbard was [...] "descended from Count de Loup who entered England with the Norman invasion and became {{the founder of the}} English de Wolfe family which emigrated to America in the 17th century. On his father's side, from the English Hubbards, who came to America in the 19th century." [...] The story went that Count de Loup (or de <b>Loupe)</b> was a French courtier who saved the King of France from an attack by a wolf; the grateful monarch bestowed the title of Count de <b>Loupe,</b> which was eventually anglicized to [...] "De Wolf", the name of Hubbard's maternal grandfather. No records exist to substantiate this story. Harry Ross Hubbard was an orphan, born Henry August Wilson in August 1886, who had been adopted by an Iowa farming couple by the name of Hubbard. The couple changed his given names to Harry Ross.|$|E
500|$|Diamonds can be {{identified}} by their high thermal conductivity. Their high refractive index is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds cut glass, {{but this does not}} positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the Mohs scale and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature. The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly, using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones; these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a <b>loupe</b> (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds [...] "by eye".|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{represent a}} significant occupational health issue in dental hygiene, with high prevalence rates documented. Despite this fact, {{there have been}} few advancements in the application of ergonomic principles in the dental hygiene profession. While the use of <b>loupes</b> is often promoted as an ergonomic solution, there is little published research to support this claim. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of the use of <b>loupes</b> on neck pain and disability in dental hygienists. METHODS: The study was conducted using an exploratory pre-test post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal measures in dental hygienists wearing <b>loupes</b> with final year dental hygiene students who do not wear <b>loupes.</b> Pre- and post-test measures included the Neck Pain and Disability Scale and a standardised physical assessment using previously validated measures. Statistical analysis was conducted as a series of mixed ANOVAs with time and treatment as the independent variables. RESULTS: While the analyses revealed no significant interactions between time and treatment (p< 0. 05), there were general trends of improvement or deterioration for outcome measures. Improvements over time were noted in the treatment group for cervical range of motion and deep neck muscle endurance; however deteriorations were noted for forward head posture and cervical kinaesthetic sense. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, despite no statistically significant differences being detected, this study suggests that wearing <b>loupes</b> appears to have both positive and negative outcomes with regards to physical well-being. As such, further studies are required to more precisely determine the effects of <b>loupes</b> on MSD among dental hygienists, particularly long-term. Dental hygienists with existing neck pain exploring ergonomic equipment may reflect on the findings and consider the potential benefits and risks of wearing <b>loupes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Sapphires can {{be treated}} by several methods to enhance and improve their clarity and color. It is common {{practice}} to heat natural sapphires to improve or enhance color.

Upon heating, the stone becomes more blue in color, but loses some of the rutile inclusions (silk). When high temperatures are used, the stone loses all silk (inclusions) and it becomes clear under magnification. The inclusions in natural stones are easily seen with a jeweler's <b>loupe.</b> Evidence of sapphire and other gemstones being subjected to heating goes {{back at least to}} Roman times.

40|$|Objectives: It is well {{established}} that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a significant occupational health issue for dentists and hygienists. Despite this, {{there has been little}} advancement in the application of ergonomic principles in the dental profession. While the use of <b>loupes</b> is often promoted as an ergonomic solution, there is little published research to robustly support this claim. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of the use of <b>loupes</b> on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists. Methods: The study was conducted using an exploratory pretest and post-test design, comparing musculoskeletal measures in practising dental hygienists wearing <b>loupes</b> with final-year dental hygiene students who did not wear <b>loupes.</b> Pre- and post-test measures included valid self-reported and objective outcome measures and were measured at baseline and 6 months following the intervention. Statistical analysis was conducted as a series of mixed anovas with time and treatment as the independent variables. Results: The analysis revealed a significant interaction between time and treatment for the Disabilities of the Shoulder, Arm and Hand (DASH) scores (P < 0. 04), indicating an improvement in symptoms for the treatment group but a reversed trend for the controls. There was also a significant mean increase in scapular position measures; however, this finding was evident in both groups, indicating that these were not a result of the intervention. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests that wearing <b>loupes</b> appears to have both positive and negative effects on upper extremity MSD among dental hygienists.

2500|$|The laser {{drilling}} process {{involves the use}} of an infrared laser (of surgical grade at a wavelength about 1064nm) to bore very fine holes (less than 0.2 millimeters or 0.005inches in diameter) into a diamond to create a route of access to a black carbon crystal inclusion. Because diamond is transparent to the wavelength of the laser beam, a coating of amorphous carbon or other energy-absorbent substance is applied {{to the surface of the}} diamond to initiate the drilling process. The laser then burns a narrow tube or channel to the inclusion. Once the location of included black carbon crystal has been reached by the drill channel, the diamond is soaked in sulfuric acid to dissolve the black carbon crystal. After soaking in sulfuric acid the black carbon crystal will dissolve and become transparent (colorless) and sometimes slightly whitish opaque. Under microscopic inspection the fine drill or bore holes can be seen, but are not distracting and do not affect sparkle or brilliance of the diamond. While the channels are usually straight in direction, from an entry point on the surface, some drilling techniques are drilled from within, using naturally occurring fractures inside the stone to reach the inclusion in a way that mimics organic [...] "feathers" [...] (This method is sometimes referred to as KM drilling which stands for special drilling in Hebrew). The channels are microscopic so that dirt or debris cannot travel down the channel. The surface-reaching holes can only be seen by reflecting light off of the surface of the diamond during microscopic viewing such as a jeweler's 10x magnifying lens or <b>loupe</b> and are invisible to the naked eye.|$|E
