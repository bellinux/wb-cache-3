500|$|Griesemer {{said that}} a {{recurring}} theme throughout Infamous games {{that they wanted to}} continue with Second Son was the idea of [...] "modern elemental powers", variations on commonplace powers drawn from the game world. Producer Brian Fleming found that the graphical effects helped to inform players of the amount of power Delsin possesses. [...] "This is a game about super powers, so for us, the way the effects look tells you a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> you're playing the game", he explained. Fox considered that the game world's resemblance to Seattle helped the superpower elements feel authentic. [...] "Because we have that sweet foundation of plausibility, you buy into the super-powered element", he explained.|$|E

[...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt.

[...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt.

And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a <b>lot</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come."

And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't just stand there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night.

This review will focus mainly on the fast ionotropic nicotinic receptors and less on the metabotropic muscarinic receptors. Finally, we will review limitations of the existing studies and address how innovative technologies might push the field forward in order to gain understanding into the relation between acetylcholine, neuronal activity and behavior...|$|R
