40|$|Abstract—Given {{a system}} which can fail in 1 of {{different}} ways, a fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm uses sensor data to determine which fault {{is the most likely}} to have occurred. The effectiveness of an FDI algorithm can be quantified by a confusion matrix, also called a diagnosis probability matrix, which indicates the probability that each fault is isolated given that each fault has occurred. Confusion matrices are often generated with simulation data, particularly for complex systems. In this paper, we perform FDI using sum-of-squared residuals (SSRs). We assume that the sensor residuals are-independent and Gaussian, which gives the SSRs chi-squared distributions. We then generate analytic lower, and upper bounds on the confusion matrix elements. This approach allows for the generation of optimal sensor sets without numerical simulations. The confusion matrix bounds are verified with simulated aircraft engine data. Index Terms—Aircraft turbofan engine, chi-squared distribution, confusion matrix, diagnosis probability matrix, fault detection and isolation.

40|$|Performance {{deterioration}} in the JT 9 D- 7 is a flight sensitive phenomenon caused by one short term and two long term wear modes. The short term deterioration occurs primarily during airplane acceptance testing and therefore does not affect airline operation. The long term wear takes place continuously over the engine life so that the performance loss can be minimized by a sound maintenance program. Short term deterioration is primarily due to flight load induced blade and gas path seal wear which result in increased gas path running clearances. The wear occurs in all engine modules but has the most deleterious effect on the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> and high <b>pressure</b> turbine performance. The wear occurs during conditions that combine minimum axisymmetric running clearances and maximum engine distortion or asymmetric closure...|$|R
40|$|A {{fuzzy system}} is {{developed}} using a linearized performance {{model of the}} gas turbine engine for performing gas turbine fault isolation from noisy measurements. By using a priori information about measurement uncertainties and through design variable linking, {{the design of the}} fuzzy system is posed as an optimization problem with low number of design variables which can be solved using the genetic algorithm in considerably low amount of computer time. The faults modeled are module faults in five modules: fan, <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor,</b> high <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor,</b> high <b>pressure</b> turbine and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine. The measurements used are deviations in exhaust gas temperature, low rotor speed, high rotor speed and fuel flow from a base line 'good engine'. The genetic fuzzy system (GFS) allows rapid development of the rule base if the fault signatures and measurement uncertainties change which happens for different engines and airlines. In addition, the genetic fuzzy system reduces the human effort needed in the trial and error process used to design the fuzzy system and makes the development of such a system easier and faster. A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is also used to preprocess the measurements before fault isolation. The RBFNN shows significant noise reduction and when combined with the GFS leads to a diagnostic system that is highly robust to the presence of noise in data. Showing the advantage of using a soft computing approach for gas turbine diagnostics...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on {{utilizing}} a mean line compressor flow analysis code coupled to an engine system thermodynamic code, to estimate the effects of ice accretion on the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor,</b> and quantifying its effects on the engine system throughout a notional flight trajectory. In this paper a temperature range in which engine icing would occur was assumed. This provided a mechanism to locate potential component icing sites and allow the computational tools to add blockages due to ice accretion in a parametric fashion. Ultimately the location and level of blockage due to icing would be provided by an ice accretion code. To proceed, an engine system modeling code and a mean line compressor flow analysis code were utilized to calculate the flow conditions in the fan-core and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> and to identify potential locations within the compressor where ice may accrete. In this study, an "additional blockage" due to the accretion of ice on the metal surfaces, has been added to the baseline aerodynamic blockage due to boundary layer, as well as the blade metal blockage. Once the potential locations of ice accretion are identified, the levels of additional blockage due to accretion were parametrically varied to estimate the effects on the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> blade row performance operating within the engine system environment. This study includes detailed analysis of compressor and engine performance during cruise and descent operating conditions at several altitudes within the notional flight trajectory.

40|$|The Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL), an {{altitude}} test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center, {{has been used}} to test a highly instrumented turbine engine at simulated altitude operating conditions. This is a continuation of the PSL testing that successfully duplicated the icing events that were experienced in a previous engine (serial LF 01) during flight through ice crystal clouds, which was the first turbofan engine tested in PSL. This second model of the ALF 502 R- 5 A serial number LF 11 is a highly instrumented version of the previous engine. The PSL facility provides a continuous cloud of ice crystals with controlled characteristics of size and concentration, which are ingested by the engine during operation at simulated altitudes. Several of the previous operating points tested in the LF 01 engine were duplicated to confirm repeatability in LF 11. The instrumentation included video cameras to visually illustrate the accretion of ice in the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> (LPC) exit guide vane region in order to confirm the ice accretion, which was suspected during the testing of the LF 01.

A data point was selected for analysis during which the engine experienced a full roll back event due to the ice accretion on the blades and flow path of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor.</b> The computational tool consists of the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) engine system thermodynamic cycle code, and an Euler-based compressor flow analysis code, that has an ice particle melt estimation code with the capability of determining the rate of sublimation, melting, and evaporation through the compressor blade rows. Decreasing the performance characteristics of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> (LPC) within the NPSS cycle analysis resulted in matching the overall engine performance parameters measured during testing at data points in short time intervals through the progression of the roll back event. Detailed analysis of the fan-core and LPC with the compressor flow analysis code simulated the effects of ice accretion by increasing the aerodynamic blockage and pressure losses through the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> until achieving a match with the NPSS cycle analysis results, at each scan. With the additional blockages and losses in the LPC, the compressor flow analysis code results were able to numerically reproduce the performance that was determined by the NPSS cycle analysis, which was in agreement with the PSL engine test data. The compressor flow analysis indicated that the blockage due to ice accretion in the LPC exit guide vane stators caused the exit guide vane (EGV) to be nearly choked, significantly reducing the air flow rate into the core. This caused the LPC to eventually be in stall due to increasing levels of diffusion in the rotors and high incidence angles in the inlet guide vane (IGV) and EGV stators. The flow analysis indicating compressor stall is substantiated by the video images of the IGV taken during the PSL test, which showed water on the surface of the IGV flowing upstream out of the engine, indicating flow reversal, which is characteristic of a stalled compressor...|$|R
