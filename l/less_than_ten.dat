By extending the range of accessible length scales to <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of microns we gain access to a regime where strong coupling's effects are predicted yet largely untested. To this effort, high resolution optical systems were designed, bench tested and implemented for sculpting and imaging ultracold neutral plasmas. Many complications and unexpected effects were documented to assist future experimental design considerations, including, those due to saturation and optical thickness, both of which limit the utility of 461 nm push beam modulations. It was concluded that sculpting should be performed on the 412 nm ionizing beam and real-time density space analysis is reliable for spatial frequencies up to 5 cyc/mm by using 4 X magnified imaging. Higher spatial frequencies benefit from velocity space analysis due to extremely fast dynamics and low intensity levels...|$|R

Assuming a rigidity of surrounding rocks of 1 – 10 GPa at a depth of 1 km, we estimate the changes of the circular conduit radius to be 0.025 – 0.25 %. Even when the conduit shape is elliptical, with an aspect ratio of 10, the radius change is 2.5 %. These values are negligibly small compared with changes in the magma flow within the conduit, so that we may reasonably assume a conduit with a constant radius.|$|R

40|$|Life history {{characteristics}} of snapper (Pagrus auratus) {{were found to}} vary at fine spatial scales (<b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of kilometres) in the sub-tropical waters of Shark Bay, Western Australia, from research undertaken between 1997 and 2004. Differences in the timing and duration of the spawning season, length and age at maturity, and maximum age and growth between snapper from the Eastern Gulf, Denham Sound and Freycinet Estuary were attributed to spatial differences in environmental conditions and density-dependent responses to fishing-induced changes in spawning biomass. Such fine-scale spatial variation in the biological {{characteristics of}} snapper is consistent with results of previous stock identification studies and further supports the geographic scale at which local snapper stocks are managed to protect both stock productivity and genetic diversity...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} we develop {{realistic}} global barotropic ocean modeling for the high-frequency (O(day- 1)) ocean variation induced by synoptic atmospheric disturbances. A number of numerical experiments {{reveal that the}} model results strongly depend on the horizontal resolution of the modeling. The model accuracy is validated by global in-situ 144 OBP (ocean bottom pressure) data, and is shown to be highest when the model resolution is 1 / 12 °. The model skill yields a correlation coefficient of 0. 55 to the observation on global average at the period longer than 2 days. However, finer resolution models show lower model skills with smaller OBP amplitude than the observation. This deficiency is probably caused by inadequacy of barotropic assumption in the modeling. The barotropic model would not represent energy distribution processes due to baroclinic instability that should be effective at spatial scales <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of kilometers...|$|R
40|$|Since their discovery, transposable {{elements}} (TEs) {{have been}} regarded either as useful {{building blocks of}} genomes, or as "selfish DNA": genetic parasites that exploit the sexual cycle to spread in copy number within populations {{to the detriment of}} their hosts. If the "selfish DNA" hypothesis is correct, TEs are expected to deteriorate and be lost from asexual populations. This thesis tests the predictions of the "selfish DNA" hypothesis in four asexual plant species, focusing on patterns of nucleotide diversity and nucleotide substitution. Sequences bearing strong resemblance to known TE families including Ty 1 /copia, Ty 3 /gypsy, and LINE-like elements were successfully isolated from all four plant species, and showed patterns of nucleotide substitution consistent with a long history of purifying selection. Stochastic simulations were also conducted, and suggested that this result is expected if the host species has been asexual for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>tens</b> of thousands of generations...|$|R

40|$|Controversy {{continues}} {{on whether or}} not ionizing radiation is harmful at low doses, with unresolved scientific uncertainty about effects below a few tens of millisieverts. To settle what regulatory controls should apply in this dose region, an assumption has to be made relating dose to the possibility of harm or benefit. The position of the Australasian Radiation Protection Society on this matter is set out in a statement adopted by the Society in 2005. Its salient features are: • There is insufficient evidence to establish a dose-effect relationship for doses that are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a few <b>tens</b> of millisieverts in a year. A linear extrapolation from higher dose levels should be assumed only for the purpose of applying regulatory controls. • Estimates of collective dose arising from individual doses that are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> some <b>tens</b> of millisieverts in a year should not be used to predict numbers of fatal cancers. • The risk to an individual of doses significantly <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 100 microsieverts in a year is so small, if it exists at all, that regulatory requirements to control exposure at this level are not warranted...|$|R
