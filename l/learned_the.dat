5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

In mobile <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> is not depended to any designated time and place. Learning through mobile device requires extensive design and pedagogical considerations. The traditional teaching pedagogy theories are {{not suitable for}} mobile <b>learning</b> since <b>the</b> main assumptions on teaching are in the classroom. There have already been some initiatives for defining distinct pedagogical theories for mobile <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> main focuses of <b>the</b> mobile <b>learning</b> pedagogical consideration must be directed to content of <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> materials and <b>the</b> context where <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> occurs...|$|R
