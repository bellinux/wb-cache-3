The old gallery and painting rooms were transformed into the GEO library catalogue room (decorated by Francisco Vilaça in the Renaissance style that included the painted ceiling of the allegories of painting and sculpture). The former Golden Hall/Salon is the most notable space in the house, and includes the grand tapestry by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, [...] "O Carnaval de Veneza", that is today used for the library reading rooms. The old music room (with decoration inspired by classical mythology) was also transformed into a reading room and decorated by Francisco Vilaça, who executed stuccos of musical instruments. A small vestibule that led to the old dining room is decorated by a grand ceramic panel created by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and executed by the Fábrica de Faianças in Caldas da Rainha, that includes a small fountain. The former dining room was decorated by the three Bordalo Pinheiro brothers: Columbano (who covered the walls with tiles which were later sold at auction), Rafael (a ceramic lamp and crown moulding, decorated with vegetal forms); and Maria Augusta (an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>panel</b> painted in floral patterns in the ceiling corners). The former dining room has been converted into a conference and exposition hall, along with the window-lined former games room.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The present work {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of three-dimensional (3 d) finite element analysis of thin-walled structures to computations based on reduced, two-dimensional (2 d) models which a priori satisfy the plane stress assumption. We apply a plasticity-based non-linear softening material model for concrete 1 to simple four-node 2 d plane stress elements and to a 7 -parameter 3 d shell formulation. Numerical results are compared to experimental data for an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>panel</b> 3. ...|$|E

The use of a concrete rheometer is promising for the purpose, but sometimes limited high associated cost and procedure complexity. This study proposes a simulation-based model that correlates the slump flow test results to a concrete's rheological properties, allowing quantitative evaluation through this simple method. The proposed model is based on single-fluid simulation using the volume-of-fluid method, with an extension to accommodate the partial segregation of coarse aggregates. Either the channel flow or the <b>L-shaped</b> <b>panel</b> filling of SCC is simulated using the rheological properties obtained by our model. Finally, the rheograph describing the self-compacting ability of SCC is updated...|$|E

Separating the immigration offices from the customs offices {{on each side of the}} space is a relatively narrow wood stairway to the basement and second floor. Interior finishes throughout the building are largely intact with plaster walls and ceilings, and architrave door surrounds. Flooring on the first level is original red tile set in a concrete border. Linoleum has been added in the offices. The basement is devoted to mechanical rooms with the unusual exception of two room size safes.|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this work, {{the effect}} of {{different}} parameters, including stacking sequence, part thickness, and tooling material, on distortion of flat panels was investigated. A Romer arm equipped with a laser scanner was used to obtain {{the maximum amount of}} distortion as well as the 3 D pattern of distortion for each panel. Among the different stacking sequences, the maximum distortion was observed in the asymmetric and balanced panel, while the least distortion belonged to the symmetric and unbalanced one. Furthermore, thinner panels were more distorted than thicker panels with the same planar size and stacking sequences. This study showed that distortion of the flat panels caused by asymmetry in the stacking sequence was an order of magnitude greater than distortion of the panels due to imbalance in the stacking sequence. L-shaped and U-shaped panels were also fabricated to investigate {{the effect of}} stacking sequence on spring-in angle and warpage of the panels. Among all the stacking sequences, the panel with an asymmetric and unbalanced stacking sequence showed the least spring-in angle, while the largest angle was observed in the symmetric and balanced panel. Although asymmetry in the stacking sequences reduced the spring-in angle, significantly more warpage was observed in the panels with asymmetric stacking sequences, as compared to the symmetric ones. MSC Marc was used to predict the distortion of the panels, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results for several stacking sequences of the flat and the L-shaped panels. An <b>L-shaped</b> <b>panel</b> with the stacking sequence of [0 / 45 / 90 /- 45] 4 was simulated to investigate the effect of curve radius and tool geometry on the spring-in angle. The FEA results showed that curing the <b>L-shaped</b> <b>panel</b> on a concave tool led to less spring-in angle, as compared to the panel confined to a convex tool...|$|E
