5|$|In about 1829, Samuel Miller and {{his brother}} John opened a store on the north {{bank of the river}} at the forks. In 1830, they {{enlarged}} their store and began to operate it as a tavern in competition with the Wolf Point Tavern. On June 2, 1829 Samuel Miller and Archibald Clybourn had been authorized to operate the first ferry across the Chicago River. Clybourn was the ferry man, crossing the North Branch of the river between Miller's tavern and the Wolf Point Tavern. In 1831 John Miller built a <b>log</b> <b>house</b> near his brother's tavern that he used as a tannery; Chicago's first recorded factory. Samuel Miller sold the tavern and moved away following the death of his wife in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Willie Alben Barkley, {{the eldest}} of John Wilson and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley's eight children, was born November 24, 1877. His grandmother, midwife Amanda Barkley, {{delivered}} him in the <b>log</b> <b>house</b> she lived in with her husband, Alben, in Wheel, Kentucky. Barkley's parents were tenant farmers who grew tobacco, and his father was an elder in the local Presbyterian church. Both parents were religious, opposed to playing cards and alcohol. Occasionally, Barkley's parents would leave him {{in the care of}} his grandparents for extended periods. During these times, his grandmother related stories of her relatives. Her childhood playmates included future U.S. Vice President Adlai Stevenson I and James A. McKenzie, a future U.S. Representative from Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down <b>log</b> <b>house.</b> Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E
25|$|The first {{building}} {{used for}} Morgan County courts was the <b>log</b> <b>house</b> of a pioneer. Work began in 1823 {{to build the}} first courthouse, a two story <b>log</b> <b>house.</b> A brick courthouse replaced it in 1833.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a <b>log</b> <b>house</b> and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the <b>log</b> <b>house</b> into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E
25|$|In 1730, Squire Boone, Daniel Boone's father, built a {{log cabin}} in the Oley Valley {{in what is now}} Berks County near present-day Reading.

A quarter-century later, Captain Moore's son, Reuben Moore, Jr., would build Court Manor on the very spot where his father's log cabin once stood.|$|E
50|$|Pre-fabricated <b>log</b> <b>houses</b> {{for export}} were {{manufactured}} in Norway from the 1880s until around 1920 by three large companies: Jacob Digre in Trondheim, M. Thams & Co. in Orkanger, and Strømmen Trævarefabrik at Strømmen. They were factory built from sawn or milled logs, numbered and dismantled for transportation, and reassembled on the buyer's site. Buyers could order standard models from catalogs, custom-made houses designed by architects {{employed by the}} companies, or houses of their own design. <b>Log</b> <b>houses</b> from Thams were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris.|$|R
50|$|Vlkolínec, {{situated}} in the centre of Slovakia, is a remarkably intact settlement with the traditional features of a central European village. It is the region’s most complete group {{of these kinds of}} traditional <b>log</b> <b>houses,</b> often found in mountainous areas. The village consists of more than 45 <b>log</b> <b>houses</b> each of them made up of two or three rooms. A wooden belfry from the 18th century as well as the baroque chapel has also been preserved. Houses No. 16 and 17 are turned into the folk museum with all the instruments of daily life and work.|$|R
50|$|Processing and {{products}} differs {{especially with regard}} to the distinction between softwood and hardwood. While softwood primarily goes into the production of wood fuel and pulp and paper, hardwood is used mainly for furniture, floors, etc.. Both types can be of use for building and (residential) construction purposes (e.g. <b>log</b> <b>houses,</b> <b>log</b> cabins, timber framing).|$|R
25|$|The {{land was}} {{originally}} surveyed on November 23, 1736. A subsequent survey done in 1753 by David Schultz for a road from Easton to Reading, of which present-day Union and Jackson streets were links, shows {{the location of}} a <b>log</b> <b>house</b> owned by Allen, situated near the western bank of Jordan Creek, which was believed to have been built around 1740. Used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, here Allen entertained prominent guests including his brother-in-law, James Hamilton, and colonial Pennsylvania governor John Penn.|$|E
25|$|The Lower Swedish Cabin on Creek Avenue {{alongside}} Darby Creek {{is possibly}} the oldest <b>log</b> <b>house</b> in North America. The cabin {{is believed to}} have been built by early Swedish settlers who were part of the New Sweden colony. The cabin was most likely built between 1638 and 1655, but the exact year is not known. Log cabin architecture was a major contribution of the colonial Swedes. European settlers from other countries copied this style of housing, and the log cabin became popular all across America.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Elyria was officially founded in 1817 by Heman Ely, who built a <b>log</b> <b>house,</b> dam, {{gristmill}} and sawmill on the village's site along the Black River. Ely {{began to build}} more houses to accommodate European-American settlers migrating to what was, at that time, within Huron County, Ohio. By the time Ely died in 1852, Elyria had five churches, three grocery stores, three flour mills, a newspaper, and a {{population of more than}} 1,500. Early postal service from Cleveland was provided by Artemis Beebe, a rider who held the first contract to deliver mail across this section of the Black River.|$|E

5000|$|The railway (Grand Trunk) reached Berlin in 1856 {{and that}} {{accelerated}} {{the growth of}} industry. In the next decade factories and the homes of labourers and wealthy owners replaced the early settlers <b>log</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{family home}} was a small <b>log</b> <b>house</b> on Sandusky Street in Zanesfield. Earl's father was a horse harness maker, {{who served as a}} pioneer {{veterinary}} surgeon for central Ohio, and he bought and sold horses for the army during the Civil War. He had a certain ability with horses and spent as much time caring for animals as he did in mending saddles. From a formula reportedly given to him by the Indians (though this is uncertain), Andrew made a strong-smelling brown concoction that was applied to horses' shoulders when they stiffened from the spring ploughing. The formula grew to be in great demand in the area.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlement}} {{in what is}} now Mount Holly began in 1677, when Walter Reeves acquired land from the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans living in the area. He constructed a dam on Rancocas Creek to channel water through a raceway to power a grist mill and saw mill. Edward Gaskill and his sons hand dug the mill race on their property between 1720 and 1723. After the mills were established, more settlers were attracted to the area and built houses and commercial buildings on High, Church, White, Mill, and Pine streets, including the Shinn Curtis <b>Log</b> <b>House</b> (1712). By 1800, over 250 dwellings had been built.|$|E
25|$|Hamar {{received}} the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station {{was designed by}} Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen. The line opened on 23 June 1862. The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse. In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a locomotive depot and a cargo building. Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two-story main building a <b>log</b> <b>house</b> with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing. About forty people worked at the station from the opening.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>logs</b> in <b>log</b> <b>houses</b> have a {{varying degree}} of {{moisture}} content; all logs have moisture when freshly cut. In the case of handcrafted logs moisture will naturally leave the timber, drying it out until it stabilizes with its climate. This drying-out causes movement and shrinking of the log's diameter. As logs and timbers dry, the differential shrinkage (radial versus tangential) causes small cracks (known as [...] "checks") to open slowly over time. Checking is a natural process in both air- and kiln-dried logs. This occurs in all <b>log</b> <b>houses</b> regardless of construction method or how the timber is allowed to dry, and is considered normal.|$|R
