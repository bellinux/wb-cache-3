He resold the land to another insurance company and leased it back for forty years, with options of thirty and twenty-nine additional years. Concurrently Sonnenblick-Goldman obtained a $3.3 million <b>leasehold</b> <b>mortgage</b> from Harte for twenty-five years with a thirty-year option. There was an additional option to add five stories when necessary. The expansion was ongoing in December 1964.|$|E

It finds that (i) mortgage markets have experienced rapid development, which has led to lower private per capita consumer spending volatility this decade; (ii) a downward price correction occurred in the housing market after 2007, which appears to have bottomed out; (iii) the rental market appears to be largely determined by region-specific economic fundamentals-a youthful working-age population and wealth variables; and (iv) a segregation between self-owned house and rental price dynamics exists in this region, rendering the former more sensitive to the business cycle.

[Footnote 28: In {{order that}} the reader who is not {{familiar}} with what is passing in New York may not suppose that exaggerated terms are here used, the writer will state a single expedient of the anti-renters in the Legislature to obtain their ends. It is generally known that the Constitution of the United States prevents the separate States from passing laws impairing the obligations of contracts. But for this provision of the Federal Constitution, it is probable, numbers would have succeeded, long ago, in obtaining {{the property of the}} few on their own terms, amid shouts in honor of liberty! This provision, however, has proved a stubborn obstacle, until the world, near {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, has been favored with the following notable scheme to effect the ends of those who [...] "want farms and must have them." [...] The State can regulate, by statute, the laws of descents. It has, accordingly, been solemnly proposed in the Legislature of New York, that the statute of descents should be so far altered, that when a landlord, holding lands subject to certain leasehold tenures, dies, or a descent is cast, that it shall be lawful for the tenants, on application to the chancellor, to convert these <b>leasehold</b> tenures into <b>mortgages,</b> and to obtain the fee-simple of the estates in payment of the debt! In other words, A leases a farm to B forever, reserving a ground-rent, with covenants of re-entry, etc., etc. B wishes a deed, but will not pay A's price. The United States says the contract shall not be impaired, and the Legislature of New York is illustrated by the expedient we have named, to get over the provision of the Constitution! ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, formerly known as ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus, is a regular, multi-purpose survey which {{was carried out in}} eight months of the year until April 2005. From this point it has run monthly. It started operating commercially in 1990 and was set up originally {{to meet the needs of}} government departments for a survey that used short and simple sets of questions, had greater statistical reliability than private sector omnibus surveys and a properly designed random sample. Now, however, an increasing number of academics are finding it a valuable research tool. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is used for a number of purposes, for example: to provide quick answers to questions of immediate interest to provide information on topics that do not require a full survey to develop and pilot questions for other surveys to sift for subgroups that can be followed up in another survey History From January 2008 the ONS Omnibus Survey changed its name to the ONS Opinions Survey (OPN) and became part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS). As a result, certain classificatory variables were altered to harmonise with the rest of the surveys that form the IHS. For further information, see detailed breakdown of the changes contained within the documentation for 2008 studies onwards. Subsequently, in January 2010, the OPN component was dropped from the IHS due to only one individual per household being interviewed, while the IHS requires questions to be asked of all household members. This process significantly increased the length of the OPN interview and, therefore, OPN reverted back to interviewing one household member, but still contains questions harmonised to the IHS. From April 2012 the ONS Opinions Survey changed its name to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey following the merger of the non-EU-SILC questions from the General Lifestyle Survey. Special Licence Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data With effect from 2008, the decision was made by ONS to make all new and existing Disability Monitoring data (Module 363) and Contraception data (Module 170) issuable only to Approved Researchers under Special Licence access conditions due to the disclosive nature of the modules. See the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Special Licence Access datasets page.
