40|$|The European Commission {{adopted the}} Euromarker (SY 124) in 2001 {{as a common}} pan-European fiscal marker to label gas oil and kerosene. In parallel, several other marking systems based on other dyes and markers were already in use in {{different}} member states. Generally {{the use of a}} marker makes it possible to sell fuel with a lower tax for use in dedicated sectors like agriculture, marine use and for domestic heating. In contrast, non-marked fuels are normally fully taxed and intended for road transport. Unfortunately SY 124 is easy to remove or destroy which has made wide-spread fraud possible. This has resulted in substantial losses of tax revenue and a number of member states have repeatedly notified the European Commission of this problem. Some member states currently invest considerable amounts of resources and effort in tracking illegal use of <b>laundered</b> <b>fuel</b> by performing > 10, 000 measurements per year of SY 124 in gasoil and diesel. Other member states have recently adopted a new national marker to prevent this kind of fraud. To improve the situation on a European level DG TAXUD published an open call in order to find a new marker that could potentially replace SY 124 as Euromarker. To support DG TAXUDs policies to find a better fiscal marker, JRC has performed different kinds of tests resulting in more than 1200 samples for checking resilience of four candidate markers alongside with SY 124. Generally the tests involved laundering over different adsorbents, chemical break-down and different physical treatments. All new candidate markers are colourless but road-side detection of the candidate markers is possible and based on dedicated instrumentation. Based on these experiments one candidate marker outperforms the others and is resilient to most treatments. This candidate marker could potentially be used to replace SY 124. JRC.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} NOx regularities combusting fuels having high concentration of nitrogen and to develop methods that will reduce the conversion of fuel nitrogen into NOx. There are three solutions to reducing NOx concentration: the combustion of fuel mixing it {{with other types of}} “clean” fuel containing small amounts of nitrogen, <b>laundering</b> <b>fuel</b> and the combustion of fuel using carbon additives. These solutions can help with reducing the amount of nitrogen in the wood waste of furniture by about 30 % by washing fuel with water. Therefore, NOx value may decrease by about 35 %.

25|$|To fund its campaign, the IRA was {{allegedly}} involved in criminal {{activities such as}} robberies, counterfeiting, protection rackets, kidnapping for ransom, <b>fuel</b> <b>laundering</b> and cigarette smuggling. The IRA also raised funds through donations and by running legitimate businesses such as taxi firms, social clubs, pubs and restaurants.

5000|$|The CIRA {{continued}} to be active in both planning and undertaking attacks on the PSNI. The IMC said they tried to create troubles to lure police forth, while they have also taken to stoning and using petrol bombs. In addition, other assaults, robbery, tiger kidnapping, extortion, <b>fuel</b> <b>laundering</b> and smuggling were undertaken by the group. The CIRA also actively took part in recruiting and training members, including disgruntled former Provisional IRA members. As {{a result of this}} continued activity the IMC said the group remained [...] "a very serious threat".|$|R

After examining the major deficiencies of the attempts to restrict illegal pornographic representations, the authors aim to highlight that the debate regarding their availability in the Internet era neglects the lucrative nature of the circulation of such material, which can be also targeted through anti-money <b>laundering.</b> Rising profits <b>fuel</b> the need to recycle the money back into the legal financial system, {{with a view to}} concealing their illegal origin. Anti-money laundering laws require disclosure of any 'suspicion' related to money laundering, thus opening another door for law enforcement to reach the criminal...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Money <b>laundering</b> provides the <b>fuel</b> for terrorists, drug dealers, arms traffickers, and other criminals to operate and expand their activities. GAO focused on two issues. The first is whether the nation's annual National Money Laundering Strategy {{has served as a}} useful mechanism for guiding federal law enforcement efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Unless reauthorized by the Congress, the annual requirement ended with the 2003 strategy. The second issue is the implementation status of a May 2003 Memorandum of Agreement, signed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, that was designed to enhance the coordination of terrorist financing investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Seventeenth and Eighteenth IMC {{reports the}} INLA {{was said to}} remain a threat, {{with a desire to}} mount attacks that could well be more {{dangerous}} in the future, but was characterized as being largely a criminal enterprise at that time. The INLA killed Brian McGlynn on 3 June 2007 during the span of the first of these reports. This killing was said to have occurred because the victim used the INLA name in the drug trade. [...] On 24 June 2008, the INLA was said to have committed the murder of Emmett Shiels, although the IMC report did indicate the investigation was continuing.It was also said to be partaking in [...] "serious crimes" [...] such as drug dealing, extortion, robbery, <b>fuel</b> <b>laundering</b> and smuggling. Furthermore, the INLA and Continuity IRA were stated to have co-operated.|$|R
40|$|Ireland's {{black market}} in {{counterfeit}} goods endangers jobs and supports violent crime, writes Jerome Reilly Up in smoke: A revenue officer from the Customs Service {{with some of}} the 7. 6 m contraband cigarettes seized last month. Startling research has lifted the lid on Ireland's black market, which has mushroomed since the downturn [...] and is now costing the economy € 860 m a year and killing thousands of jobs. From illicit cigarettes to dangerous counterfeit medicines, more and more ordinary people are actively seeking out black market goods to buy on the cheap because their finances have been squeezed. And Retail Ireland says this is playing into the hands of paramilitaries and criminal gangs who make millions {{from a wide range of}} black market enterprises including digital piracy, fake clothing, watches and perfume as well as <b>fuel</b> <b>laundering.</b> Counterfeit booze is another major problem for the retail sector which has already suffered 30 per cent job losses since the downturn began. Retail Ireland and a group of retailers last week briefed members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party on the crisis. At the end of July, the European Commission published a report on customs seizures in the EU which showed that the number of counterfeit items intercepted in Ireland more than doubled in 2011 [...] increasing 119 per cent from 2010, while the number of cases taken by customs in Ireland increased 226 per cent. The Government has been warned that the current level of convictions is not deterring even casual criminals from street-dealing in counterfeit cigarettes, clothing or jewellery, while for the criminal godfathers there's the potential of millions in illegal profits without the risks associated with the drug trade [...] . ...|$|R
