50|$|If a crash should occur, <b>lashing</b> <b>eyes</b> {{can reduce}} the {{severity}} of outcome of the accident by keeping the luggage in the loadspace compartment and thereby preventing projectiles from harming correctly restrained passengers in the passenger compartment.These lashing features {{may be in the}} form of fixed or foldable loops, {{or in the case of}} certain European vehicles combine sliding loops in a rail system to allow optimal positioning of the <b>lashing</b> <b>eyes.</b> At the same time this eases the integration of accessories for loadspace management; dividers, bike carriers, etc. into the interior of the vehicle, a principle that has been applied in cargo vans and air transport for many years.|$|R
25|$|To improve {{practicality}} further, self-levelling {{rear suspension}} and an integral load restraint system {{were added to}} the options list for the Tourer. Up to 100kg can be loaded onto the roof, which is more than rival executive cars of the time, and putting loads into the boot is made easier by the 544mm sill height. Four hinged chrome <b>lashing</b> <b>eyes</b> are fitted to the floor, and oddment stowage compartments and two recessed hooks are located in the side walls.|$|R
50|$|The trunk space can {{contribute}} to the active and passive safety of the vehicle. Active safety may be promoted in vehicles that are partially loaded. Here the use of <b>lashing</b> <b>eyes</b> to restrain luggage can prevent or reduce damage to the vehicle and its occupants in severe manoeuvres. In driving while cornering 'in-extremis', the prevention of sudden weight transfer due to poorly loaded luggage can be enough to prevent the vehicle losing grip, and potentially avoiding thereby an accident; active safety.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIris {{features}} {{provides a}} unique biometric identification in the eye. The uniqueness is maintained for {{left and right}} eye, twins. Even during the eye transportation, the natures of iris parameters are varied by nature. The <b>eye</b> lids, <b>lashes</b> and flash light impressions are the crucial hazards, during the localization of iris region. The proposed method is used to detect the iris boundary, by eliminating the hazards. The eye image is pre-processed by using the filter with suitable coefficients. The flash image is eliminated in the pre-processing stage. The morphological operation is imposed on the pre-processed image, which results the exact pupil area. The edge detection technique is applied to find the visible iris region, either on {{the left or right}} side. The radius is calculated from the pupil centre to the iris visible boundary. The circle is formed on the iris region, which exactly fits on iris boundary. The iris region curve formed over the <b>eye</b> <b>lashes</b> and <b>eye</b> lids. The proposed method is tested with CASIA Ver 3. 0 image, which eliminates the iris hazards to identify the unique radius as a feature in the eye image...|$|R

40|$|Trachomatous trichiasis {{can cause}} corneal damage and visual impairment. WHO {{recommends}} surgery for all cases. However, {{in many regions}} surgical provision is inadequate and patients frequently decline. Self-epilation is common and was associated with comparable outcomes to surgery in nonrandomised studies for minor trichiasis (<six <b>lashes</b> touching <b>eye).</b> This trial investigated whether epilation is noninferior to surgery for managing minor trichiasis. 1, 300 individuals with minor trichiasis from Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia were recruited and randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive trichiasis surgery or epilation. The epilation group were given new forceps and epilation training. The surgical group received trichiasis surgery. Participants were examined every 6 months for 2 years by clinicians masked to allocation, with 93. 5 % follow-up at 24 months. The primary outcome measure ("failure") was â‰¥five <b>lashes</b> touching the <b>eye</b> or receiving trichiasis surgery during 24 months of follow-up, and was assessed for noninferiority with a 10 % prespecified noninferiority margin. Secondary outcomes included number of lashes touching, time to failure, and changes in visual acuity and corneal opacity. Cumulative risk of failure over 24 months was 13. 2 % in the epilation group and 2. 2 % in the surgical group (risk differenceâ€Š=â€Š 11 %). The 95 % confidence interval (8. 1 %- 13. 9 %) includes the 10 % noninferiority margin. Mean number of <b>lashes</b> touching the <b>eye</b> was greater in the epilation group than the surgery group (at 24 months 0. 95 versus 0. 09, respectively; p< 0. 001); {{there was no difference}} in change in visual acuity or corneal opacity between the two groups. This trial was inconclusive regarding inferiority of epilation to surgery for the treatment of minor trichiasis, relative to the prespecified margin. Epilation had a comparable effect to surgery on visual acuity and corneal outcomes. We suggest that surgery be performed whenever possible but epilation be used for treatment of minor trichiasis patients without access to or declining surgery. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00522912...|$|R
40|$|Background Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) {{needs to}} be managed {{to reduce the risk}} of vision loss. The {{long-term}} impact of epilation (a common traditional practice of repeated plucking of <b>lashes</b> touching the <b>eye)</b> in preventing visual impairment and corneal opacity from TT is unknown. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of epilation versus surgery for the management of minor TT (fewer than six <b>lashes</b> touching the <b>eye)</b> in Ethiopia. Here we report the four-year outcome and the effect on vision and corneal opacity. Methodology / Principal Findings 1300 individuals with minor TT were recruited and randomly assigned to quality trichiasis surgery or repeated epilation using high quality epilation forceps by a trained person with good near vision. Participants were examined six-monthly for two-years, and then at four-years after randomisation. At two-years all epilation arm participants were offered free sur-gery. At four-years 1151 (88. 5 %) were re-examined: 572 (88 %) and 579 (89 %) from epila-tion and surgery arms, respectively. At that time, 21. 1 % of the surgery arm participants ha...|$|R

Long <b>lashes.</b> <b>Eyes</b> grey--yes, grey decidedly, though at times they look almost sapphire blue; but the pupils are so large--that is perhaps the secret of their pathetic expression.

You think it strange, do you not, Fan? that I should take you into my house and clothe you--a poor homeless girl; for I don't suppose that you can do anything for me, and you will therefore only be an extra expense. A great piece of folly, my friends would probably say. But don't be afraid, I care nothing for what others say. What I do, I do only to please myself, and not others. If I am disappointed in you, and find you different from what I imagine, I shall not keep you, and there will be an end of it all.
