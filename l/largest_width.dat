25|$|Paeonia daurica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous photosynthesising plant, emerging {{in spring and}} retreating underground in the autumn. It has slender carrot-shaped roots which are directed downwards. The leaves are alternately set along the stems and have an outline of 5–11½×8–17cm. The lower leaves are usually composed of three sets of three entire or sometimes bifid leaflets, and occasionally there is third order division, resulting in a maximum of nineteen leaflets. The shape of the leaflets is wide to narrowly oval, with the <b>largest</b> <b>width</b> at midlength or towards the tip. The base of the leaflets {{is more or less}} wedge-shaped or sometimes rounded, the margin is entire and sometimes wavy, and the tip is rounded or has a smaller or larger sharp tip. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless, while the undersides are hairless or sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs. The hermaphrodite flowers are set individually {{at the end of the}} stems and are subtended by none to two leafy bracts. The flower itself consists of two or three green sepals, five to eight petals, that may be white, pale yellow, yellow, yellow with a red blotch at the base or with a reddish margin, pink, red, or purple-red, and many stamens consisting of pale, yellow, pink or purple filaments topped by anthers that contain yellow pollen. At the very centre of each flower are one to five carpels that are glabrous, sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs and almost directly tipped by the stigmas which are mostly curved or S-shaped from above.|$|E

40|$|Hercules X- 1 was {{observed}} with Suzaku in the main-on state from 2005 to 2010. The 0. 4 - 100 keV wide-band spectra obtained in four observations showed a broad hump around 4 - 9 keV {{in addition to}} narrow Fe lines at 6. 4 and 6. 7 keV. The hump was seen in all the four observations regardless of {{the selection of the}} continuum models. Thus it is considered a stable and intrinsic spectral feature in Her X- 1. The broad hump lacked a sharp structure like an absorption edge. Thus it was represented by two different spectral models: an ionized partial covering or an additional broad line at 6. 5 keV. The former required a persistently existing ionized absorber, whose origin was unclear. In the latter case, the Gaussian fitting of the 6. 5 -keV line needs a <b>large</b> <b>width</b> of sigma = 1. 0 - 1. 5 keV and a <b>large</b> equivalent <b>width</b> of 400 - 900 eV.

5000|$|It is a Ramform type ship-design with {{an unusual}} hull shape. The shape of the hull is {{characteristic}} with a sharp bow, sinusoidal waterline, a descending rear body that ends in a straight cut-off stern where the ship has the <b>largest</b> <b>width.</b> Because of the very large width of the ship it will have an operational metacentric height of about 16 meters. The ship can continue to operate even with {{large parts of the}} interior under the waterline, when the ship's exact trimming is uncritical. The same goes for cargo shift, if the ship is exposed to icing or large amounts of water on deck. This makes Marjata a very stable sensor platform, she is also built with a very low noise signature, so that the ship itself does not interfere with the onboard sensors. Marjata also has large internal bay for computing and analyzing of reconnaissance data. The ramform type ships are often used for seismological surveys of the seabed. Marjata is well suited for operation in arctic conditions for prolonged periods of time.|$|E

Branches develop from reddish brown, with ridges lengthways and very fine grains when young, to yellowish gray, circular in cross-section with persistent half circle-shaped leaf scars, and often with corky outgrowths. The spines are mostly split at base into three arms of 4-12 mm long, often somewhat curved outward, and almost at a straight angle to each other. Bracts are narrowly triangular and about 1 cm long. The leaf blades are approximately elliptic, 20-50 × 12-22 mm, with the <b>largest</b> <b>width</b> before, at or beyond midlength, stiff and leathery, shiny danker green on top, but sometimes prone to patchy reddish brown or golden discoloration, and whitish green underneath. The margin mostly has few teeth (zero to six, mostly one to four) at each side that end in spines of 1-4 mm long, {{and with a}} truncated, or pointed and spined tip. The base can be rounded or pointed more or less blending with the leafstem of up to 4 mm long. The midvein is slightly sunken above but sticks out underneath, the three to five pairs of secondary veins that partially reach the leaf margin, partially curve back on their neighbours. The inflorescens is a raceme of tree to seven flowers on a common inflorescens stem ⅔-2 or exceptionally 3½ cm long, and stems of the individual flower mostly a bit shorter. The flowers are orange in color and ½-1 cm long, with about 14 tepals, that change in shape form almost circular to ovate going out. The filaments are 3 mm long {{and do not have}} a tooth on each side, unlike in many other Berberis species, and the anther is about 1½ mm long. The pistils are 3-7 mm long and almost cylindrical and are topped with a stigma of about 1½ mm across.

40|$|Chocolate bar {{games are}} {{variants}} of the CHOMP {{game in which}} {{the goal is to}} leave your opponent with the single bitter part of the chocolate. In this paper, we investigate step chocolate bars whose widths are determined by a fixed function of the horizontal distance from the bitter square. When the width of chocolate bar is proportional to the distance from the bitter square and the constant of proportionality is even, the authors have already proved that the Grundy number of this chocolate bar is (m- 1) ⊕ (n- 1), where m is is the <b>largest</b> <b>width</b> of the chocolate and n is the longest horizontal distance from the bitter part. This result was published in a mathematics journal(Integers, 15, 2015). On the other hand, if the constant of proportionality is odd, the Grundy number of this chocolate bar is not (m- 1) ⊕ (n- 1). Therefore, it is natural to look for a necessary and sufficient condition for chocolate bars to have the Grundy number that is equal to (m- 1) ⊕ (n- 1), where m is the <b>largest</b> <b>width</b> of the chocolate and n is the longest horizontal distance from the bitter part.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} PFZ and grain {{boundary}} precipitates formed in aging processes on the macroscopic mechanical properties in Al-Zn-Mg(-Ag) alloys were evaluated using TEM, SEM, tensile test and nanoindentation. Decreases in width of PFZ and smaller size of grain boundary precipitates aging at lower temperatures and/or {{the addition of}} Ag processes improved the tensile properties, {{and the presence of}} PFZ was found to be harmful to the fracture. Nanoindentation hardness results clarified that the hardness within PFZ is smaller than that in grain interiors, indicating that, in the alloy with <b>large</b> <b>width</b> of PFZ, preferential deformation occurs within PFZ in the initial stage of deformation, and this causes lower elongation regardless of the same level of proof stress and the same sizes of grain boundary precipitates. From the quantitative correlation between precipitate microstructures in the vicinity of grain boundaries, mechanical properties and fracture morphologies, the deformation process of the alloys is considered to divided by three types; i. e. in case of the alloys with the small width of PFZ and the small size of grain boundary precipitates, in case of the alloys with the <b>large</b> <b>width</b> of PFZ and the small size of grain boundary precipitates and in case of the alloys with the <b>large</b> <b>width</b> of PFZ and the large size of grain boundary precipitates...|$|R
