For the multidisciplinary design problem of LED <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> we establish the information model of LED <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> based on the object tree, that is, a process and two trees. First we build a multidisciplinary design process of LED <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> clearing tasks and indicators of product design. Then we discuss the LED product modeling which is based on the design object tree and construct two trees of LED products, providing a necessary theoretical support for the design of LED <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> Finally, through the example of application, verify the feasibility of multidisciplinary design modeling...|$|R

40|$|<b>Lighting</b> <b>products</b> are {{essential}} in people's daily life. The global lighting market {{is expected to}} have over 100 billion euros’ revenue by 2020 (McKinsey & Company 2012), and the introduction of Light Emitting Diode (LED) technology in the lighting sector is leading to a rapid growth of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> By 2020, it is predicted that the LED-based lighting market share will be almost 70 % of the total lighting market (McKinsey & Company 2012). However, <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> also cause a negative impact on the environment during all the product life cycle stages, especially during the use stage. To date, there are no in-depth studies that have researched how to reduce the environmental impact caused by LED-based lighting products; therefore, research in this area is needed. This research aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in this area by studying the following issues: 1) What the key product-related features are that influence the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> at each product life cycle stage, 2) What design recommendations can contribute to extend the lifespan of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> 3) What the most effective and efficient method is to assess and compare the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> and 4) What the most effective and efficient eco-design tools, techniques and methods are to reduce the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> during the design process, and how these can be integrated into an eco-design approach to reduce the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> The methodological approach followed to gather and analyse the data necessary to understand and answer the issues above mentioned has been based on the utilisation of two research methodologies: 1) Case study research, and 2) Survey. The case study research consisted of the study and critical examination of a real-world eco-design process of an awarded and patented LED-based product designed by the author in collaboration with several manufacturers. The data was collected using direct participatory observation. In addition to this, a survey was also conducted to understand the lifespan and causes of end of life of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> The data was collected using on-line self-completion close-ended questionnaires. This research contributes to body of knowledge of how to eco-design LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> In particular, it has made the following contributions to knowledge: 1) Identification of key product-related features that influence the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> at each product life cycle stage, 2) Definition of design recommendations to extend the lifespan of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> 3) Development of a method to assess and compare the environmental impact of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> and 4) Development of approach to eco-design of LED-based <b>lighting</b> <b>products.</b> These contributions can be utilised to inform product developers' decision-making processes to reduce the environmental impact of this category of products...|$|R

In the French version the yolks are beaten with the sugar first while the whites are beaten separately to a meringue-like foam, to be gently folded in later. The mixture is then poured into a cake tin and baked. Both methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages.

Daily scanner data from a hypermarket supports the effects of price promotions on sales within and between product categories, as expected.

The numerical framework combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with a Discrete Element Method (DEM), implemented in an opensource computation package (OpenFOAM). This framework is validated first by comparing the simulations with experiments for a standardized test case and further with our experimental study of a pilot-scale destoner. We evaluate the combined effects of process conditions, such as separator deck inclination, vibration speed and fluidization velocities on destoner performance. Our simulations showhowthe heavy product fraction in the discards streamincreases over timewith a corresponding accumulation of the ‘valuable’ <b>light</b> <b>product</b> {{at the base of the}} deck, indicating segregation between the stones (heavy product) and the grains (<b>light</b> <b>product).</b> We also find that these separation profiles are highly sensitive to changes in deck surface air velocities, with the gradual development of segregation zones at velocities close to the minimum fluidization velocity of the heavier component. Optimal separation is seen at a deck inclination of 4 ° and a fluidization velocity of between 1. 75 and 2 m/s. Our simulation results also agree well with the experimental findings indicating the usability of the proposed framework for the design and optimization of gravity separators...|$|E

40|$|Co/Al(2) O(3) Fischer-Tropsch {{synthesis}} catalysts promoted {{with different}} quantities of Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, Au) were characterized and tested. The presence of relatively small quantities of such metals enhanced Co reducibility and, {{in the cases}} of Ag and Au, improved the surface Co metal active site densities. EXAFS experiments with the most loaded catalyst samples show that only Co-Co and Me-Me (Me = Cu, Ag and Au) coordination could be observed. This suggests that the greater fraction of the metals form different phases. However, the reduction promoting effect of the Group 11 metal is severely hampered once the catalyst receives a mild passivation treatment following primary reduction. An explanation in terms of promoter segregation during primary reduction is proposed. At lower promoter levels (0. 83 %Ag and 1. 51 %Au) and higher Ag levels (2. 76 %), significant gains in Co active site densities were achieved resulting in improved CO conversion levels relative to the unpromoted catalyst. Moreover, slight decreases in <b>light</b> <b>product</b> (e. g., CH(4)) selectivity and slight increases in C(5) + selectivity were achieved. At high Au loading (5. 05 %), however, too much Au was loaded which, although significantly increasing the fraction of Co reduced, blocked Co surface sites and resulted in decreased Co conversion rates. While Cu facilitated Co reduction, the increased fraction of reduced Co did not translate to improved active site densities. It appears that a fraction of Cu tended to cover the rim of Co clusters, resulting in decreases in CO conversion rates and detrimental increases in <b>light</b> <b>product</b> selectivity.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{environmental}} effects of low power PV <b>lighting</b> <b>products,</b> which are increasingly used in rural areas in South East Asia, {{by means of a}} life cycle analysis (LCA). The main goals of the project are to determine (1) the environmental impacts, (2) which parts are contributing to environmental impacts that occur, and (3) the accuracy of an LCA of these PV products. The study is based on an entrepreneurial case in Cambodia. Three PV <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> with a nominal power of 0. 7 Wp, 4. 5 Wp and 40 Wp respectively, have been compared with three alternatives for lighting services. The LCA was executed with Simapro software using the Ecoinvent 2. 1 database and applying the ReCiPe 2008 method for the impact assessment. An important conclusion of the study is that solar PV <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> have less environmental impact than conventional lighting solutions, such as lighting services from kerosene lamps and compact fluorescent lamps powered by car batteries. The environmental profile of small size PV <b>lighting</b> <b>products</b> can be improved by approximately 50 % by recycling of the batteries.
