40|$|The Vacuum Lug Closure system, or VLC, {{is found}} on many widely {{available}} {{products such as}} jam, sauces and pickles. The closure has many useful advantages over other closure systems, and it is popular with both manufacturers and consumers. However, there are large groups ofpeople that have great difficulty opening products packaged in jars with vacuum <b>lug</b> <b>caps.</b> The goal of this project is to understand both {{the way in which}} consumers interact with the closure, and also how the closure system works. The torque that users can apply to ajar lid was measured using a torque sensor embedded in a modified jar. This was then compared to a calcula ed torque derived from grip measurements. This second type oftest can be used to predict openability for any kind of closure by utilising simple and quick tests and mathematically adapting strength test data. By eliminating the need to perform more extensive tests, costs are kept to a minimum whilst ensuring that the results are still relevant to the problem. The results from both tests were compared with the measured forces required to open examples ofconsumer packaging found on sale. The results from both tests agree reasonably well, but more data is required regarding the interaction between human skin and packaging materials. However the current required opening torques were found to be far too high for many users. It is suggested that a limit of 1 Nm torque should be used for future packaging designs to allow over 97...|$|R

It is a {{practice}} in African-American culture involving a verbal strategy of indirection that exploits the gap between the denotative and figurative meanings of words. A simple example would be insulting someone to show affection.

50|$|For 1986, {{few changes}} marked the new DeVille's {{second year in}} production. An {{anti-lock}} braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard space-saver spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new flush-fitting center caps (last year's design featured exposed <b>capped</b> <b>lugs),</b> and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look {{was applied to the}} seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.|$|R
