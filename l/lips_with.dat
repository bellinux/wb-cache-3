The flowers are two-lipped, the upper <b>lip</b> <b>with</b> four lobes and the lower <b>lip</b> <b>with</b> two lobes. In cultivation the two lips are often different colours.|$|R
25|$|Aaron, {{the brother}} of Moses, is on the first icon {{on the right side}} of the tier. He {{represented}} the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first High Priest of the Israelites. In his right hand he holds a crosier decorated with flowers, and a thurible in his left. The next image depicts Gideon, one of the judges of Israel, with a fleece. In the Old Testament, an angel appeared to Gideon, telling him that he would save his tribe from the invading Midianites. Gideon asked for proof of God's message; he laid a fleece of wool on the ground and asked the Lord to make the fleece wet and keep the ground dry by next morning, if the victory were to be his. Next morning the fleece was wet and the ground was dry; Gideon demanded a second test in which the fleece should remain dry while dew covered the rest of the ground and this also happened. Later this narrative was understood as a reference to Jesus' birth. In these explanations the fleece stood for Mary, and the dew signified Christ. King Solomon is portrayed on the next icon. He was the son of King David, and he holds an image signifying the First Temple of Jerusalem. The Old Testament credits Solomon with its completion. Another unidentified icon stands close to Solomon's painting. The aged man reaching for the sky is probably Jeremiah, son of a landowner. In the Bible Jeremiah was chosen to prophesy God's anger at the Israelites who worshiped idols. He had to prepare his people for the fall of Jerusalem and for being enslaved. Knowing the fate of his tribe he is usually depicted as an old, worn man looking up to the skies, praying for God's forgiveness. The next icon shows a traditional depiction of Isaiah, in which an angel touches his lips. According to the iconographical traditions the angel fills Isaiah's <b>lips</b> <b>with</b> fire to preach his prophecies without fear. In another interpretation the fire refers to the Book of Isaiah, in which he mentions the burning anger of God. The last icon on the Prophets tier depicts a young man wearing a turban. It is the last uncertain icon in the row, probably portraying Habakkuk. He holds a package containing the stew he took for Daniel when he was in the lion's den with the help of an angel.|$|E

500|$|Following this, Low's fleet {{captured}} a Portuguese ship called the Nostra Signiora de Victoria on 25 January 1723. The Victoria's captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11,000 gold moidores (worth {{at the time}} around Â£15,000) {{to fall into the}} sea rather than see it captured. One of Low's most noted episodes of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's <b>lips</b> <b>with</b> a cutlass, broiled them, and forced the victim to eat them while still hot. He then murdered the remaining crew. Low's own men described him as [...] "a maniac and a brute".|$|E

She also uses pheromones which make men {{fall in love with}} her. Julia Roberts, who worked with director Joel Schumacher in Flatliners, was heavily rumored to be in contention for the role, but the rumours were dismissed by Schumacher, saying that if she would have wanted to get the role, she would have called him.|$|E
500|$|Sticky Fingers was {{the first}} to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which {{effectively}} became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of <b>lips</b> <b>with</b> a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the outstuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo, [...] "Without using the Stones' name, it instantly conjures them, or at least Jagger, as well as a certain lasciviousness that is the Stones' own ... It quickly and deservedly became the most famous logo in the history of popular music." [...] The tongue and lips design was part of a package that, in 2003, VH1 named the [...] "No. 1 Greatest Album Cover" [...] of all time.|$|E

500|$|Lip {{piercing}} and lip stretching were historically {{found in}} certain tribal cultures in Africa and the Americas. Pierced adornments of the lip, or labrets, were sported by the Tlingit {{as well as}} peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Amazon basin. Aztecs and Mayans also wore labrets, while the Dogon people of Mali and the Nuba of the Nile Valley wore rings. The practice of stretching the lips by piercing them and inserting plates or plugs was found throughout Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and South America as well as {{among some of the}} tribes of the Pacific Northwest and Africa. In some parts of Malawi, it was quite common for women to adorn their <b>lips</b> <b>with</b> a lip disc called a [...] "pelele" [...] that by means of gradual enlargement from childhood could reach several inches of diameter and would eventually alter the occlusion of the jaw. Such lip stretching is still practiced in some places. Women of the Nilotic Mursi tribe in the Nile Valley wear lip rings on occasion that may reach [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Big Boy coerces club owner Lips Manlis into signing {{over the}} deed to Club Ritz. He then kills <b>Lips</b> <b>with</b> a cement {{overcoat}} (referred to onscreen as [...] "The Bath") and steals his girlfriend, the seductive and sultry singer, Breathless Mahoney. After Lips is reported missing, Tracy interrogates his three hired guns Flattop, Itchy, and Mumbles, then {{goes to the}} club to arrest Big Boy for Lips' murder. Breathless is the only witness. Instead of providing testimony, she unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Tracy. Big Boy cannot be indicted and he is released from jail. Big Boy's next move {{is to try to}} bring other criminals, including Spud Spaldoni, Pruneface, Influence, Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, and Numbers, together under his leadership. Spaldoni refuses and is intentionally killed, leaving Dick Tracy, who discovered the meeting and was attempting to spy on it, wondering what is going on. The next day, Big Boy and his henchmen kidnap Tracy and attempt to bribe him; Tracy refuses, prompting the criminals to attempt to kill him. However, Tracy is saved by Kid, who gets prized by the police with a Honorary Detective Certificate, which will remain temporary until he decides a name for himself.|$|E

[...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease â winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards.
