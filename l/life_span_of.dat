40|$|Determining <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> planktonic foraminifera {{is vital}} {{in view of}} their {{increasing}} use for paleoclimatic studies. Till date all the estimates about <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> planktonic foraminifers {{are based on the}} extrapolations of growth rates obtained in culture experiments and range from a few days to a few weeks, varying widely. Here we propose the use of sediment trap technique to get much better estimates <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> planktonic foraminifers. On the basis of sediment trap results, we hypothesize that in general the <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> planktonic foraminiferal species are of the order of few months instead of few days to few weeks, as reported earlier.

50|$|While some Asian {{cultures}} practise {{the custom}} of eating dogs, this is strictly forbidden to the Mosuo. In Mosuo culture, a myth describes that long ago, dogs had <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> 60 years while humans had <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> thirteen years. Humans felt their <b>life</b> <b>span</b> was too short, so they traded it with the dogs in exchange for paying homage to them. Therefore, dogs are valued members of the family. They are never killed, and they most certainly are never eaten. During the initiation rites into adulthood, Mosuo adolescents pray before the family dogs.|$|R
5|$|Female California spiny {{lobsters}} reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> mature {{spiny lobsters}} is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|Most main-sequence {{stars with}} a {{spectral}} class between O5 and F5 {{have been found}} to rotate rapidly. For stars in this range, the measured rotation velocity increases with mass. This increase in rotation peaks among young, massive B-class stars. As the expected <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> a star decreases with increasing mass, this can be explained as a decline in rotational velocity with age.|$|E

5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. Moulting {{does not occur}} in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August. Females carry the eggs on their pleopods (appendages on the abdomen) until they hatch directly into juvenile crabs, having passed through the larval stages inside the egg.|$|E
5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The {{age of a}} few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails.|$|E
5|$|The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> {{peregrine}} falcons in {{the wild}} is up to 15.5years. Mortality {{in the first year}} is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults.

5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 1013 years.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a new mother who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E
5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} methods {{may be used to}} treat the most common being the total hip {{replacement}} (THR).

50|$|Phase 1 {{reactors}} {{were designed}} to work for 30 years and were originally slated {{to be shut down}} in 2003 and 2004. However the shutdown did not happen.

5|$|Great auks {{walked slowly}} and {{sometimes}} used their wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear of human beings, and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened {{by the sight of}} something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a <b>life</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E

40|$|The <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> {{individual}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{cells were}} determined microscopically by counting {{the number of}} buds produced by each cell to provide a measure of the number of cell generations (age) before death. As the cells aged, their generation times increased five- to sixfold. The generation times of daughter cells were virtually identical to those of their mothers throughout the <b>life</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> the mothers. However, within two to three cell divisions after the daughters were detached from their mothers by micromanipulation, their generation times reverted to that characteristic of their own age. Recovery from the mother cell effect was also observed when the daughters were left attached to their mothers. The results suggest that senescence, as manifested by the increase in generation time, is a phenotypically dominant feature in yeast cells and that it is determined by a diffusible cytoplasmic factor(s) that undergoes turnover. This factor(s) appeared to be transmitted by a cell not only to its daughter, but also indirectly to its granddaughter. In separate studies, it was determined that the induced deposition of chitin, the major component of the bud scar, in the yeast cell wall had no appreciable effect on <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> We raise the possibility that the cytoplasmic factor(s) that appears to mediate the "senescent phenotype" is a major determinant <b>of</b> yeast <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> This factor(s) may be the product of age-specific gene expression...|$|R
