40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} unemployment {{persistence in}} Spain by the so–called “ladder” effect. This arises when high-skilled workers {{who do not}} find a job corresponding to their skill accept jobs which previously were occupied by less qualified staff. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model, in which two types of workers — characterized by their level of formal education — coexist on the labor market. Highly educated workers are then assumed to compete with low–skilled workers, generating a <b>ladder</b> <b>effect.</b> The model is then calibrated on the Spanish economy. Our results replicate the observed decline in the ratio of high to low–skilled vacancies, and explains how firms substitute high for low–skilled employment. The results also suggest that the Spanish <b>ladder</b> <b>effect</b> may essentially reflect increases in the training costs {{as a result of}} a biasedshock against low-skilled workers...|$|E

To identify policies alleviating this problem, we study the impact of reductions in employer social security contributions.

40|$|Victorin is a host-selective toxin {{produced}} by Cochliobolus victoriae, the causal agent of victoria blight of oats. Previously, victorin {{was shown to}} be bound specifically by two proteins of the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex, {{at least one of}} which binds victorin only in toxin-sensitive genotypes in vivo. This enzyme complex is involved in the photorespiratory cycle and is inhibited by victorin, with an effective concentration for 50 % inhibition of 81 pM. The photorespiratory cycle begins with ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and victorin was found to induce a specific proteolytic cleavage of the Rubisco large subunit (LSU). Leaf slices incubated with victorin for 4 hr in the dark accumulated a form of the LSU that is cleaved after the 14 th amino acid. This proteolytic cleavage was prevented by the protease inhibitors E- 64 and calpeptin. Another primary symptom of victorin treatment is chlorophyll loss, which along with the specific LSU cleavage is suggestive of a victorin-induced, senescence-like response. DNA from victorin-treated leaf slices showed a pronounced <b>laddering</b> <b>effect,</b> which is typical of apoptosis. Calcium appeared {{to play a role in}} mediating the plant response to victorin because LaCl 3 gave near-complete protection against victorin, preventing both leaf symptoms and LSU cleavage.

We allow for job competition between high- and low skilled workers on the low-skilled segment {{of the labor market}} and for on-the-job search for high skilled workers. Matching processes are represented by matching functions à la Pissarides. Workers search intensities are endogenous. We distinguish between embodied and disembodied technological progress and endogenize them through a learning by doing process based on capital accumulation. Social returns to capital are imposed to be constant. Biased technological change is introduced via embodied technical progress and new technologies-skill complementarity relationship. The model reproduces quite well the producivity slowdown puzzle, the unemployment rate evolutions and the relative wage stability observed over the last decades.

40|$|Ultrafast spectroscopy, in {{particular}} time-resolved photoluminescence, {{can help in}} the development of InGaN/GaN heterostructures for long wavelength visible emitters. In this paper, we present recent results that underscore the current understanding of two approches to achieve desired emission characteristics and recombination mechanisms in InGaN/GaN MQWs for green LEDs. Specifically, the photoluminescence decay of samples grown using two different design approaches is discussed. In one approach, samples, with high indium incorporation, were grown on a high quality AlN substrate to achieve green emission. The resulting photoluminescence decay of the green luminescence is long-lived and non-exponential. Quantitative analysis showed that the decay is non-exponential and consists of a stretched-exponential decay component, at short times, followed by a power law decay component at longer times. This non-exponential decay, resulting in significant elongation of the radiative lifetime, is indicative of inhomogeneity in the quantum wells. Thus carrier localization, in a structure with low defect density, proves to be an effective means to achieve green emission. In another approach, a piezoelectric Stark-like <b>ladder</b> <b>effect</b> is used. In this case, a methodical layer-by-layer growth homogeneity optimizatio...|$|E

In the field of combustion analysis, a characterisation of a CH 4 /N 2 - O 2 /N 2 counter-flow diffusion flame has been performed using Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF). An absolute density profile of NO in the flame has been obtained, with concentrations up to a few tens of ppm. Temperature measurements by LIF on NO have also been performed. OH profiles were measured by both fluorescence and emission. In the trace-element analysis part of this thesis, the Tl content in rivers and lakes in the Göteborg area have been assessed to the range of a few tens of ppt by LIF in a Graphite Furnace. The Pb and Al contents of aerosols from the Norwegian Arctic have been analysed by the same technique. By the use of the LEI technique in conjunction of a rod-flame atomiser, the content of Co, Cr, Mn and Ni in NH 4 F and NaF, used in the production of optical fibres, have been determined.

Fifty-two proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, with 39 in common between the three groups, two in common between RT 8 and CON, one in common between RT 8 and RT 4, four exclusive in the CON, one in the RT 8, and four in the RT 4. The RT 8 group had a reduced abundance of 12 proteins, mostly involved in muscle protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, anti-oxidant defense, and oxygen transport. Otherwise one protein involved with energy transduction as compared with CON group showed high abundance. There was no qualitative protein abundance difference between RT 4 and CON groups. These results revealed that high volume RT induced undesirable disturbances on skeletal muscle proteins, while lower volume RT resulted in similar gains in skeletal muscle hypertrophy without impairment of proteome.

This study aimed to examine the expression profile and role of this enzyme in NSCLC, and determine if it is a potential target for intervention. Methods: A panel of retrospective resected lung tumours was stained for 12 -LOX expression by IHC. Levels of the 12 -LOX metabolite, 12 (S) -HETE, were examined in 50 NSCLC serum samples, and correlated with serum VEGF. A panel of NSCLC cell lines were treated with baicalein (10 uM), a selective inhibitor of 12 -LOX, or 12 (S) -HETE (100 ng/ml) and cell survival/proliferation examined by BrdU. Apoptosis following 12 -LOX inhibition was examined by HCS and validated by FACS and DNA <b>laddering.</b> The <b>effect</b> of 12 -LOX inhibition on NSCLC tumour growth and survival was examined in-vivo using an athymic nude mouse model. Gene alterations following 12 -LOX inhibition in NSCLC cell lines were assessed by qPCR arrays and validated by RT-PCR. Transient transfection methods were used {{to examine the effects of}} 12 -LOX overexpression in NSCLC cells. Results: 12 -LOX expression was observed to a varying degree in human lung cancers of varying histological subtypes. 12 (S) -HETE levels were correlated (p< 0. 05) with those of VEGF. Baicalein inhibited proliferation/survival in all cell lines, while 12 (S) -HETE increased proliferation. 12 -LOX inhibition increased apoptosis, indicated by a reduction in f-actin content and mitochondrial mass potential. Treatment with baicalein significantly reduced the growth of NSCLC tumours and increased overall survival in athymic nude mice. qPCR array data implicated a number of apoptosis/angiogenesis genes regulating these effects, including bcl- 2, VEGF, integrin A 2 and A 4. 12 -LOX overexpression resulted in an increase in VEGF secretion, confirming qPCR observations.

Since Σ_R is the mass function of an "unstable" quasi-particle in thermal field theories, it necessarily has non-trivial imaginary parts together with non-trivial wave function renormalization constants. In the present analysis we correctly respect this fact, and study, in the <b>ladder</b> approximation, the <b>effect</b> of HTL resummed gauge boson propagator. Our results with the use of numerical analysis, show the two facts; i) The chiral phase transition is of second order, since the fermion mass is dynamically generated at a critical value of the temperature T_c, or at the critical coupling constant α_c, without any discontinuity, and ii) the critical temperature T_c at fixed value of α is significantly lower than the previous results, namely the restoration of chiral symmetry occurs at lower temperature than previously expected. The second fact shows the importance of correctly taking the essential thermal effect into the analysis of chiral phase transition, which are, in the previous analyses, neglected due to the inappropriate approximations. The procedure how to maximally respect the gauge invariance in the present approximation, is also discussed. Comment: Revtex 4 with 6 figures, 11 page...|$|R
40|$|Although {{dozens of}} fish ladders have been {{constructed}} at dams of Brazilian reservoirs, there are few studies evaluating their efficiency {{as a tool for}} the conservation of Neotropical ichthyofauna, especially for migratory species. Therefore, the present study evaluated the selectivity of the species that entered and ascended the fish ladder located next to Lajeado Dam (Luis Eduardo Magalhães Hydroelectric Power Plant) on the Tocantins River. Samples were taken monthly from November, 2002 through October, 2003, in the resting pools of the ladder, using cast nets, and in the downstream stretch, using gillnets. The selectivity of the ladder in attracting fish was evaluated by comparing the occurrence, relative abundance, dominance and the congruence of abundance ranks of migratory and non-migratory species in the ladder and in the stretch of river immediately downstream. Species richness and fish abundance in the resting pools were used to evaluate selectivity along the <b>ladder.</b> The <b>effects</b> on selectivity by temporal variations in water level downriver and maximum flow velocity in the fish ladder were also analyzed. Out of the 130 species recorded downriver, 62. 3 % were caught in the ladder, and migratory species were clearly favored. However, more than 2 / 3 of the catch belonged to only three species (Rhaphiodon vulpinus, Psectrogaster amazonica and Oxydoras niger). Although the majority of the species that entered the ladder were able to reach its top, there was a sharp reduction in abundance of individuals towards the top. Temporal variations in the water level below the dam influenced richness and abundance of fish concentrated downstream and in the ladder, with lower values during periods of low water. In the ladder, a maximum flow velocity of 2. 3 m/s, although also selective, proved to be more appropriate for fish ascension than a velocity of 2. 8 m/s. It was concluded that the entry and ascension of the fish in the ladder were not congruent with their proportions in the downriver stretch: fish samples in the ladder were clearly dominated by a few species, including some that {{do not need to be}} translocated. Thus, selectivity constitutes an important bottleneck to initiatives for translocating fish aimed at conserving their stocks or biodiversity.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether a functional AR is present in human sperm. METHODS: The expression of AR and its effects on sperm were evaluated by RT-PCR, Western Blot, Immunocytochemistry, PI 3 Kinase and DNA laddering assays. RESULTS: We showed in human sperm that AR is located at the head region. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in a dose-dependent manner, leads to the rapid phos-phorylation of the AR on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues and this effect was reduced by the AR antagonist hydroxyflutamide (OH-Flut). The effects of AR were evaluated on the phosphoinositide- 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI 3 K/AKT) pathway. Specifically, 0. 1 and 1 nM DHT stimulated PI 3 K activity, whereas 10 nM DHT decreased PI 3 K activity and levels of p-AKT S 473 and p-AKT T 308, p-BCL 2, and enhanced phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphorylation. In addition, 10 nM DHT was able to induce the cleavage of caspases 8, 9 and 3 and cause DNA <b>laddering,</b> and these <b>effects</b> were reversed either by casodex or OHFlut. By using wortmannin, a specific PI 3 K inhibitor, the cleavage of caspase 3 was reproduced, confirming that in sperm the PI 3 K/AKT pathway is involved in caspase activation.

Preparations of human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed to HD (1 × 10 − 8 M– 1 × 10 − 3 M), and incubated at 37 °C for 0 – 24 h. Total genomic DNA was extracted from these cells and compared with DNA from control cells of the same donor using agarose gel electrophoresis. The effects of HD on genomic DNA depended on the HD concentration and the length of the post-exposure time interval. DNA fragmentation was detected as early as 2 h after exposure to 3 × 10 − 4 M HD, or at 24 h after exposure to 6 × 10 − 6 M HD. The qualitative DNA pattern, as well as the extent of DNA fragmentation, changed with post-exposure time. Exposure to HD caused a time-dependent shift in the DNA cleavage pattern from an oligonucleosome-sized ‘DNA ladder’ characteristic of apoptotic cell death, to a ‘broad band’ pattern characteristic of necrotic cell death. DNA fragmentation was not observed if cells were killed with heat or with Lewisite. Treatment of cells with selective PARP inhibitors consistently altered the DNA fragmentation caused by HD exposure. The inhibitors arrested DNA fragmentation at the DNA <b>ladder</b> stage. This <b>effect</b> only was observed if the PARP inhibitors were applied within 8 h of HD exposure. We conclude that early inhibition of PARP activity can induce a switch in the mechanism of cell death caused by HD. Such a switch may be useful therapeutically to convert a lytic, pro-inflammatory cell death that includes the disintegration of dying cells (necrosis), into a slower, programmed cell death that includes absorption of dying cells (apoptosis) ...|$|R

It is thus important to find therapeutic agents that can inhibit colon cancer cells with altered p 53 status. beta-Lapachone, a novel topoisomerase inhibitor, {{has been shown to}} induce cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia and prostate cancer cells through a p 53 -independent pathway. Here we examined the effects of beta-lapachone on human colon cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several human colon cancer cell lines, SW 480, SW 620, and DLD 1, with mutant or defective p 53, were used. The antiproliferative effects of beta-lapachone were assessed by colony formation assays, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis analysis, including annexin V staining and DNA <b>laddering</b> analysis. The <b>effects</b> on cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins were examined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: All three cell lines, SW 480, SW 620, and DLD 1, were sensitive to beta-lapachone, with an IC(50) of 2 to 3 microM in colony formation assays, a finding similar to that previously reported for prostate cancer cells. However, these cells were arrested in different stages of S phase. At 24 hr post-treatment, beta-lapachone induced S-, late S/G 2 -, and early S-phase arrest in SW 480, SW 620, and DLD 1 cells, respectively. The cell cycle alterations induced by beta-lapachone were congruous with changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin A, cyclin B 1, cdc 2, and cyclin D 1. Moreover, beta-lapachone induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin V staining, flow cytometric analysis of DNA content, and DNA laddering analysis. Furthermore, down-regulation of mutant p 53 and induction of p 27 in SW 480 cells, and induction of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in DLD 1 cells may be pertinent to the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of beta-lapachone on these cells. CONCLUSIONS: beta-Lapachone induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells through a p 53 -independent pathway. For human colon cancers, which often contain p 53 mutations, beta-lapachone may prove to be a promising anticancer agent that can target cancer cells, especially those with mutant p 53...|$|R
40|$|Falls {{represent}} a serious hazard to workers in many industries. Workers who perform tasks at elevation - {{workers in the}} construction, structural metal working, and tree trimming industries, for example - {{are at risk of}} falls from heights, with frequently grave or even fatal consequences. Many more workers, in nearly every industry, are subject to falls to floors, walkways or ground surfaces. These falls, characterized as fall on the same level, are responsible for well over half of nonfatal injuries that result in days away from work. The etiology of falls as injury-producing events is multi-factorial, and encompasses multiple mechanisms of exposure. Working at heights involves completely different fall risks than those found on workplace surfaces and floors. The different exposures represent serious safety risks in both cases, resulting in fatal and serious nonfatal injury. To address the various causes of multi-factorial events such as these, there needs to be wide-ranging and multidisciplinary injury-mitigation approaches provided to practitioners based {{on a wide variety of}} research methods. To advance our knowledge of occupational fall injuries, the International Conference on Fall Prevention and Protection (ICFPP), held in May of 2010, was convened to provide a forum for researchers from NIOSH, its stakeholders, and the community of fall-prevention specialists and experts to present research findings, recommendations and expert advice on the latest tools and methods to reduce the incidence of injury from falls. At the conference, a wide variety of research approaches and methods were presented, and these approaches reflected the multidisciplinary orientation of the different stakeholders in attendance, as well as the individual interests and expertise of participating researchers.
