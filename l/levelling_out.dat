5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E

25|$|According to {{many analysts}} the {{currency}} war had largely fizzled out by mid-2011, though others including Mantega disagreed. As of March 2012, outbreaks of rhetoric were still occurring, with additional measures being adopted by countries like Brazil {{to control the}} appreciation of their currency. Yet by June, there were signs that currency misalignment had been <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> in China and across the world, with even Mantega relaxing some of Brazils anti-appreciation controls.

25|$|Since the race's {{restyling}} in 2012, the climbs of Oude Kwaremont, Paterberg and Koppenberg, {{just south}} of Oudenaarde, are {{the heart of the}} action. The Kwaremont is a long section of cobbles that starts sharply before gradually <b>levelling</b> <b>out.</b> It is the site where powerful riders often make the race-winning move, as Fabian Cancellara demonstrated in 2013, when he attacked with Peter Sagan on the lower slopes of Kwaremont before distancing the Slovak on the Paterberg. The Paterberg is the final climb of the day where fans create a carnival-like atmosphere. It is a short but cobbled climb and viciously steep. After 245km of racing, it is generally an ultimate test of endurance and strength.|$|E
25|$|Running south {{east from}} the summit is Littledale Edge an airy narrow ridge which connects to the {{neighbouring}} fell of Hindscarth. To {{the north of the}} Edge is a sharp descent into the head of Little Dale, part of the Newlands catchment. This valley runs north east, flanked by parallel ridges descending from Robinson and Hindscarth, its stream being named Scope Beck. Robinson’s north east ridge is rough and craggy towards the top before <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> onto the grassy spur of High Snab Bank. This finally runs down to Newlands Church and the hamlet of Little Town. Beneath the nose of the ridge is the confluence of Scope Beck and Keskadale Beck.|$|E

25|$|Early on 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a British Overseas Airways Corporation Boeing 377 Stratocruiser {{crashed on}} landing at Prestwick, killing 28 of the 36 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. The crash {{has been attributed to}} a number of factors, including: pilot fatigue (the Captain was well over his duty limit due to the aircraft being delayed); the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair; and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which might have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.|$|E

2500|$|The Mount Pleasant Management Trail is a trail {{used for}} walking and {{mountain}} bike riding, bicycles being permitted only on management trails {{and not on}} walking tracks in the Illawarra Escarpment State Conservation Area.

From Mount Pleasant the trail ascends steadily to its junction with the Ken Ausburn Track, which {{is located on the}} walker's left (east side of the trail). From here ascends a steep hill before <b>levelling</b> <b>out</b> to Mount Keira Road. Near the entrance to the Ken Ausburn track, views of Wollongong can be had.

5000|$|Next, {{the train}} turns {{left in a}} slight decline before {{leveling}} out. Once leveled, it enters the diving circular helix into the ravine.

The train begins to climb and <b>level</b> <b>out</b> after reaching {{the bottom of the}} ravine, producing significant positive G-forces.
