500|$|Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury responded {{negatively}} to Jacqui's Promiscuity in 2010 by stating: [...] "I DON'T like to bandy names about but...that Jacqui McQueen {{is a right}} trollop." [...] Rhiannon Vivian of the Sunday Mirror describe Jacqui as a [...] "hard-bitten" [...] character. Men's lifestyle magazine FHM brand Jacqui a [...] "notoriously sexy bad-girl". On a separate occasion Olly Richards of the magazine stated: [...] "In the soap she always looks a bit hard and <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> definitely beat us up." [...] Josie Ensor of WalesOnline spoke about Cooper stating: [...] "feisty jailbird character Jacqui has made her infamous on and off screen." [...] Colin Robertson of newspaper The Sun also agreed with the [...] "feisty brunette" [...] tag. Kris Green of Digital Spy branded Cooper {{as one of his}} favourite Hollyoaks actresses due to her portrayal of Jacqui. Dawn Collinson of the Liverpool Echo refers to Jacqui as a [...] "brassy character".|$|E
500|$|Chyler Leigh {{joined the}} {{cast as a}} main {{character}} in the fourth season as Dr. Lexie Grey, Lexie had appeared as a guest star {{in the final two}} episodes of the third season. On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: [...] "Chyler stood out...It felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." [...] Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who first appeared on Grey's Anatomy in the second season, became a series regular in the fourth season. Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast, Entertainment Weekly Michael Ausiello, reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from Grey's Anatomy on November 6, 2008. E! Online Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to [...] "de-gay" [...] Grey's Anatomy, but Rhimes countered these claims, saying that [...] "we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run".|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} was now fairly under way. They were walking {{side by side}} beneath the swaying boughs. Mr. Lewisham's sensations were ecstatic, marred only by a dread of some casual boy coming upon them. She had not read much Carlyle. She had always wanted to, even from quite a little girl--she had {{heard so much about}} him. She knew he was a Really Great Writer, a very Great Writer indeed. All she had read of him <b>she</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> say that. As much as <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> anything. And <b>she</b> had seen his house in Chelsea.|$|R

500|$|Björk premiered Biophilias songs {{during the}} Manchester International Festival with a {{residency}} {{commissioned by the}} Festival itself. The singer played in a circular stage which included custom-made instruments like computer-controlled Pendulum Harps and a Tesla Coil, an instrument called Gameleste, an hybrid between a gamelan and a celesta, and a pin Barrel organ called Sharpsichord. The stage also included a circle of projection screens. During the [...] "Mutual Core" [...] performance, the screen projected images of moving tectonic plates, which Alan Pedder of the website Wearsthetrousers likened to [...] "Jóga"'s music video, while the choir performed a sort of choreography, which included huddling at center stage during the verses and dancing during the chorus. The song was performed on every date of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance was well received by critics, which praised the whole show and project, which was called [...] "ambitious". While reviewing Björk's show at the New York Hall of Science, Will Hermes of the website PembrokeMayball stated that [...] "during 'Mutual Core', she sang of tectonic plates under a circle of projection screens illustrating the phenomena, and licked her lips after a line about how 'the Atlantic ridge drifts' <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel that motion tingle beneath her skin".|$|E

[...] Leigh offered her insight on her first days working with the main cast of the series, [...] "It was like coming into somebody else's group or circle. It was a little daunting in the beginning. But I have had such a great time." [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] was the first episode in two years not to feature the character of Montgomery, due to her portrayer, Walsh, leaving the series in order to launch the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, medical drama Private Practice. However, the character continued to be prominent throughout the run of the series, appearing sporadically as a guest star in the following seasons. Also introduced in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come" [...] is the new generation of interns, all of whom were portrayed in co-star capacity, with the exception of Lexie.|$|E
2500|$|Jennifer Morrison has {{received}} praise for her portrayal of Emma. In a review from the [...] St. Louis Post-Dispatch, TV critic Gail Pennington had {{high marks for}} Morrison. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times gave excellent reviews for Morrison's character: [...] "Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly– fairy-tale princess, my Aunt Fanny– but she's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for 'just a few more pages' before they go to bed." [...] For TVLive, [...] "Morrison does a nice job of mirroring the viewer's disbelief of this fantastical dilemma– and Emma looks <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become a worthy adversary for Regina." [...] For Daniel Fienberg, [...] "Jennifer Morrison is very good in the lead". On less favorable reviews, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was not enthusiastic of Morrison's portrayal and called her a [...] "wooden lead".|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Hurtle got up {{to receive}} him with her sweetest smile,--and her smile could be very sweet. She was a witch of a woman, and, as <b>like</b> most witches <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be terrible, so <b>like</b> most witches <b>she</b> <b>could</b> charm. 'Only fancy,' she said, 'that you should have come the only day I have been two {{hundred yards from the}} house, except that evening when you took me to the play. I was so sorry.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{some days}} the queen {{was so much}} shaken by all she had gone through that she lay with her eyes closed, unable either to move or speak. When she got better, the Lion Fairy told her that if <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> build herself a cabin, as {{she would have to}} spend her life in that place. At these words the queen burst into tears, and implored her gaoler to put her to death rather than condemn her to such a life; but the Lion Fairy only laughed, and counselled her to try to make herself pleasant, as many worse things might befall her.|$|R
6000|$|He seemed nervous lest, in thus {{announcing his}} intentions, {{he should be}} setting his granddaughter a bad example; {{and now that he}} came to the point, his way of putting the {{suggestion}} that, if <b>she</b> didn't <b>like</b> it, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> live by herself and lump it, was delicate in the extreme.' ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} he emptied his mind of care {{concerning}} the matter; but husband and wife are never both quite free of care on the same point of common interest, and Mrs. Claxon assumed {{more and more of}} the anxieties which he had abandoned. She fretted under the load, and expressed an exasperated tenderness for Clementina when the girl seemed forgetful of any of the little steps to be taken before the great one in getting her clothes ready for leaving home. She said finally that she presumed they were doing a wild thing, and that it looked crazier and crazier the more she thought of it; but all was, if Clem didn't <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come home. By this time her husband was in something of that insensate eagerness to have the affair over that people feel in a house where there is a funeral.|$|E
6000|$|Her aunt did {{not object}} to capital {{punishment}} or war, or the industrial system or casual wards, or flogging of criminals or the Congo Free State, because {{none of these things}} really got hold of her imagination; but she did object, she did not <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear to think of people not having and enjoying their meals. It was her distinctive test of an emotional state, its interference with a kindly normal digestion. Any one very badly moved choked down a few mouthfuls; the symptom of supreme distress was {{not to be able to}} touch a bit. So that the thought of Ann Veronica up-stairs had been extremely painful for her through all the silent dinner-time that night. As soon as dinner was over she went into the kitchen and devoted herself to compiling a tray--not a tray merely of half-cooled dinner things, but a specially prepared [...] "nice" [...] tray, suitable for tempting any one. With this she now entered.|$|E
6000|$|The bells were rung lustily all the morning, and all {{the parish}} was there, round about the church, to see. There was no record of a lord ever having been married in Clavering church before; and now this lord {{was going to marry}} my lady's sister. It was all one as though she were a Clavering herself. But there was no ecstatic joy in the parish. There were to be no bonfires, and no eating and {{drinking}} at Sir Hugh's expense--no comforts provided for any of the poor by Lady Clavering on that special occasion. Indeed, there was never much of such kindnesses between the lord of the soil and his dependants. A certain stipulated dole was given at Christmas for coals and blankets; but even for that there was generally some wrangle between the rector and the steward. [...] "If there's to be all this row about it," [...] the rector had said to the steward, [...] "I'll never ask for it again." [...] "I wish my uncle would only be as good as his word," [...] Sir Hugh had said, when the rector's speech was repeated to him. Therefore, there was not much of real rejoicing in the parish on this occasion, though the bells were rung loudly, and though the people, young and old, did cluster round the churchyard to see the lord lead his bride out of the church. [...] "A puir feckless thing, tottering along like-not half the makings of a man. A stout lass <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> a'most blow him away wi' a puff of her mouth." [...] That was the verdict which an old farmer's wife passed upon him, and that verdict was made good by the general opinion of the parish.|$|E

6000|$|Yet he came not, and {{the stillness}} [...] Dampened round her <b>like</b> a tomb; <b>She</b> <b>could</b> feel cold eyes of spirits [...] Looking on {{her through the}} gloom, <b>She</b> <b>could</b> hear the groping {{footsteps}} [...] Of some blind, gigantic doom.|$|R
6000|$|... “She can get {{anything}} <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> in Paris. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{get a whole}} army over the frontier if <b>she</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> get herself admitted into the Foreign Office at one o’clock in the morning if it so pleased her. Doors fly open before the heiress of Mr. Allègre. She has inherited the old friends, the old connections [...] . Of course, {{if she were a}} toothless old woman [...] . But, you see, she isn’t. The ushers in all the ministries bow down to the ground therefore, and voices from the innermost sanctums take on an eager tone when they say, ‘Faites entrer.’ My mother knows something about it. She has followed her career with the greatest attention. And Rita herself is not even surprised. She accomplishes most extraordinary things, as naturally as buying a pair of gloves. People in the shops are very polite and people in the world are like people in the shops. What did she know of the world? She had seen it only from the saddle. Oh, she will get your cargo released for you all right. How will she do it? [...] . Well, when it’s done—you follow me, Mills?—when it’s done she will hardly know herself.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Former {{porn star}} Traci Lords {{appeared}} in a five episodes arc. Darren Star remembers: [...] "Mostly, she looked like someone who actually lived in L.A. at that age... She had that quality. <b>Like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> recruit you into a cult." ...|$|E
50|$|However, after {{a strong}} start to her career, her {{results in the}} medley events started to fade, and Muffat felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not sustain her pace well enough to achieve her goals by {{swimming}} the medley. As a result, she changed her swimming profile, switching to the freestyle events, {{at the suggestion of}} her coach Fabrice Pellerin.|$|E
5000|$|Rebekah wanted CA to be {{the data}} engine, which would {{essentially}} give her control of the group. And if the venture were successful, she would have an influence over the GOPthat no donor had ever pulled off. Theoretically, if the president did something she didn’t <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marshal his own supporters against him, since it would be her database and her money. Vicky Ward ...|$|E

5000|$|She was {{mentioned}} in the Pyramid Texts. In Ancient Egyptian creation myths, she gives birth to the sun {{at the beginning of}} time, and in art she is portrayed as a cow with a sun disk between her horns. She is associated with the goddesses Neith, Hathor, and Isis, all of whom have similar characteristics, and <b>like</b> them <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be called the [...] "Eye of Ra".|$|R
50|$|After {{moving to}} Summer Bay, Denny found {{employment}} {{at the local}} bait shop run by town stalwart Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), and developed a close working relationship with him. Smith explained that Denny saw Alf as a father figure, making {{it the first time}} she had had that type of relationship in her life. Denny <b>liked</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> talk to Alf about life's issues and get a straight answer.|$|R

Julia Heine succeeds in bringing Tad to Stauf, but instead of making her wish come true, Stauf mercilessly kills her.|$|E
5000|$|Ygritte {{is played}} by Rose Leslie in the {{television}} adaption of the series of books. Leslie talked about her final scene as Ygritte, saying [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have killed him - she could have shot Jon in the heart in one fell swoop. But when it finally came to that moment, she couldn't actually kill him. Even when she's expected to. Even when she wants to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of her ceramics, Allen states, [...] "I {{make the}} things that I want, and I have always liked teapots." [...] She enjoys {{the fact that if}} she made {{something}} she did not <b>like,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> simply start over again. Her platters are typically dark and molten, while her teapots are colorful and graphic. She states, [...] "When I rented my first studio in 2005 at Mellwood, I knew that I was truly an artist." ...|$|E

On the way home she meets the old women again, who seems to warn her not {{to go into the}} house, not to sleep in her room. She enters no. 17 asks Ben to fix her window then sleeps on her bed. Amber woke up sure Poppy was in the room with her, sitting on the bed, <b>like</b> <b>she</b> does, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> feel the pressure on the bed. The shape disappears and Amber tries to get back to sleep. She hears a high pitch complaining like Poppy but different, then she hears an eerie noise, wood on wood. The old rocking chair in the attic.|$|R
60|$|She {{taught her}} to read and to sew. Topsy liked reading, and learned her letters <b>like</b> magic. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear sewing. So she broke her needles or threw them away. She tangled, broke, and dirtied her cotton and hid her reels. Miss Ophelia felt sure all these things could not be accidents. Yet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never catch Topsy doing them.|$|R
60|$|That <b>she</b> did not <b>like</b> grouse-eggs; That <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get {{her living}} very well without them; That {{she was afraid}} to eat them, for fear of the gamekeepers; That she had not the heart to eat them, because the grouse were such pretty, kind, jolly birds; And a dozen reasons more.|$|R
5000|$|She {{acted as}} mother and {{grandmother}} almost to all actors and actresses like M.G.R, Rajinikanth, Kamalhassan, Vijaykanth, Sathyaraj, Prabhu, Vijay, Revathi, Radha, Ambika, Radhika, etc. Other actors or actresses cannot utter the non-lexical filler proverbs like [...] "Chithada kalli viragu odaika ponalam kathala mullu kothoda kuthidichan" [...] (When a lazy girl is forced {{to go for the}} work of cutting the firewood she may complain that aloe vera thorns poked her in a bunch) <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... a sex work narrative, but in {{the form}} of a musical. The problem with most sex work {{narratives}} is that they are not musicals ... they don’t innovate on a story that we’ve now heard a lot, a story that doesn’t really change up all that much. But Erin brings into it her voices, her singular artistic voice of course, but also her singing voice which is really good. <b>Like,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go on American Idol or something.|$|E

During her time in the Navy, Helms began cross-dressing while based in Charleston, South Carolina and says in an interview it was the [...] "deepest, darkest secret in her entire life". She was reassigned to the Bay Area in 1976, and said she [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be out in public as herself".|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him in {{something}} <b>like</b> amazement. Before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ask the question which was framing itself upon her lips, however, they were both aware of a distant sound, rapidly drawing nearer--the thunder of a horse's hoofs upon the soft sand. Looking up they both recognised the rider at the same instant.|$|R
50|$|Her {{first two}} books For the Fatherland (Gia tin Patrida (1909)) and In the Time of the Bulgar-Slayer (Ton Kairo tou Voulgaroktonou (1911)) are adventures set among the {{defenders}} of the Macedonian frontier in the heroic days of the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. With a theme <b>like</b> this <b>she</b> <b>could</b> hardly be accused of spreading atheism or undermining the nation, and she was allowed to publish freely. Her work became immensely popular, and accustomed a generation of Greek children to reading demotic prose for pleasure.|$|R
60|$|Mac did neither; he only loved her, silently, patiently, hopefully, {{and this}} generous sort of {{fidelity}} was very eloquent to a nature <b>like</b> hers. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not refuse or chide, since nothing was asked or urged; {{there was no}} need of coldness, for he never presumed; no call for pity, since he never complained. All that could be done was to try and be as just and true as he was, and to wait as trustfully for the end, whatever it was to be.|$|R
