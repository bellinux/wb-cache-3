5|$|Fàbregas' {{increase}} in exposure drew transfer speculation during the summer; Real Madrid {{expressed a desire}} to sign the Spaniard despite his long-term contract with Arsenal, but Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger stated that Arsenal would not listen to any offers. In September 2006, with six years left on his deal, Arsenal offered a new five-year deal (with an option to extend by a further three years) to the midfielder, which he signed on 19 October 2006. While the contract was unusually long, Fàbregas cited Arsenal's playing style and Wenger as reasons for his <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the club.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
25|$|First and foremost, it {{is crucial}} to realize that Iranian {{authorities}} insist on a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> and a transfer of technology as a requisite for getting a share in the market. Foreign companies are therefore advised to adopt a medium- to long-term strategy for the Iranian market. Iran will almost never honor the interests of a company that does not show <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment.</b> Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects. These are rarely competitive. Breaking up contracts into smaller parts is a common practice to try to incorporate at least 30% of the contract's value in local capability and also to negotiate on specific prices.|$|E

Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, they are widely bred in captivity.

Captive life expectancy is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts over 40 years, making them a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> as a pet.

This boa constrictor was named Popeye and died in Philadelphia Zoo, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1977. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan; this includes providing adequate space, correct temperatures and humidity, and suitable food items.|$|E

Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors: he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them. Applewhite's students had made a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them.

500|$|Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje {{signed to}} Lost on a one-year contract, {{as he did}} not want to make a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the series. As Michelle Rodriguez signed under similar {{conditions}} that lead to her character Ana-Lucia Cortez only appearing in the show's second season, show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with Akinnuoye-Agbaje to make his character, Mr. Eko, to appear in the third season as well, adding some space between the two character deaths to develop Eko's closure better. As filming of season 2 ended, conversations between the actor and the writers ended setting Eko's departure during the first six episodes, prior to mid-season break, with [...] "a shocking and emotional death". To make sure the sequence was [...] "big and impressive", effects supervisor Kevin Blank decided to set the death at the Jackass Ginger in Kalihi, a large space that allowed to make the Smoke Monster [...] "flip him around in weird physical positions". A stunt double was dragged through cables, and along with the digital monster and wire removal, fast editing made the scene akin to [...] "a magician's trick", in Blank's opinion. The episode was written by Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, who had previously worked in another series by Lost production company Bad Robot Productions, Alias.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Mr. Eko {{was created to}} explore the spiritual element of the show, and to add an African character, which the producers thought would provide [...] "cultural variety" [...] to the cast. Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse's first choice for the actor to portray Eko was Lance Reddick, after they had seen him as Cedric Daniels on HBO's The Wire. However, after it was made clear Reddick was unavailable due to the filming schedule of The Wire, Cuse and Lindelof decided to contact Akinnuoye-Agbaje, because they were big fans of {{his work on the}} HBO prison drama Oz. At the time, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was filming Get Rich or Die Tryin' and, being unfamiliar with Lost, had no intention of joining the cast. While the producers succeeded in persuading Akinnuoye-Agbaje to take the role, {{he did not want to}} make a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> to the show and was therefore only hired for a short period of time. Akinnuoye-Agbaje accepted the part mostly because it was an opportunity to play a character with a different faith than his Buddhism, and because he enjoyed the idea of being on a deserted island (he had lived on a deserted island four years prior to being cast on the show). Two weeks after he was hired, Akinnuoye-Agbaje moved to Oahu, Hawaii, where filming took place.|$|E
500|$|Larger {{cockatoos}} {{can live}} 30 to 70 years {{depending on the}} species, or occasionally longer, and cockatiels can live for about 20 years. As pets they require a <b>long-term</b> <b>commitment</b> from their owners. Their longevity is considered a positive trait as it reduces instances {{of the loss of}} a pet. The oldest cockatoo in captivity was a Major Mitchell's cockatoo named [...] "Cookie", residing at Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which lived to be 83 years old (1933-2016). A salmon-crested cockatoo named 'King Tut' who resided at San Diego Zoo was nearly 69 when he died in 1990 and a palm cockatoo reached 56 in London Zoo in 2000. However, anecdotal reports describe birds of much greater ages. 'Cocky Bennett' of Tom Ugly's Point in Sydney was a celebrated sulphur-crested cockatoo who was reported to have reached an age of 100 years or more. He had lost his feathers and was naked for much of his life. A palm cockatoo was reported to have reached 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, and a little corella that was removed from a nest in central Australia in 1904 was reported still alive in the late 1970s. In February 2010, a white cockatoo named 'Arthur' was claimed to be 90 years old; he had lived with a family for generations in Dalaguete, Cebu, before being taken to Cebu City Zoo.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} of personal risk taking and risk perception {{in the field of}} health-related behavior. It reviews work on addictions, which has shown the difficulties of impulse control in the pursuit of <b>long-term</b> <b>commitments.</b> Such <b>long-term</b> <b>commitments</b> are typically in conflict with temporary and strong urges to indulge in seeking pleasure and comfort. People know and do not know, at the same time, the likely consequences of their behavior, and relapses in addictions are very common. Risk perception research has elucidated some of these points and shown that people see risks as very different for themselves and others, especially lifestyle risks. This difference is related to the notion that they can control their own risks, while others neither can, nor want to, exercise such control. Hence, own competence and motivation is overestimated, and that of other people is underestimated. Wishful thinking further contributes to irrational tendencies. Campaigns intended to change risk-taking behavior run into very difficult resistance due to these factors, and risk messages may be interpreted as pertinent to others rather than oneself...|$|R
