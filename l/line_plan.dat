In {{order to}} avoid the {{ergonomic}} issues in the early planning stages of production line, and to achieve a more satisfactory planning and design, the ergonomic simulation is particularly important in the study of digital production <b>line</b> <b>planning.</b> An ergonomics analysis methods was presented making use of these two theory of OWAS and BSHA. The process of ergonomics analysis and simulation was discussed based on the platform of Process Simulate & Process Designer. Finally, take an example, how to consider the ergonomics problems in production <b>line</b> <b>planning</b> was introduced to make a better choice between different production <b>line</b> <b>planning</b> schemes...|$|R
2500|$|Dennison J. Lawlor was {{a famous}} Boston Naval {{architect}} who produced a <b>line</b> <b>plan</b> in which the Sparrow-Hawk had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the mizzen mast (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders' [...] to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with [...] "lively rise" [...] at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat transom, with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor. [...] Sander's rig {{takes into account the}} mast step, and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a Barque.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kubla Khan; or, A Vision in a Dream: A Fragment" [...] is a poem {{written by}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{completed}} in 1797 {{and published in}} 1816. According to Coleridge's Preface to [...] "Kubla Khan", the poem was composed one night after he experienced an opium-influenced dream after reading a work describing Xanadu, the summer palace of the Mongol ruler and Emperor of China Kublai Khan. Upon waking, he set about writing lines of poetry that came {{to him from the}} dream until he was interrupted by a person from Porlock. The poem could not be completed according to its original 200–300 <b>line</b> <b>plan</b> as the interruption caused him to forget the lines. He left it unpublished and kept it for private readings for his friends until 1816 when, at the prompting of Lord Byron, it was published.|$|E

50|$|The plan {{adopted by}} the MBTA {{is based on the}} Indigo <b>Line</b> <b>plan</b> {{advanced}} by community activists, which was intended to make the characteristics of the line more like rapid transit than commuter rail, with increased frequency and number of stops. However, in its initial proposal the MBTA did not plan to increase service frequency to match rapid transit lines, nor to install pre-pay fare systems. The Indigo <b>Line</b> <b>plan</b> also called for the use of diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars for faster acceleration and deceleration, which was considered by the MBTA but not implemented initially because of lack of funding. , the proposed state budget includes some funds to purchase DMU railcars and the state plans to issue a request for proposals in December to purchase 30 DMUs, with deliveries starting in 2018 and completed by 2020.|$|E

40|$|The railway {{planning}} problem {{consists of}} several consecutive phases: network design, <b>line</b> <b>planning,</b> timetabling, personnel assignment and rolling stocks planning.

In this work we {{will focus on the}} <b>line</b> <b>planning</b> problem context taking into account aspects related to rolling stock and crew operating costs. We assume that the number of possible vehicles is limited, that is, the problem that we are considering is a capacitated problem and the line network can be a crowding network. The main novelty in this paper is the consideration of the size of vehicles and frequencies as variables as well as the inclusion of a congestion function measuring the level of in-vehicle crowding. Concretely, we present the problem and an algorithm to solve it, which are tested via a computational experience...|$|R
