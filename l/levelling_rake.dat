40|$|The low gravity liquid <b>level</b> sensor <b>rake</b> {{measures}} the liquid surface height of propellant in a propellant tank used in launch and spacecraft vehicles. The device reduces {{the tendency of}} the liquid propellant {{to adhere to the}} sensor elements after the bulk liquid level has dropped below a given sensor element thereby reducing the probability of a false liquid level measurement. The liquid <b>level</b> sensor <b>rake</b> has a mast attached internal to a propellant tank with an end attached adjacent the tank outlet. Multiple sensor elements that have an arm and a sensor attached at a free end thereof are attached to the mast at locations selected for sensing {{the presence or absence of}} the liquid. The sensor elements when attached to the mast have a generally horizontal arm and a generally vertical sensor...|$|R

The seats are split into three parts, with a wide center and two smaller side seating areas to either side. Foot and knee room are comfortable, and the seats are comfortably reclined. The seating area also clings to its roots by using wood-backed seats and no modern-era cupholders.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{predictive}} force {{models for}} orthogonal metal cutting incorporating tool flank wear were developed {{on the basis}} of experimental investigations. CNC lathe machine (T 6 -series) was used to cut mild carbon steel CS 1030. Cylindrical workpieces were prepared with wall thickness of 3 mm and diameter of 100 mm. Four levels of cut thickness (0. 1, 0. 17, 0. 24 and 0. 31 mm) were tested at three levels of cutting speed (100, 150 and 200 m/min) and three <b>levels</b> of tool <b>rake</b> angles (− 5,...|$|R
50|$|Anglezarke Reservoir is {{the largest}} {{reservoir}} in the Rivington chain {{to the west of}} Anglezarke in Lancashire, England. Anglezarke Reservoir has three embankments, the longest, the Charnock Embankment is 777 metres long and 9.45 metres high, the Knowsley Embankment is 219.5 metres long and 14 metres high while the Heapey Embankment is 85.3 metres long and 9.75 metres high. It is fed by the River Yarrow, which has been diverted from its original course which is now covered by the Knowsley Embankment. It served the city of Liverpool before its current status as a supply mainly for Wigan. The original `Rivington Pike Scheme' was undertaken by Thomas Hawksley between 1850 and 1857. The scheme was to construct five reservoirs and a water treatment works {{at the south end of}} Lower Rivington with a 17-mile pipeline to storage reservoirs at Prescot. Water from two higher <b>level</b> reservoirs, <b>Rake</b> Brook and Lower Roddlesworth, was carried south in `The Goit', a channel connecting them to the reservoirs.|$|R
500|$|Rivington was {{dramatically}} {{changed by}} {{the construction of the}} Anglezarke, Upper Rivington, Lower Rivington and Yarrow reservoirs which were built to provide Liverpool with a safe, clean water supply. Nine properties in the valley were demolished before construction work began. The Rivington Pike Scheme, still in use today, was undertaken by Thomas Hawksley between 1850 and 1857. The scheme was to construct five reservoirs and a water treatment works {{at the south end of}} Lower Rivington with a [...] pipeline to storage reservoirs at Prescot. Water from two higher <b>level</b> reservoirs, <b>Rake</b> Brook and Lower Roddlesworth, was carried south in the Goit, a man-made channel connecting them to the lower reservoirs. The scheme was expanded in 1856, to include High Bullough Reservoir, built in 1850 by J. F. Bateman to supply water to Chorley. The scheme was further expanded by the construction of the Upper Roddlesworth Reservoir in 1867–75 by Thomas Duncan and Joseph Jackson. The Rivington watershed comprises 10,000 acres. Yarrow Reservoir, on which work began in 1867, was designed by Thomas Duncan, the Liverpool Borough Engineer.|$|R
50|$|Each {{level of}} the {{building}} is similar in plan with offices and classrooms accessed from the rear verandahs. Lattice screens and timber doors secure the entry vestibule from the verandahs on the lower level. The verandahs have painted brick columns, timber floors and vertical slatted balustrades and are partly enclosed by brick walls and toilet facilities. The lower level verandah has a flat ripple iron ceiling and lattice valence while the upper <b>level</b> has a <b>raked</b> timber boarded ceiling. Half glazed timber doors to classrooms and offices open directly from the verandah. The walls facing onto the verandahs are unpainted brickwork. Window heads and sills are concrete. A flight of stairs, enclosed with lattice panels and doors, is located along the external edge of the verandah on the Stanley Street wing. A connection has been built between {{the western end of}} the Stanley Street wing and the adjoining Block E. A raised concrete walkway joins the end of the verandah on the upper {{level of the}} Walker Street wing.|$|R
40|$|High {{data rates}} {{combined}} with high mobility represent {{a challenge for}} the design of cellular devices. Advanced algorithms are required which result in higher complexity, more chip area and increased power consumption. However, this contrasts to the limited power supply of mobile devices. This presentation discusses the application of an HSDPA receiver which has been optimized regarding power consumption with the focus on the algorithmic and architectural level. On algorithmic <b>level</b> the <b>Rake</b> combiner, Prefilter-Rake equalizer and MMSE equalizer are compared regarding their BER performance. Both equalizer approaches provide a significant increase of performance for high data rates compared to the Rake combiner which is commonly used for lower data rates. For both equalizer approaches several adaptive algorithms are available which differ in complexity and convergence properties. To identify the algorithm which achieves the required performance with the lowest power consumption the algorithms have been investigated using SystemC models regarding their performance and arithmetic complexity. Additionally, for the Prefilter Rake equalizer the power estimations of a modified Griffith (LMS) and a Levinson (RLS) algorithm have been compared with the tool ORINOCO supplied by ChipVision. The accuracy of this tool has been verified with a scalable architecture of the UMTS channel estimation described both in SystemC and VHDL targeting a 130 nm CMOS standard cell library. An architecture combining all three approaches combined with an adaptive control unit is presented. The control unit monitors the current condition of the propagation channel and adjusts parameters for the receiver like filter size and oversampling ratio to minimize the power consumption while maintaining the required performance. The optimization strategies result in a reduction of the number of arithmetic operations up to 70 % for single components which leads to an estimated power reduction of up to 40 % while the BER performance is not affected. This work utilizes SystemC and ORINOCO for the first estimation of power consumption in an early step of the design flow. Thereby algorithms can be compared in different operating modes including the effects of control units. Here an algorithm having higher peak complexity and power consumption but providing more flexibility showed less consumption for normal operating modes compared to the algorithm which is optimized for peak performance...|$|R
