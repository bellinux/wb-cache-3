40|$|International audienceIn <b>light</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> therapy, {{positron}} (β+) emitters {{are produced}} by the tissue nuclei through nuclear interactions with the beam ions. They {{can be used for}} the verification of the delivered dose using positron emission tomography by comparing the spatial distribution of the β+ emitters activity to a computer simulation taking into account the patient morphology and the treatment plan. However, the accuracy of the simulation greatly depends on the method used to generate the nuclear interactions producing these emitters. In the case of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the nuclear interaction models still lack the required accuracy due to insufficient experimental cross section data. This is particularly true for carbon therapy where literature data on fragmentation cross sections of a carbon beam with targets of medical interest are very scarce. Therefore, we performed at GANIL in July 2016 measurements on β+ emitter production cross sections with a carbon beam at 25, 50, and 95 MeV/nucleon on thin targets (C, N, O, and PMMA). We extracted the production cross section of C 10, 11, N 13, and O 14, 15 that are essential to constrain or develop MC nuclear fragmentation models...|$|E

40|$|More precise {{stopping}} power models {{for use in}} ICF target design need to be developed. The <b>light</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> ICF program is now moving into a phase where "ad hoc" scaling of certain key physics parameters in the {{stopping power}} models is no longer sufficient. Our goal is to predict ion ranges in ICF targets to within about 10 - 20 %. A verified stopping power model is also essential in diagnosing target irradiation intensities; such data can only be inferred by target response. Presently, our area of primary concern involves calculating the stopping power of the bound electrons of partially ionized atoms. One bound electron stopping power model that we are investigating uses the local oscillator model along with Hartree-Fock-Slater atomic charge density profiles to calculate I (Z,q,E), a generalized average ionization potential for the target electrons. This method is being studied systematically to look for deficiencies in the underlying physics model, especially at low projectile velocities. Another procedure uses the Generalized Oscillator Strength model to calculate the bound electron stopping. Experimental measurements of enhanced stopping power in ICF plasmas at the 0. 3 TW/cm 2 level have been reported by the Naval Research Laboratory. Further experiments at Sandia are aimed at extending this data base both to higher ionization states and to higher-Z targets using a 1. 2 TW/cm 2 proton beam on the PROTO-I accelerator...|$|E
40|$|In the auroral zone, {{quasi-static}} parallel electric fields produce {{beams of}} ionospheric ions (e. g., H(+), He(+) and 0 (+)), which flow outward into the magnetosphere, providing a {{significant source of}} ions for the ring current and plasma sheet. Because the velocities to which these beams are accelerated is dependent on the mass of the ions, differential flows between the various ion species can develop which are unstable to an ion-ion streaming instability. Particle simulations and observations from DE 1 are used to investigate the heating of the ion beams produced by this instability. It is shown that there is net transfer of energy from the light ions to the heavy ions, with the heavy ions reaching maximum velocities near the beam velocity of the light ions. Bulk heating of the heavy ions occurs when their relative density is low while high-energy tails are produced when their relative density is high. The heating is primarily parallel to the magnetic field if the difference in the heavy and <b>light</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam</b> velocities is subsonic while both perpendicular and parallel heating can occur if it is supersonic. In the latter case, very strong heating of an intermediate ion's species such as He(+) can also occur. Comparison with observations shows features consistent with heating via the ion-ion instability including perpendicular heating in the supersonic regime and parallel heating in the subsonic regime and a change in the heating between these regimes as the ratio of the H(+) beam speed to the local sound speed is observed to decrease. This heating is, however, not always observed in association with enhanced wave emissions. This lack of waves is attributed to reabsorption of the waves as the ions become heated...|$|E
30|$|Nanofluids {{are a new}} dynamic sub-class of nanotechnology. This is {{the reason}} why the {{majority}} of scientists and researchers are persistently attempting to take a shot at novel elements of nanotechnology. Das and Choi [8] named the amalgamation of these particulate matters of particle size in the order of nanometers as a “nanofluid.” Nano-particulate suspension in a base fluid makes it superior and finer in terms of heat transfer compared to conventional fluids. Abrasion-related properties of nanofluids are found to be excellent over traditional fluid-solid mixtures. Metallic nanoparticles have vast applications in the ambit of nanosciences. Nanofluids with metallic nanoparticles have a lot of useful applications especially in the biological sciences. The photothermal metallic nanoblade is another novel methodology for delivering highly concentrated material into mammalian cells. Cryosurgery is used to destroy undesired tissues with penetration of metallic nanoparticles into the target tissues. Gold nanoparticles are the finest and most efficient drug-carrying molecules. The injection/suction factor with relaxing/contracting porous orthogonally moving disks in well-established flows is regarded as an important area of study in fluid mechanics. This area of study has attracted significant applications in engineering sciences, for example, crystal growth procedures, computer storage equipment, rotating machineries, viscometers, heat and mass exchangers, and lubricants [9 – 13]. Ashraf et al. [14] discussed non-Newtonian fluid flow in orthogonally moving coaxial porous and non-porous disks. Kashif et al. [15] conducted a ground-breaking study of nanofluid flow due to orthogonally porous moving disks. The core principles of magnetohydrodynamics flow are particularly used in spacecraft propulsion, plasma accelerators for ion thrusters, <b>light</b> <b>ion</b> <b>beam,</b> powered inertial confinement, MHD generators, pumps, bearing, and boundary layer flow in aerodynamics. Nikiforov [16] performed a seminal study on MHD flow. Various other analysts have also emphasized this idea, and points of interest are explored in various studies, for example, Hatami et al.
