60|$|On {{the night}} of their arrival there the {{refectory}} of the monastery was transfigured to accommodate the numerous noble and very jovial company assembled there to sup. The long, stone-flagged room, lofty and with windows set very high, normally so bare and austere, was hung now with tapestries, and the floor strewn with rushes that were mingled with <b>lemon</b> <b>verbena</b> and other aromatic herbs. Along the lateral walls and across {{the end of the}} room that faced the double doors were set the stone tables of the Spartan monks, on a shallow dais that raised them above the level of the floor. These tables were gay now with the gleam of crystal and the glitter of gold and silver plate. Along one side of them, their backs to the walls, sat the ladies and nobles of the Court. The vaulted ceiling was rudely frescoed to represent the open heavens--the work of a brother whose brush was more devout than cunning--and there was the inevitable cenacolo above the Abbot's table at {{the upper end of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|They {{saw it as}} {{they walked}} up the pine-fringed hill from the park. Just on the crest, where Spofford Avenue petered out into a plain road, was a little white frame house with groups of pines {{on either side of}} it, {{stretching}} their arms protectingly over its low roof. It was covered with red and gold vines, through which its green-shuttered windows peeped. Before it was a tiny garden, surrounded by a low stone wall. October though it was, the garden was still very sweet with dear, old-fashioned, unworldly flowers and shrubs--sweet may, southern-wood, <b>lemon</b> <b>verbena,</b> alyssum, petunias, marigolds and chrysanthemums. A tiny brick wall, in herring-bone pattern, led from the gate to the front porch. The whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village; yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor, the big lawn-encircled palace of a tobacco king, look exceedingly crude and showy and ill-bred by contrast. As Phil said, it was the difference between being born and being made.|$|E

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of that day our new assistant came, {{and my mother was}} delighted with the way she set herself at work. The china-closet, desecrated and disordered in the preceding reigns of terror and confusion, immediately underwent a most quiet but thorough transformation. Everything was cleaned, brightened, and arranged with a system and thoroughness which showed, as my mother remarked, a good head; and all this was done so silently and quietly that it seemed like magic. By the time we came down to breakfast the next morning, we perceived that the reforms of our new prime minister had extended everywhere. The dining-room was clean, cool, thoroughly dusted, and freshly aired; the tablecloth and napkins were smooth and clean; the glass glittered like crystal, and the silver wore a cheerful brightness. Added to this were some extra touches of refinement, which I should call table coquetry. The cold meat was laid out with green fringes of parsley; and a bunch of heliotrope, <b>lemon</b> <b>verbena,</b> and mignonette, with a fresh rosebud, all culled from our little back yard, stood in a wineglass on my mother's waiter.|$|E

50|$|Unofficial importations from Spanish America seldom fared well: {{when another}} French {{botanist}} Joseph Dombey landed his collections at Cadiz in 1785 they were impounded {{and left to}} rot in warehouses, while he was refused permission even to have seeds planted.

5000|$|The {{essential}} oil of various species, mainly common vervain, is traded as [...] "Spanish verbena oil".

50|$|In the winter, if mint is rare, {{sometimes}} {{leaves of}} tree wormwood (chiba or sheeba in Moroccan dialect) are substituted for (or used to complement) the mint, giving the tea a distinctly bitter flavor. <b>Lemon</b> <b>verbena</b> (louiza in Moroccan dialect) {{is also used}} to give it a lemon flavor. The tea is sometimes sold as a ready-to-cook mixture of tea and dried mint, which is easier to store and to prepare but has diminished flavour.|$|E
