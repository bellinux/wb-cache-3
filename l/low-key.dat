5|$|Despite Warner Bros.' new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He {{placed the}} studio's {{directors}} on a quota system, and decreed a flat, <b>low-key</b> lighting style {{to make the}} sets look cheaper than they were.|$|E
5|$|CFPS' barn in Maresfield, {{where an}} all-night vigil was held; those invited {{included}} Ralph Harvey, and Ronald Hutton. After this Pagan rite was completed, her coffin was cremated at Brighton's Woodvale crematorium, in an intentionally <b>low-key</b> service with John Belham-Payne, Doreen's last High priest as celebrant for the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the band}} played a series of <b>low-key</b> concerts as The Dangermen, {{performing}} covers of classic reggae and ska songs. A lot of the songs were those played by the band {{when they were first}} forming, and the band performed the songs as a celebration of their 25th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool erected the 15-foot high {{cast-iron}} Shankly Gates {{in front}} of the Anfield Road stand. Inscribed You'll Never Walk Alone, they were opened by Nessie Shankly at a <b>low-key</b> ceremony in August 1982. In 1997, a seven-foot tall bronze statue of Shankly was unveiled outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a <b>low-key</b> {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Nowitzki's older sister, Silke Nowitzki, {{described}} Nowitzki as {{a confident}} but <b>low-key</b> character, unspoiled by money and fame. He also enjoys reading {{and playing the}} saxophone. Nowitzki passed his Abitur examination at Röntgen Gymnasium Grammar School of Würzburg. He also founded the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, a charity which aims at fighting poverty in Africa.|$|E
5|$|A new jack swing album, The Revival {{features}} R {{music that}} draws on funk and older soul influences. Its songs incorporate eccentric sounds and stylistic elements from jazz and hip hop, including improvisational sounds, conversational vocals, and digital samples. The group's lyrics exhibit contemporary hip hop attitudes and traditional soul themes, with songs about unruly women, <b>low-key</b> ballads, and more danceable tracks.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as <b>low-key</b> duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{a series}} of phone calls between band members {{resulted}} in some <b>low-key</b> rehearsals, and soon to a decision to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes. The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.|$|E
5|$|Retiring in 1984 {{during a}} Test {{series against the}} West Indies, Willis found later work as a {{commentator}} with Sky Sports. He formed a noted commentary partnership with Botham; however, Willis' relatively <b>low-key</b> style, in contrast to Botham's ebullience, meant that from 2006 onwards Willis tended {{to be used as}} a second string commentator. He remains an often-heard broadcaster, a published writer and an occasional critic of the modern game.|$|E
5|$|The film {{eventually}} {{received a}} <b>low-key</b> release in June 2015 in 18 theaters in England and Scotland. It was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, on September 21, 2015, and attracted 88,000 overnight viewers. By {{the start of}} October it had become Sky's most-watched documentary for three years, attracting a peak audience of 313,000 viewers and an average of 243,000 including catchup viewing.|$|E
5|$|A win at the World 10K Bangalore, {{where he}} beat Moses Kipsiro in 27:51, was the {{highlight}} of a <b>low-key</b> build up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In August, Zersenay was among some forty runners competing for the medals in the 10,000 metres Olympic final. Zersenay's brother, Kidane, was also competing and he led for most of first half of what was a quick race. Zersenay Tadese had the lead at the 7–8000m mark but Bekele and Sihine sprinted into first and second. Although Zersenay's time almost equalled the previous Olympic record for the event, he ended up one second behind Kenyans Moses Masai and Micah Kogo, taking fifth place overall.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more <b>low-key</b> military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely <b>low-key</b> throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, {{playing to the}} film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is {{the eighth}} studio album by American {{experimental}} rock band Sonic Youth, released on May 10, 1994 by DGC Records. It {{was produced by}} Butch Vig and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. Unlike its predecessor Dirty, Experimental Jet Set features a more <b>low-key</b> approach and references the band's earlier work on the independent record label SST Records. The album contains quieter and more relaxed songs that deal with personal and political topics.|$|E
5|$|Hu Die {{retired in}} 1966, after a career {{spanning}} {{more than four}} decades. It was said that in 1967 she married an admirer named Zhu Fangkun (or Song Kunfang), who had given her financial support in the difficult period following Pan Yousheng's death. She emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975 to join her son. She lived a <b>low-key</b> life and avoided attention by using the name Pan Baojuan. She dictated her memoir in 1986, which first appeared in Taiwan's United Daily News in serials, and was published in mainland China in 1987. She died on 23 April 1989, after suffering a stroke.|$|E
5|$|I Want You is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, <b>low-key</b> production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, <b>low-key</b> European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 provincial election, Stelmach {{was elected}} as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vegreville-Viking (later Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville). A Progressive Conservative, {{he served in}} the {{cabinets}} of Ralph Klein—at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development—where he developed a reputation as a <b>low-key</b> politician who avoided the limelight. When Klein resigned the party's leadership in 2006, Stelmach {{was among the first to}} present his candidature to replace him. After a third-place finish on the first ballot of the leadership race, he won an upset second ballot victory over former provincial treasurer Jim Dinning.|$|E
5|$|Several actors {{campaigned for}} the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. While some {{characters}} are composites, most {{are based on}} actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded {{a few weeks later}} in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's <b>low-key</b> direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In post-production, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.|$|E
5|$|To market Zorro, TriStar {{purchased}} a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, {{who had been}} known for their <b>low-key</b> presence at the ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached Zorros trailer to prints of Godzilla. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and Zorro was Sony's first film to use VRML.|$|E
5|$|Arjona's primary musical {{style is}} Latin pop. He usually sings {{without the help}} of {{featured}} or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden Déjame Decir Que Te Amo, on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums. On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively <b>low-key</b> effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.|$|E
5|$|For the 40th {{anniversary of}} All Things Must Pass, EMI reissued the album in its {{original}} configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs. Available via participating Record Store Day retailers, with each copy individually numbered, the release took place on 26 November 2010. In what Bergstrom notes as a contrast to the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon's estate, to commemorate Lennon's 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison's official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate's similarly <b>low-key</b> release of the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music's reissue of Raga, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Fort Nieulay, {{located along}} the Avenue Roger Salengro {{originally}} dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 {{on the principle}} that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect the bridge of Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly the site of a <b>low-key</b> scuffle with Germans in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the band}} {{released}} the cover album Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over {{the direction of}} the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a <b>low-key</b> solo career, {{while the rest of the}} band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, Prophets of Rage, with Chuck D and B-Real. In 2017, they were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were <b>low-key</b> and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} <b>low-key,</b> despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are <b>low-key.</b> The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing <b>low-key</b> events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by the patrons. He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
5|$|Morris also {{continued}} writing poetry and began designing illuminated manuscripts and embroidered hangings. In March 1857, Bell and Dandy {{published a book}} of Morris's poems, The Defence of Guenevere, which was largely self-funded by the author. It did not sell well and garnered few reviews, {{most of which were}} unsympathetic. Disconcerted, Morris would not publish again for a further eight years. In October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a poor working-class background, at a theatre performance and asked her to model for him. Smitten with her, he entered into a relationship with her and they were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit however that she never loved Morris. They were married in a <b>low-key</b> ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium, and settling temporarily at 41 Great Ormond Street, London.|$|E
5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} double the amount raised by any of his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} his own money on the campaign. He initially pursued a <b>low-key,</b> low-profile strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff {{in a way that}} was more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, <b>low-key</b> lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E
5|$|The <b>low-key</b> {{lighting}} schemes of many classic film noirs {{are associated}} with stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Hinde gave to many {{charities}} {{in southern}} California, and he was particularly generous to Coronado and San Diego.. He funded the construction of Christ Episcopal Church in Coronado, together with its parish center and rectory, all dedicated to his deceased daughter, Camilla. Even though Hinde was generous in his gifts, he remained modest and <b>low-key</b> throughout his life. He did not like receiving credit for his philanthropy, perhaps the reason his contributions were overlooked in the years following his death. Hinde bequeathed a large part of his estate to his sister Belinda's son, Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, who used the money to build the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel. Hinde left an even larger portion of his estate and his house in Coronado to his nephew, Harry Hinde.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was {{connecting}} {{and growing}} on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, {{in the years following}} the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later {{set the stage for the}} band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing <b>low-key</b> shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.|$|E
5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, dropping in number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again in the Depression years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically <b>low-key</b> and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E
