Reduced nighttime overglow or haloing was expected also to improve recognition rates for computer road sign detection. Unfortunately, these tests compared new signs in Clearview to existing, weathered signs in the existing Highway Gothic font. The new font's apparent legibility [...] "was more {{due to the fact}} that older, worn signs were being replaced with nice, fresh, clean signs which were, naturally, more legible." [...] Better testing also revealed that legibility was worse for negative contrast signs (dark lettering on light backgrounds) such as on speed limit and yellow warning signs.|$|E

40|$|The {{need to see}} {{traffic signs}} at night {{has led to the}} {{development}} of increasingly brighter retroreflective sign sheeting. The impact of this increased brightness has been shown to increase the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> of the sign, but at what cost? With brighter signs being visible from farther away, there is an increased opportunity for the driver to look at the sign. This thesis assesses the impact of sign brightness on the nighttime driver??????s sign viewing behavior; such as the number of glances and the total glance duration directed at the sign. Eye-tracking technology has been used to follow the nighttime driver??????s eye movements through tasks based on sign usage. The six signs used for the analysis are classified in three relative brightness categories of bright, medium, and dim on a closed course and on a public road. Data relating to the beginning and end of each glance were recorded as well as the distance at which the sign became legible to the driver. Comparisons were made between the three brightness levels for the number of glances, total glance duration, and <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> of the sign. Further analysis was conducted to determine the effect of the testing environment on a driver??????s sign viewing behavior by comparing the results from the closed course with those from the open road. The data for this thesis show varying results between the two courses with more defined differences based on luminance for the open road. The results of this thesis indicate that drivers do not consistently change the number of times they look at a sign or the amount of time dedicated to a sign based on its brightness. During real world driving scenarios, the brightest sign resulted in the longest <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> and the lowest total glance duration, indicating an increased efficiency reading the sign by the driver. Typically, a sign with a longer total glance duration had a shorter <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> Comparisons between the closed and open courses revealed that open road driving resulted in a longer total glance duration and a shorter <b>legibility</b> <b>distance...</b>|$|E

RysDuring {{the last}} several decades, the number of drivers {{and the number of}} senior {{citizens}} driving on U. S highways has increased significantly along with the number of traffic signs. The median age of the drivers has also increased due to the aging population. Traffic signs provide a plethora of necessary information - directions, guidance, warnings, regulations, and recreation. With today's congestion and higher speed, it's very important to recognize the need for brighter and easier to read signs to increase safety among drivers. In the recent years, there has been innovation in the field of traffic engineering, giving rise to numerous innovations in retro-reflective sheeting materials and fonts. It is important to identify the combination of font and retro-reflective sheeting material, which performs best by increasing the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> between the driver and the sign during both day and night time conditions. The objective of the research was to determine the combination of font (among Clearview 5 -W, Series E-Modified and Clearview 5 -W-R) and retro-reflective sheeting materials (DG 3, Type 4 and Type 1) that produces maximum <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> The objective was also to study the safety benefits of the Clearview font. Both field and computer based tests were carried out to find out which combination of font and retro-reflective material produced maximum <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> From field tests {{it was found that the}} Clearview 5 -W-R font along with Type 1 reflective material produced the maximum <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> in day time conditions, whereas Clearview 5 -W-R along with Type 4 reflective material produced the maximum <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> at night conditions. It was also seen that while the Type 1 sheeting material performed well during day time, it failed to produce good results during night time. In fact it ended up as the worst performing sheeting material during night time. Based on these observations, it is recommended to use the Clearview 5 -W-R in combination with Type 4 retro-reflective sheeting as it showed the most consistent performance compared to all other combinations of fonts and DG 3 or Type 1 retro-reflective material...|$|E

40|$|Sign {{visibility}} is an imprecise term {{in that it}} encompasses both sign detectability {{and sign}} legibility. Sign detectability refers to {{the likelihood of a}} sign being found in the driving environment and is integrally associated with sign conspicuity. Sign conspicuity is a function of a sign’s capacity to attract a driver’s attention that depends on sign, environmental, and driver variables (Mace, Garvey, and Heckard 1994). Sign legibility describes the ease with which a sign’s textual or symbolic con-tent can be read. Sign legibility differs from sign recognizability in that the former refers to reading unfamiliar messages while the latter refers to identifying familiar sign copy. Sign legibility and rec-ognizability in turn differ from sign comprehensibility in that the latter term implies understanding the message while the former merely involve the ability to discern critical visual elements. While other measures of sign visibility such as blur tolerance (Kline et al. 1999) and compre-hension speed (Ells and Dewar 1979) are sometimes used, sign visibility is most often assessed by determining threshold distance. The two thresholds often used are detection distance (the distance at which an observer can find a sign in the driving environment) and <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> (the distance at which an observer can read a sign’s message). The intent of a sign designer is to provide the sign’s observer with the maximum time to read the sign, and to do that the observer must find it prior to or at its maximum reading distance. Therefore, in designing a sign it is desirable to achieve a detection distance that is equal to or greater than that sign’s <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> To describe <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> across signs with different letter heights, the term legibility index is often used. Legibility index (LI) refers to the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> of a sign as a function of its text size. Measured in feet per inch of letter height (ft/in.), the LI is found by dividing the sign’s <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> by its letter height. For instance, a sign with 10 -inch letters legible at 300 feet has an LI of 30 ft/in. (300 / 10 = 30) ...|$|E

This study {{examined the relationship between}} stair use and a broad range of features of the physical environment within 10 buildings. Based on a review of the literature, a thematic framework (Appeal, Convenience, Comfort, Legibility and Safety) was developed for identifying the features of buildings that may influence stair use. Three methods of investigation were used {{to examine the relationship between}} stair use and variables of the five themes and their constructs. Buildings users were surveyed for their reasons for both single and multi-level route choice. The results indicated that reasons associated with convenience and legibility of route had greater influence on route choice than appeal, comfort or safety. Stair and elevator use were measured in the ten buildings along with variables that operationalized the thematic framework. Regression analysis was utilized to examine the relationship between stair use and the operationalized variables of the thematic framework. The results of regression analysis indicated that stair use was associated with 8 key spatial variables of convenience and <b>legibility</b> (travel <b>distances</b> from stair to nearest entrance and to the elevator; percentage of total building area or total occupant load attributed to each stair; physical accessibility of each stair; area of stair isovist; number of turns from the stair to closest entrance and to the most integrated path). Most local environmental features of stairs such as lighting levels and views were not statistically influential. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that three variables (effective area of each stair, area of stair isovist, and number of turns required between the stair and the most integrated path) explained 53 % of stair use. A graphic analysis of the arrangement of the 8 key spatial variables within the ten buildings indicated that buildings with high overall levels of stair use optimized the key spatial variables in respect to the location of stair(s) within the building floor plan.

In the United States, older drivers are increasing in numbers on our public highways; the U. S.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} various presbyopic vision corrections on nighttime driving performance on a closed-road driving circuit. Methods. Participants were 11 presbyopes (mean age, 57. 3 ± 5. 8 years), with a mean best sphere distance refractive error of R+ 0. 23 ± 1. 53 DS and L+ 0. 20 ± 1. 50 DS, whose only experience of wearing presbyopic vision correction was reading spectacles. The study involved a repeated-measures design by which a participant's nighttime driving performance was assessed on a closed-road circuit while wearing each of four power-matched vision corrections. These included single-vision distance lenses (SV), progressive-addition spectacle lenses (PAL), monovision contact lenses (MV), and multifocal contact lenses (MTF CL) worn in a randomized order. Measures included low-contrast road hazard detection and avoidance, road sign and near target recognition, lane-keeping, driving time, and <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> for street signs. Eye movement data (fixation duration and number of fixations) were also recorded. Results. Street sign legibility distances were shorter when wearing MV and MTF CL than SV and PAL (P < 0. 001), and participants drove more slowly with MTF CL than with PALs (P = 0. 048). Wearing SV resulted in more errors (P < 0. 001) and in more (P = 0. 002) and longer (P < 0. 001) fixations when responding to near targets. Fixation duration was also longer when viewing distant signs with MTF CL than with PAL (P = 0. 031). Conclusions. Presbyopic vision corrections worn by naive, unadapted wearers affected nighttime driving. Overall, spectacle corrections (PAL and SV) performed well for distance driving tasks, but SV negatively affected viewing near dashboard targets. MTF CL resulted in the shortest <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> for street signs and longer fixation times. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulations}} concerning {{road markings}} have recently opened up more {{for use of}} symbols in the roadway. However, regulations for the dimension of road marking symbols vary even between the Nordic countries, and research on how the symbols should be designed is lacking. The aim of the ViP project described in this report was to establish guidelines for how symbols in the roadway should be extended along the road. In order to achieve the goal, a simulator study on legibility distances was carried out, followed by two minor field studies. In the simulator study, four two-character symbols and four three-character symbols were used; 55, 56, 65, 66, 55 N, 56 N, 65 S, 66 S. For each of four symbol sizes; 1. 6 m, 2. 5 m, 4. 0 m and 7. 5 m and each of four speeds; 30, 50, 70 and 90 km/h, one two-character symbol and one three-character symbol were presented to the driver. The simulator study resulted in a main effect of symbol size; the larger the symbol size, the larger the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> Another result was that the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> decreased when the speed increased. As an attempt to check {{the results from the}} simulator a downscaled field study was carried out. The highest and lowest speed and the largest and the shortest symbol size in the simulator were used, although downscaled with a factor three. Comparing the results of the simulator and the downscaled field study, the speed effect was significant but weak, i. e. the effect size was small. To be able to establish if there is a speed effect that should be examined in a larger test, a validation field study was completed. In the validation field study, the symbol size was always 2. 5 m and the travel speeds were 30, 50, 70 and 90 km/h, in correspondence with the simulator speeds. The results of the validation field study showed no speed effect. The simulator study in this project confirmed the logic of larger symbol sizes meaning longer legibility distances, but while the speed influenced <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> in the simulator {{this was not the case}} in the field. The legibility distances in the simulator were also shorter than in the field, possibly due to issues related to the graphics rendering. A conclusion from this is that in order to find out how much road marking symbols should be extended, supplementary field studies are needed. It is recommended that future studies include several symbol sizes but it would probably be sufficient to perform the tests at only two vehicle speeds; one low and one high. Data from such studies should also be used for developing the graphics rendering in the simulation...|$|E

Although text and graphics are, in reality, often viewed not perpendicular to the display, they are rarely studied. To examine the legibility of characters viewed not perpendicular to the display, this paper has redefined the Legibility Index as the inverse square root of the solid angle subtended by the target, based on a hypothesis that the three-dimensional solid angle, rather than the two-dimensional visual angle, both subtended by the character, captures how people recognize text and graphics that usually have two significant dimensions (width and height).

Twenty-four participants, aged 55 - 75, drove a passenger sedan around a closed course at 30 mph while attempting to read ground-mounted signs on the right shoulder. Results showed no difference between drivers aged 55 - 64 and those aged 65 - 75. Overall legibility distances ranged from 143 ft to 206 ft, producing legibility indexes {{in the range of}} 24 - 34 ft of legibility per inch of letter height. Color was found to be a significant factor in legibility with yellow and white producing the longest legibility distances followed by green and then orange. Across all colors, retroreflective sheeting type was a significant factor with specific difference...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{observer}} age and environmental glare on nighttime legibility of traffic signs were investigated in two field experiments with the subjects driving or {{riding in a}} car towards a sign. Experiment 1 showed that equating older and younger subjects {{in terms of their}} low luminance/high contrast visual acuity resulted in elimination of any age effects on legibility. Furthermore, the presence of a glare source with an illuminance of 0. 17 or 0. 017 lux offset 2 [deg] from the sign legend improved <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> significantly. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that a glare source with an illuminance of 0. 0098 lux had no effect on legibility when presented at an offset angle of 1. 5 [deg] or 0. 6 [deg], but it had a significant detrimental effect at an offset angle of 0. 2 [deg]. The present findings suggest that (1) the usually observed age-related performance decrement on nighttime legibility tasks is the result of visual-acuity deficits, and not shortcomings in information-processing ability; (2) legibility is relatively unaffected by glare, unless the glare angle is very small or glare level very high; and (3) glare sources positioned outside of the fovea might improve nighttime legibility performance under certain conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of In-Vehicle Signing (IVS) functions {{was guided by}} the principles of traffic engineering as they apply to the design and placement of roadway signs. Because of the dynamic and active nature of computing, communications, and display technology, IVS can fulfill the signing principles of traffic engineering in ways that have been impossible with conventional signage. Current signing technology represents a series of compromises of these principles, especially the data and equations contributing to the calculation of required sight distance. A number of conditions relevant to sight distance are quite variable, e. g. : vehicle speed, visibility, weather, and driver reaction time. However, conventional signing requires that there are fixed values of each variable for the determination of (e. g.) <b>legibility</b> <b>distance.</b> IVS, on the other hand, {{will be able to}} tailor the timing of sign presentation to the dynamically diverse variable values of all of these conditions. A clear, in-vehicle sign display, adaptive to ambient and driver conditions, will in fact obviate the entire issue of sign legibility. These capabilities, together with information filtering functions, will truly enhance the presentation of sign information to drivers. The development of IVS is a critical step in the development of an integrated In-Vehicle Information System (IVIS) ...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis documents the results of a laboratory study designed to evaluate and compare the glance <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> of commercially available freeway Lane Control Signals (LCS). Two prototype fiber-optic lane control signals were evaluated to determine their suitability for freeway-lane-control-signing applications. The LCS used in the study were obtained from C. J. Hood, Inc., and Electro Fiberoptics, Inc. This study emphasized the visibility of the standard LCS displays (their ability to be detected and recognized) rather than their comprehension (their ability to be understood by a majority of the drivers). For this, glance <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> was used as a Measure of Effectiveness (MOE). It is the distance at which the sign catches the attention of a driver in a limited time of exposure. The glance legibility was evaluated and compared for the corresponding symbols displayed by the two signs. An attempt was made to correlate the difference in legibility to the differences in sign design characteristics. Also evaluated was the sensitivity of glance legibility to the gender and age of the subject. The glance legibility distances of the symbols displayed by the two signals were analyzed for their compliance with the MUTCD guidelines. Glance legibility of "Red X", "Yellow X", and "Green Arrow" displayed by the two signs was found to be in the ranges of 750 - 950 feet, 800 - 1000 feet, and 1200 - 1400 feet respectively. The size of the sign, brightness of the display, and the pixel arrangement were found to be the main design characteristics that have a direct bearing on the legibility of the displays. Brightness of the sign is a greater determinant than the color of the display. Significant differences exist between the color versus symbol recognition distances. The signal displays were visible but not legible. The glance legibility does not depend upon the gender of the driver; however, significant differences in legibility of displays were found to exist between the younger and the older age groups. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding and utilization of LCS systems and will promote more uniformity in the design, installation, and operation of LCS systems in the most cost effective manner possible; however, further research needs to be done as regards the factors contributing to the effective visibility of freeway LCS. In summary, {{there is a need to}} make an in-depth study of the interrelationships between the LCS hardware elements (e. g. the light intensities, symbol displays, color combinations etc), geometric features and traffic conditions, mounting characteristics, and driver limitations so as to promote more uniformity in the application of LCS to freeway traffic management...|$|E
40|$|IESNA Annual Conference: Light Matters 2007 : Integrating Light Into Our Environments. General Lighting Topics. January 28 - 30, 2007. Phoenix, AZ. Reading {{text and}} {{graphics}} {{is a common}} issue in lighting design and practice. Legibility of text and graphics is often measured using the Legibility Index, conventionally defined as the distance at which material can be read with perfect accuracy (the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance)</b> divided by the character height. The ratio equals to the inverse tangent of the visual angle V. This definition assumes the material to be read is perpendicular to the viewer, which is always not true. Off-axis viewing of text and graphics is common in reality, yet rarely researched. To examine off-axis legibility, this paper has developed a new definition of the Legibility Index, defined as the inverse square root of solid angle ω subtended by the target, based on a hypothesis that the three-dimensional solid angle, rather than the two-dimensional visual angle, captures how people recognize text and graphics. This hypothesis has been verified in light of how retinal images activate cones. When viewed, text or graphics form a retinal image that activates the underlying cones in the center fovea of viewer’s eyes. Legibility is then determined by the spatial distribution of these activated cones. For linear targets, their retinal images have only one dimension. Their activated cones are linearly distributed. Thus, visual angle is sufficient to examine the legibility of linear targets. For common nonlinear targets, their retinal images usually have two significant dimensions (width and height) and activate a two-dimensional collection of cones. Solid angle {{should be used to}} examine the legibility of these real viewing targets...|$|E

RysBefore year 2012 the US States must {{implement}} {{and continue}} using an assessment or management method to maintain traffic signs’ retro-reflectivity {{at or above}} the minimum levels adopted by FHWA. Overhead guide signs are a particular problem because past research has shown that with available sheeting types, external illumination may still be necessary. Newer sheeting types and more energy efficient and cost-effective lighting systems are currently available. Over the next several years there is potential for savings {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars if the states don’t have to use external illumination for their overhead guide signs, or, if more energy efficient, low cost lighting systems are used when necessary. A detailed literature review was conducted on minimum retro-reflectivity values for overhead guide signs, the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> under reduced sign luminance and the lighting systems available for external illumination. There is no agreement found in the previous research studies as to what is the optimum or minimum luminance of the guide signs. In addition, a survey was sent to all state DOTs. This survey was focused on finding states’ policies regarding the use of sheeting type and external illumination requirement, and methods and lighting systems for maintaining minimum values for overhead guide sign luminance. The total response rate was 56 % (28 out of 50 state DOTs responded). Out of 28 respondents 19 said that they have usage policy for the type of sheeting material used for overhead guide signs and 18 of them provided details about their policy. An equipment to control the illumination levels from vehicle headlamps was built and pilot tests were conducted in the laboratory. A pulse-with-modulation dimming circuit designed around the Atmel ARM-based microcontroller board and power MOSFETs was used to control the brightness of the headlights for the high- and low-beams. Field tests were conducted in the later stages during nighttime to evaluate three different types of sheeting materials using 10 human subjects from age group 18 - 34. The materials DG 3 and Type IV were found to perform better than Type I material for nighttime visibility but they were not significantly different from each other...|$|E
40|$|All factors being equal, {{pavement}} marking {{signs are}} more likely to be detected by drivers than post-mounted signs. Several international manuals/guidelines explicitly state that elongation improves the <b>legibility</b> <b>distance</b> of pavement markings. Furthermore, some countries use greater elongation ratios on roadways with higher speed limits, while some others use a single elongation ratio regardless of the speed limit of the roadway. Therefore, research is needed to explore the relationship between speed and elongation ratio. Most of the available research on this topic has used stationary observers rather than subjects driving at posted roadway speeds, which makes a full-scale driving simulator an invaluable tool to study the effects of sign elongation on recognition distance while driving. Sixteen drivers, between the ages of 21 and 54, participated in the driving simulator study. Five elongation ratios that were tested in the driving simulator, 1 : 1, 1 : 2. 5, 1 : 5, 1 : 7. 5 and 1 : 10. The ?Curve? (W 1 - 2) sign, ?Speed Limit? (R 2 - 1) sign, and ?Pedestrian Crossing? (W 11 - 2) sign were chosen for this research. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the effect of elongation ratio on recognition distance through a random effects linear model. All variables were initially included and through the procedure it was found that age, gender, years of driving experience, and if the participant wore corrective lenses were not statistically significant covariates. It was found that elongation ratio, sign type, and speed were statistically significant factors when perception response time is not taken into account. The relationship between recognition distance and elongation ratio was found to be a quadratic function. While sign type is statistically significant, it is not meaningful for real world applications, therefore, the model was adjusted to be useful for all sign types. This research yielded a relationship between recognition distance and elongation ratio for drivers in a driving simulator: The constant term is affected by speed and whether a perception reaction time is used. Other considerations, such as cost of installation and maintenance, should be taken into account before an elongation ratio is selected for application...|$|E
