40|$|Abstract: Septal {{necrosis}} + peripheral <b>left</b> <b>blocks.</b> Because of {{an extensive}} septal necrosis, {{the manifestation of}} the initial ventricular activation forces decreases in the precordial leads. With <b>left</b> bifascicular <b>block</b> (LASB + LPSB), the first ventricular activation forces become more evident and the electrical signs of septal necrosis can be concealed. In {{the presence of a}} trifascicular block, manifestation of the first ventricular electromotive forces diminishes again and the electrical signs of septal necrosis become evident once more. Small Q waves are present in leads V 1 to V 4. Extensive anterior necrosis + peripheral blocks. This necrosis is manifested by QS complexes from V 2 to V 6. An associated <b>left</b> bifascicular <b>block</b> reduces the electrical manifestation of dead tissue: QS complexes persist only in V 3 and V 4. In turn, a coexisting trifascicular block causes the presence of QS complexes from V 2 to V 5. Posteroinferior necrosis + peripheral blocks. Electromotive forces of the ventricular activation shift upward, due to a posteroinferior necrosis and QS or QR complexes are recorded in leads aVF, II and III. An associated <b>left</b> bifascicular <b>block</b> displaces the main electromotive forces downward, posteriorly and to the left, due to a delay of the posteroinferior activation fronts. The ventricular complexes become positive and wider in all leads, reflecting the potential variations of the inferior portions of the left ventricle: aVF, II, III, sometimes V 5 and V 6. Consequently, the electrical signs of necrosis are reduced or abolished. Due to a trifascicular block, wide and slurred QS complexes are recorded in aVF, II, III and sometimes in V 5 and V 6.
