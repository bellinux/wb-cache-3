5|$|On June 21, 2015, a 37-year-old man's leg was gashed by the ride's <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> gates. He {{was taken}} to a local {{hospital}} where his wound was sutured.|$|E
5|$|The new station {{had four}} {{platform}} faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains {{on the new}} line. The platforms were linked by a subway {{which led to the}} booking office, situated on ground level by the main entrance {{on the east side of}} the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west side of the line and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton Junction Signal Box, which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, one for {{unloading}} {{and one for}} loading. Two trains are loaded and unloaded while the third train is running the course. There is also a separate line in the station where riders can wait for the first seat. The <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> has red overhead lights, which are located above the train. Millennium Force's theme song is played in the station while riders are boarding.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear <b>loading</b> <b>platform.</b> There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E

25|$|At the {{south-east}} end of {{the main}} station platform is another garden. Further south-east {{to the west of}} the line is a corrugated iron clad goods shed with a gabled roof. It stands on timber stumps, although its timber <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> is supported on steel poles. Opposite the goods shed, east of the line, is a modern driver's quarters (not of cultural heritage significance). Further to the south-east, east of the line, are located: an old steel carriage used for storage (not of cultural heritage significance); a skillion-roofed three-bay trolley shed (pre 1982) clad in corrugated iron; plus a two-lever ground frame with attached signals and points.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2006, 21 {{people were}} injured at Liseberg when two roller coaster trains, on the rollercoaster Lisebergbanan, collided. The crash {{happened}} when the chain that pulls trains up the initial climb malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll backward into the <b>loading</b> <b>platform,</b> hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since {{only part of the}} train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80km/h. Since the accident the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{railroad}} tracks through Scales Mound are five properties, four of them historic in nature. There are two shed/pump houses, both dating from c. 1910–40. One is a gable roof building with a concrete foundation and the other has a flat roof and metal siding. A rectangular feed warehouse dating from c. 1915–20 is also located along the rail corridor. The one story, gable roof feed warehouse stands on a concrete pier foundation. A pyramidal roof garage/warehouse, built c. 1915–25, stands on concrete foundations near the tracks as well. Associated with the garage are bulk oil storage tanks and a pump shed constructed by Trachte Brothers Company of Madison, Wisconsin. The {{only one of the}} five buildings not considered contributing to the district is a c. 1949–50 rail <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> of pole construction.|$|E

500|$|As {{its name}} suggests, The Riddler's Revenge is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} Riddler. The track was previously painted green with black supports, {{but as of}} 2017, the track is now green with yellow supports. [...] As the Riddler was an archenemy of Batman, The Riddler's Revenge is located appropriately adjacent to Batman: The Ride, {{in the back of}} the park. The Riddler's signature question mark is featured on the coaster's logo. The techno music that played on the <b>loading</b> <b>platform</b> is Ecuador (Bruce Wayne Mix) by Sash!

40|$|Nanoscale {{materials}} {{often have}} stochastic material properties due to random distribution of material defects {{and lack of}} sufficient number of defects to ensure a consistent average. Current methods to measure the mechanical properties employ microelectromechanical systems based tensile <b>loading</b> <b>platforms.</b> The nanoscale specimens are typically mounted manually onto the <b>loading</b> <b>platforms</b> with external integration techniques so the boundary conditions have random variations, complicating the experimental measurement of the stochasticity in the natural state of the material properties. In this Ph. D. thesis, we show methods for batch-compatible (i. e. monolithic) integration of nanoscale specimens cofabricated with the tensile <b>loading</b> <b>platforms.</b> The specimens are gold nanowires of 40 nm thickness, 350 nm to 410 nm width (depending on the specimen), and 7 -micrometer length. The uniaxial micro tensile <b>loading</b> <b>platforms</b> are interdigitated electrode electrostatic actuators. The experiments are performed in a scanning electron microscope and digital image correlation is employed to measure displacements to determine nominal stress and nominal strain. The ultimate tensile strength of the nanocrystalline gold nanowires approach 1 GPa, consistent with the smaller-is-stronger paradigm. The batch-compatible integration method is designed to microfabricate uniaxial micro tensile testing platforms that are suitable for transmission electron microscope experiments. This batch-compatible integration method is designed also to create nominally identical nanoscale specimens and boundary conditions for {{a broad range of}} nanoscale materials provided the nanoscale materials of interest are compatible with the etchants used in the microfabrication processes. Furthermore, in addition to the batch-compatible integration method, a generalized external integration method that can be applied to free-standing thin-films is developed. Using this method, mechanical behavior of single crystal gold metal, and single crystal gold-silver alloy nanoscale specimens are extracted. For the extraction of the mechanical properties, similar procedures followed for batch-compatible integrated nanoscale specimens are followed. For single crystal gold nanoscale specimen, a Young's modulus of 33. 42 GPa, and ultimate tensile strength of 0. 48 GPa is obtained. For single crystal gold-silver alloy nanoscale specimen, a Young's modulus of 64. 47 GPa, and ultimate tensile strength of 0. 67 GPa is obtained...|$|R
