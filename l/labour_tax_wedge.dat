40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a rise in non-wage labour costs (NWLC) on real manufacturing labour costs in OECD countries, taking into account the degree of coordination in the wage bargaining process. We find that, in countries in which wage bargaining is not highly coordinated, 55 % of an increase in NWLC appears to be shifted to workers in the long run, whereas in countries operating under a highly coordinated bargaining regime, full shifting occurs. Overall, our results suggest that high NWLC can be associated with a high equilibrium unemployment rate, but only in those OECD countries that do not have highly coordinated wage bargaining. <b>labour</b> costs, <b>tax</b> <b>wedge,</b> wage determination, bargaining coordination. ...|$|R

The results show that Croatia is classified among countries with a high <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> and a high unemployment rate. The same holds when, instead of the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge,</b> personal average <b>tax</b> rate is considered.

The relatively high labour tax burden for low-paid employees is due to several reasons. The most important one is the existence of mandatory minimum base for social security contribution (SSC).

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{time series}} {{evidence on the}} relationships, and possible trade-offs, between productivity and employment, and {{on the impact of}} taxes in this connection. First, a heoretical model is built for an open economy leading to the identification of technology, non-technology and <b>labour</b> and capital <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> shocks, as based on their long-run effects. Then structural VAR models are estimated for the EU- 15 and some other OECD countries to infer the above relationships. Our conclusion is that there is in the EU a fairly uniform and significant short-run negative impulse on employment from a positive productivity shock, while this becomes smaller and statistically insignificant over time in most, but not in some member countries. The former situation is interpreted to be an indication of nominal and the latter that of real or structural rigidity in the economy. In the US, there is no such trade-off, either in the short or long run. The impulse response of the shocks in the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> on <b>labour</b> in the EU- 15 is a fairly sizeable and significant negative impact on employment both in the short and long run, while the effects of capital income tax shocks are negative on productivity, but not significant in statistical terms. 2 ̆ 022 How much does the Finnish forest cluster invest in biotechnology R&D activity, and what are the key application areas in the value chain...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the motives}} for and {{results of the}} <b>labour</b> <b>tax</b> reforms undertaken by the Latvian government in 2011 - 2013 with a special focus on the lowwage sector. The reforms were developed {{with the goal of}} overcoming negative effects on the labour market caused by the deep economic crisis in 2008 - 2010 as well as of coping with an increase in <b>labour</b> <b>tax</b> burdens during consolidation. In 2008 - 2010, Latvia was seriously affected by the global economic crisis and during these years real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 21 percent. Labour market conditions became worse rapidly and at the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate reached 21. 5 per cent of the economically active population. For the period of 2011 - 2016, the reforms provide for a reduction in the rates of personal income tax (PIT) and social security contributions (SSC) as well as for an increase in PIT allowances. Taking into account the changes made in <b>labour</b> <b>tax</b> laws, we employed forecasts of average wages and applied the Eurostat methodology to calculate the <b>tax</b> <b>wedge</b> for different groups of employees depending on income level and on the number of their dependants. The results show that the impact of the reform varies greatly and it is more beneficial for employees with dependants and for low-wage earners.

40|$|Measures {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the <b>tax</b> burden on <b>labour</b> have been advocated to alleviate the EU unemployment problem. Most of the analyses document {{a relationship between the}} unemployment rate and the <b>tax</b> burden on <b>labour.</b> Hence, {{it is not possible to}} discern whether the effect on unemployment derives from labour demand, labour supply or through the wage formation mechanism. Moreover, the empirical analyses are usually static, and may be indicative of the steady-state determinants of the unemployment rate and do not reveal the features of the adjustment process. This paper studies the relationship between <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> and <b>labour</b> costs by modelling the wage formation mechanism in a dynamic context. We test if the composition of <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> affects <b>labour</b> costs in the short- and in the long-run and whether highly centralised bargaining systems have better employment performance than decentralised ones.
