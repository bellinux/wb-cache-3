2500|$|Following the 1993 election, Richardson was {{returned}} to cabinet in the second Keating Ministry as Minister for Health. In a highly publicised tour, of the Northern Territory and following the Mabo decision and the <b>lodging</b> <b>of</b> Wik <b>claim,</b> Richardson promised to make health care the key components of a new social justice package being negotiated with Aborigines. Richardson went on national television and said that $1.3billion was needed in new funding and he would deliver it. Keating's secretary, Mike Codd, described Richardson during his term as Minister for Health as being [...] "passionate about Aboriginal health. Genuinely passionate.

40|$|The “Wild Coast”, an {{alternative}} {{name for the}} coastal Pondoland (Eastern Cape, South Africa), {{is one of the}} focal points of strong eco-frontier dynamics, like scenic landscape tourism and biodiversity conservation. Nonetheless, beyond the Wild Coast there is a changing rurality. The end of apartheid has opened an era of potential changes for Pondoland, starting with the <b>lodging</b> <b>of</b> land <b>claims</b> on historically seized land. If Pondoland local development has to adjust to the global economy, new outsiders' appropriation challenges, like mining projects or future tourist resorts, are also a reality to consider. Today, the “Wild Coast” is confirmed as the branding name for the coastal Pondoland to become a major eco-tourism attraction. Are outsiders and insiders able and willing to work together towards an integrated Pondoland in order to avoid partition of the coast from its rural hinterland? Several authors contribute to the making of this book of interest for eco-conscious tourists planning to visit the Wild Coast, for students and academics researching the new South Africa and for all actors willing to commit themselves to building a better future for Pondoland...|$|R

25|$|In 1946, {{the ship}} was refloated and {{allocated}} as a war prize to China and placed under the ownership of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shanghai. In 1947 she {{was sent to the}} Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock for repairs. New electrical systems and radar were fitted and her accommodation was rebuilt.

Her crew defected to the Communist Chinese side in March 1951. On 12 March 1951, an emergency Cabinet meeting was held by the Hong Kong Government to discuss the ship. Four days later, the Chinese Government reiterated its claim to the ship, stating that it held the British Government liable for any interference in the free movement of the vessel, leading to the <b>lodging</b> <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> for compensation. Yung Hao was requistioned by the British Admiralty on 7 April to prevent her falling into Chinese hands on orders from Governor Sir Alexander Grantham. The next day, the issue was raised in the British Parliament. Answering a question from Ernest Kinghorn, Secretary of State for the Colonies James Griffiths stated that the requisitioning had been done in consultation with the British Government and was to prevent North Korean and Chinese forces using the ship.|$|R
