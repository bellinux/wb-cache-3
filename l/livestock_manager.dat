30|$|More generally, our {{findings}} suggest that pastoralists (as well as other land or <b>livestock</b> <b>managers)</b> can minimize negative interactions and maximize positive interactions through two means: first, by minimizing competition between wild herbivores and livestock during the dry season; and second, by maintaining or increasing habitat heterogeneity.

Realistically, however, {{it may be difficult to}} minimize competition and land degradation unless pastoralists destock during or in anticipation of dry periods and then later restock.

For this reason, remote sensing data such as the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) have been widely used to assess Sahelian plant productivity for about 40 years. This study combines traditional FAPAR-based assessments with agrometeorological variables computed by the geospatial water balance program, GeoWRSI, using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration satellite gridded data to estimate the annual herbaceous yield in the semi-arid areas of Senegal. It showed that a machine-learning model combining FAPAR seasonal metrics with various agrometeorological data provided better estimations of the in situ annual herbaceous yield (R 2 = 0. 69; RMSE = 483 kg·DM/ha) than models based exclusively on FAPAR metrics (R 2 = 0. 63; RMSE = 550 kg·DM/ha) or agrometeorological variables (R 2 = 0. 55; RMSE = 585 kg·DM/ha). All the models provided reasonable outputs and showed a decrease in the mean annual yield with increasing latitude, together with an increase in relative inter-annual variation. In particular, the additional use of agrometeorological information mitigated the saturation effects that characterize the plant indices of areas with high plant productivity. In addition, the date of the onset of the growing season derived from smoothed FAPAR seasonal dynamics showed no significant relationship (0. 05 p-level) with the annual herbaceous yield across the whole studied area. The date of the onset of rainfall however, was significantly related to the herbaceous yield and its inclusion in fodder biomass models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of a mass herbaceous deficit at an early stage of the year...|$|R
40|$|Across sub-Saharan Africa pastoralists live {{alongside}} large densities and {{distributions of}} wildlife. Today, {{the relationships between}} pastoralists and spaces dedicated to wildlife are changing. Pastoralists are losing communal land due to changes in land tenure {{and an increase in}} wildlifebased tourism. This has led to shifts in land access and use, {{as well as in the}} political economy of labor for livestock production. The objective of this research is to understand how new land tenure arrangements and shifts in the tourism economy are affecting access to grazing resources and restructuring herd management. This case study from southwest Kenya employs qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, informal conversations, and ethnographic observations gathered from accompanying individuals on their daily routines. In the first chapter, I argue that there are both positive and negative effects to the shifts in land tenure with respect to livestock production strategies for pastoralists who reside on the borders of protected areas. Some of the effects explored in this chapter include changes in social capital, increased fences, and private wildlife conservancies.

With increasing numbers of <b>livestock,</b> the <b>managers</b> and users of the park are apprehensive about {{degradation of}} the grazing land. However, owing to weak infrastructure for scientific and statistical data collection and sociopolitical restrictions in the region, a lack of quality ground-based weather, vegetation, and livestock statistical data had prevented scientific assessment.

Additionally, the possibility of land degradation in heavily-grazed rangeland was indicated via a multiple regression analysis at a decadal timescale, whereas weather conditions, such as rainfall and snow cover, primarily explained year-by-year differences in grass production.

40|$|In Ethiopia, {{intensification}} of agricultural production {{is the primary}} focus of the government’s poverty reduction strategy. Livestock constitute an invaluable resource providing essential goods and services to small-scale poor farmers and their families and communities. Production of high valued livestock products provides a route out of poverty especially where growing urban demand fuels the markets. Water security is a requisite input for livestock production and its resultant contribution to poverty reduction. Typically, one tropical livestock unit (TLU = 250 kg live weight) requires less than 50 litres/day derived from drinking water and moisture in animal feeds. Assuming annual rainfall of 500 to 1000 mm and a stocking rate of one TLU/ha, the drinking water required by livestock is less than 0. 2 % of the intercepted precipitation. While sufficient high quality water is essential to sustaining livestock production, direct water intake is only of minor significance in terms of livestock water budgets in farming systems and watersheds where the water required for feed production can be up to 5000 litres/TLU per day or 100 times the amount directly consumed. Water productivity of livestock may be high or low depending on the context within which livestock production is evaluated. Livestock produced solely with irrigated forage and grain crops may be very inefficient in terms of water consumed for food produced. However, ‘cut-and-carry’ and grazing production relying on consumption of crop residues and tree fodder can be very efficient since the water used for plant production would have been used with or without livestock feeding on it. The stover or feed is simply a by-product of growing crops and does not require additional water for its production. Livestock also provide rural farmers with additional value in terms of consumable and marketable outputs without incurring significant demand for water. Understanding and managing water productivity of livestock presents opportunities to contribute to poverty reduction. Water productivity varies according to the geographic scale being considered and depends largely on the degree to which water is depleted or available to other users or ecosystem services. Livestock have a profound impact on downstream water resources. In urban and peri-urban areas, livestock production may be an ideal agricultural practice in terms of water productivity if downstream contamination can be avoided. Increasing demand for livestock products implies increased future demand for water that can be expected to rival the water requirements for production of all other food products consumed by the urban population. In many cases, livestock management practices jeopardise water quality, human health and aggravate water mediated land degradation. Research is needed to develop practical strategies to enable poor people in rural, peri-urban and urban areas to better manage livestock so that they can realise poverty reducing benefits and minimise harmful effects on themselves and others. An utmost need exists for community based natural resources management, a critical issue of interest to water and <b>livestock</b> <b>managers.</b> Given the paucity of literature on livestock–water interactions, key areas for future research are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bromus Tectorum is an {{invasive}} {{plant species}} known to reduce abundance of native perennial grasses, increase fire frequency and intensity, decrease animal performance, and alter microbial communities and ecosystem processes.

This research uses dynamic programming in conjunction with a process based ecological model to solve for optimal management strategies of Bromus invasion. The model represents biological responses to different management strategies given exogenous land, animal, and weather characteristics. The model is solved for both finite and infinite time horizons. This research tests the hypotheses that it is not always optimal to manage Bromus invasions, but more realistically, invasions should only be managed in specific instances.
