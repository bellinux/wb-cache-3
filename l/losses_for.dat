McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions.

5|$|FBS {{teams are}} allowed to {{schedule}} FCS teams, and one win against an FCS team can be counted towards their bowl-eligible status provided the FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements. FCS teams are often paid upwards of USD $500,000 for participating in games against FBS teams.

40|$|We {{analyze and}} compare the {{well-known}} Gradient Descent algorithm and the more recent Exponentiated Gradient algorithm for training a single neuron with an arbitrary transfer function. Both algorithms are easily generalized to larger neural networks, and the generalization of Gradient Descent is the standard back-propagation algorithm. In this paper we prove worst-case <b>loss</b> bounds <b>for</b> both algorithms in the single neuron case. Since local minima {{make it difficult to}} prove worst-case bounds for gradientbased algorithms, we must use a loss function that prevents the formation of spurious local minima. We define such a matching <b>loss</b> function <b>for</b> any strictly increasing differentiable transfer function and prove worst-case <b>loss</b> bounds <b>for</b> any such transfer function and its corresponding matching <b>loss.</b> <b>For</b> example, the matching <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> the identity function is the square loss and the matching <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> the logistic transfer function is the entropic loss.
