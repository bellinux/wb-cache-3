He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo!

North Korea has been suspected of maintaining a clandestine nuclear weapons development program since the early 1980s, when it constructed a plutonium-producing Magnox nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Various diplomatic means have been used by the international community to attempt to limit North Korea's nuclear program to peaceful power generation and to encourage North Korea to participate in international treaties. During the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, which was held in the DPRK in 1989, South Korean activist and [...] "Flower of Reunification" [...] Lim Su-kyung implied that the DPRK should not seek nuclear weapons, saying: [...] "The slogan 'Let us build a new world free from nuclear weapons!' will not be materialized by words alone. I'd like you to resolutely struggle against the anti-reunification forces, and give us support and encouragement.

2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face the fact we <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
