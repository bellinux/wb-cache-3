25|$|G-funk, {{given its}} name by Laylaw from Lawhouse Production, became {{a very popular}} genre of hip hop in the 1990s. Although G-funk {{originated}} in Los Angeles, the subgenre drew {{a large amount of}} influence from the earlier Bay Area-based sound known as Mobb music of the mid- to late 1980s, pioneered by Oakland rappers <b>like</b> <b>Too</b> Short & E-40. Too Short had experimented with looping sounds from classic P-Funk records over bass-heavy tracks during this period. However, unlike Bay Area Mobb music, Southern California-born G-funk used more portamento synthesizers and less live instrumentation. Too Short's lazy, drawl-heavy delivery was also a major influence on later G-funk rappers like Snoop Dogg.|$|E
25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems <b>like</b> <b>too</b> good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} he ever felt averse to any {{material}} in the film due to perceived offence, Morris said that the crew's attitude was [...] "let’s shoot everything, push it, and then if it feels <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much when we’re watching it, we can always pull {{it back in the}} editing room".|$|E

6000|$|At this he fairly laughed. [...] "You {{go to the}} point!" [...] She just {{coloured}} to have amused him so, but {{he quickly}} went on: [...] "I think one has a little natural nervousness at being carried off one's feet. I'm afraid I've always <b>liked</b> <b>too</b> much to see where I'm going." ...|$|R
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the {{challenge}} to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, [...] "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you {{need a lot of}} straight men... Let's not give them too much Jack. It's <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much dessert or {{too much of a good}} thing." [...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Poker Face" [...] was {{inspired}} by Gaga's boyfriends who enjoyed gambling, and also dealt with her personal experience of bisexuality; her fantasies about women while having sex with men, thus representing her 'poker face'." [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys" [...] {{was inspired}} by the similarly titled Mötley Crüe song [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". Gaga explained that she wanted a female version of the song that rockers would <b>like</b> <b>too.</b> [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" [...] summed up her time of self-discovery, living in the Lower East Side and dabbling in drugs and the party scene. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] was about breaking up with a boyfriend and finding someone new. [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] {{was inspired by}} the British rock band Queen and, according to Gaga, is the most vulnerable song on the album.|$|E
500|$|Hill did {{not regard}} sport {{climbing}} {{to be real}} climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 {{and went back to}} traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, [...] "the thing I didn't <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something that I wanted to do as a full-time profession". In her autobiography, she also comments on the [...] "bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.|$|E

500|$|After the game, Watt {{was quoted}} as saying [...] " [...] McGee doesn't look <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much," [...] as he had only scored once in the first game. McGee scored four goals {{in the first half of}} the second match and 10 in the second half, leading Ottawa to a 23–2 score; his 14 goals remains a record for a single game of major senior hockey. Eight of those 14 goals were scored {{consecutively}} in a span of less than nine minutes. Despite this high score, the newspapers claimed that Albert Forrest, the Dawson City goalie, had played a [...] "really fine game", otherwise the score [...] "might have been doubled". Ottawa celebrated by hosting Dawson at a banquet. After this, the players took the Cup and attempted to drop-kick it over the Rideau Canal. The stunt was unsuccessful, as the Cup landed on the frozen ice and had to be retrieved the next day.|$|E
500|$|Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch {{rated the}} main event 4¼ of 5, while he rated the X Division Championship match a 3½ [...] out of 5. He gave the lowest ranking to the AMW versus 3Live Kru bout, at ½ of a star, while his highest went to main event. Keller {{described}} {{the main event}} as an [...] "absolutely crazy match, but they managed {{to create a sense}} of order and consequence from the chaos and big spots". Keller thought that X Division Championship bout had [...] "a lot of good moves and felt exciting", but when it was over [...] "it felt <b>like</b> <b>too</b> many spots and not enough story". Keller spoke of Samoa Joe's debut as a [...] "great squash", which showed [...] "what sets him [...] apart."

500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much. I like to say that {{we have a lot of}} tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E

500|$|A {{columnist}} {{from the}} British newspaper New! described [...] "Bye Bye" [...] as their [...] "favorite track" [...] and wrote, [...] "the delicious 'Bye Bye' {{is a classic}} slushy Mariah ballad, with a swoonsome chorus." [...] Jonathan Reyes from Rap-Up felt the track would get listeners [...] "teary eyed", and due to it being a [...] "song everyone can relate too", assure it would become Carey's next number-one single. While ABC News writer, Steve Jones, described how [...] "Bye Bye" [...] packed the bum with [...] "an emotional wallop", The Washington Posts Freedom De Luc compared it heavily to [...] "Don't Forget About Us", Carey's 2005 single. De Luc wrote how both shared similar piano instrumentation, however different lyrical settings; [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] finds Carey playing a [...] "broken-hearted lover", while [...] "Bye Bye" [...] an [...] "inspirational song that comes with {{its own set of}} suggested demographics and instructions." [...] Some reviewers felt the song was a sub-par effort from an artist of Carey's stature, with many describing it as unoriginal and not a good follow-up single to [...] "Touch My Body". Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watsman felt [...] "Bye Bye" [...] was an [...] "odd choice" [...] for a second single, and called it [...] "somber edgy". Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as a [...] "shmaltzy ballad", while an anonymous VH1 critic wrote [...] "with the “We Belong Together” sonic template and lyrics tailored appeal to everyone on such a basic level seems <b>like</b> <b>too</b> easy of a combination for someone as established as Mimi. This one’s like insurance – in case nothing else is a hit, here’s a sure-shot. But ultimately, {{it turns out that the}} album is too good for that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Oregon" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television commentators, who praised its storylines. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a good review. He {{claimed that the}} episode [...] "felt like {{a bit of a}} stand-alone story focusing on Britten's heightened anxiety over Rex's grief", and that the episode also [...] "stepped in and launched the series forward, introducing one of Britten's worlds to a rather apropos serial killer". He also liked the episode's [...] "ambition". Fowler concluded his review by giving the episode an [...] "8.5 out of 10", classifying it as [...] "great". Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic also praised the episode. He claimed that the Britten family will not move to Oregon in the [...] "red reality", as it is [...] "already complex enough as it is". McHatton concluded his review by giving the episode a score of [...] "4.8 out of 5". Caroline Preece from Den of Geek gave praise in the episode. She claimed that the episode was the [...] "strongest outing" [...] since [...] "Pilot" [...] broadcast on March 1, 2012. Preece wrote that the episode [...] "used interesting story ideas, [...] the writers have bigger plans for the weeks ahead". HitFix's Alan Sepinwall gave many notes on the episode. He claimed that NBC's decision to change the broadcasting order was [...] "probably for the best, in that doing back-to-back episodes where Britten's son was kidnapped in the first and Britten attracted the personal interest of a serial killer in the second would have felt <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much". He criticized parts of the episode writing that the episode [...] "seemed too much like a conventional cop show". Screen Rant's Kevin Yeoman said that the episode [...] "works best when its procedural elements take on a sort of background essence". He also wrote that as a series it is [...] "becoming a sustainable program". Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club enjoyed [...] "Oregon". In his [...] "B" [...] review, he stated that he enjoyed the [...] "impressionistic approach, scenes of emotional connection and growth".|$|E
500|$|In 2013's Gangster Squad, a crime thriller, Gosling portrayed Sgt. Jerry Wooters, a 1940s LAPD {{officer who}} {{attempts}} to outsmart mob boss Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn). He was reunited with Emma Stone as his love interest, after their earlier pairing in Crazy, Stupid Love. Stone {{has said she}} hopes they will find more projects to work together on. A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film {{as an excuse for}} the cast [...] "to earn some money trying out funny voices and suppressing whatever sense of nuance they might possess." [...] Christy Lemire of the Boston Globe criticized Gosling's [...] "weird, whispery voice" [...] and his [...] "barely developed, one-note" [...] character. However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that there was [...] "a seductive power" [...] in the scenes shared by Gosling and Stone: [...] "But <b>like</b> <b>too</b> much else in the film, it's a scenario that is only half played out." [...] In The Place Beyond the Pines, a generational drama directed by Blue Valentines Derek Cianfrance, Gosling portrayed Luke, a motorcycle stunt rider who robs banks to provide for his family. The shoot was described by Gosling as [...] "the best experience I have ever had making a film." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times praised the performance: [...] "Mr. Gosling’s cool self-possession— the only thing he was allowed to display in “Drive”— is complicated, made interesting, by hints of childlike innocence and vulnerability." [...] Scott Foundas of The Village Voice was unimpressed: [...] "Gosling's character verges on parody ... Gosling uses a soft, wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on ... It's a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refn's existential Hollywood thriller, Drive, where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker remarked that he [...] "reprises his inexorable-loner routine". The film has grossed $35 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club stated [...] "Told sometimes feels <b>like</b> <b>too</b> {{much of a}} good thing; at 18 furious tracks, it’s overwhelming in the best sense.
