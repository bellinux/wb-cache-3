Baldwin’s experiments with perspective, time handling, and revealing reflect his interest in style as exposé of harmful delusions. His treatment of point of view functions to analyze culture myths about sexuality that justify violent rape of Black women and castration and <b>live</b> <b>burning</b> of Black men. Validated as ethical norm, these myths serve as the altar on which the community sacrifices its capacity for self-examination. They supply the energy that keeps in motion cycles of barbarity against which the perpetrators claim, ironically, to be defending their enlightened selves. Inevitable, therefore, is the tragic undermining of individuals’humanity andwarping of the social character. James Baldwin’s (1998 b) “Going to Meet the Man, ” the title story of his 1965 collection, is sustained by an impassioned poli-tics. The narrative dramatizes racism as symptomatic of an inner disorder that reveals itself through the protagonist’s sexual dys-function, itself the malady of a defective mind. The story, filtered through Jesse’s consciousness, communicates the perverted sense of reality that is a condition of what Baldwin called the “guilty imagination. ” Plotted here is the insidious and self-destructive working of guilt and repression on the mind, agency for the crip...|$|E

40|$|Wildfire {{spread in}} living vegetation, such as {{chaparral}} in southern California, often causes significant damage to infrastructure and ecosystems. The effects of physical characteristics of fuels and fuel beds on <b>live</b> fuel <b>burning</b> and whether <b>live</b> fuels differ fundamentally from dead woody fuels in their burning characteristics {{are not well}} understood. Toward this end, three common chaparral fuels prevalent in southern California, chamise, manzanita, and ceanothus, were investigated by burning them in a cylindrical container. The observed fire behavior included mass loss rate, flame height, and temperature structure above the burning fuel bed. By using successive images of the temperature field, a recently developed thermal particle image velocity (TPIV) algorithm was applied to estimate flow velocities {{in the vicinity of}} the flame. A linear regression fit was used to explain the observed time difference between when maximum flame height and maximum mass loss rate occur, as a function of fuel moisture content. Two different methods were used to extract power laws for flame heights of live and dead fuels. It was observed that the parameters defined in the well-known two-fifths power law for flame height as a function of heat release rate were inadequate for live fuels. As the moisture content increases, the heat release rate in the power law needs to be calculated at the time when the maximum flame height is achieved, as opposed to the maximum mass loss rate. Dimensionless parameters were used to express local temperature and velocity structure of live and dead chaparral fuels in the form of a Gaussian profile over different regimes in a fire plume...|$|R

50|$|In contrast, {{a typical}} O'Bannon zombie simply cannot be {{deactivated}} short of complete destruction. Any severed body parts will still remain animate, resulting {{in two or}} more moving parts. Therefore, decapitation produces both an animate head and an animate body wandering around still trying to catch a living human. There are only two known ways to permanently kill a zombie. One is completely burning the body (as seen in the cremation scene from Return of the <b>Living</b> Dead), though <b>burning</b> the body releases Trioxin-laced smoke into the air, which can combine with clouds to create Trioxin-laced rain. Another way is electrocuting the undead until they cease to move or squirm (see Return of the Living Dead Part II). In the third film scientists invented an endothermic chemical dart that freezes the brain, incapacitating the zombie, but its effective duration is wildly unpredictable. This zombie endurance is nevertheless contradicted in both {{the fourth and fifth}} films in the series, where the zombies are easily destroyed by attack, including attacks that do not damage the brain.

After learning that his wife Angélica was briefly held and questioned by the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (National Intelligence Directorate, a secret police agency established by the dictatorship), Dorfman started fearing for the safety of his family and decided to escape Chile. He formally sought right of asylum at the embassy of Argentina. Dorfman felt that Chile's new leader, Augusto Pinochet, was punishing the Chilean people for daring to dream of an alternative way of life, an alternative to the life predetermined for them since the time before their birth. Dorfman was transported to Argentina, where he had been born back in 1942. His novel Hard Rain had already been published and won awards. Dorfman's new literary fame helped him secure a passport from Argentina. He used the passport to migrate to France, well away from Latin America.|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of thc details of nucleosynthesis in stars remains a great challenge. Though the basic mechanisms governing the processes {{have been known}} since the pioneering work of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle (l), we are now evolving into a condition where we can ask more specific questions. Of particular interest are {{the dynamics of the}} s ('slow') process. In this process the general condition is one in which sequential neutron captures occur at time scales long compared with the beta decay half lives of the capturing nuclides. The nucleosynthesis period for C or Ne burning stellar shells is believed to be in the year to few year time frame (2). This means that radionuclides with similar half <b>lives</b> to this <b>burning</b> period serve as 'branch point' nuclides. That is, there will be a competition between a capture to the next heavier isotope and a beta decay to the element of nexl higher atomic number. By understanding the abundances of these competing reactions we can learn about the dynamics of the nucleosynthesis process in the stellar medium. Crucial to this understanding {{is that we have a}} knowledge of the underlying neutron reaction cross sections on these unstable nuclides in the relevant stellar energy regions (neutrons of 0. 1 - 100 KeV). Tm (1. 9 years) and ls'Sm (90 ycws) have decay properties that permit their handling in an open fume hood. These Iwo were therefore selected to be the first radionuclides for neutron capture study in what will be an ongoing effort...|$|R
6000|$|I {{intentionally}} omit cases {{which are}} vaguely analogous {{to that of}} the Hirpi. In Icelandic sagas, in the Relations of the old Jesuit missionaries, in the Travels of Pallas and Gmelin, we hear of medicine- men and Berserks who take liberties with red-hot metal, <b>live</b> coals, and <b>burning</b> wood. Thus in the Icelandic Flatey Book (vol. i. p. 425) we read about the fighting evangelist of Iceland, a story of Thangbrandr and the foreign Berserkir. 'The Berserkir said: [...] "I can walk through the burning fire with my bare feet." [...] Then a great fire was made, which Thangbrandr hallowed, and the Berserkir went into it without fear, and burned his feet'--the Christian spell of Thangbrandr being stronger than the heathen spell of the Berserkir.

The accused communicates before carrying the red-hot iron bar, or walking on the red-hot ploughshare. The consecrated wafer is supposed to preserve him from injury, if he be guiltless. He carries the iron for nine yards, after which his hands are sealed up in a linen cloth and examined at the end of three days. 'If he be found clear of scorch or scar, glory to God.'

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{constrain}} evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examined the luminosity functions and number ratio between AGB and red giant branch (RGB) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST). This database provides HST optical photometry together with maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories for dozens of galaxies within 4 Mpc. We select 12 galaxies characterized by predominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue RGB, and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in their color [...] magnitude diagrams. Thousands of AGB stars brighter than {{the tip of the}} RGB (TRGB) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence the Poisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the AGB/RGB ratio. We model the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. This technique allows us to set stringent constraints to the TP-AGB models of low-mass metal-poor stars (with M< 1. 5 Msun, [Fe/H]<~- 1. 0). Indeed, those which satisfactorily reproduce the observed AGB/RGB ratios have TP-AGB lifetimes between 1. 2 and 1. 8 Myr, and finish their nuclear <b>burning</b> <b>lives</b> with masses between 0. 51 and 0. 55 Msun. This is also in good agreement with recent observations of white dwarf masses in the M 4 old globular cluster. These constraints can be added to those already derived from Magellanic Cloud star clusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating AGB evolutionary models.
