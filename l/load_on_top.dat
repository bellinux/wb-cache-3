50|$|Even with <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> {{there is}} still some oil in the {{discharged}} water from the slop tank. Starting in the 1970s, equipment capable of using crude oil itself for washing began to replace the water-based washing, leading to the current technique of crude oil washing. This reduces the remaining deliberate discharge of oil-contaminated water and increases the amount of cargo discharged, providing a further benefit to the cargo owner.|$|E
50|$|The {{discharges}} from seawater washing {{were still}} considered {{a problem and}} during the 1960s the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> approach began to be adopted. The mixture of cleaning water and residue was pumped into a slop tank and allowed to separate by their different densities into oil and water during the journey. The water portion was then discharged, leaving only crude oil in the slop tank. This was pumped into the main tanks and the new cargo loaded on top of it, recovering as much as 800 tons of oil which was formerly discarded.|$|E

In {{order to}} study {{influences}} of applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile <b>top</b> <b>on</b> the negative skin friction behaviors of piles, field investigations of negative skin friction behaviors of three identical piles with different <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> pile <b>top</b> {{are made in}} the same site.

Additional settlement of pile induced by negative skin friction becomes larger, negative skin friction induced by the settlement of soil surrounding the pile becomes smaller with the increase of <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile <b>top.</b> Dragload induced by negative skin friction decreases and position of neutral point in pile moves up while applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile <b>top</b> increases. While there is no applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile <b>top,</b> additional settlement induced by negative skin friction is minimum, dragload induced by negative skin friction is maximum and the neutral point is the farthest from the top of piles.

50|$|Crude oil washing (COW) is {{washing out}} the residue from the tanks {{of an oil}} tanker using the crude oil cargo itself, after the cargo tanks have been emptied. Crude oil is pumped back and {{preheated}} in the slop tanks, then sprayed back via high pressure nozzles in the cargo tanks onto {{the walls of the}} tank. Due to the sticky nature of the crude oil, the oil clings to the tank walls, and such oil adds to the cargo 'remaining on board' (the ROB). By COWing the tanks, the amount of ROB is significantly reduced, and with the current high cost of oil, the financial savings are significant, both for the Charterer and the Shipowner. If the cargo ROB is deemed as 'liquid and pumpable' then the charterers can claim from the owner for any cargo loss for normally between 0.3% up to 0.5%. It replaced the <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> and seawater washing systems, both of which involved discharging oil-contaminated water into the sea. MARPOL 73/78 made this mandatory equipment for oil tankers of 20,000 tons or greater deadweight.|$|E

An experimental study is carried out on a Tee-section reinforced concrete beam subject to the action of a moving model vehicle. Vertical accelerations and displacements are measured while the vehicle crosses the bridge. Nonlinearities are detected by examining the changes in the instantaneous frequency when the vehicular loads are at different locations along the beam. Results demonstrated that the large changes in the vibration behavior due to the damage could be amplified by the presence of vehicular <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the beam.

A stochastic force identification algorithm is proposed in which the statistics of the moving interaction forces can be accurately identified from a set of samples of the random responses of the bridge deck. Numerical simulations are conducted in which the Gaussian assumption for the road surface roughness, the response statistics calculation and the stochastic force identification technique for the proposed bridge-vehicle interaction model are verified. Both the effect of the number of samples used and the effect of different road surface profiles on the accuracy of the proposed stochastic force identification algorithm are investigated.

The work {{is based on}} several years experience on aqueous tape-casting applied to the shaping of YSZ-based SOFC: however, water-based tape casting of BCY 10 appeared to be impracticable for reasons associated with the high basicity of this material that results in rapid hydrolysis when in contact with water.

40|$|Conduits {{buried in}} narrow {{trenches}} {{and covered with}} granular soil backfills are commonly used for several services. Because of soil arching action, a significant fraction of self-weight of the backfill is transferred to the wall. The <b>load</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the conduit is expressed as Cd Î³ B 2 where Î³ is the unit weight of granular backfill, B is the trench width, and Cd is the load coefficient, which increases with depth. Values of Cd for ditch conduits covered with granular backfills have been presented in the literature. Recent {{research has shown that}} providing a layer of geosynthetic above the conduit, anchored at both the walls, can reduce the overburden load transferred to the conduit. This paper is aimed at formulating a theoretical framework for computing the load coefficient CdR for ditch conduits covered with geosynthetic-reinforced granular backfills. The new CdR -value takes into account the load reduction attributable to soil arching as well as geosynthetic arching but ignores the soil-geosynthetic frictional/adhesion interaction in the analysis for simplicityâ€™s sake. It is shown that the CdR -values depend on the stiffness of the geosynthetic layer and the rut depth, among other factors that govern the unreinforced case.

However, the correlative research work on pile groups settlement methods is not deep enough {{and needs to}} be continued. Based on the shear displacement method, considering the reinforcing and restraining effect, the settlements of the analyzing pile caused by loads on the pile top were calculated, including the reduction effect caused by the existence of the other adjacent piles. And the additional settlements of the adjacent piles arising from the settlement of the loaded pile were obtained as well. Thus a simplified formula of interaction coefficients between any two piles was presented.

Lastly, the formula was extended to the settlements calculation of high and low cap pile groups. Different methods were compared with two engineering cases.
