500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't {{let me go}} / Make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|In early 1954, Chess Records issued [...] "I'm Your Hoochie Cooche Man" [...] {{backed with}} [...] "She's So Pretty" [...] {{on both the}} {{standard}} ten-inch 78rpm and the newer seven-inch 45rpm record single formats. [...] It soon became the biggest hit of Waters' career. [...] The single entered Billboard magazine's Rhythm & Blues Records charts on March 13, 1954, and reached number three on the Juke Box chart and number eight on the Best Seller chart. [...] It remained on the charts for 13 weeks, making it Waters' longest charting record {{up to that time}} (two more Waters-Dixon songs, [...] "Just Make <b>Love</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> (I Just Want to Make Love to You") and [...] "Close to You", both later also lasted 13 weeks).|$|E
500|$|Murray {{struggled}} with her sexual and gender identity {{through much of}} her life. Her marriage as a teenager ended almost immediately {{with the realization that}} [...] "when men try to make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> something in me fights". Although acknowledging the term [...] "homosexual" [...] in describing others, Murray preferred to describe herself as having an [...] "inverted sex instinct" [...] that caused her to behave as a man attracted to women would. She wanted a [...] "monogamous married life", but one in which she was the man. The majority of her relationships were with women whom she described as [...] "extremely feminine and heterosexual". In her younger years, Murray often was devastated by the end of these relationships, to the extent that she was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment twice, in 1937 and in 1940.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Hughes, in a {{short story}} {{published}} in 1864, described a fictional game of Forfeits involving the song: A cry for forfeits arose. So the party sat down round Mabel on benches brought {{out from under the}} table, and Mabel began, --The first day of Christmas my true <b>love</b> sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a partridge and a pear-tree;The second day of Christmas my true <b>love</b> sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The third day of Christmas my true <b>love</b> sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fourth day of Christmas my true <b>love</b> sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> four ducks quacking, three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree; The fifth day of Christmas my true <b>love</b> sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> five hares running, four ducks quacking, three fat hens, two turtle-doves, a partridge, and a pear-tree.And so on. Each day was taken up and repeated all round; and for every breakdown (except by little Maggie, who struggled with desperately earnest round eyes to follow the rest correctly, but with very comical results), the player who made the slip was duly noted down by Mabel for a forfeit.|$|R

2500|$|Elvis was a keen karate {{student and}} persuaded Priscilla {{to take it}} up. Priscilla {{thought it was a}} good idea, as it would pass the time she spent alone if she had a hobby on which to concentrate, and she was also keen to share in Elvis' interests. Following {{suggestions}} from Elvis, Priscilla began taking lessons from Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1972 backstage at one of Elvis' concerts. She soon began an affair with him. Priscilla states in her book, [...] "My relationship with Mike had now developed into an affair. I still loved Elvis greatly, but over the next few months I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny." [...] She later states [...] "Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness." [...] A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite. It was then that she writes in her book that Elvis [...] "forcefully made <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> 'This is how a real man makes love to his woman.'" ...|$|E
