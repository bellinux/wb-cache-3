5|$|A <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> {{across the}} Yangtze River was {{originally}} envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in The International Development of China, in 1919. He stated that a dam capable of generating 30million horsepower (22GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges. In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on {{plans in the}} Three Gorges. In 1939, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. A design, the Otani plan, was completed for the dam {{in anticipation of a}} Japanese victory over China.|$|E
5|$|To date, one <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> {{has been}} {{partially}} constructed on the Great Zab: Iraq's Bekhme Dam and Turkey's 24 MW weir-controlled run-of-the-river Bağışlı Hydroelectric Power Plant. Five {{others have been}} planned in the Great Zab basin by both Turkey and Iraq. Turkey's State Hydraulic Works plans to construct the Çukurca and Doğanlı Dams near Çukurca and the Hakkâri Dam {{near the city of}} Hakkâri. The Hakkâri Dam with a 245 MW power station is in final design and the Çukurca and Doğanlı Dams will support 245 MW and 462 MW power stations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E

40|$|The current acute {{needs for}} {{improved}} water resources and energy {{management in the}} contemporary development of Africa has renewed the interest in <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> in recent times, especially in the energy sector, because of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), concern about climate change, the variability in crude oil prices and alternative sources of funding for <b>large</b> <b>dams.</b> So, the rethink about <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> as an energy source {{in the face of}} fluctuations in the cost of crude oil and climate change is also based on finding cheaper and renewable sources of electricity. However, the renewable credentials of <b>large</b> <b>dams,</b> and their compatibility with sustainable development, are disputed. Using the Akosombo dam and the Bui dam project – both in Ghana – as case studies, this paper analyses the potential and significance of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> within the ambit of Africa’s contemporary development. The paper argues that despite criticisms of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> and the promotion of alternatives, <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> are still very important to Africa’s development as they are technologies with well known positive and negative socio-economic and environmental impacts which could be mitigated. The alternatives to <b>large</b> <b>dams,</b> in contrast, have relatively unknown long-term socio-economic and environmental impacts. In addition, there is scepticism among local people and other stakeholders about the alternatives to <b>large</b> hydropower <b>dams</b> because of the impression that some western-backed non-governmental organisations (NGOs), some northern countries, and some multilateral and bilateral institutions are intentionally seeking to undermine significant development in Ghana and other African countries...|$|R

5|$|The {{demand for}} {{irrigation}} {{water in the}} Sacramento area {{and other parts of}} the Central Valley were also growing. In 1854, a diversion dam was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into ditches that supplied downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because the seasonal nature of the American River caused floods in some years and droughts in others. A <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> at the Auburn site was thus considered for both flood control and water supply. In the 1950s, the Bureau of Reclamation created the first plans for a high dam at Auburn. Several designs, ranging from earth-fill to concrete gravity dams, were considered. Before the dam could be built, the Auburn-Foresthill Road – which crosses the river just upstream of the dam site – had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, contracts were let for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir, as well as preliminary excavations at the dam site.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{conditions}} {{occurred in}} parts of the other eastern islands. Along the southern shore of Sal, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in Santa Maria. Pier restoration was incomplete as of May2017, about 2.5years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in Palmeira, and caused minor structural damage to Sal International Airport. At the height of the hurricane, flooding forced nearly 130people living in the impoverished outskirts of Terra Boa and Espargos to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80percent of the Loggerhead sea turtle nests on the beaches of Sal, a crucial nesting site for this species. Overall, Sal suffered CVE$30million ($300,000) in damage from the hurricane. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of Santiago and Fogo, peaking at 13in (330mm) over the mountains of Santiago and causing widespread damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In São Miguel, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Conversely, the rains replenished water reserves and filled a <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> in São Salvador do Mundo to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands. Structural damage across Santiago, largely in flooded urban areas, reached CVE$87million ($860,000).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we apply}} Fourier Spectral Element Method (SEM) to the dynamic {{analysis}} of <b>large</b> <b>dams,</b> {{and take advantage}} of its high numerical accuracy and exponential rate of convergence and excellent geometrical adaptability to improve the computational procedure, efficiency and results of dynamic problem of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> in numerical calculation. Based on the governing dynamic equation of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> with the boundary nonlinearity, this paper derives the Fourier spectral stiffness, mass, damping matrix and equivalent load vector in terms of discrete Fourier spectral series, so a spectral formulation of dynamic analysis of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> can be reached. For the purpose of higher numerical efficiency, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is also adopted in this paper. Although SEM has few applications in the analysis of solid structures, this paper indicates that SEM could be used in solid construction such as <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> as good as other preferable fields...|$|R

25|$|A {{culvert pipe}} under a road {{is a common}} target for beaver damming because the {{constriction}} speeds up the current and may resemble a hole in a dam. With a little work, a beaver can quickly plug a culvert with mud and sticks, and turn the entire roadbed into a <b>large</b> <b>dam.</b> Highway Departments often spend significant amounts {{of time and money}} repeatedly clearing beaver dams from culverts.|$|E

25|$|These beyond-regular-insurance {{costs for}} {{worst-case}} scenarios {{are not unique}} to nuclear power, as hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the Banqiao Dam disaster, where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30,000 to 200,000 people died, or <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> failures in general. As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.|$|E
25|$|A common {{distinction}} between dams and weirs is that water flows {{over the top}} (crest) of a weir or underneath it {{for at least some}} of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an overflow spillway on a <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> may therefore be referred to as a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being only a few inches in height whilst the largest may be hundreds of metres long and many metres tall. Some common weir purposes are outlined below.|$|E

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} {{literature on}} <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> {{is critical of}} their performance particularly regarding their negative impacts on society and the ecosystem. This has led to suggestions of more benign alternatives which could provide the same if not more benefits and fewer negative social and environmental stresses. Consequently, <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> are caught in an ideological contest of why, what and how development should be pursued. This thesis examines the impacts of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> to analyse some aspects of development theory {{in the context of}} the links between dam-building, sustainable development and neoliberalism/ modernisation in Africa’s socio-economic development trajectory. Using an interdisciplinary approach and multiple methods including actor-oriented research, historical research processes and case studies and a review of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> in Africa, this thesis examines and analyses the perceptions and experiences of communities resettled following the construction of the Akosombo Dam, and communities likely to be affected by the proposed Bui Dam Project in Ghana, and of other national, local and international actors and their organisations. Contextualised within contemporary African development, the thesis finds that the construction of <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> is temporally and spatially mediated by geophysical conditions and prevailing international, national and local socio-economic and political circumstances. Although some <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> built to maximise water resources use for development have realised their objectives, others have demonstrably failed, and this failure is especially acute viewed {{in the context of the}}ir additional social and environmental costs. The thesis finds that although <b>large</b> <b>dams</b> have variable outcomes, they are associated with problems of equity in benefit distribution, social and environmental costs.

25|$|The 2011 Souris River flood caused {{extensive}} damage throughout the Souris River Valley. On June 21, 2011, KXMC-TV {{reported that a}} flood of historic proportions was imminent in the Souris River Valley, largely due to <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, three feet above the previous record set back in 1881. It is estimated that 20 percent of Minot sustained damage from the flood. This figure includes over 4,100 homes which were someway affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair. The nearby town of Burlington was also severely damaged during this time.|$|E
25|$|Other {{consequences}} of the inundation include loss of farmland, loss of spawning habitat as fishes can not swim upstream anymore. The Kachin Development Networking Group, a network of civil society groups and development organisations in Kachin State warn this {{will lead to a}} loss of income for fishermen. They report locals are also worried about the flooding of cultural sites in the flood zone. As with other <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> projects, the Myitsone Dam construction will alter the hydrological characteristics of the river, e.g. preventing sediment from enriching riverbanks downstream, where it usually enriches the riverside foodproducing plains. This can affect fertility as far downstream as the Irrawaddy Delta, the major rice-producing area of Myanmar.|$|E
25|$|In a bid {{to solve}} the {{salinity}} problem, local residents proposed constructing a tidal barrage across the mouth of Suisun Bay, a project which was never realized. In 1919 a different solution {{came in the form}} of the Marshall Plan, created by Robert Marshall of the United States Geological Survey. It proposed a <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> across the Sacramento River just downstream of its confluence with the Pit River near the copper mining town of Kennett, several hundred miles to the north of the Delta. The dam would store water for release during the dry months when the Delta was most vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, with the added benefit of controlling floods in the winter. Water captured by the dam would increase the irrigation supply, for both the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley further south, with which it would be linked by an extensive aqueduct and reservoir system.|$|E

25|$|Around {{early or}} mid 252, Zhuge Dan {{pointed out to}} Sima Shi that Eastern Wu forces had been making incursions on Wei {{territory}} and had constructed a <b>large</b> <b>dam,</b> complete with exterior defences, at Dongxing (東興; southeast of present-day Chaohu, Anhui). He suggested to Sima Shi to send Wang Chang and Guanqiu Jian to lead troops to attack and destroy the dam. Later that year, Sima Shi devised a strategy for launching a three-pronged attack on Eastern Wu. He sent Wang Chang to attack Nan Commandery (南郡; present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), Guanqiu Jian to attack Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), and Hu Zun and Zhuge Dan to lead 70,000 troops to attack the Dongxing dam. In response, the Wu general Zhuge Ke led 40,000 troops to Dongxing to counter the invaders. The Battle of Dongxing concluded with a tactical victory for the Wu forces.

500|$|The {{palatial}} centers organized their {{workforce and}} resources {{for the construction of}} large scale projects in the fields of agriculture and industry. The magnitude of some projects indicates that this was the result of combined efforts from multiple palatial centers. [...] Most notable of them are the drainage system of the Kopais basin in Boeotia, the building of a <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> outside Tiryns, and the drainage of the swamp in the Nemea valley. Also noticeable is the construction of harbors, such as the harbor of Pylos, that were capable of accommodating large Bronze Age era vessels like the one found at Uluburun. The Mycenaean economy also featured large-scale manufacturing as testified by the extent of workshop complexes that have been discovered, the largest known to date being the recent ceramic and hydraulic installations found in Euonymeia, next to Athens, that produced tableware, textiles, sails, and ropes for export and shipbuilding.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{there was some}} local {{opposition}} to the project {{on the grounds that}} it was too big – with a reservoir more than twice as large as the annual flow of the Stanislaus River, it might never fill and would be a waste of federal Central Valley Project funds. There was also concern that water from New Melones II might be exported outside the Stanislaus River basin and sold elsewhere; therefore, a rider attached to the 1962 act [...] "reserved water for use within the basin with export of excess water only". Two years later, the Christmas flood of 1964 caused considerable damage along the Stanislaus River that a <b>large</b> <b>dam</b> could have prevented; Congressman John J. McFall [...] "seized the political leverage that only [...] could provide, and urged the drenched farmers to support New Melones Dam." [...] With opposition having largely turned to support, Congress approved funding in 1965, with construction starting the following year.|$|E
