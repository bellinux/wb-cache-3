40|$|Despite {{the pervasiveness}} of {{violence}} in teen relationships, civil protection order statutes largely ignore teens. The accessibility of protection orders for teens depends primarily on the scope of their rights <b>to</b> standing and <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> pursue claims for protection. Because states largely fail to detail expressly {{the circumstances under which}} teens are accorded standing to seek protection orders and <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> represent their own interests in related court proceedings, the accessibility of protection orders for teens in most states remains in flux. This article explores legal principles and policy arguments that support the extension of standing and <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> teens to seek protection orders without adult involvement where laws are ambiguous. The article concludes with an advocacy roadmap to help practitioners assess the viability of teen claims and devise strategies to enable teens to obtain protection orders under the laws of their jurisdiction...|$|R

Further historical evidence supports our hypothesis that higher taxes led to better legal institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|This study's main {{objective}} is to analyze certain effects produced by the changes of the Labor Code and by the entry into force of the current Romanian Civil Code. These effects refer {{to one of the}} fundamental conditions for the valid conclusion of the individual employment contract, that is, <b>to</b> the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of employers and employees. Thus, a complete analysis of legal regulations and of the correlations between different provisions on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of parties <b>to</b> the individual employment contract is required to identify the existing noncompliance and to propose solutions. The research demonstrated that the current regulatory framework governing the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of the parties to an individual employment contract does not entirely correspond to the social reality. Therefore, only the employer benefits from a relatively comprehensive statutory regulation on the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> conclude an individual employment contract. The employee, however, does not benefit from the same attention from legislature. Considering the above, the study represents a significant scientific contribution, whose value lies in the proposed changes to modify legislature, so that the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> of job holders would benefit from fair regulation, in accordance with the principle of legal protection of employee rights...|$|R

40|$|Can one {{consent to}} sex in advance? Scholars have {{neglected}} the temporal dimension of sexual consent, and this theoretical gap has significant practical implications. With {{the aging of}} the population, more and more people will be living for extended periods of time with cognitive impairments that deprive them of the <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> consent to sex. However, they may still manifest sexual desire, so consenting prospectively to sex in this context serves several purposes. These include protecting long-term sexual partners from prosecution by the state, ensuring sexually fulfilled lives for their future disabled selves, or preserving important sexual identities or relationships. The law currently provides a device for prospective decision-making in the face of incapacity: the advance directive. The central claim of this Article is that the law should recognize sexual advance directives. In other words, people facing both chronic conditions that threaten their <b>legal</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> make decisions and institutional care that threatens sexual self-determination should be able to consent prospectively to sex or empower an agent to make decisions about sex on their behalf. To justify this claim, the Article introduces a novel theory of sexual consent—the consensus of consents—that diffuses the longstanding philosophical debates over whether advance directives should be legally enforceable. With this normative foundation, the Article then draws on insights from criminal law, fiduciary law, and the law of wills to fashion a workable regime of sexual advance directives that adequately protects individuals from the risk of sexual abuse...|$|R
