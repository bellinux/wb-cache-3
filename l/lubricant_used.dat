In this study, we assess the incidence of topical <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> as a surrogate marker for underlying OSD, in medically and surgically treated glaucoma patients. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed for newly diagnosed glaucoma patients who were started on topical medications in 2007 and followed up over a 5 -year period. Primary outcome measure was the incidence of topical <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> in these patients and a subset of these patients who required glaucoma or cataract surgery during follow-up. Results: Charts of 505 newly diagnosed glaucoma patients with no prior history of ocular <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> were analyzed. Mean age was 63. 9 years (SD 11. 1), 42. 8 % were women. One hundred one (20. 0 %) patients underwent phacoemulsification surgery, 80 underwent mitomycin C (MMC) augmented phacotrabeculectomy, 16 underwent MMC-augmented trabeculectomy and 3 underwent tube surgery {{during the course of}} follow-up as their only type of surgery. Five-year incidence of <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> was 59 % in all glaucoma subjects; 54. 1 % of patients were on medical treatment and 74. 0 % of patients who underwent phacotrabeculectomy or trabeculectomy were started on lubricants, respectively (P= 0. 0011); 60. 4 % of glaucoma subjects who underwent phacoemulsification surgery were started on lubricants. Incidence of <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> increased from 17. 7 % preoperatively to 74. 0 % postoperatively in subjects who required trabeculectomy or phacotrabeculectomy. Incidence of <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> was similar in patients on one or multiple glaucoma medications, with the mean onset of <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> being 10 months after starting glaucoma medication in both groups. Females were more likely to use artificial tears compared with males (P= 0. 002). Conclusion: Both medical and surgical management of glaucoma have an adverse effect on the ocular surface. Chronic use of glaucoma medications was associated with a high incidence of ocular <b>lubricant</b> <b>use.</b> MMC-augmented trabeculectomy was associated with an even higher incidence of ocular <b>lubricant</b> <b>use.</b> Keywords: glaucoma, medications, trabeculectomy, ocular surface disease, ocular lubricant...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{diversity}} in self-identified lesbian and bisexual women's sexual interactions necessitates {{better understanding of}} how and when they integrate personal lubricant into different experiences. However, little is known about lesbian and bisexual women's lifetime <b>lubricant</b> <b>use,</b> particularly at the population level. Aims The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the prevalence and characteristics of <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> among adult lesbian and bisexual women in the United States. Methods Data were drawn from a subset of lesbian and bisexual participants who participated in the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, an online questionnaire administered to a nationally representative probability sample of U. S. adults ages 18 and older. Main Outcome Measures We examined socio-demographic characteristics, recent and lifetime <b>lubricant</b> <b>use,</b> <b>lubricant</b> <b>use</b> in associated with specific sexual behaviors and condom use, frequency of use, motivations for use, as well as perception of <b>lubricant</b> when <b>used.</b> Results A majority of lesbian- (60. 1 %) and bisexual-identified (77. 1 %) women reported ever using lubricant; 25. 7 % of lesbian women and 32. 7 % of bisexual women used it in the last 30 days. Across most age groups, <b>lubricant</b> was commonly <b>used</b> during partnered sexual play, partnered sexual intercourse, or when a vibrator/dildo was used. Lesbian and bisexual women reported <b>using</b> <b>lubricants</b> to increase arousal/sexual pleasure/desire, to make sex more fun, or to increase physical comfort during sex. Conclusions <b>Lubricant</b> <b>use</b> is identified as a part of lesbian and bisexual women's sexual experience across the life span, as a part of both solo and partnered experiences. As part of evolving sexual health assessments, clinicians and health educators may find value in integrating lubricant-focused conversation with their lesbian and bisexual patients and clients, particularly...|$|R

50|$|Motor oil is a <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> in {{internal}} combustion engines, which power cars, motorcycles, lawnmowers, engine-generators, {{and many other}} machines. In engines, there are parts which move against each other, and the friction wastes otherwise useful power by converting the kinetic energy to heat. It also wears away those parts, {{which could lead to}} lower efficiency and degradation of the engine. This increases fuel consumption, decreases power output, and can lead to engine failure.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the {{lubrication}} {{and high}} viscosity of a grease are desired {{in situations where}} non-toxic, non-oil based materials are required. Carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC, is one popular material {{used to create a}} water-based analog of greases. CMC serves to both thicken the solution and add a lubricating effect, and often silicone-based lubricants are added for additional lubrication. The most familiar example of this type of <b>lubricant,</b> <b>used</b> as a surgical and personal lubricant, is K-Y Jelly.|$|E

50|$|Silicone Plugs: These plugs {{are soft}} and malleable, {{allowing}} a relatively large plug to be inserted into the fistula. Once folded and inserted into the ear, they expand, stretching the earlobe. However, stretching with silicone is often a dangerous decision. It's not recommended to use silicone plugs to stretch, due to the tacky, porous surface. The stretched fistula can adhere to the silicone if the <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> is pushed out by {{the pressure of the}} stretch, and an airtight seal can be created, trapping infection and causing it to spread internally. Also because silicone expands and contracts in temperature change, they can swell and potentially blow out a newly stretched fistula.|$|E
50|$|After {{a year-long}} investigation, the Bureau of Reclamation {{attributed}} {{the failure to}} a design flaw: the Corps of Engineers, which designed the dam, did not consider trunnion friction (at the pin-hub interface) in the gate analyses. While this is true, {{this was one of}} five identical service gates that operated under the same circumstances for nearly 40 years without problems being observed. This suggests that the failure resulted from a condition that changed over time; specifically, there was a gradual increase in the coefficient of friction at the pin-hub interface. While one would expect maintenance frequency to increase as a gate ages, Reclamation decreased the frequency of regular maintenance and lubrication over time due to budget constraints. In addition, the <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> by Reclamation did not conform to the Corps' original design specifications; it was a new, environmentally-friendly lubricant that was not sufficiently waterproof, allowing water to enter the pin-hub interface and cause the corrosion that resulted in increased friction.|$|E

50|$|In 1954 Test Laboratory {{director}} Karl Heimburg began {{construction of}} the Static Test Stand for Redstone testing. This was still under construction when it was re-purposed for Jupiter, and finally competed in January 1957. A Jupiter was installed in the stand that month, and fired {{for the first time}} on 12 February 1957. This almost ended in disaster when a small explosion went off in the liquid oxygen (LOX) pump, and as the missile sat there the LOX boiled off and threatened to burst the tanks. The day was saved when the foreman, Paul Kennedy, ran to the missile and connected a pressure line to drain the oxygen buildup in the tank. The problem was later traced to the <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> in the pump, which tended to burst into flames in contact with LOX. A new lubricant was introduced, along with a series of changes to the test stand to help retain control in these situations.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common areas of the body {{associated}} with irritation is the vagina. Many women complain of an itch, dryness, or discharge in the perineum {{at some point in their}} lives. There are several causes of vaginal irritation including fungal vaginitis (like candida) or trichomoniasis. Often, herpes simplex infection of the mouth or genitalia can be recurrent and prove to be extremely irritating.Sometimes, the irritation can be of the chronic type and it can be so intense that it also causes painful intercourse. Aside from infections, chronic irritation of the vagina may be related to the use of contraceptives and condoms made from latex. The majority of contraceptives are made of synthetic chemicals which can induce allergies, rash and itching. Sometimes the <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> for intercourse may cause irritation.Another cause of irritation in women is post menopausal vaginitis. The decline in the female sex hormones leads to development of dryness and itching in the vagina. This is often accompanied by painful sexual intercourse. Cracks and tears often develop on outer aspects of the labia which becomes red from chronic scratching. Post menopausal vaginitis can be treated with short term use of vaginal estrogen pessary and use of a moisturizer.|$|E

50|$|A side-lever {{engine was}} a rugged and fairly easy-to-build but inefficient {{single-stage}} design for early marine steam engines, eventually replaced in ocean use with {{better and more}} efficient multiple-stage engines. Where fuel was cheap and easily obtainable, as on American rivers, the similar walking beam engine was used well into the 1890s. One of the main disadvantages of the side-lever steam engine was that it {{put a lot of}} weight high in the ship, making the ship more susceptible to capsizing in rough weather and vulnerable to naval gunfire from a warship. Like all engines, the side-lever engine required lubrication. Piston-cylinder lubrication was provided by allowing the steam to pick up a small amount of oil before being injected into the cylinder. Some type of oil cups were used on all the other moving parts. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>used</b> then was a form of whale oil, the main lubricant of the period. The maintenance schedule is unknown. She was driven by about 10 psi steam generated by two return-flue boilers that used salt water for steam and coal as her fuel. Since steamships required from 2 to 10 tons of coal per day, they were more expensive to run and had a maximum range of about 3000 mi before needing re-fueling. The coal was fed to Californias boilers by twelve firemen shoveling by hand around the clock.|$|E
