40|$|Disease control {{measures}} require poultry {{to be killed}} on farms to minimise the risk of disease being transmitted to other poultry, {{and in some cases}} to protect public health. High expansion gas-filled foam has been shown to have potential as a possible for humane emergency killing of poultry. It may also have potential for other applications where there are concerns over welfare, e. g. killing laying hens in a poultry shed at the end of lay. This project will assess the welfare implications for individual birds of application of anoxic (nitrogen filled) gas-foam. Appuratus capable of delivering gas filled foam of the correct specification will be developed and incorporated into a pilot testing appuratus. Measurement of key physiological parameters during the application of anoxic gas-foam (versus air control) will allow inferences to be drawn about time to loss of consciousness, time to non-recovery, cause of death and potential welfare insults experienced by birds during the euthansia process. The project will also include development work to scale up exisiting foam generators to delivery rates suitable for <b>large</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> with the ultimate aim of producing reliable implementation protocols. The project will be undertaken in collaboration with complementary research in The USA and the Netherlands. In brief, we will undertake one common experiment using nitrogen gas-filled foam with chickens, ducks and turkeys using common methods. This will ensure that the results are directly comparable between the major species of poultry, avoid duplication of effort and provide the basis of internationally agreed methods of humane killing of poultry, during a disease epidemic or for spent laying hens, broiler and turkey breeders at the end of lay. The findings of this project will be presented to the British poultry industry, Government officials, Animal Health, welfare NGOs and poultry veterinarians. The dissemination meeting will also cover the complementary research in the USA and the Netherlands. </p...|$|R

The population fluctuation and spatial distribution of the Alphitobius diaperinus in a <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> in Cascavel, {{in the state of}} Parana, Brazil, was studied between October, 2001 and October 2002. Larvae and adults of the lesser mealworm were sampled weekly using Arends tube traps (n = 22) for six consecutive flock grow-outs. The temperature of the litter and of the <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> was measured at the same locations of the tube traps.

Significantly greater numbers of larvae were collected than adults (1 to 20 times in 95 % of the sampling points). There was no correlation between temperature and the number of larvae and adults collected, therefore no fluctuation was observed during the sampling period. The population growth was correlated to litter re-use. The highest temperatures were observed in deep litter. The spatial distribution of larvae and adults in the <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> was heterogeneous during the whole period of evaluation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Distribution of {{inorganic}} elements {{was measured}} in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust from five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> during either winter, spring, or summer. With varied environmental condi-tions {{at the time of}} sampling, the levels of calcium, sodium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and aluminum were higher than the other elements found in dust samples from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> The most abundant element in <b>poultry</b> <b>house</b> dust was calcium. The level of this element in dust samples from the mechanically ventilated house used for research purposes corresponded closely to the level found in the feed fed at sampling time. High zinc levels in layer houses may be attributed to either the abrasive actions of feathers and feet of layers against the galvanized wire cages on the high zinc content in feathers. The ash content of dust from the five types of <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> ranged from. 31 to 3. 54 %. Air particulate counts for particles ranging in size from. 5 to 10 jum were much higher in the layer house used for commercial purposes (ranged from 34. 9 to 66. 3 X 106 /m 3) than in the layer houses used for research purposes (ranged from 5. 8 to 9. 8 X 106 /m 3). During winter, air particulate levels in the layer house used for commercial purposes were lower (34. 9 X 106 /m 3) than the level during summer (66. 3 X 106 /m 3).

40|$|Ammonia {{volatilization}} from poultry litter commonly {{causes a}} buildup of ammonia in the atmosphere of chicken houses that can {{have a negative impact}} on both farm workers and birds. The release of ammonia from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> can also contribute to environmental problems such as atmospheric haze. The most widely accepted management strategy to control ammonia volatilization from <b>poultry</b> <b>houses</b> is the use of litter amendments that are added to the litter. The poultry industry routinely uses dry acids such as aluminum sulfate and sodium bisulfate to reduce ammonia emissions inside the <b>poultry</b> <b>house.</b> Although these products are very effective in controlling ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses,</b> they typically only work for about the first three weeks of the grow-out period, after which time litter pH and ammonia levels will begin to rise. As a result, these litter amendments must be reapplied prior to the placement of new chicks in order for ammonia levels to continually remain low. Therefore this research was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative product for long-term control of ammonia release in <b>poultry</b> <b>houses.</b> This research investigated the efficacy of a single application of superabsorbent polymers to poultry litter for long term in-house ammonia control which could reduce the negative impacts of ammonia on bird health and performance and potentially the environment...|$|R
