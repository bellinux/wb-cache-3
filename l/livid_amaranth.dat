30|$|AHAS in Arabidopsis {{comprises}} of 670 {{amino acids}} while in rice it is 644 amino acids long (Sathasivan et al. 1990; [URL] At least seventeen alleles of AHAS gene, harbouring mutations in amino acids at single or multiple positions such as, 121, 122, 124, 197, 199, 205, 206, 376, 574, 653 and 654 (with respect to Arabisopsis) and conferring tolerance to imidazolinone, {{have been reported}} across crops (rice, maize, canola, sunflower and wheat) and 87 weed species including prickly lettuce, pigweed, <b>livid</b> <b>amaranth</b> and weedy rice (Shaner, 1999; Duggleby and Pang, 2000; Heap, 2016 from [URL] The occurrence of multiple alleles {{and all of them}} conferring tolerance to Imidazolinone and/or sulfonylurea treatment suggests that mutations across AHAS could render them unresponsive to these groups of herbicides. In weeds, Ala 122, Pro 197, Ala 205, Asp 376, Arg 377, Trp 574, Ser 653 and Gly 654 are the eight confirmed target sites reported across genera and countries so far ([URL] accessed on 21 Nov 2016). In weedy rice alone, three mutations, G 654 E, S 653 D and A 122 T are known (Roso et al. 2010). Among them, the change S 653 D (S 627 D in rice) is common across crops and weeds (Croughan 2002) whereas the rice Clearfield events released in USA had mutation G 654 E (G 628 E in rice) as known from the patent search (US 20070028318 A 1). Thus, the HTM rice, identified in the current study with multiple amino acid substitutions (TableÂ  4), all different from the rice Clearfield event, and is free from IPR issues.|$|E
