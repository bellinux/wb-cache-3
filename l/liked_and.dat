The {{friendly}} association brought Ashutosh to him with the script, which he <b>liked,</b> <b>and</b> thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Ashutosh, who believed that Amin was like Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> admired her.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

40|$|Children’s social {{interactions}} {{with their peers}} influence their psychosocial adjustment; consequently, the relationship between class-wide peer liking, same-gender peer <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment was explored in two age groups. Peer liking was analysed using the social relations model (SRM). In Study 1, 205 children (103 female and 102 male, Mage = 7. 15, SD = 7 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment, and teachers completed the Short-Form TRSSA. In Study 2, 197 children (98 female and 90 male, Mage = 9. 87, SD = 5. 9 months) completed measures of peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> school adjustment. Both studies yielded evidence of reciprocal <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> individual differences in the ratings of <b>liking</b> awarded to, <b>and</b> elicited from, both peer groups. Multigroup path analysis, with groups created according to gender, revealed that elements of liking predicted different aspects of school adjustment with some variation according to age and gender. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} the SRM can be used to examine peer <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> underscore the importance of children’s peers for school adjustment...|$|R

Manning, a former office manager to New York City architect Robert Robertson, finally produced a design the village <b>liked,</b> <b>and</b> it was completed and opened in 1902, at the end of the extension. Financial assistance came from some of the village's wealthier residents. Frederick W. Guiteau, a member of the society, endowed the library with $10,000 which he had apparently originally intended to bequeath to it in his will. Helen Gould, who had grown up in the nearby Lyndhurst estate as the daughter of Jay Gould, contributed the cost of the interior finishings and made Tiffany's work possible.

40|$|We {{examined}} the relations among children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence {{with a sample}} of 240 7 - to 12 -year-old children.

Significant positive correlations existed between children’s effortful control, school <b>liking,</b> <b>and</b> academic competence. Consistent with predictions, and while controlling for the effects of parents’ education and family income, school liking mediated the relation between effortful control and academic competence. Implications include a focus on proximal processes such as enhancing school <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> encouraging social relationships when designing interventions to promote academic competence...|$|R

25|$|It was the 1976 Republican Presidential {{race that}} may have {{cemented}} the tight political friendship between Laxalt and former Governor Reagan. Reagan had decided to challenge President Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination. Ford enjoyed widespread support among the GOP establishment, particularly in Washington, D.C. Reagan decided that having Laxalt serve as his national chairman would give his campaign credibility it was otherwise lacking. Although Laxalt was not well known on a national level, he was well <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> respected in the U.S. Congress, and he was similarly respected by many prominent {{members of the national}} media. Laxalt eventually acceded to Reagan's request, even though doing so severely jeopardized his relationship with the Ford White House. Laxalt campaigned all over the United States on behalf of Reagan, often campaigning by his side.|$|E
25|$|While Don Quixote is {{unconscious}} in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, {{the parish}} curate {{and the local}} barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. It is a scene of high comedy: If the books are so bad for morality, how does the priest know them well enough to describe every naughty scene? Even so, this gives an occasion for many comments on books Cervantes himself <b>liked</b> <b>and</b> disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote {{that it was the}} action of a wizard (encantador).|$|E

40|$|Current {{train of}} thought in {{appetite}} research is favouring an interest in non-homeostatic or hedonic (reward) mechanisms in relation to overconsumption and energy balance. This tendency is supported by advances in neurobiology that precede {{the emergence of a}} new conceptual approach to reward where affect <b>and</b> motivation (<b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting) can be seen as the major force in guiding human eating behaviour. In this review, current progress in applying processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting to the study of human appetite are examined by discussing the following issues: How can these concepts be operationalised for use in human research to reflect the neural mechanisms by which they may be influenced? Do <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting operate independently to produce functionally significant changes in behaviour? Can <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting be truly experimentally separated or will an expression of one inevitably contain elements of the other? The review contains a re-examination of selected human appetite research before exploring more recent methodological approaches to the study of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting in appetite control. In addition, some theoretical developments are described in four diverse models that may enhance current understanding of the role of these processes in guiding ingestive behaviour. Finally, the implications of a dual process modulation of food reward for weight gain and obesity are discussed. The review concludes that processes of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting are likely to have independent roles in characterising susceptibility to weight gain. Further research into the dissociation of <b>liking</b> <b>and</b> wanting through implicit and explicit levels of processing would help to disclose the relative importance of these components of reward for appetite control and weight regulation...|$|R
