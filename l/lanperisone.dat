40|$|Activating K-RAS {{mutations}} are {{the most}} frequent oncogenic mutations in human cancer. Numerous downstream signaling pathways {{have been shown to}} be deregulated by oncogenic K-ras. However, to date there are still no effective targeted therapies for this genetically defined subset of patients. Here we report the results of a small molecule, synthetic lethal screen using mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a mouse model harboring a conditional oncogenic K-rasG 12 D allele. Among the > 50, 000 compounds screened, we identified a class of drugs with selective activity against oncogenic K-ras–expressing cells. The most potent member of this class, <b>lanperisone,</b> acts by inducing nonapoptotic cell death in a cell cycle- and translation-independent manner. The mechanism of cell killing involves the induction of reactive oxygen species that are inefficiently scavenged in K-ras mutant cells, leading to oxidative stress and cell death. In mice, treatment with <b>lanperisone</b> suppresses the growth of K-ras–driven tumors without overt toxicity. Our findings establish the specific antitumor activity of <b>lanperisone</b> and reveal oxidative stress pathways as potential targets in Ras-mediated malignancies. National Institutes of Health (U.

40|$|The spinal reflex {{depressant}} {{mechanism of}} tolperisone {{and some of}} its structural analogs with central muscle relaxant action was investigated. Tolperisone (50 – 400 M), eperisone, <b>lanperisone,</b> inaperisone, and silperisone (25 – 200 M) dose dependently depressed the ventral root potential of isolated hemisected spinal cord of 6 -day-old rats. The local anesthetic lidocaine (100 – 800 M) produced qualitatively similar depres-sion of spinal functions in the hemicord preparation, whereas its blocking effect on afferent nerve conduction was clearly stronger. In vivo, tolperisone and silperisone as well as lido-caine (10 mg/kg intravenously) depressed ventral root reflexes and excitability of motoneurons. However, in contrast with li-docaine, the muscle relaxant drugs seemed to have a more pronounced action on the synaptic responses than on th...|$|E
