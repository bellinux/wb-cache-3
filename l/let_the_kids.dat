500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. Upon killing Capo, the drivers of the vehicle reportedly struck a stroller with 13-month-old Dillan Harris in it, killing the baby instantly. Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. <b>Let</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was {{he has a lot of}} songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re not going to let you circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E

2500|$|In Calgary, {{the third}} and final stop, the police wished to avoid the protests that were {{witnessed}} in Toronto and their presence seemed to subdue the crowds outside the stadium, though there were many complaints about the ticket prices. [...] It was estimated that about 1000 people managed to sneak in on Saturday by climbing fences (a few rushed the gates) early in the day, but security was tightened and on Saturday afternoon and Sunday fewer people had sneaked in for free. However, there was a heated altercation between promoter Ken Walker and Calgary mayor Rod Sykes after Sykes strongly suggested to Walker on Sunday afternoon that he open the gates and <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> in for free after the show was well underway. Walker, who was livid about the mayor's intrusion and his reference to Walker as [...] "Eastern scum" [...] "trying to skim" [...] the young people of Calgary, claimed to have punched the mayor in the mouth, and boasted that he still had a scar on his hand to prove it.|$|E
