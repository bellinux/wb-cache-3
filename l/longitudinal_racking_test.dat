40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate and recommend improvement of wall-to-wall connections for prefabricated wall panels. Results of 6 <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> and 9 bending tests on full-size 2. 44 by 2. 44 m walls are presented. The specimens were composed of two 1. 22 by 2. 44 m segments attached with three different types of connection configurations. Static <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> were performed according to ASTM standards and with two types of wall-to-foundation attachments. Bending wall tests were carried out according to a proposed protocol based on the calculation of the wind pressure corresponding to the five hurricane categories. For bending tests three types of wall-to-foundation attachments were used. The results of the <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> indicate that the type of connection between the wall segments did not have a definite influence on the strength of the anchored walls, whereas for walls nailed to the base the underutilization of the full capacity was noted. For bending tests, the connected wall segments resisted high pressure independent on the central connection used. The trend of the test results will be used to validate a preliminary finite element model developed to predict the performance of prefabricated wall panels subjected to bending and racking forces, with special focus on the interface and anchorage behaviour for performance optimizatio...|$|R

For the purpose of evaluating the performance of different sheathing materials, the tester provides an economic alternative to standard full-scale <b>racking</b> <b>tests.</b> In addition, results from testing provide practical insight into the racking response of framed and sheathed walls. The load-deformation responses of three commercial sheathing boards were measured, and initial racking stiffness and racking strength were proposed as parameters for characterizing the board. The <b>racking</b> <b>test</b> results showed that the initial paperboard racking stiffness correlated to elastic modulus and caliper, but the response was insensitive to paperboard orientation or test dimensions. Observations and results showed that both panel buckling and paperboard cutting at the staples affected the racking response, but the dominating factor influencing the racking response appears to be load transfer through the staples...|$|R
40|$|While {{the design}} and {{technology}} of conventional low rise light framed residential structures are relatively simple, their response to lateral loading is quite complex. This {{is due to the}} high degree of redundancy, the irregular geometry and interaction between the structural and non-structural components. In addition, the designated lateral bracing elements within one structure may exhibit significantly different behaviour due to the different bracing actions and different materials. This paper focuses on the bracing capacity of plasterboard clad walls which could be considered either structural or non-structural. While such walls may be installed purely as partition walls, they may provide lateral strength and stiffness due to the complex load paths. The paper presents in detail the possible load transfer mechanisms to a variety of typical walls. It also highlights the difficulty with performing <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> on isolated walls due to the complex boundary conditions surrounding walls in real structures.

40|$|There are {{a limited}} number of {{in-plane}} shear <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> in the field of glass facades design and the designer is sometimes faced with the lack of knowledge about their actual in-plane behavior. This is particularly important for the glass facades exposed to the seismic load, which imposes story drifts to the main structure and hence to the glass panels which can pose a significant risk to users. The dissertation presents an innovative composite shear panel composed of laminated timber frame and a double heat strengthened laminated glass, which has the function of taking over of the horizontal loads. The contact between timber frame and glass panel is made adhesiveless which consequently enables sliding of glass panels within timber frame. We conducted six monotonous and six cyclic quasi-static <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> in the laboratory of the Faculty of Civil and Geodetic Engineering, University of Ljubljana. Full dynamic tests have been also conducted at earthquake institute IZIIS in Skopje for two parallel composite shear panels for different earthquake acceleration records. For detailed analysis and understanding of the behavior of the considered composite shear panels, we carried out a series of complementary experiments to capture the response of laminated glass to bending and compression loads, the development of friction force between timber and glass, load bearing capacity of different joint details and mechanical characteristics of the timber frame. Three different types of composite shear panel specimens are tested for three possible boundary conditions. For the interpretation of the hysteresis response we upgraded software HISPA+, which enables us to evaluate ductility, stiffness degradation and the equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The results are showing robust behavior of tested panels and particularly high energy dissipation level due to the friction between the glass panels and timber frame. Simplified bilinear model for the displacement response {{at the top of the}} composite panel is introduced which was later used in the analysis of the simplified three stories timber frame model for evaluating of the stabilizing effect on the frame structure. The results are showing that considered composite panels have high potential in sharing of the earthquake imposed load where one must be aware of the fact that further parametric analysis must be done for broader acceptance of this statement...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of cold-formed steel (CFS) wall frames in residential building under extreme wind and seismic loading {{is a major}} concern in the construction industry. There is a little physical evidence to confirm the ability of such walls to resist horizontal loads (racking load). This leads the author to determine the racking capacity of a cold-formed steel wall frame that is commonly used in lightweight construction in the Northern Territory (NT). The behaviour of the wall frame when subjected to racking load is also investigated. A CFS wall frame normally consists of top and bottom tracks, vertical studs, bracing and connections, which may be assembled together on site (depending on the connection used) or manufactured in the factory. In this paper, experimental <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on a CFS wall frame with aspect ratio of 1. 5 (2700 mm x 1800 mm) and compared to the computer-based Microstran results.

The detail investigation of mechanical properties, production and treatment possibilities of individual materials is a condition for good understanding of facade system, made from this materials. When we got the knowledge about the materials, we analysed and separated the aluminium facades with a help of tehnical system solutions, provided by facade system manufacturers. For {{a good understanding of}} system behaviour itself, we obtained the sample of glass-aluminium facade segment as well. Field of earthquake resistant building design is for us very important, because Slovenia is on the earthquake hazard area. We decided to do the cyclic shear <b>racking</b> <b>tests,</b> wich will better show the behaviour of facade system under the influence of in plane horizontal loading. On the base of experimental received results, we made a numerical model with the same dimensions, like the specimen. This was used as the basis for numerical modelling of the same system with bigger dimensions, the one that we can find out in real facade systems. We compared the shifts, which we got from experimental and numerical analysis. The results of our investigations is a resistance of structural element by the limited shift. We can conclude, that the rigidity of bigger structural element decreases, because of its enlarged height. The rotations are smaller and cosequently the internal loads and damages of element are smaller as well...|$|R
40|$|In {{structural}} design of timber structures the load-bearing capacity of fenestrated wall segments usually is not {{taken into account}} when earthquake resistance analysis is carried out. Some recent experimental and parametric studies show that fenestrated wall segments may significantly contribute to earthquake resistance of wooden buildings. The load bearing capacity and stiffness of fenestrated wooden walls is influenced by dimensions and layout of openings. The exact numerical models are reliable only if they passed the appropriate experimental validation and verification. Therefore, at University of Ljubljana, the series of <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> of fenestrated solid cross-laminated wooden panels were carried out to supply experimental data needed for computational model development. The main objective of testing {{was to understand the}} global response of fenestrated panels and to obtain data for verification and validation of response of the panel. Numerical model was developed and parametric study carried out by commercial software SAP 2000 - Version 8 Nonlinear. Main parameters of interest were related to nonlinear behavior of anchors. Developed and justified mathematical model of experimentally tested panel was used for development of further mathematical models of panels having different patterns of fenestrations. Models were systematically numerically tested by SAP 2000 and results of calculation presented in form of parametric study. Parametric study resulted in diagrams that will serve for engineering judgment of fenestration influence on stiffness and load-bearing capacity of solid-wood wall panels. It was concluded that regularly positioned openings in surface equal up to 30 % of panel surface do not much influence on load-bearing capacity when stiffness is reduced for about 50 %...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} comprehensive studies into locally unstable {{light-gauge steel}} structures. The {{aim of this}} project was to create guidelines {{for the design of}} thin-walled steel structures by analyses which consider the effect of cross-sectional instability. Research was conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with the amplification of second-order effects due to local instabilities, the treatment of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect of interactive buckling on light gauge steel members. The objectives of this research were achieved through a combination of numerical and experimental investigations using two different types of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The first series of experiments investigated the effects of interactive buckling through a number of compression tests on varying lengths of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The second experimental investigation was used to study the effects of local instabilities on the second-order effects and behaviour of light gauge steel frames. Fourteen full scale storage <b>rack</b> <b>tests</b> were completed using different combinations of beam depths and nominal horizontal loads.

Background: This study aims to determine the sociodemographic characteristics of the Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinic at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, to ascertain satisfaction levels with aspects of care, and determine if patient satisfaction levels can be increased by the provision of information letters prior to appointment. Methods: New patients attending Ophthalmology Outpatient Clinic were surveyed regarding sociodemographic information and satisfaction levels. Participants received an introductory letter prior to their clinic appointment, and were compared with controls. Responses were analysed using Mann–Whitney U-tests. Satisfaction scores regarding waiting times, clinic environment, doctors, nurses, clerical staff and general satisfaction were correlated with demographic data using Spearman correlation coefficient analysis and chi-squared statistics. Ordinal logistic regression and non-parametric <b>rack</b> <b>testing</b> determined differences between the two groups. Results: Positive correlations were identified between patient-estimated actual waiting time, ratings of waiting times, booking efficiency, information given, intention to return to, recommend the clinic, to comply with advice given, and higher ratings of the overall quality of the service, and satisfaction levels. Negative qualitative comments correlated with lower ratings of satisfaction and quality of the service. The intervention group showed statistically significantly higher ratings of the wait in clinic and the overall quality of the service. Satisfaction ratings of the clinic staff were also higher in the intervention group. Conclusions: Ophthalmology outpatients {{are more likely to be}} happy with their health care if they are satisfied with waiting times, and are more likely to return to the service and comply with advice, thus improving health outcomes. Provision of information regarding the outpatient clinic structure and estimated waiting times is a simple, cost-effective method of improving patient satisfaction levels and altering perceptions of waiting times.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive, macroscopic material {{model for the}} in-plane behaviour of brick masonry and describes its incorporation into an incremental, non-linear finite element computer model capable of simulating the behaviour of masonry {{at all levels of}} applied load. The material model is derived from a large number of biaxial tests on half scale brick masonry panels and consists of elastic and in-elastic deformation characteristics and a failure criterion. In the elastic range, the brick masonry behaves, on average, isotropically. However, its in-elastic stress-strain relations and failure criterion are significantly influenced by the presence of mortar joints acting as planes of weakness. The material model allows the brick masonry to be modelled as a continuum. Despite the fact that the influence of individual bricks and joints is averaged, depending on the state of stress, the failure can occur in the joints alone, in a combined mechanism involving both brick and joint or by crushing and s palling of the masonry. The results of the finite element model have been verified by comparing the results of racking and vertical load tests on steel frames with brick masonry infill. Infilled frames of varying height/length ratio and frame/wall stiffness and infill panels of differing curing history (and hence differing strength) have been considered. Sensitivity analyses of the parameters of the material model have been carried out with reference to <b>racking</b> <b>tests</b> on infilled frames. The modulus of elasticity and the strength parameters were found to be the most significant properties of masonry. The model has also been used to carry out a study of infilled frame and shear wall behaviour.
