5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's movements were constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{also held}} {{that the level of}} a creature's {{perfection}} was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to her solo recordings, 2012 McCracken also co-founded the kids music group, Rain for Roots, with fellow singer-songwriters Ellie Holcomb, Katy Bowser and Flo Paris. They have released three albums, Big Stories for Little Ones, The Kingdom of Heaven Is <b>Like</b> <b>This,</b> <b>and</b> Waiting Songs.|$|E
25|$|As in {{the years}} before, the Belgian cyclists had {{dominated}} the entire race. The French press and audience did not <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> wanted the brothers Pélissier, who did not join because of a fight with the Tour organisers, to enter the race again. They would ultimately do this in 1923, when Henri won the race as the first French cyclist in eleven years.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, a guest {{was stabbed}} {{critically}} by another guest. The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she had never seen anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E

25|$|Of Kepler-90's seven planets, b and c {{are close}} to a 4:5 period ratio (4:4.977), and d, e, f, g and h {{are close to}} a 2:3:4:7:11 period ratio (2:3.078:4.182:7.051:11.102; also 7:11.021). f, g and h are also close to a 3:5:8 period ratio (3:5.058:7.964). Relevant to systems <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> that of Kepler-36, {{calculations}} suggest {{that the presence of}} an outer gas giant planet facilitates the formation of closely packed resonances among inner super-Earths.|$|E
25|$|Rumors were {{rife with}} why {{the band was}} splitting. Marc Terenzi had met German pop star Sarah Connor {{in the summer of}} 2002 and against Pearlman's wishes had kept dating her. In June 2003 it was {{announced}} that Sarah Connor was pregnant and the couple was engaged. Pearlman didn't <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> wanted Terenzi replaced. Terenzi was a founding member, and the other members were not about to fall for it, so they decided to split – except for Patrick King.|$|E

25|$|The raid {{would be}} carried out by 115 {{officers}} and other ranks, who were divided into four groups., Each group would be landed on one of the target beaches at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Stella Plage, Berck and Le Touquet. They were to spend no more than 80 minutes ashore before returning to their boats. The RAF boats were not equipped for a mission <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> lacked exact navigation equipment and the compasses were known to be unreliable. Crossing the channel they also came to the notice of patrolling RAF aircraft who, not being aware of the mission, came in close to investigate. At around 02:00 hours on 24 June 1940, the boats reached France and put their men ashore.|$|E

[...] Numerous promotional materials were released through Xbox Live, and many more via online and television advertising.

In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences.

500|$|Though Evan Almighty was hyped up, {{especially}} with churchgoers, and had {{double the budget}} of Bruce Almighty, it performed under expectations. On its first weekend, it opened in 5,200 screens in 3,604 theaters and earned $31.1 million (on its first two days the film earned $11.4 million followed by $8.3 million on Sunday). The opening was {{less than half of}} the first film's $68 million weekend ($85 million counting Memorial Day). Nikki Rocco, the president of distribution for Universal Pictures declared, [...] "We never expected it to be much higher...it is not unusual for family films to open at a level <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> build. This film will have legs." [...] The film managed to remain at the third spot at the box office in its second week, before dropping to fifth place in its third week.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for the Savannah Film Festival, Carlos Serrano of District wrote that though {{the subject matter}} covered a lot of ground, it {{utilized}} an efficient presentation: [...] "Sounds like a lot to put in to one movie, but the film manages to {{make good use of}} its 85 minute running time." [...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, I came out of the theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a solid film. ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work".

A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E
