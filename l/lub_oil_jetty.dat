40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>jetties</b> {{are known}} as the most serious threat for coastal environments in recent decades. This refers to the high volume of oil {{products}} transmitted to these terminals. Hence, an environmental site selection for them can {{play a critical role}} in preventing destructive effects of this type of jetties in coastal regions. The purpose of this study is to identify, select, and prioritize the environmental and technical criteria for site evaluation in Iran using Delphi method for the first time. The results show that “Sensitive Coastal Area” is the criteria with the greatest percentage of importance. After that “Depth”, “Marine Meteorology”, and “Possibility of Bigger Ships Berthing” are identified as the most, while “Land Value” and “Distance to Development Foundations” are the least important criteria. On the other hand, “Distance to Habitat Area”, “Threat for Locals” and “Human Population Density” are given the least percentage of usage among others. Then the “ecologic” criteria can be introduced as the most and “Social” one as the least crucial criteria in oil jetties’ site survey, and the suggested linear model can be used as a simple tool for criteria selection of <b>oil</b> <b>jetties.</b> All the results reveal the high efficiency of Delphi method for criteria selection of site survey for <b>oil</b> <b>jetties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The azooxanthellate octocoral Dendronephthya hemprichi (Octocorallia, Alcyonacea) is {{the most}} abun-dant benthic {{organism}} inhabiting the under-water surfa-ces of <b>oil</b> <b>jetties</b> at Eilat (Red Sea); however, it is very rare on Eilat’s natural reefs. This soft coral exhibits a newly discovered mode of clonal propagation that results in autotomy of small-sized fragments (2 — 5 mm in length). They possess specialized root-like processes that enable a rapid attachment onto the substrata. An autotomy event is completed within only 2 days; large colonies can bear hundreds of pre-detached fragments. Temporal fluctu-ations {{in the percentage of}} fragment-bearing colonies indi-cate that autotomy is stimulated by exogenous factors, probably flow-related events. Recruitment of fragments onto PVC plates placed horizontally adjacent to D. hemprichi colonies, was immediate and remarkably high. Attached fragments were observed 2 days after placement of plates; after 52 days, densities of more than one recruit per cm 2 were recorded. The negative buoyancy of fragments causes them to land on horizontal surfaces rather than on vertical ones. However, their survivorship on vertical surfaces is much higher. This pattern corres-ponds with dominance of D. hemprichi on vertical substra-ta at the <b>oil</b> <b>jetties</b> and on natural vertical reefs of the northern Red Sea. Such a mode of clonal propagation provides an efficient mean for genets of D. hemprichi to exploit food resources within a zooxanthellate-dominated reef community...|$|R

40|$|The bay of Pipavav, India {{has been}} {{investigated}} for a feasible {{development of a new}} regional deep water port. This master's study contributes to the DHV Environment and Infrastructure feasibility study for a preliminary masterplan study based on a tentative traffic and shipping forecast. In Volume I of this study a preliminary design of the port was made. This design comprised of the dimensions of the terminals, the storage requirements, the cargo handling equipment and the navigation channel, turning and berthing basins. Also a general layout of the port's land and water areas as well as a phased development of the port are described. In Volume 11 a more detailed design was made, specifically of the hydraulic aspects of the port. A wave climate study and a nautical study were undertaken to get an estimate of the port and terminal downtime, the accessibility of the port and to evaluate the preliminary design. The wave climate study was done using the mathematical models PORTRAY and HISWA. PORTRAY is a ray model, specifically written to predict wave activity inside harbours, but it could not be used for the bathymetric complex tidal basin of Pipavav, so HISWA was used alternatively. HISWA is a mathematical model that uses wave propagation over a grid rather than along rays and on a slowly sloping foreshore seabed. It performed well and was used to describe the exceeding of certain wave heiqht/period combinations at specific locations inside and outside the port. This portrayed a strong wave attenuation starting at circa 80 % near the oil products terminal, near the entrance of the port, to circa 8 % near the multi-purpose terminal, {{at the rear of the}} port. The waves are refracted such that they are incident between 30 and 180 with the moored vessels. Terminal downtime due to waves varied from 20 days at the oil products terminal to 0 days at the multi-purpose terminal. In the final part of this study a nautical study was performed using the mathematical simulation model SHIPMA. With this model the entrance manoeuvre of a 60, 000 DWT bulk carrier was simulated under various environmental conditions. The manoeuvre was investigated with regular and extreme wind, waves and currents conditions. Currents proved to be the dominating factor. The study showed that, due to a good alignment of waves and currents with the navigation channel and the terminals, vessels can enter the port with tugboat assistance under all ebb conditions and with flood up to a flow velocity of 1. 4 mIs. This resulted in a channel downtime of 22 hours spread out over one year. The results of both studies were combined with the results of a site investigation. With these results the terminal and the port downtime were estimated. It was concluded that the tidal basin is well protected for wave penetration and the port can be sailed well, due to a good current alignment. It is suggested that the oil product terminal is relocated or better protected and a that the crude <b>oil</b> <b>jetty</b> is re-orientated to get a better compromise between current a wave alignment for this terminal.

The asset owners are aim to establish potential maintenance strategies in restoration of his asset facilities. The damaged marine structure will be looked at from whole life asset management perspectives; to identify various components of concrete structures that were subjected to steel corrosion and concrete deterioration. Application of whole life asset management paradigm in the case study will have significant impacts to the facilities and the owner as well. The benefits with regard to implementation of whole life asset management approaches in managing the asset marine facility correlate with risk management, accountability, service facility management and financial efficiency. The refurbishment work will make use of current repair method in assessing the restoration of damage concrete piles. This should take account of a risk management study prior selection of best procurement routes for the case studies. The case study is critically reviewed for options that suit the asset facility present condition and set up objectives to get the best approach adopted with regards to asset problem. The findings demonstrate that the adoption of the whole life asset management paradigm will promote the asset owner, to obtain best value for money concept from the investment and to gain benefits in terms of time, cost, quality and fit for purpose.
