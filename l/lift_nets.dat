The elimination of gillnets from areas of high use is needed and economic incentives need to be provided to the local people.|$|E

40|$|Light fishing has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, fishing with lamp (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, <b>lift</b> <b>net,</b> purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of light fishing technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of light fishing has been limited especially for purse seine and <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> (bagan). Bagan is a <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on light fishing in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and <b>lift</b> <b>net.</b> These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and discarded catch. The other fishing gear, <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for fish lamp. According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of discarded catch. It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly light fishing technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|R

In this region, {{a study on}} the effect of different light intensities of floating <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> on fish catches was carried out. The analyses were done on light distribution of 4 light intensities different: Petromaks Lamp and Underwater Lamps of each 18 watt, 36 watt and 54 watt. This study showed that catches of floating <b>lift</b> <b>net</b> using different light intensities were statistically significantly different. The use of 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamp yielded the same amount of catches but higher than that of 18 watt-underwater lamp and petromaks, both in number and species. Catches consisted of 17 species, 16 fishs and 1 mollusca. Number of species and size also varied with light intensity used. There were 13 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus indicus as much as 46. 9 kg or 22 % for petromaks catches, 14 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 64 kg (31 %) for 18 watt underwater lamp, 17 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 76 kg (28 %) for 36 watt underwater lamp, and 15 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus devisi as much as 54. 8 kg (22 %) for 54 watt underwater lamp, respectively.
