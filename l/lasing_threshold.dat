25|$|A nanophotonic {{resonator}} or nanocavity is {{an optical}} cavity {{which is on}} the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. Optical cavities are a major component of all lasers, they are responsible for providing amplification of a light source via positive feedback, a process known as amplified spontaneous emission or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower <b>lasing</b> <b>threshold</b> provided the quality factor of the resonator is high. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching <b>lasing</b> <b>threshold.</b> Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{electron}} and a hole {{are present in}} the same region, they may recombine or [...] "annihilate" [...] producing a spontaneous emission — i.e., the electron may re-occupy the energy state of the hole, emitting a photon with energy equal to the difference between the electron's original state and hole's state. (In a conventional semiconductor junction diode, the energy released from the recombination of electrons and holes is carried away as phonons, i.e., lattice vibrations, rather than as photons.) Spontaneous emission below the <b>lasing</b> <b>threshold</b> produces similar properties to an LED. Spontaneous emission is necessary to initiate laser oscillation, but it is one among several sources of inefficiency once the laser is oscillating.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, an impact of {{localization}} of an oxide aperture within a vertical-cavity surface-emitting diode laser (VCSEL) on its threshold operation is analyzed. As expected, {{a shift of}} the aperture from the anti-node position of the standing optical wave within a VCSEL cavity to the node position {{is followed by a}} drastic change of the wave guiding mechanism from the index guiding to the gain guiding. Index-guided VCSELs have been found to exhibit much lower threshold currents, but any increase in their active-region diameters over a relatively low critical value is followed by excitation of higher-order modes. On the other hand, the fundamental-mode operation is achieved in gain-guided VCSELs with much larger active regions but at the expense of considerably higher <b>lasing</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Therefore, a new VCSEL design, i. e., the separate confinement oxidation (SCO) VCSEL, is proposed. The SCO VCSELs are expected to combine advantages of both previous oxide-confined VCSELs, i. e., low <b>lasing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of index-guided VCSELs with the fundamental-mode operation of gain-guided ones even in the case of large active regions...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid {{plasmonic}} lasers provide deep subwavelength optical confinement, strongly enhanced {{light-matter interaction}} and together with nanoscale footprint promise new applications in optical communication, bio-sensing and photolithography. The subwavelength hybrid plasmonic lasers reported so far often use bottom up grown nanowires, nanorods and nanosquares, {{making it difficult}} to integrate these devices into industry-relevant high density plasmonic circuits. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of AlGaInP based, red-emitting hybrid plasmonic lasers at room temperature using lithography based fabrication processes. Resonant cavities with deep subwavelength 2 D and 3 D mode confinement of lambda square/ 56 and lambda cube/ 199, respectively are demonstrated. A range of cavity geometries (waveguides, rings, squares and disks) show very low <b>lasing</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 0. 6 - 1. 8 mJ/cm square with wide gain bandwidth (610 nm- 685 nm), which are attributed to the heterogeneous geometry of the gain material, the optimized etching technique, and the strong overlap of the gain material with the plasmonic modes. Most importantly, we establish the connection between mode confinements and enhanced absorption and stimulated emission, which {{play a critical role in}} maintaining low <b>lasing</b> <b>thresholds</b> at extremely small hybrid plasmonic cavities.

This has the advantage that <b>lasing</b> <b>threshold</b> could be lowered under continuous wave excitation, enhancing the potential of CSSNCs as optical gain media. Type II CSSNCs separate the electrons and holes of the exciton pair, which leads to a strong electric field and thus, reducing absorption losses.|$|E
