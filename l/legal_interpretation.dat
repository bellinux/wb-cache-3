5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E
5|$|The stipulations {{contained}} in the Act caused significant controversy during debates over NATO's military command structure. Both Striking Fleet Atlantic and the United States Sixth Fleet have never been allowed to be placed anywhere but directly under American commanding officers—the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe—because the dominant <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the McMahon Act has been that nuclear striking forces cannot be controlled by non-US commanders. This {{was the reason for}} the formation of Striking Fleet Atlantic as an independent entity, instead of being operationally subordinated to the UK Admiral serving as Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Atlantic, in October–November 1952. This was also the reason why the Sixth Fleet, in its NATO guise as Naval Striking and Support Force, South, was placed under American control rather than Allied Forces Mediterranean when the European commands were agreed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of which view {{the government would}} take was answered in a January 19 memorandum issued jointly by EPA and the Corps for headquarters and field/regional staff who work on the section 404 program, discussed above; the agencies provide a <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation,</b> based on a narrow reading of the Court's decision.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have argued}} that {{regardless}} of {{the merits of the}} case, it was politically unwise for those worried about Hong Kong legal autonomy to use this as a test case to assert Hong Kong's judicial independence, since it is the general consensus that the Hong Kong public tended to support the position of the SAR government as well as the <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the NPCSC.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the judge}} is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases, making predictability of <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> difficult. The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges (qadi) and lawyers form part of the ulema, the country's Islamic scholars.|$|E

25|$|The same <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{is shared}} by the United States, the United Kingdom, and all other Western democracies , who held the forcible {{incorporation}} of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union to be illegal. At least formally, the Western democracies never considered the three Baltic states to be constituent parts of the Soviet Union. Australia was a brief exception to this support of Baltic independence: In 1974, the Labor government of Australia did recognize Soviet dominion, but this decision was reversed by the next Australian Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In {{another attempt}} to {{champion}} the rights of Dissenters, Priestley defended their constitutional rights against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist. Blackstone's Commentaries, fast becoming the standard reference for <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation,</b> stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and argued that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's grammar, his history and his interpretation of the law. Blackstone, chastened, replied in a pamphlet and altered his Commentaries in subsequent editions; he rephrased the offending passages but still described Dissent as a crime.|$|E
25|$|According to Michael Lynk, {{there are}} three schools of thought {{concerning}} the proper <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved {{have suggested that the}} indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the first}} time the Court had upheld a tax on the federal government.

25|$|Positive ecclesiastical laws, based {{directly}} or indirectly upon immutable divine law or natural law, derive formal authority {{in the case of}} universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator—the Supreme Pontiff—who possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person, while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator, whether an ordinary or a delegated legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code for the Latin Church as well as a code for the Eastern Catholic Churches, principles of <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and coercive penalties. It lacks civilly-binding force in most secular jurisdictions. Those who are versed and skilled in canon law, and professors of canon law, are called canonists (or colloquially, canon lawyers). Canon law as a sacred science is called canonistics.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} his interpretive philosophy, Breyer has sometimes noted {{his use of}} six interpretive tools: text, history, tradition, precedent, {{the purpose of a}} statute, and the consequences of competing interpretations. [...] Breyer notes that only the last two differentiate him from textualists on the Supreme Court such as Scalia. Breyer argues that these sources are necessary, however, and in the former case (purpose), can in fact provide greater objectivity in <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> than looking merely at what is often ambiguous statutory text. [...] With the latter (consequences), Breyer argues that considering the impact of legal interpretations is a further way of ensuring consistency with a law's intended purpose.|$|E
500|$|The Allied {{delegation}} initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane {{addition to}} the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests. Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that [...] "the <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> [...] was the correct one" [...] and {{not a matter of}} political question. Lloyd George commented that [...] "the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we all think she will be unable to pay more than this document requires of her." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1926, Robert C. Binkley and A. C. Mahr of Stanford University, {{wrote that}} German accusations {{of the article}} {{assigning}} war guilt were [...] "ill-founded" [...] and [...] "mistaken". The article was more [...] "an assumption of liability to pay damages than an admission of war guilt" [...] and compared it with [...] "a man who undertakes to pay all {{the cost of a}} motor accident than to the plea of guilty entered by an accused criminal". They wrote that [...] "it is absurd" [...] to charge the reparation articles of the treaty with any [...] "political meaning" [...] and the <b>legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> [...] "is the only one that can stand". They concluded that German opposition [...] "is based upon a text which has no legal validity whatsoever, and which Germany never signed at all." [...] Sidney Fay was the [...] "most outspoken and influential critic" [...] of the article. In 1928, he concluded that all of Europe shared the blame for the war and that Germany had no intention of launching a general European war in 1914.|$|E
500|$|Both referendums were {{severely}} {{criticized by}} the political opposition inside Belarus {{as well as by}} international observers such as the OSCE. Observers state that both referendums were non-transparent and that the real results were not published. Observers were not allowed to see the process of counting ballots. Specifically, the democratic opposition to President Lukashenko decided to boycott the 1996 referendum on the Constitution. During the same election, international observers found problems with the voting process or found pro-government advertisements or notices at polling places. Opposition parties contend that the vote to dissolve the Supreme Soviet in 1996 removed Belarus' last democratically elected parliament and installed Lukashenko's hand picked parliament. Despite the claims of manipulation of the elections and the Constitution itself, there are a few parts of the current constitution approved by key leaders of the Belarusian democratic opposition. In a 2005 interview with Radio Free Europe, presidential candidate Alaksandar Milinkievič stated that Belarus' stance as a neutral country, stated in Article 18, should be preserved with regard to joining NATO and the European Union. <b>Legal</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Constitution is also brought into question. In a 1998 journal, the New York University School of Law noted that Belarusian legal scholars came up with a new theory to deal with jurisprudence. Laws are constitutional if they follow the will of President Lukashenko and the people; unconstitutional if the president and the people do not like it. The laws that fall in the latter category are considered [...] "ignored" [...] by the legal scholars. In June 1999, a Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers from the United Nations visited Belarus and noted inconsistency between national laws, decrees and the Constitution. The UN rapporteur, Dato Param Cumaraswamy, especially noted that temporary decrees issued by the national authorities are still in force, even if they had expired or contradict the Constitution.|$|E
