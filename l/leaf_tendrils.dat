40|$|The {{endangered}} tropical pitcher plant Nepenthes khasiana {{has evolved}} mechanisms to lure, cap-ture, and digest prey animals (USDA 2003; Eilenberg et al. 2010). Native to areas with nutrient-poor soil, consuming insects enables Nepenthes to gain additional nourishment (Mithofer 2011). Located {{at the ends}} of <b>leaf</b> <b>tendrils,</b> their pitchers ’ bright colors and nectar secretions are a powerful attractant for bugs (Mithofer 2011). Venturing insects slip on the pitcher’s waxy mouth and fall inside, ultimately drowning in the liquid (Rischer et al. 2002). Glands located {{at the base of the}} pitcher secrete hydrolyzing enzymes (Eilenberg et al. 2006). This serves to break the arthropod’s body apart so it can be absorbed by the plant as sustenance (Eilenberg et al. 2006). Under special circumstances, Nepenthes pitcher liquid will also contain potent antifungal compounds called naph-thoquinones (Eilenberg et al. 2010). Their purpose, it is believed, is to prevent captured prey from being consumed by fungi, a competing organism (Eilenberg et al. 2010). For hundreds of years, naphthoquinones have been utilized in Asia and South America for medicinal purposes (Babula et al. 2009). In the United States, emerging studies are investigating how these compounds can be produced, as well as their efficacy against opportunistic human fungal pathogens (Eilenberg et al. 2010). The importance of this research is underscored by the limited variety of antifungal drug...|$|E

That growth is the chief cause of the spiral contraction of tendrils may be safely admitted, as shown by the recent researches of H. de Vries. I will, however, add one little fact in support of this conclusion.|$|R

The tendril presents structural organization similar to the stem, suggesting a common origin for both. The petiole has an epidermis with ornamented cuticle; the cortex is composed of collenchyma and parenchyma, and the vascular tissues are arranged in collateral bundles. The leaf blade is amphistomatic with non-glandular and glandular trichomes, and the mesophyll is dorsiventral.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} vining peas under field conditions and their growth was followed using growth analysis techniques. In the first experiment, cv Victory Freezer was grown to maturity and the growth parameters total plant dry mass, leaf area and leaf dry mass recorded at weekly intervals for each of four planting densities. Determination of weekly values of R,E and F where R is mean relative growth rate, E is mean net assimilation rate and F is mean leaf area ratio, was unsatisfactory due to harvest variability. By fitting loge values of each parameter over the harvest period to quadratic functions, of the form Ŷ = a + bT + cT 2 where Ŷ is the derived parameter value, a, b, and c are regression constants and T is time, {{it was possible to}} calculate instantaneous values for R, E and F. Calculation of R over the whole of growth by this method was not satisfactory. A third method of deriving R, E and F was then attempted by fitting the logistic function W = A(1 -e-(λ +kT) θ) 1 /θ where W is the required parameter, A is the asymptote, e the base of natural logarithms, λ, k and θ are constants and T time. Values of R obtained by this method appeared to more closely approximate to the growth patterns of peas. However, due to the non-asymptotic growth of leaves the method was not suited to derivation of E and F over the whole of growth. Fitting of growth parameters to the model was also difficult where appreciable variability existed in the parameter to be fitted. At the lower plant densities, Relative Growth Rate was maintained at a higher level for much of the growth period apparently due to a higher net assimilation rate. In this experiment maximum yield was shown to occur at the highest plant densities. This was despite lower numbers of pods per plant; numbers of peas per pod and individual pea fresh mass being little affected by density. The second experiment compared three near isogenic lines of cv Dark Skinned Perfection vining pea, differing only in the expression of <b>leaf,</b> <b>tendril</b> and stipule. Each was grown at the same range of densities as in the first experiment. By the time that this experiment was half grown, the weather conditions were unfavourable for growth, with strong winds, heavy rain and low light levels. These conditions were ideal for the spread of fungal disease and the combination of weather and disease made growth very erratic. Despite the poor conditions recording of growth parameters continued until no further plots were available for harvest. At that stage only a few plots had commenced fruiting and little yield data was obtained. The very variable growth parameter records made interpretation of R,E and F almost impossible. The ease of fitting the quadratic function made it seem that this was the only method worth attempting for derivation of R, E and F values over the experimental period. Results obtained showed that in contrast to the first experiment the higher density of planting conferred many benefits to the peas. Higher leaf area ratios in the more closely planted plots led to larger values of R in this experiment. Weather effects on density were mirrored in leaf reduction where the relative growth rate of the least leafy cultivar was much lower than for the more conventional types, due again to lower values of F. The difficulty in obtaining meaningful mean values of the derived functions in both experiments suggests that different methods of deriving R, E and F are desirable. Using quadratic regression to derive these functions is limited in following whole of growth changes. Fitting of the logistic model is also difficult particularly where harvest variability is high and where the parameters are not basically asymptotic in form. It is suggested that fitting of functions to data over only part of growth may be advisable...|$|R

I have measured that a single mature adhesive disc has an average mass of only about 0. 0005 g, an average attached area of about 1. 22 sq mm and an adhesive force of about 13. 7 N. I have found that a single adhesive disc can on average support a weight produced together by the stem, <b>leaf,</b> branchlet and <b>tendril</b> which is 260 times greater than its own weight during the growing, and can sustain the maximum pulling force which is 2, 800, 000 times higher than that produced by its own weight.

60|$|Before the tendril is mature, the {{terminal}} branchlets cohere, and the hooks are curled closely inwards. At this period no part {{is sensitive to}} a touch; {{but as soon as}} the branches diverge and the hooks stand out, full sensitiveness is acquired. It is a singular circumstance that immature tendrils revolve at their full velocity before they become sensitive, but in a useless manner, as in this state they can catch nothing. This want of perfect co-adaptation, though only for a short time, between the structure and the functions of a climbing-plant is a rare event. A tendril, as soon as it is ready to act, stands, together with the supporting petiole, vertically upwards. The leaflets borne by the petiole are at this time quite small, and the extremity of the growing stem is bent to one side so as to be out of the way of the revolving tendril, which sweeps large circles directly over head. The tendrils thus revolve in a position well adapted for catching objects standing above; and by this means the ascent of the plant is favoured. If no object is caught, the <b>leaf</b> with its <b>tendril</b> bends downwards and ultimately assumes a horizontal position. An open space is thus left for the next succeeding and younger tendril to stand vertically upwards and to revolve freely. As soon as an old tendril bends downwards, it loses all power of movement, and contracts spirally into an entangled mass. Although the tendrils revolve with unusual rapidity, the movement lasts for only a short time. In a plant placed in the hot- house and growing vigorously, a tendril revolved for not longer than 36 hours, counting from the period when it first became sensitive; but during this period it probably made at least 27 revolutions.|$|R

Whilst the plant is young, the tendrils appear like modified branches, and a distinguished botanist {{thought that they were}} of this nature; but in a full-grown plant there can be no doubt, as I am assured by Dr. Hooker, that they are modified leaves. When of full size, they are above 5 inches in length; they bifurcate twice, thrice, or even four times; their extremities are hooked and blunt. All the branches of the tendrils are sensitive on all sides, but the basal portion of the main stem is only slightly so. The terminal branches when lightly rubbed with a twig became curved in the course of from 30 m. to 42 m., and straightened themselves in between 10 hrs. and 20 hrs. A loop of thread weighing one-eighth of a grain plainly caused the thinner branches to bend, as did occasionally a loop weighing one-sixteenth of a grain; but this latter weight, though left suspended, was not sufficient to cause a permanent flexure. The whole <b>leaf</b> with its <b>tendril,</b> as well as the young upper internodes, revolves vigorously and quickly, though irregularly, and thus sweeps a wide space. The figure traced on a bell-glass was either an irregular spire or a zigzag line.

Asymptomatic shoots were collected at eight different growth stages. Nodes, internodes, <b>leaf</b> petioles, leaves, <b>tendrils</b> and bunch rachides were surface sterilised, cut into smaller pieces and plated out on potato dextrose agar. After the fungal endophytes were identified, the relative importance (RI) values were calculated and a correspondence analysis performed on the data of taxa with RI larger than 5 %. Of the 46 different fungal taxa found, 20 were present at relative importance values of more than 1 %. An analysis of the relative importance of the different species showed that the most frequently isolated fungi were members of the Alternaria alternata complex (40 %) and Sphaeropsis sp. (27 %). The Phomopsis viticola complex had a relative importance of 9 % and accounted for 3 % of the isolations. P. viticola was mainly isolated from the nodes and internodes, the plant parts in which P. viticola usually causes disease symptoms. Two different Phomopsis spp. were isolated, with 94 % of the isolates representing P. viticola taxon 2, and the rest taxon 1. Isolations made from diseased vine material during the last two years revealed taxon 2 to be dominant in vineyards in the Western Cape. Inoculations into healthy, young vine tissue also showed taxon 2 to be a primary pathogen, further suggesting that it is probably a latent pathogen rather than an endophyte.

Posebice se obrađuju ostaci monumentalnog kamenog portika ubrani u antičkim kamenolomima obližnjeg Škripa. Mirje takes {{a special}} place among late antique localities {{on the island of}} Brač. It is {{situated}} high on Mali Brig above the village of Postira, in a cultivated agrarian landscape and on an excellent strategic position in the climate of Salona, the capital of the province of Dalmatia. Actually, it was built among the two important centers on the Adriatic part of the province: Diocletian’s palace in Split and imperial quarries near Škrip, from which architectural stone for building the monumental palace was cut. Numerous fragments of stone furniture scattered all over field drywalls, confirmed the existence of a sacral building from the 6 th century, hidden within the complex, which hasn’t been recognized up to present day. Through protection works, for the past two decades, the architectural complex has been defined in its whole range. The analysis of the discovered walls suggests that the complex was not built for the convent’s community, but that was in fact a later adaptation of the late antique villa. The array of square bases with overturned monolithic stone pillars was found in the interior of the complex, among the two big projections of the western façade. The pillars with square cross-section have been knocked down towards the middle of the yard within the complex. At the ends, there were six pillars and two semi-pillars in a row, with a somewhat wider middle intercolumniation. We recognize the pattern for this kind of »rhythm« between pillars on the south façade of the imperial palace in Split, which for sure was the model and inspiration for the builders of this small residential building. Pillar surfaces were treated by marteline with a hole at the bottom. The monumental distinctive wreath is turned upside-down and re-carved into smaller pieces which served as pillar bases. By disintegrating the wreath that was intended for a public building or a temple, the bases of the portico were formed, and they, on their inner side, don’t have the same shape, but are only treated obliquely, like a truncated pyramid. The upper surface has square hole with a small canal for pouring lead. Monolithic pillars with a square cross-section are rare in other late antique localities in Dalmatia. The continuity of the quarrying tradition in Roman quarries around Škrip has created the base for the making of such blocks. Namely, cubic capitals and semi-capitals are decorated with <b>leafs</b> of acanthus, <b>tendrils</b> and plastic vegetative volutes. Traces of quarrying skills have been preserved in the stones of Roman quarries close to Škrip (Rasohe, Plate, Zastražišće), where deposits of blocks could be seen. We must not exclude the assumption that owner of the villa on Mirje was the imperial quarry manager and that he was in charge for supervision of the valuable state property near Škrip...|$|R
