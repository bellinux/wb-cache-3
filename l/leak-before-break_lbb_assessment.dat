40|$|Abstract. This study {{provides}} an engineering {{application of a}} continuum damage model to analyze the ductile tearing of axial surface cracks in X 80 pipelines. Compact tension experiments were conducted to examine the behavior of large crack extension of X 80 pipeline steel. The test results were used to verify the optimized parameter set of the proposed damage model. In the numerical model, progressive damage was restricted within a predetermined fracture process zone (FPZ). The material’s damage behavior in FPZ was {{described in terms of}} the Gurson–Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) micro-mechanical damage model. The measured load versus load line displacement curve of CT specimens was numerically predicted using the damage model developed. T * integral was calculated to determine the limiting crack size in X 80 pipelines. The damage model was then used to analyze the axial subcritical crack extension.

40|$|Past elastic-plastic {{fracture}} {{studies for}} <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> <b>assessment</b> of {{low alloy steel}} pipings have been focused mostly {{on the behavior of}} base metals and their weld metals. In contrast, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a welded pipe has not been studied in detail primarily because the size of the HAZ is too small to make specimens for mechanical properties measurements. In this study, microstructural analyses, microhardness tests, tensile tests and J-R tests have been conducted as a function of distance from a fusion line and temperature for HAZ materials of SA 106 Gr. C low alloy piping steels. For the ferrite-pearlite steels such as SA 106 Gr. C, the HAZ specimens showed a higher yield strength and fracture toughness compared with those of its base metal. These characteristics, despite of grain coarsening, can be explained by cleaner microstructures of HAZ materials with a finer morphology of carbides compared with pearlitic-ferritic base metals. However, the situation can be reversed for a bainitic steel since its HAZ can develop an upper bainitic structure with a reduced fracture resistance and strength, warranting further studies. close 212...|$|E

With particular emphasis on industrial applications and regulatory policies, the seminar provided an opportunity to compare approaches, experiences, and codifications developed by different countries. The seminar was organized into four topic areas: status of LBB applications; technical issues in LBB methodology; complementary requirements (leak detection and inspection); <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment</b> and margins. As a result of this seminar, an improved understanding of LBB gained through sharing of different viewpoints from different countries, permits consideration of: simplified pipe support design and possible elimination of loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA) mechanical consequences for specific cases; defense-in-depth type of applications without support modifications; support of safety cases for plants designed without the LOCA hypothesis. In support of these activities, better estimates of the limits to the LBB approach should follow, as well as an improvement in codifying methodologies.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a probabilistic <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> <b>assessment</b> of a ferritic main coolant line of a pressurized water reactor representative for German nuclear power plants. The analysis approach {{is based on the}} elastic-plastic fracture mechanics methodology, incorporating the failure assessment diagram to calculate the critical through-thickness crack size, as well as fatigue crack growth calculations to determine the flaw length at wall penetration. An essential part of this study is the collation and statistical treatment of material data, such as strength properties, crack resistance and fatigue crack growth curves, and their incorporation in the probabilistic assessment. The analysis yields negligible break probabilities, thus demonstrating the LBB behavior of the piping. This conclusion is validated by {{results of a}} sensitivity study with additional conservative assumptions and simplifications with respect to the initial crack size and material st ate. For the sake of simplicity, the blocking effect of the intact austenitic cladding on the crack extension, as well as the conditional probability of crack penetration through the wall during the service life are neglected in this investigation. Through an additional treatment of these issues a more realistic assessment is achieved, resulting in even smaller failure probabilities...|$|E

The failure probability for SCC satisfies the target failure probability even if conservative conditions are assumed. Moreover, for pipe wall thinning analysis, pre-service inspection is important for satisfying the target failure probability because the initial wall thickness affects the accuracy of the wall thinning rate.

In <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> analysis, the assumption that the crack is symmetrically placed with respect to the bending plane is not necessarily conservative. In this work, the crack opening of circumferential cracks, off-centered with respect to the bending plane, was investigated experimentally. Here, three pipe geometries and two crack lengths were investigated. For each crack, the centred and two off-centered configuration were examined.

If cracks develop in the welded area of a pipe, {{as is often the}} case, residual stresses in the weld may cause the crack to be forced closed. Earlier studies have shown that pipe welding produces high residual stresses with a sharp stress gradient ranging from tension to compression through the thickness of the welded area of the pipe.

40|$|The term <b>Leak-Before-Break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> {{refers to}} a {{well-established}} safety criterion used to assess whether cracked tanks or pipes can leak detectable amounts of fluid as a warning before catastrophic failure occurs. In this research The LBB criterion {{was applied to the}} safety assessment of spherical Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) containment systems on ships. For this type of LNG tanks, the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC) requires several fracture mechanics analyses of fatigue crack growth. Details on how these analyses should be carried out can be found in industry codes. Although these codes provide guidance on most aspects of an <b>LBB</b> <b>assessment,</b> they are not fully satisfactory with regard to their recommendations on how to calculate the growth of deep semi-elliptical surface cracks, on how to estimate the crack shape when the crack snaps through the tank wall and how to assess these through-thickness cracks in the stage right after breakthrough. The aim of this research was to more accurately simulate the development of cracks for LBB applications. To do so, a new numerical calculation model have been developed for the estimation of crack growth, crack shape development and crack propagation after wall penetration. In addition, Finite Element Models (FEM) have been developed to predict the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), a parameter that characterises the local stress distribution in the vicinity of a crack-tip and is commonly used in fracture mechanics. Finite Element (FE) analyses were conducted to evaluate existing, approximative SIF solutions for deep, semi-elliptical surface cracks and to find a new, FE-derived SIF solution for through-thickness cracks after breakthrough. Both the new FE-derived and existing SIF solutions were used in the numerical model. The results of different SIF solutions and numerical model configurations were then compared to experimental data from the literature in order to find recommendations for the enhancement of existing LBB procedures.

The work described in this report addresses the reliability of ultrasonic phased-array (PA) examinations for inspection of cracks that have been subjected to the mitigation method of mechanical stress improvement process (MSIP).

40|$|Over {{recent years}} the concept of <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> has been {{considered}} in establishing safety cases for piping particularly for the nuclear industry. The LBB concept {{is viewed as a}} more realistic design criterion in the design of high energy fluid piping as compared with the double-ended guillotine break as a design criterion, which gives rise to many problems. The concept of LBB aims at the application of fracture mechanics to demonstrate that pipes are very unlikely to experience sudden, catastrophic break without prior indication of detectable leakage. This report is intended to give a review of LBB research activities that have been or are being conducted throughout the world on the basis of literature published up to 1990.

Comparison with ten published test data and the results from the existing method shows that the present method not only reduces non-conservatism associated with the existing method, but also provides consistent and overall satisfactory results.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a computer code entitled PSQUIRT for probabilistic evaluations of leak rate in nuclear piping. It is based on (1) the Henry-Fauske model of two-phase flow for thermal-hydraulic analysis and (2) an estimation model for elastic-plastic fracture-mechanics analysis. In both analyses, uncertainties arise due to the incomplete knowledge of the crackmorphology variables and statistical scatter of the pipe material properties. The relevant parameters required to conduct these analyses were modeled as random variables. Henceforth, the above thermal-hydraulic and fracturemechanics models were put in a probabilistic format to allow statistical variability of input and determination of their effects in pipe fracture and <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> evaluations. A standard Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to perform the probabilistic analysis. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the PSQUIRT code. Probabilistic analyses were performed by PSQUIRT for a stainless steel and a carbon steel pipe. Histograms were developed for leakage rate and flaw size in these pipes for LBB applications. The results suggest that the variability of leak rate can be significant due to statistical scatter of crack-morphology parameters. Using these histograms, the subsequent fracture stability of a leaking crack, actual or hypothetical, can be evaluated by either a deterministic or a probabilistic method. 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is highly competitive as compared to pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport for distances of up to 2, 500 – 3, 000 nautical miles. Due to the high pressure inside CNG containers, its safety is the first important factor to be considered. <b>Leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> is an important methodology of maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels. However, the Joule-Thomson (JT) cooling effect occurred during a leak may impact {{the validity of the}} LBB approach. In this paper, a looping model based on MATLAB software is developed starting with the gas at room temperature and 250 bar at the entrance of the crack. From this, the pressure and JT temperature drop is calculated initially, which in turn affects the gas properties, such as viscosity, density, thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficients. Heat transfer and FEA analysis using a 3 D model of the plate with a central through-thickness crack are carried out. Under the internal pressure of 250 bar, the temperature drop and the stress intensity factor {{in the vicinity of the}} crack is 59. 7 °C and 120 MPa· m 1 / 2, respectively.

This paper describes level 2 and level 3 LBB analysis for SG shell-nozzle junction. In level 2, crack propagation {{analysis of}} surface crack at the most critical locations of SG shell-nozzle junction was carried out, showing thereby, that crack growth is insignificant during the complete one power plant life cycle. Crack propagation analysis was conducted as defined in RCC-MR code. The methodology based on Paris law, which needs evaluation of effective DeltaK (DeltaK(eff)) taking into account effect of plasticity and crack closure coefficient, was used. In level 3, through-wall leak size cracks (LSC) were postulated at the most critical locations and crack instability analysis was carried out under maximum credible loading conditions (e. g. earthquake). For crack instability analysis, various steps namely determination of leakage area and leak size crack (LSC) using leak-rate model, elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analysis (J-integral/tearing modulus approach) and limit load analysis (twice elastic slope method) were carried out. For the evaluation of critical load, elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analysis and for the evaluation of limit load, limit load analysis were carried outs Since no geometrical simplifications were possible for SG shell-nozzle junction, complete three-dimensional non-linear finite element analysis was performed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cooling effect}} {{caused by the}} Joule-Thomson (JT) effect in the leakage of {{pressure}} vessels has gained more and more attention and worries from natural gas transportation industries as it may influence {{the validity of the}} conventional leak-before-break approach. Currently, <b>leak-before-break</b> (<b>LBB)</b> design codes for pressure vessels do not take into account of the subsequent low temperature depression and the drop in fracture toughness {{in the aftermath of a}} leak. This study is to ensure the integrity of the compressed natural gas (CNG) containment in marine transportation vessels being proposed to transport the gas in highly pressurized (up to 250 bar) cylinders. A numerical method was proposed to simulate the heat transfer between the high pressure argon gas leaking through a narrow crack and the surrounding metal which is caused by the Joule-Thomson cooling effect of the leaking argon. A one-way coupling model was developed to calculate the gas pressure drop at different crack depth, followed by the temperature drop. A heat transfer simulation then calculated the temperature in the metal in the vicinity of the crack. The Redlich-Kwong (RK) equation with a relatively high accuracy was adopted to evaluate the temperature change of the leaking argon. The modified Petukhov correlation by Adams et al. was employed to evaluate the heat transfer coefficient of leaking argon. A MATLAB code was developed to iteratively calculate the properties of leaking gas in a crack which was fitted as formula as boundary conditions in heat transfer simulation of COMSOL program. Under the maximum internal pressure of 91 bar, the simulated temperature drop of the test plate in the vicinity of the crack caused by the Joule-Thomson cooling effect is 16. 2 °C. An experiment rig designed and tested under the same conditions showed a good agreement between the simulation and experiment at the obtained lowest temperature in the test plate...|$|R
