Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain saw the {{division}} flag {{moving to the}} left and followed Griffin with his brigade and a regiment of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory's brigade. By the time Warren returned to White Oak Road, Ayres's division had captured the return. Since no attack was now needed at the return (refused end) of the Confederate line, Warren sent Major Cope to tell Griffin to push westward toward the Ford's Road. Griffin turned his men to the right and headed west parallel to White Oak Road. Warren then turned back toward the return to <b>look</b> <b>again</b> for Crawford's division.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the dance single with Inna's vocals was {{initially}} made available for consumption as credited to Bob Taylor and Anni (backwards to Inna), as the artists wanted to [...] "stay in the shade" [...] reportedly because [...] "the Romanian audience has some bias". Following a time of speculation and controversy, the performers of the recording were finally revealed, with Inna writing on her website; [...] "I consider that a good song can be promoted and listened to without knowing by whom it is composed or who interprets it. With the help of 'Déjà Vu', I have showed this thing and, <b>look,</b> <b>again,</b> you – the audience – had the biggest intake. I thank you and don't forget that you are the only ones that can make a hit out of a song." ...|$|E

Nobody knows this better than the Material Girl." [...] Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH commented that [...] "you'd struggle {{to find a better}} show than Drowned World and you'd find it difficult to find a mainstream artist who can command near-universal respect for anything like as long as this fine lady. One could almost judge the artist by what was left out [...] she displayed that temptress quality which has beguiled us for nearly two decades and that, combined with her exquisite music, is why Madonna is so special." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote: [...] "Though her Cowgirl image is easily her least significant incarnation to date, Drowned World proves that Madonna is still unmatched in her ability to lift cultural iconography into the mainstream. [...] Those who thought Madonna hung up her handcuffs along with the notorious Sex book should <b>look</b> <b>again</b> closely. With its themes of chaos, dominance, and, ultimately, celebration, Madonna's Drowned World explores her ever-fervid intrigue with both imposed and pious restraint." ...|$|E
500|$|Walt Whitman {{is often}} {{described}} as America’s national poet, creating an image of America for itself. [...] "Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, {{and the rest of the}} world in a subordinate position." [...] In his study, [...] "The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should <b>look</b> <b>again</b> at Whitman’s nationalism: “Whitman’s seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [...] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away” (xv-xvi). Nathanael O’Reilly in an essay on [...] "Walt Whitman’s Nationalism in the First Edition of Leaves of Grass" [...] claims that [...] "Whitman’s imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights." [...] Whitman's imaginative [...] "mawkish" [...] nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay [...] "Racial attitudes","Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche." [...] The authors concluded their essay with: ...|$|E
500|$|The UK {{announced}} {{a test of}} opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community [...] "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped {{to get rid of}} this tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as [...] "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. [...] "I would ask them [...] to <b>look</b> <b>again</b> very carefully at what they rejected," [...] Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; [...] "the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them." ...|$|E

It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood. And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred miles – such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The volume {{consists}} of 46 pieces {{of poetry and}} essays. The subjects Jackson writes about are primarily children, animals and the environment. For example, one specific poem titled <b>Look</b> <b>Again,</b> Baby Seal promotes environmentalism as Jackson imagines anthropomorphic seals who brood {{about the fate of}} being killed by hunters. Another poem (So the Elephants March) presents elephants that refuse to be killed in order for ivory pieces to be made from their tusks. A third piece (Mother Earth) describes a struggle to cope with the discovery of an oil-covered seagull feather. To stress the theme of environmentalism and the necessity for action, Jackson writes in the essay: [...] "We've been treating Mother Earth the way some people treat a rental apartment. Just trash it and move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's {{argument}} is the claim that each of us possess what he calls a [...] "Cartesian theater", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind {{and that there is a}} place in the mind where it is observed. According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can <b>look</b> <b>again.</b> In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E
2500|$|Amba {{sought refuge}} with Parasurama, who ordered Bhishma to marry Amba, telling Bhishma {{it was his}} duty. Bhishma politely refused {{saying that he was}} ready to give up his life at the command of his teacher but not the promise that he had made. Upon the refusal, Parasurama called him for a fight at Kurukshetra. At the battlegrounds, while Bhishma was on a chariot, Parasurama was on foot. Bhishma {{requested}} Parasurama to also take a chariot and armor so that Bhishma would not have an unfair advantage. [...] Parasurama blessed Bhishma with the power of divine vision and asked him to <b>look</b> <b>again.</b> [...] When Bhishma looked at his guru with the divine eyesight, he saw the Earth as Parasurama's chariot, the four Vedas as the horses, the Upanishads as the reins, Vayu (wind) as the Charioteer and the Vedic goddesses Gayatri, , and Saraswati as his armor. Bhishma got down from the chariot and sought the blessings of Parashurama to protect his dharma, along with permission to battle against his teacher. Pleased, Parashurama blessed him and advised him to protect his vow as Parasurama himself had to fight to uphold his word as given to Amba. They fought for 23 days without conclusion, each too powerful to defeat the other.|$|E

Noah was charged with first-degree murder and assault. During the dispatch call to 911 shortly following the murder, Crooks revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his Call of Duty video game because his grades had turned poor {{and that this was}} the reason why he snapped. According to dispatch, Noah Crooks did not seem emotional even though he had murdered his mother a couple of hours earlier. On the night of April 14, 2012, in Clydebank, Scotland, a 13-year-old boy slashed his friend's throat after a session of Gears of War 3. The wound was deep enough to expose his trachea and required 20 staples after his surgery. In March 2013, Brian Docherty, a chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, commented that [...] "These games are rated 18 and shouldn't be played by children of this young age" [...] and that [...] "We need to <b>look</b> <b>again</b> at {{what we can do to}} [...]" [...] Similar and other effects were denounced in 2004 by Gary Webb in his article The Killing Game, exposing the use of increased reality video games by the US Army.|$|E
