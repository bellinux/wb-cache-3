Chemically, this material {{has been described as}} a <b>linear</b> <b>polyester</b> and has been noted for being naturally derived, robust and strongly resistant to chemical degradation as well as biodegradable. Despite these interesting properties little is known about the structure, chemistry or physical properties of the Colletes nest cell lining. This study investigates the nest cell linings of Colletes halophilus to addresses the discrepancies in the published literature on nest cell lining chemistry and structure. Using a variety of microscopical, analytical chemistry, mechanical and thermal characterization techniques a more complete model of the nest cell lining material is revealed. As opposed to simply being composed of a <b>linear</b> <b>polyester</b> as previously thought, the Colletes halophilus nest cell linings are shown to be biocomposite structures constructed from silk fibres laid down as a scaffolding for the application of a copolymer matrix composed of multiple ester containing compounds. Notably a composite structure has been revealed using SEM, TEM and confocal microscopy, and a more complex chemical composition revealed through FTIR and TOF techniques. Additionally, the Colletes halophilus nest cells show mechanical and thermal properties characteristic of a largely amorphous, thermoset polymer. These results advance the current understanding of the anatomy and behaviour of the Colletes bees as well as providing new information on the morphology and chemistry of the nest cell lining material.

Over the past few decades, there has been considerable interest in developing biodegradable drug carriers as effective drug delivery systems. Polymeric materials from natural sources {{play an important role in}} controlled release of drug at a particular site. Polyhydroxyalkanoates, due to their origin from natural sources, are given attention as candidates for drug delivery materials. Biodegradable and biocompatible polyhydroxyalkanoates are <b>linear</b> <b>polyesters</b> produced by microorganisms under unbalanced growth conditions, which have emerged as potential polymers for use as biomedical materials for drug delivery due to their unique physiochemical and mechanical properties. This review summarizes many of the key findings in the applications of polyhydroxyalkanoates and polyhydroxyalkanoate nanoparticles for drug delivery system...|$|R
