60|$|Of course, the sea {{rose with}} the wind frightfully; and I shall never forget the first three seas the Petite Jeanne shipped. She had fallen off, as vessels do at times when hove to, and the first sea made a clean breach. The <b>life</b> <b>lines</b> were only for the strong and well, and little good were they even for them when the women and children, the bananas and cocoanuts, the pigs and trade boxes, the sick and the dying, were swept along in a solid, screeching, groaning mass.|$|E
60|$|I called Captain Oudouse's {{attention}} to it, {{only to be}} informed that he had watched it going down for several hours. There was little to do, but that little he did very well, considering the circumstances. He took off the light sails, shortened right down to storm canvas, spread <b>life</b> <b>lines,</b> {{and waited for the}} wind. His mistake lay in what he did after the wind came. He hove to on the port tack, which {{was the right thing to}} do south of the Equator, if--and there was the rub--IF one were NOT in the direct path of the hurricane.|$|E

60|$|I've {{tried it}} both ways. I {{remember}} labouring in a fourteen days' gale {{off the coast}} of New Zealand. We were a tramp collier, rusty and battered, with six thousand tons of coal in our hold. <b>Life</b> <b>lines</b> were stretched fore and aft; and on our weather side, attached to smokestack guys and rigging, were huge rope-nettings, hung there for the purpose of breaking the force of the seas and so saving our mess-room doors. But the doors were smashed and the mess-rooms washed out just the same. And yet, out of it all, arose but the one feeling, namely, of monotony.|$|E
60|$|Wilson {{began to}} study Luigi's palm, tracing <b>life</b> <b>lines,</b> heart lines, head lines, and so on, and noting {{carefully}} their relations with the cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides; he felt of the fleshy cushion {{at the base of}} the thumb and noted its shape; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the base of the little finger and noted its shape also; he painstakingly examined the fingers, observing their form, proportions, and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose. All this process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest, their heads bent together over Luigi's palm, and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word. Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again, and his revelations began.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>life</b> <b>line</b> {{is perhaps}} the most {{controversial}} line on the hand. This line extends {{from the edge of the}} palm above the thumb and travels in an arc towards the wrist. This line is believed to represent the person's vitality and vigor, physical health and general well being. The <b>life</b> <b>line</b> is also believed to reflect major life changes, including cataclysmic events, physical injuries, and relocations. Contrary to popular belief, modern palmists generally do not believe that the length of a person's <b>life</b> <b>line</b> is tied to the length of a person's life.|$|R
