5|$|Gia Long {{had three}} wives. In 1780, {{during the war}} against the Tây Sơn, he married Tống Thị Lan, the {{daughter}} of a Nguyen general. She bore him two sons, the first being Nguyễn Phúc Chiêu, who died shortly after birth in Phú Quốc island, and later Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh. Following Gia Long's ascension to the throne, she became Empress consort and was given the title of Empress Thừa Thiên posthumously. Around 1781, during the war with the Tây Sơn, he married his second wife Trần Thị Đang, a daughter of one of his ministers. She bore him three sons, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, Nguyen Phuc Dai and Nguyen Phuc Chan, and was posthumously given the title of Empress Thuận Thiên. After his conquest of Vietnam, Gia Long, took his third wife, Lê Ngọc Bình. A daughter of Lê Hiển Tông, the second-last emperor of the Lê Dynasty, she was betrothed by Emperor Quang Trung to his son Quang Toản. After Gia Long defeated the Tây Sơn and executed Quang Toan, he took her as his wife. Binh bore him two princes, Nguyen Phuc Quan and Nguyen Phuc Cu, and princesses An Nghia Ngoc Ngon and My Khue Ngoc Khue. Gia Long had almost 100 concubines who were daughters of his mandarins; Gia <b>Long</b> <b>did</b> not favor polygamy but he did so to secure the loyalty of his inner circle.|$|E

At length the French gained {{possession of a}} large house, as also of the churchyard, into which they brought forward two pieces of cannon. General Jagow vainly endeavoured with the 7th Regiment to retake this house. The 1st Battalion of the 3rd Westphalian Landwehr displayed the most inflexible perseverance in its endeavours to drive the French out again from the churchyard: it made three unsuccessful attempts to cross an intervening ditch, and subsequently tried to gain a hollow way, which lay in the flank of that post, but falling upon the French reinforcements that were advancing towards it, they were compelled to abandon the enterprise.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the election Law held the support of no more than 40 of the 270 members of parliament; the remaining 130 were divided between Long and Chamberlain. Although Long believed he had the most MPs, his support was largely amongst backbenchers, and most of the whips and frontbenchers preferred Chamberlain. With Long and Chamberlain almost neck-and-neck they called a meeting on 9 November to discuss the possibility of a deadlock. Chamberlain suggested that he would withdraw if this became a strong possibility, assuming <b>Long</b> <b>did</b> the same. Long, now concerned that his weak health would not allow him to survive the stress of party leadership, agreed. Both withdrew on 10 November, and on 13 November 232 MPs assembled at the Carlton Club, and Law was nominated as leader by Long and Chamberlain. With the unanimous support of the MPs, Law became Leader of the Conservative Party despite never having sat in Cabinet.|$|E

While carrying Lawless with an electromagnet, The Collector says [...] "Care for a Rolo, sweet Xena?" [...] The reference was included because the writing staff were given free Rolos at the time. In The Collector's lair, several celebrities are seen stored in aluminized PET film bags.

[...] "There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with" [...] Hauge explained in the episode's DVD commentary. Other captives include actress Yasmine Bleeth, Gilligan from the series Gilligan's Island and Spock and Seven of Nine from Star Trek. The segment also features the series' first reference to , when The Collector uses a mint-condition of Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber. Because the episode was written before the film's release, the writers did not know [...] "how bad it was gonna be", in their view, and therefore did not include any [...] "obligatory shot" [...] at the film.

500|$|In August 2005, Long {{suffered}} an ankle injury and was sidelined as the 2005 Michigan Wolverines football team's season began. [...] The injury had been caused {{in training camp}} when he was zone blocking alongside center Mark Bihl, who got tangled up with nose tackle Gabe Watson. [...] The two fell against the outside of Long's leg and rolled over it. [...] The injury required surgery. <b>Long</b> <b>did</b> {{not return to the}} lineup until October 22 on the third possession against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was the lead blocker on the game-winning overtime touchdown. He started the game the subsequent week against the Northwestern Wildcats. [...] Two weeks later, following a bye week, Long got injured during the first half against the Indiana Hoosiers, and his foot was put in a protective boot. [...] The second foot injury was expected to end his season. [...] He appeared in the subsequent rivalry game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and during the first play, he opposed Bobby Carpenter and Carpenter got a broken leg. After the game, Long appeared to need immediate surgery, which would have caused him to miss the 2005 Alamo Bowl. By the time of the game on December 28, though, he was ready to play. [...] As the team prepared for 2006 spring practice, the left-handed Long was moved from right tackle to left tackle where he would be protecting the blindside of right-handed quarterbacks.|$|E

He immediately thought of its potential in surgery. Conveniently, a participant in one of those [...] "ether frolics", a student named James Venable, had two small tumors he wanted excised. But fearing the pain of surgery, Venable kept putting the operation off. Hence, Long suggested that he have his operation while under the influence of ether.

2500|$|The Six Years War was Gavin Long's {{short history}} of Australia's role in World War II. In 1943 Long {{proposed}} producing a {{short history of}} Australia's role in the war {{as soon as possible}} after the war ended.

The Six Years War is [...] "derived almost entirely" [...] from the work of the 13 authors of the official history series, and these authors drafted substantial parts of the book. While Long completed the book's manuscript in 1967, its publication was delayed until 1973 while the second volumes in the Navy and Civil series were completed.

2500|$|Muhammad is {{reported}} to have had mysterious seizures at the moments of inspiration. [...] According to Philip Schaff (1819–93), during his revelations Muhammad [...] "sometimes growled like a camel, foamed at his mouth, and streamed with perspiration." [...] Welch, a scholar of Islamic studies, in the Encyclopedia of Islam states that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, since they are unlikely to have been invented by later Muslims. According to Welch, these seizures should have been the most convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations for people around him. Others adopted alternative explanations for these seizures and claimed that he was possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician.
