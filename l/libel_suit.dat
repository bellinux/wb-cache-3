5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against the Liberal Party. Because libel laws {{do not apply}} to statements made in the House of Commons, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E
5|$|The cave {{was first}} {{opened to the}} public by the owner Captain G.W. Hodgkinson in 1927 {{following}} preparatory work by Balch. Three years later, John Cowper Powys wrote of the caves in the novel A Glastonbury Romance.

5|$|Harry Innes' <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against Joseph Street was {{not fully}} {{adjudicated}} in the Jessamine County Circuit Court until 1811. The jury found in Innes' favor and awarded $750 in damages, although Innes' counsel, Henry Clay and Robert Wickliffe, insisted that Innes only desired the vindication of a guilty verdict against Street {{and would not}} collect the damages. Soon after, Street shuttered the Western World and moved to Illinois.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against Marshall {{dragged on}} in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, fashion {{designer}} Dawn Simorangkir brought a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against Love concerning a defamatory post Love made on her Twitter account, which was settled for $450,000. Six years later, Simorangkir filed another lawsuit against Love for further defamatory Twitter posts, and Love paid a further $350,000 in recompense. A similar suit was brought against Love by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes in 2014, who also accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages. It {{was the first}} case of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history {{to make it to}} trial. The jury, however, found in Love's favor.|$|E

Holloway's parents {{responded by}} filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.|$|E
5|$|Morgan was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 {{and returned to}} Jamaica shortly afterward {{to serve as the}} territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica {{in the absence of the}} post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed of Morgan has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.|$|E
5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, {{including}} at least one <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E

5|$|After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology {{mounted a}} public {{relations}} campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he {{considered to be an}} objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against Time Warner and Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, {{the real-life}} Münchhausen {{fought for the}} Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Upon {{retiring}} in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which {{was first published in}} Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a <b>libel</b> <b>suit,</b> Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Egyptian television in 1998, hosting the current affairs and press review talk show Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief"). The program {{became one of}} the most popular and respected in Egypt. After apparent trouble with the state censors, Qandil moved the show to Dubai TV in 2004 under the name Qalam Rosas ("Pencil.") The new program was highly watched throughout the Arab world. He was forced to quit Dubai TV after criticizing Arab governments and subsequently hosted the show on the Libyan channel Al-Libia for two months before the Libyan government cancelled it. He {{returned to}} Egypt and wrote for the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper and then Al-Shorouk, but his association with the latter ended as a result of a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> brought on by then-Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit in response to a column critical of Egyptian foreign policy written by Qandil in May 2010. The case was later dropped following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.|$|E

5|$|In 1843 Hogg {{became the}} target of a {{blackmail}} attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane's marital status. Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a <b>libel</b> <b>suit,</b> Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not {{to draw attention to the}} fact that they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|Raspe, {{probably}} {{for fear of}} a <b>libel</b> <b>suit</b> from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed {{that it was a}} competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, Karl Reinhard.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} {{existing}} libel laws apply to Internet publishing {{was established by}} the Keith-Smith v Williams case of 2006, but the time limit of one year after publication for <b>libel</b> <b>suits</b> {{does not apply to}} Internet publishing because each incidence of material being accessed on the Internet is defined as a new publication. As a result, many newspapers and journals do not publish controversial material in their on-line archives due to a fear of potential <b>libel</b> <b>suits.</b> In addition, individuals without the financial means to defend themselves against <b>libel</b> <b>suits</b> can also be reluctant to publish controversial material on-line. With older forms of publishing the media companies themselves had legal responsibility for posts but with social media such as Twitter it is the users and not their online hosts who have legal responsibility. Individuals who are defamed online may also not have the financial means to seek legal redress. The UK Ministry of Justice drew up plans in 2008 to give such individuals access to cheap low-cost legal recourse but these proposals were never implemented. Instead the Defamation Act 2013 (which came into force on 1 January 2014) reformed libel law to allow new defences and introduce a requirement for claimants to show that they have suffered serious harm. The intention behind the reform was to make it harder to bring <b>libel</b> <b>suits</b> in Britain.|$|R
