Police suspected Berkman, {{although there was}} no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two <b>local</b> <b>labor</b> activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E

Disque, a former army captain, to the Pacific Northwest to {{determine}} if <b>local</b> <b>labor</b> issues within the forest products industry could be quickly resolved. Disque met with mill owners {{and representatives of the}} Industrial Workers of the World, the union that was trying to organize loggers and sawmill workers in the Pacific Northwest. After studying the situation for several months, Disque determined that the long-standing labor management dispute could not be resolved without direct intervention by the army. Based on Disque's report, the United States Army Signal Corps was given the job of reorganizing the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest to support United States war production.|$|E

5|$|With his war service loan, Whitlam built a {{house in}} seaside Cronulla. He also bought the block of land next door, using the prize money (£1,000 in {{security}} bonds) he received for winning the Australian National Quiz Championship in 1948 and 1949 (he was runner-up in 1950). He sought {{to make a career}} in the ALP there, but <b>local</b> <b>Labor</b> supporters were sceptical of Whitlam's loyalties, given his privileged background. In the postwar years, he practised law, concentrating on landlord/tenant matters, and sought to build his bona fides in the party. He ran twice—unsuccessfully—for the local council, once (also unsuccessfully) for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and campaigned for other candidates. In 1951, Bert Lazzarini, the Labor member for the Federal electorate of Werriwa, announced that he would stand down at the next election. Whitlam won the preselection as ALP candidate. Lazzarini died in 1952 before completing his term and Whitlam was elected to the House of Representatives in the ensuing by-election on 29 November 1952. Whitlam trebled Lazzarini's majority in a 12per cent swing to Labor.|$|E

Each NECTA consists of a cluster of cities and towns defined by commuting patterns, which therefore correspond roughly to <b>local</b> <b>labor</b> markets.

Shanker also argued that exposing the labor movement's internal disputes to labor's enemies seriously risked weakening the labor movement.
