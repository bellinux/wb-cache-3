Stripping the building's {{materials}} was an arduous process, as the hotel was made of stiffer material than earlier buildings had, and the granite, precious metals, and wood chips used in the old hotel were not in high demand. Most of the wood eventually either went into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> materials {{that made up the}} old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean off the shore of Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

Despite this, O'Keefe was nominated for the League One Apprentice of the Year award, eventually losing out to Carlisle United defender Tom Aldred. The following season, O'Keefe featured more regularly for the first team, making nine appearances in total despite missing two months of the season due to a hernia injury sustained in a match against Millwall on 26 January 2010.

30|$|All MCL-based {{localization}} schemes, {{there are}} two main inferiors generally. The first is that sampling and filtering iteratively consume <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> energy. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> is that higher localization accuracy is achieved through increasing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> anchors. These bring out extraordinary consequences, especially for WSNs, energy-constraint and economic-constraint applications. Thus, there are some improved spaces for MCL-based localization for mobile WSNs. Besides MCL methods used for mobile WSNs, there are several other localization methods for mobile WSNs, such as localization scheme based on convex method, localization based on geometric constraints, and localization based on perpendicular bisector of a chord [46 – 48].|$|R

The emigrants discovered not plowed fields and a village but forested land, being somewhat misled by wording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> De Tijd advertisements: the word “acres” was translated as akkers, meaning cultivated land.
