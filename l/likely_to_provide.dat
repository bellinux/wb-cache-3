5|$|By {{the late}} 1820s Jennings was {{critically}} short of cash. He depended on income from political office {{to pay his}} expenses. His farm was not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient financial support. Because the thirty-eight-year-old Jennings was prohibited by law from running for reelection to a third term as Indiana governor in 1823, {{he was forced to}} consider other political options. Jennings decided to return to Congress.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game will enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> assistance).|$|E
5|$|In 1648, {{during the}} Second English Civil War, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his {{brother-in-law}} William II, Prince of Orange, seemed more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> substantial {{aid to the}} royalist cause than his mother's French relations. However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control {{was not used to}} any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist Engager army of the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a complete explanation.|$|E

25|$|They {{were largely}} {{restricted}} to environments {{that are less}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> good fossils. Floodplains as the best terrestrial environments for fossilization provide few mammal fossils, because they are dominated by medium to large animals, and the mammals could not compete with archosaurs in the medium to large size range. Tracks from the Early Cretaceous of Angola show the existence of raccoon-size mammals 118 Million years ago.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} that other non-trait elements of personality may correlate with happiness. For instance, one study demonstrated that various features of one's goals, such as progress towards important goals or conflicts between them, can affect both emotional and cognitive well-being. Several {{other researchers have}} also suggested that, at least in more individualistic cultures, having a coherent sense of one's personality (and acting {{in a way that}} conforms to that self-concept) is positively related to well-being. Thus, focusing solely on extraversion—or even extraversion and neuroticism—is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an incomplete picture of the relationship between happiness and personality.|$|E
25|$|Species, {{including}} humans, {{known to}} possess animal cognition require {{large amounts of}} energy, and have adapted to specific conditions, including an abundance of atmospheric oxygen {{and the availability of}} large quantities of chemical energy synthesized from radiant energy. If humans are to colonize other planets, true Earth analogs in the CHZ are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the closest natural habitat; this concept was the basis of Stephen H. Dole's 1964 study. With suitable temperature, gravity, atmospheric pressure and the presence of water, the necessity of spacesuits or space habitat analogues on the surface may be eliminated and complex Earth life can thrive.|$|E

40|$|Though some {{programs}} that were created to promote homeownership in the United States, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been harshly criticized {{in the wake of}} the housing crisis, we are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> some form of taxpayer-funded assistance to those who would become homeowners.

25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
25|$|There are two bright spots. One: We {{can improve}} the quality of care and cut costs without rationing. There are models out there for how to do it right -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that are doing a better job for less. Their doctors are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care.

25|$|Studies {{of genetic}} {{disorders}} are often performed {{by means of}} family-based studies. In some instances population based approaches are employed, {{particularly in the case}} of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a geneticist-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the Human Genome Project are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> increased availability of genetic testing for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} research is to document the level of personal assistance support <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> students with severe physical disabilities by disability support services in higher education institutions across the United States. A national survey was conducted {{of members of the}} Association of Higher Education And Disability (AHEAD) via an online survey. Of the 326 respondents with usable responses, 36 (14. 1 %) stated they provided some level of personal assistance services to students with severe physical disabilities, ranging from providing emergency services (25 or 69. 4 %) <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> residential services with in-house personal assistants (4 or 11. 1 %). Personal assistance support to students with severe physical disabilities were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>provided</b> at master’s, comprehensive, and research universities and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>provided</b> at bachelor’s, associate’s, and trade/technical schools. Those who provided personal assistant support were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be able to identify students with severe physical dis-abilities who were negatively impacted by the lack of personal assistance support, were more satisfied with their personal assistance support services, had longer tenure in disability support services, and had greater numbers of part-time staff.

25|$|In 1998, Steven Kirsh {{reported}} in the journal Childhood {{that the use of}} video games may lead to acquisition of a hostile attribution bias. Fifty-five subjects were randomised to play either violent or non-violent video games. Subjects were later asked to read stories in which the characters' behaviour was ambiguous. Participants randomised to play violent video games were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> negative interpretations of the stories. Another study done by Anderson and Dill in 2000 found that violence in video games increases aggressive behavior in the short term although other scholars have suggested that results from this study were not consistent, and that the methodology was flawed.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of The Law Society of Scotland, solicitors were in most areas organized into a local Faculty of Procurators or Faculty of Procurators and Solicitors. These societies still exist, but their influence has waned. Whereas membership was once required in order to practise law in a particular locality, as long as a solicitor is registered with The Law Society of Scotland this is no longer the case. The local societies are now more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their members with a well-stocked law library, continuing professional development courses (all solicitors in Scotland are required to complete 30 hours of continuing professional development each year), and lobby on behalf of their members with The Law Society of Scotland and The Scottish Government regarding future legal developments.|$|E
25|$|Employment {{conditions}} abroad {{are relevant}} to the individual worker and their families {{as well as for the}} sending country and its economic growth and well being. Poor working conditions for Filipinos hired abroad include long hours, low wages and few chances to visit family. Women often face disadvantages in their employment conditions as they tend to work in the elder/child care and domestic. These occupations are considered low skilled and require little education and training, thereby regularly facing poor working conditions. Women facing just working conditions are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their children with adequate nutrition, better education and sufficient health. There is a strong correlation between women's rights and the overall well being of children. It is therefore a central question to promote women's rights in order to promote children's capabilities.|$|E

25|$|As the {{possibility}} of a 2006 Liberal leadership convention emerged during the midpoint of the election campaign, most media speculation focused on the surfeit of potential candidates poised to replace Martin.

Such speculation seemed rooted in the assumption that high-profile members of the Chrétien cabinet that had elected not to challenge the Martin juggernaut in 2003 (most commonly enumerated as John Manley, Allan Rock, Brian Tobin and Martin Cauchon) would return to federal politics, along with 2003 runner-up Sheila Copps and Martin's own presumptive heir Frank McKenna, prompting a balanced matchup between multiple household names.|$|E
25|$|Adult male macaques try to {{maximize}} their reproductive success by entering into sex with females, both in and outside the breeding period. Females prefer to mate with males that will increase the survival of their young. Thus, a consort male provides resources for his female and protects her from predators. Larger, more dominant males are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for the females. The breeding period can last up to 11 days, and a female usually mates with four males during that time. Male rhesus macaques have not been observed to fight for access to sexually receptive females, although they suffer more wounds during the mating season. Female macaques first breed when they are four years old, and reach menopause at around 25 years of age. When mating, a male rhesus monkey usually ejaculates less than 15 seconds after sexual penetration. Male macaques generally play no role in raising the young, but do have peaceful relationships with the offspring of their consort pairs.|$|E
25|$|Japanese POWs were interrogated {{multiple}} times during their captivity. Most Japanese soldiers were interrogated by intelligence {{officers of the}} battalion or regiment which had captured them for information {{which could be used}} by these units. Following this they were rapidly moved to rear areas where they were interrogated by successive echelons of the Allied military. They were also questioned once they reached a POW camp in Australia, New Zealand, India or the United States. These interrogations were painful and stressful for the POWs. Similarly, Japanese sailors rescued from sunken ships by the US Navy were questioned at the Navy's interrogation centres in Brisbane, Honolulu and Noumea. Allied interrogators found that Japanese soldiers were much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> useful intelligence than Imperial Japanese Navy personnel, possibly due to differences in the indoctrination provided to members of the services. Force was not used in interrogations at any level, though on one occasion headquarters personnel of the US 40th Infantry Division debated, but ultimately decided against, administering sodium penthanol to a senior non-commissioned officer.|$|E
