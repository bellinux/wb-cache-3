40|$|Abstract – Software {{product lines}} have known an {{increasing}} use {{over the last}} years, taking advantage from the important benefits they may bring to software development in terms of time, cost and effort. However, product line approaches remain immature owing {{to the fact that}} they still base on traditional design concepts of software engineering which are not adequate to the basic principles of software product <b>lines</b> <b>engineering.</b> Considering that software product lines are inspired by industry where production activity is based on assembling certified components, and in light of the recent progress in Component-based development field, we believe that integrating these two approaches will bring significant benefits to software development. This paper describes a new approach for Component-Based Product <b>Lines</b> <b>engineering</b> focusing on the Component-Based specification of the Product Line architecture. The aim is to overcome the shortcomings of traditional product lines by unifying the strengths of two complementary approaches, and to facilitate the derivation process since applications will be produced by the simple composition of existing components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reuse-oriented {{software}} methodologies {{have emerged}} to pro-vide {{a set of}} rules or guides for development and evolution of software systems by reusing existing domain engineering artefacts such as require-ments, architecture, components, test cases, etc. Domain engineering methods, such as software product <b>lines</b> <b>engineering,</b> aim at reducing development time, eort, cost, and complexity by taking advantage of the commonality within a portfolio of similar products. However, these methodologies are not based on specic domains, instead they cover a wide range of domains without considering particularities within them. Therefore, in this work we dene a novel approach in which the creation of a software product line is guided by a subdomain analysis process, oriented to a particular case within the marine ecology domain. The methodology is then applied to a specic organization {{in order to create a}} product of the line...|$|R

Whereas ongoing research keeps improving their expressiveness, formalisation and automation, more experience reports on their usage in real projects are needed. This paper describes some challenges encountered during the re-engineering of PloneMeeting, an Open Source software family, into a software product line. The main challenging issues we could observe were (i) the ambiguity originating from implicit information (missing definitions of feature labels and unclear modelling viewpoint), (ii) the necessity of representing spurious features, (iii) the difficulty of making diagrams and constraints resistant to change, and (iv) the risks of using feature attributes to represent large sets of subfeatures. Our study reveals the limitations of current constructs, and calls for both language and methodological improvements. It also suggests further comparative evaluations of modelling alternatives. ...|$|R
