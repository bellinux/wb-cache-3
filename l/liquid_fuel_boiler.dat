40|$|The {{undertaken}} {{project is}} a case study, focusing primarily on the energy efficiency improvement of an industrial partner in the food processing industry through the recovery of low grade waste heat. An analysis of the energy efficiency (enthalpy and exergy) of the plant was carried out and consequently the installation of standard heat recovery devices have been recommended (plate heat exchangers, reboiler etc.) {{for the improvement of}} energy efficiency. Additionally, a novel heat recovery technology is discussed which allows for the recovery of low grade waste heat from boiler flue gases with a complementary reduction in NOx gas emissions through combustion air prehumidification. As part of this project, experiments have been carried out to investigate the impact of boiler combustion air prehumidification on the NOx gas emissions of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> burning <b>boiler.</b> Previously, no such experiments had been carried out on <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> burning <b>boilers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The BIOFLAM project {{intends to}} provide {{solutions}} to the problem of environmental impact of combustion of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> for heating purposes. Oil burners show up to date a very poor power modulation especially at low power outputs, as usually needed in domestic appliances. Liquid biofuels like FAME are also not compatible with conventional oil burner technologies. Furthermore, the integration of oil burners in wall-hung systems requires further burner size reductions. Within the EC-funded BIOFLAM project new <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> fired condensing <b>boilers</b> are being developed showing such major features as a power modulation of at least 10 : 1, ultra low CO and NOx emissions over the entire power modulation range, significantly more compactness than conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> fired <b>boilers</b> and compatibility with renewable <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> like FAME. In order to reach these goals new ceramic premixed <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> burners were developed based on the combination of the innovative cool flame vaporization process and the novel porous medium burner concept. High temperature ceramics, condensing boiler technology with condense water neutralization and innovative burner controls with a power modulation were utilized, in order to realize all the principal advantages of the employed technologies...|$|R

40|$|A {{goal of this}} master‘s final {{project is}} the {{analysis}} of rapeseed oil and the prospects of its usage as energy <b>fuel</b> in household <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>boilers.</b> In this project, some properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> were analysed, also {{the production of the}} fuel and its usage in Lithuania and in Europe which showed that this fuel has a lot of raw material and a simple process of making it compared to pure diesel fuel. The properties of rapeseed oil and diesel mixture were introduced, their layering test was performed. The analysis of combustion and flue gas of the various mixtures of diesel and rapeseed oil was made. The analysis of the fuel consumption of the boiler was also made, which showed, that 10 - 40 % amount of rapeseed oil in diesel increases <b>boiler</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption by 3 - 6 %. In order to evaluate the efficiency of <b>boiler</b> <b>fuel</b> injection system and the probability of soot formation in the combustion chamber, 5 liters of 70 % diesel and 30 % rapeseed oil mixture were burned, which showed that the fuel mixture is sprayed efficiently and any formation of soot wasn`t noticed. Calculation of the cost of 1 kWh by burning diesel and rapeseed oil mixtures showed that 20 - 40 % amount of rapeseed oil increases the production of thermal energy cost by 8 - 18 %. In this final project the short-term studies and analysis were made. In order to get more reliable results, it is necessary to make long-term combustion tests at various ambient conditions and combustion parameters...|$|R

When utilized for electrical power generation, these plants will operate with efficiencies greater than 60 % and produce near zero emissions of traditional stack gas pollutants. The new process partially gasifies coal at elevated pressure producing a coal-derived syngas and a char residue. The syngas {{can be used to}} fuel the most advanced power producing equipment such as solid oxide fuel cells or gas turbines, or processed to produce clean <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> or chemicals for industrial users.

40|$|SCA Obbola AB is a {{kraft pulp}} mill that {{produces}} and sells packaging paper. The steam demand {{is covered by}} a recovery boiler and a solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> (consists of two parallel solid fuel furnaces and a boiler). Adjustments in steam production are foremost made by the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Previously made energy-reducing measures at the mill has lowered the steam demand which forces the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> to low steam production. The solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> produces over 25 GWH/year and is therefor bound by the Swedish nitrous oxide charge, but is also restricted to a monthly mean value of 70 mg/MJ. This mean value was exceeded in July 2016, which {{is thought to be}} a result of forced limitation in steam production. NOx emissions are reduced secondarily by an urea-based SNCR-system where its efficiency depends on several parameters, foremost sufficiently high flue gas temperatures. This work has identified parameters that effects foremost hydrogen-based combustion emission from the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> This was achieved by evaluating historical data and by conducting tests during operation of the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> which was planned and evaluated using a software called MODDE. Emission reducing measures and recommended ways to operate the boiler was then presented from the collected data. Practical measures including down-winding supply machinery of secondary air and replacement of urea injection showed no tendencies in reducing NOx emissions. However, complete shut down of one the furnaces produced at least 100 °C higher flue gas temperatures produced from the active furnace. Low NOx emissions was noted when secondary air was supplied from machinery with original speed. therefor, during stretched periods with low steam production, it's recommended that: Only one furnace should be active as steam producer, urea should be injected at its original placement in the flue gas chamber close the furnace and that secondary air should be supplied by machinery with original speed. Comparison test made in this work showed that this way of operating the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> could reduce NOx emissions with 45 % compared to mean NOx emissions at low steam production in July 2016...|$|R

40|$|Future regulations, {{such as the}} ultra low {{emissions}} vehicle (ULEV) {{specified by}} the California Air Resources Board (CARB), are placing stricter limits on the allowable hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and make {{the understanding of the}} sources of HC emissions of considerable importance. Previous researchers have identified six sources of hydrocarbon emissions: oil layers, deposits, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> quenching, crevices, and exhaust valve leakage. The objective of this research was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> contribution to hydrocarbon emissions.

40|$|This {{computational}} {{study examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> depth on flame spread across propanol pools with and without forced, opposed air flow. The initial pool temperature is below its closed- cup flash point temperature T(sub cc); so the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> must be heated sufficiently to create a combustible mixture of fuel vapor before ignition and flame spread can occur. Furthermore, {{in order for the}} flame to spread, an approximate rule is that the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame must be heated above T(sub cc) so that a flammable mixture just above the lean limit exists ahead of the flame. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would affect the heating of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool and thus the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> surface temperature ahead of the flame. It has been observed experimentally and numerically that, at normal gravity without forced gas-phase flow and with the initial pool temperature T(sub 0) in a range well below T(sub cc), the flame periodically accelerates and decelerates (pulsates) as it propagates. The depth of a <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> pool would change this range of T(sub 0) since it would affect the heating of the pool...|$|R
