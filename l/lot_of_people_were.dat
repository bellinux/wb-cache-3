500|$|Devers {{returned}} to the Military Academy for the third time, this time as graduate manager of athletics. The superintendent was now Major General William Durward Connor, an officer renowned for his sharp tongue. Devers later recalled that [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> afraid of General Connor. He called me a moron once a week". The responsibility had grown considerably since the days when Devers was a cadet. Then there were only six varsity team sports; by 1936 there were eighteen. Despite the Great Depression, the Athletic Boards, which Devers ran, had accumulated considerable funds. His major task was {{the construction of new}} playing fields where there {{did not appear to be}} any available land. He came up with a plan to move the right of way of the West Shore Railroad. He found the railroad welcoming of the plan, as a shorter, straighter route saved them money. The new fields were completed in December 1936. He was promoted to full colonel on 1 July 1938.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much better. If we had more time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E

However, in September 2007, DJ Kay Slay revealed that he and Papoose had left Jive, commenting that they had [...] "almost [...] victims of A hell." [...] This was due to Jive wanting Papoose to be a more commercial artist. He would say, [...] "The business part and the politics of the game kinda got in the way.

2500|$|In 1973, film {{producer}} George Roy Hill contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately, asking each man {{to write the}} score for a film project he was working on: The Sting. Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments. Instead Hill found Marvin Hamlisch available, and brought him into the project as composer. Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin's music for The Sting, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of [...] "The Entertainer" [...] reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting The New York Times to write, [...] "The whole nation has begun to take notice." [...] Thanks to the film and its score, Joplin's work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world, becoming (in the words of music magazine Record World), the [...] "classical phenomenon of the decade." [...] Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin's style and his band adaptations from Schuller's style. Schuller said Hamlisch, [...] "...got the Oscar for music he didn't write (since it is by Joplin) and arrangements he didn't write, and 'editions' he didn't make. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> upset by that, but that's show biz!" ...|$|E
2500|$|PVRIS {{planned to}} call the album Haunt or have it self-titled, however they were quite indecisive. Eventually they agreed on naming it {{after one of the}} songs, [...] "White Noise". All of the {{material}} that features on White Noise was written by Lyndsey Gunnulfsen and producer Blake Harnage of VERSA, with the exception of [...] "Holy", [...] "Fire" [...] and [...] "Eyelids", which were written by Gunnulfsen, Harnage and Sierra Kusterbeck. Gunnulfsen wrote the songs while she was [...] "in a very dark place in my mind". Compared to the band's previous output, Gunnulfsen said that White Noise [...] "is very different from what a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> expecting but in the best way". She explained that the album's sound was [...] "rock mixed with electronic/pop kind of stuff", resulting in [...] "a lot of different vibes throughout the album." [...] Gunnulfsen was inspired by Saosin, Circa Survive, Ellie Goulding, Rihanna, and The Weeknd. Gavin Lloyd of Classic Rock wrote that the album featured [...] "infectious rock" [...] done by the likes of Paramore and We Are the In Crowd, and [...] "dark electro-pop" [...] performed by artists such as Purity Ring and Banks. Natasha Van Duser of Inked compared the [...] "steady bass lines, groovy backbeats, and melodic vocals" [...] to the likes of Taylor Swift's 1989 (2014).|$|E

2500|$|Other sources {{indicate}} {{the replacement of}} Detroit's large electric streetcar network with buses & highways was much more controversial. [...] In 1930, Detroit had 30 electric streetcar lines over 534 miles of track. [...] In 1941, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds at peak times. Wartime restrictions on vital war materials such as rubber and gasoline caused particularly heavy use of the streetcar system during the 1940s. [...] However, {{between the end of}} the war and 1949, the city discontinued half of its 20 streetcar lines. Five more were discontinued in 1951 — three of them switched abruptly to bus lines during a DSR strike. More closings followed until August 1955, when Mayor Albert Cobo, who promoted freeway construction as the way of the future, urged City Council to sell the city's recently purchased fleet of modern streetcars to Mexico City. [...] It was a controversial move. A newspaper poll showed that Detroiters, by a margin of 3-to-1, opposed the switch to buses. Some even jeered the sunken freeways Cobo championed, dubbing them [...] "Cobo canals." [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> against the decision... A common complaint was about the sale of the [...] cars, that the city didn't get its money's worth. Of course, the city had an answer for anything. ..." [...] On April 8, 1956, the last streetcar in Detroit rolled down Woodward Avenue. After less than 10 years in service, Detroit's fleet of streamlined streetcars was loaded on railcars and shipped to Mexico City, where they ran for another 30 years.|$|E
