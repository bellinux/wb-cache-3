40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and an unbalanced torque or twist-liveliness is created. Generally, the torque depends on yarn geometric {{factors such as}} the <b>yarn</b> <b>twist</b> and linear density and the fibre properties. In order to prevent the instability of yarn (e. g., snarling), twist-liveliness must be controlled. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold <b>yarn.</b> This <b>twisting</b> or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free. In the present paper, the instability of <b>twisted</b> textile <b>yarns</b> will be interpreted using the Topological Conservation Law (Fuller, 1971) which has been developed to study the dynamics of twisted rods by Van der Heijden et al. (2003). The present work considers the equilibrium configuration of a series of multi-ply <b>twisted</b> <b>yarns</b> (2, 4, 8, and 16 strands) of finite length. The influence of structural properties (the number of strands, the diameter and twist of each strand) on the parameters of a balanced multi-ply <b>yarn</b> (writhe and <b>twist)</b> using a topological invariant of the <b>twisted</b> <b>yarn</b> (link) is established and investigated using experimental results obtained at CSIRO. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>twist</b> in a <b>yarn</b> helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less <b>twist</b> than a <b>yarn</b> with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the yarn, {{strength}}, the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp <b>yarns,</b> and highly <b>twisted</b> <b>yarns</b> are, in general, stronger.
