40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals with properties of cathode materials for <b>Lithium-Ion</b> <b>accumulators.</b> The theoretical part {{consists of an}} overview of the cathode materials and a brief introduction into the very wide area of <b>Lithium-Ion</b> <b>accumulators.</b> The goal of this work was to study the LiCoO 2 cathode material and to prepare some modifications of it by doping with other elements. This work was then extended with the study of the new generation of high-voltage cathode materials. The aim of this part was to study their synthesis, their physical and electrochemical properties and the influence of used electrolytes on their electrochemical stability. The work then focuses on the influence of doping these materials and the influence of another part of the battery – the separator – on the overall properties of these types of cathode materials. The results show that doping the LiCoO 2 cathode material with sodium and potassium lead to an enhancement of some electrochemical properties as stability during cycling or stability at higher loads and also the long-term stability during aging is better. The LiNi 0, 5 Mn 1, 5 O 4 high voltage material was synthetized in both its forms in comparable or even better quality compared with the results from foreign laboratories. The synthesis process was watched in-situ by SEM, thanks to which a unique study of the ongoing changes during synthesis was done. Also the best suitable electrolytes for this material were identified from the viewpoint of stability at high voltages, which is important for the future practical use. Doping of the material with chromium resulted in better stability and capacity both during cycling at standard conditions and at higher temperature and load. A significant impact of the separators on the overall electrochemical properties of the cathode materials was proved, which could be a big benefit for their future usage...|$|R

Nevertheless, the advantages offered by the Lithium-ion technology in terms of better charging/discharging efficiencies and ageing make <b>lithium-ion</b> <b>accumulators</b> more and more envisioned in such applications. In this paper, sizing optimisations of SAPV systems have been lead for each accumulator technology considered. The photovoltaic system has been simulated hour by hour on the whole cycle life duration. Experimental outcomes, lead {{in order to establish}} a complete energetic model for Li-ion accumulators, are presented in this paper.
