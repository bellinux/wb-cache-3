In 1957 both the <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> city coat of arms were newly arranged by the designer Eduard Ege. At the same time, the city council set the resolution on the December 17, 1957 that the large one was no longer for official use but only for particular representative purposes.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E

Other sports clubs represent association football, cricket and running.|$|E

A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red leaf spot or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, King Ludwig I {{granted the}} city its old {{coat of arms}} again {{in the form of}} <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> crests. These {{embodied}} the small crest seal of 1304 and the large one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, though this was later corrected to argent under Ludwig II in 1865. The background was rarely changed. One example of its occurrence, however, was when or was used in the 16th century instead.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E

5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs.

The monuments {{are generally}} of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock {{with a combination of}} <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.|$|E

5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, {{to allow for the}} changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage {{was caused by the}} initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, <b>large</b> <b>and</b> <b>small.</b> They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
