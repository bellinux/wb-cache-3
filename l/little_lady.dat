However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did not reflect the dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E

[...] "Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> from Coconut Grove", McCarthy wrote in the introduction of A River in Flood.|$|E

[...] On {{the reverse of}} each Sammy Sneeze page appears a non-Sammy Sneeze strip—the complete run of McCay's The Story of Hungry Henrietta, as well as selections from John Prentiss Benson's The Woozlebeasts, and Gustave Verbeek's The Upside-Downs of <b>Little</b> <b>Lady</b> Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo and The Terrors of the Tiny Tads.

500|$|Despite these criticisms, {{the novel}} still {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, [...] "So this is the <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> who started this great war." [...] Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, {{following}} the Bible.

In {{the first year after}} it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States; one million copies in Great Britain. In 1855, three years after it was published, it was called [...] "the most popular novel of our day." [...] The impact attributed to the book is great, reinforced by a story that when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe {{at the start of the}} Civil War, Lincoln declared, [...] "So this is the <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> who started this great war."

The Lincoln matter was getting large-scale press attention and the senators became commonly known as the [...] "Keating Five". All the senators denied they had done anything improper in the matter, and said Keating's contributions made no difference to their actions. The senators' initial defense of their actions rested on Keating being one of their constituents; McCain said, [...] "I have done this kind of thing many, many times," [...] and said the Lincoln case was like [...] "helping the <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> who didn't get her Social Security." [...] Some of the five hired high-power Washington lawyers to represent them– including Charles Ruff for Glenn and John Dowd for McCain– while others feared that to do so would give the appearance their political careers were in jeopardy.|$|E

When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun.

He stated that [...] "Gaga has often {{been accused of being}} all artifice and no heart, but tonight's show is a powerful statement from a star who refuses to be pinned down or written off." [...] Daniel Dylan Wray from The Independent awarded the Birmingham concert with 4 out of 5 stars and described ArtRave as [...] "loud, colourful and frequently emblematic of feel-good, throwaway party times". Katie Fitzpatrick from Manchester Evening News awarded the concert with 5 out of 5 stars. She praised Lady Gaga's voice, her live band, the outfits and the connection of the fans – especially in this show that Gaga helped a fan to propose to his partner on stage. Katie stated that [...] "the ostentatiously named ArtRave may reaffirm that Gaga the show-woman is definitely about her art. But this <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> with the powerful set of lungs is also undoubtedly all heart." [...] Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the Financial Times rated the concert three out of five stars. He criticized the songs from Artpop except the title track, but complimented the acoustic and piano sequences.|$|E

500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions.

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{was clearly}} Stowe's magnum opus (although she {{considered}} Old Town Folks, {{which was written}} {{while she was in}} Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying [...] "So this is the <b>little</b> <b>lady</b> who made this big war?" [...] Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it [...] "uneven in quality and unstable in stance". More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it [...] "downright offensive" [...] and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features—comparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example—and writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.|$|E

In the dénouement of The <b>Little</b> <b>Lady</b> of the Big House, the heroine, confronted by the pain of a mortal gunshot wound, undergoes a physician-assisted suicide by morphine.

So fond of babes was this little mother that she had always room near her for one more, and often have I seen her in the Gardens, the centre of a dozen mites who gazed awestruck at her while she told them severely how <b>little</b> <b>ladies</b> and gentlemen behave. They were children of the well-to-pass, and she was from Drury Lane, but they believed in her as the greatest of all authorities on <b>little</b> <b>ladies</b> and gentlemen, and the more they heard of how these romantic creatures keep themselves tidy and avoid pools and wait till they come to a gate, the more they admired them, though their faces showed how profoundly they felt that to be <b>little</b> <b>ladies</b> and gentlemen was not for them.
