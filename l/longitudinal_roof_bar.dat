40|$|Analysis of the {{sensitivity}} of the support unit static parameters to the changes in the inclination angle of a <b>roof</b> <b>bar</b> The article presents how the changes in the inclination angle of a <b>roof</b> <b>bar</b> impact the static load of the support unit elements. The change of this angle is the result of adapting geometrical features of the support unit to an unparallel roof and floor of the excavation. On the basis of low, middle and high support units it was found out that minor changes in the inclination angle of the <b>roof</b> <b>bar</b> result in significant changes in the load-bearing capacity of the support unit and the values of forces in the joints of the support development mechanism. key words: mining, mechanization, powered suport, load-bearing capacity of the support uni...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to design a one-nave steel structure industrial hall in Jablonne nad Orlici with dimensions 63 x 30 m and 15. 0 m in height of the structure.

The roof structure is designed in a variant of saddle roof with truss girder and truss purling with {{the function of the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>roof</b> bracing. The columns are solid panel fixed to the foundation pad. The main construction material is steel classed as S 355.

50|$|To {{benefit the}} safety of the drivers, NASCAR {{improved}} the roll cage that surrounds the driver after a large amount testing in the NASCAR Research and Development Center. The improvement features a new forward <b>roof</b> <b>bar</b> and center <b>roof</b> support <b>bar</b> that intersects {{in the center of the}} front section of the roll cage. NASCAR later released cosmetic changes to the 2013 car, including the driver's last name on the windshield, the sponsor's logo placed on the roof, the team logo being moved from the headlights to the front bumper, and the reduction in size of contingency decals and car numbers due to the smaller size of the car. During the Autoweek's Racing Conference in Detroit, Michigan, NASCAR announced that the manufacturer logos will be placed on either side of the drivers' name to increase manufacturer identity.|$|R

Also introduced with the MG 3 was the Xross model, which similar to the Rover Streetwise and the earlier NAC produced MG3 SW, features chunkier off road styling, raised suspension and <b>roof</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|As well as {{platform}} accommodation, a new mechanical {{departure indicator}} was provided, {{and there were}} spacious new offices for the LSWR headquarters.

The last of the new platforms was commissioned on 28 February 1915. The new station was formally opened by HM Queen Mary on 21 March 1922; {{the cost of the}} reconstruction had been £2,269,354.|$|R

A two-seater, three-door Discovery Commercial version, lacking rear side windows, was later offered by Land Rover Special Vehicles also known as SVO (Special Vehicles Operations).|$|R
50|$|The tough-looking Streetwise was {{designed}} as a two-wheel drive urban car with 4x4 looks. The streetwise had a higher ride height than the basic 25, and although it shared many of the common characteristics of the 25, it was visually different with large impact absorbing grey or black plastic bumpers. Unlike the rest of the Rover and MG range, the Streetwise bumpers were not colour-coded. The front indicator and fog lights were redesigned to complement the circular headlamps, and most models came with chunky 16-inch wheels as standard. To extend the load space, the Streetwise was fitted with multi-purpose <b>roof</b> <b>bars,</b> which also served to distinguish the Streetwise from ZR & 25.|$|R
