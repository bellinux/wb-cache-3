5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they <b>listened</b> <b>and</b> acted with him presently.|$|E

All the princes and people <b>listened</b> <b>and</b> let their Hebrew slaves go free, but afterwards they turned and caused their servants whom they had freed to return to subjugation.|$|E

He spent his early years at Goindval and Sultanpur Lodhi. At Goindval, Gurdas <b>listened</b> <b>and</b> obtained knowledge from scholars and swamis that continuously visited the town while traversing the Delhi-Lahore road. He later moved to Varanasi, where he studied Sanskrit and Hindu scriptures. After Guru Amar Das died, his successor Guru Ram Das assigned Gurdas as a Sikh missionary to Agra.|$|E
40|$|At present, <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> {{speaking}} English textbooks in Chinese Universities have {{an extensive}} use of cooperative learning strategies.

This paper starts from the basic theory of “cooperative” teaching mode, and then analyzes the status quo of academic English <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking in regular colleges, and finally carries out comparative analysis by the use of fuzzy mathematics method based on the traditional <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode <b>and</b> cooperative <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode and other methods, and finally concludes the main trend of future development of the cooperative <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode...|$|R

The focus of the present study was to explore Bangladesh secondary English teachers’ understandings about <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills assessment as well as to learn the barriers and enablers they encounter in assessing those two skills. The study showed that the Bangladesh secondary English curriculum does not include the assessment of <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills, although the curriculum document gives a mandate to teachers to practise and assess all the four language skills – <b>listening,</b> speaking, reading, <b>and</b> writing. The study also indicated that teachers taught English mixing with Bangla language; they had not been trained to assess <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills; the English curriculum required restructuring to make way for <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills assessment; teachers needed <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking resources to enable them to undertake both <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking practices and assessment; and above all, it shows that the teachers need instruction from the education authority in order to start auraloral skills assessment in schools. This qualitative study with six Bangladeshi secondary school English teachers employed classroom observations and semi-structured interviews...|$|R

500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone <b>listened</b> <b>and</b> understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E

To shed more light on this issue, {{the present study was}} conducted to compare the effect of jigsaw and decision-making tasks on improving <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking abilities of EFL learners. To this end, 75 female Iranian EFL learners, assumed homogenous based on their performance on the Nelson Test, were employed as the participants.

500|$|The Prince of Egypt was [...] "written" [...] {{throughout}} the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, Story Supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led {{a team of}} fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film— sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a [...] "story reel" [...] or animatic. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand {{what is happening in}} each sequence of the film. [...] After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances. Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars, Christian, Jewish and Muslim theologians, and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives <b>listened</b> <b>and</b> responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources.|$|E

Furthermore, we found that higher inferential complexity of the context requires a higher working memory load, which results in a weaker <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> reading performance.
