5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel concedes that some <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E

25|$|Most {{defendants}} in defamation <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> newspapers or publishers, which {{are involved in}} about twice as many lawsuits as are television stations. Most plaintiffs are corporations, businesspeople, entertainers and other public figures, and people involved in criminal cases, usually defendants or convicts but sometimes victims as well. In no state can a defamation claim be successfully maintained if the allegedly defamed person is deceased.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the UCLA Center for Environmental Risk Reduction {{released}} a study showing that Boeing's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, in the Simi Hills of eastern Ventura County in Southern California, had been contaminated with toxic and radioactive waste. The {{study found that}} air, soil, groundwater, and surface water at the site all contained radionuclides, toxic metals, and dioxins; air and water additionally contained perchlorate, TCE, and hydrazines, while water showed the presence of PCBs as well.

5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the <b>lawsuit</b> to <b>be</b> destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations.

25|$|In 1995, Raytheon {{acquired}} Dallas-based E-Systems, {{including a}} site in St. Petersburg, Florida. In November 1991, prior to Raytheon's acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and 1,4-Dioxane. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site. According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008 to investigate its groundwater. Contamination in the area has not affected anyone's drinking water supply or health, yet due to negative local media coverage <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> being filed with claims against Raytheon citing decreases in property values.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the alleged}} acts fall outside the {{statutes}} of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal {{charges have been filed}} against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> active against Cosby. Gloria Allred is representing 33 {{of the alleged}} victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court reporting service. In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex, involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic methaqualone (Quaaludes), with a series of young women, and acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 2013 Netanyahu apologised for the {{incident}} in a 30-minute telephone call with ErdoÄŸan, stating that the results were unintended; the Turkish prime minister accepted apology and agreed to enter into discussions to resolve the compensation issue. Following the telephone apology, Israel's Channel 10 television channel reported that compensation talks had commenced; however, a disparity became immediately apparent, as Turkey sought $1 million {{for each of the}} flotilla deaths, while Israel response was $100,000. As of 27 March 2013, an agreement was made between the two nations in regard to three points: 1. Compensation will only be paid to the family members of the people killed aboard the Marmara; 2. Confirmation of a signed commitment from Turkey, whereby Turkey will be unable to sue Israel over {{the incident}}; 3. The Turkish government will return the monetary compensation to Israel in the event that civilian <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> ever filed by Turkish citizens; a meeting was also planned for the discussion of future relations between Turkey and Israel.|$|E

2500|$|Class-action <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> an {{important}} and valuable part {{of the legal system}} when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.|$|E

With a total number of over 2,000 bridges and 91 tunnels to be built through this mountainous terrain {{containing}} many rivers, {{it was the biggest}} and perhaps the most difficult railway engineering project on the Indian subcontinent at the time. A major challenge in the area was land acquisition as c. 43,000 landowners had to be negotiated with.

2500|$|A fourth, related, legal {{argument}} against comprehensive campaigns {{is that their}} elements may be used against unions as well. Union leaders, like their corporate counterparts, may engage in insider-dealing, have conflicts of interest, or engage in questionable or embarrassing financial expenditures. For example, a CEO's high pay may {{be the subject of}} a comprehensive campaign's publicity effort. But then, so may a union president's high salary. <b>Lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> not the only domain of unions; employers may seek to pre-empt union legal action by filing suits against unions first. They may choose a venue (such as a state court) where judges are less experienced or a court which has proven historically favorable to business claims. Too few unions assess the risks of a [...] "counter-attack" [...] by businesses, critics argue, and end up in trouble themselves.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in March 2008, {{class action}} <b>lawsuits</b> <b>were</b> filed against {{several of the}} large banks.

2500|$|On August 26, 1999, {{after winning}} 3 jury verdicts, 20 pretrial summary {{judgments}} and {{the dismissal of}} 14,000 claims, Wyeth offered out-of-court cash settlements of $1,500 each to about 36,000 women who contended {{that they had not}} been adequately warned about possible side effects of Norplant such as irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression. Wyeth said that most of the plaintiffs experienced routine side effects described in Norplant's labeling information. Wyeth did not admit to any wrongdoing, saying the settlement offer [...] "was purely a business decision," [...] noting [...] "our legal success has come at a steep price because <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> time-consuming, expensive, and have a chilling effect on research," [...] and that it would continue to offer Norplant and would contest [...] "any and all new lawsuits aggressively." ...|$|E
2500|$|How {{much these}} costs are {{is a matter}} of debate. Some have argued that {{malpractice}} <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> a major driver of medical costs. However, the direct cost of malpractice suits amounts to only about 0.5% of all healthcare spending, and a 2006 Harvard study showed that over 90% of the malpractice suits examined contained evidence of injury to the patient and that frivolous suits were generally readily dismissed by the courts. A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said [...] "liability wasnâ€™t driving premiums." [...] Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost of malpractice [...] "is linked to" [...] between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs. A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office put medical malpractice costs at 2% of U.S. health spending and [...] "even significant reductions" [...] would do little to reduce the growth of health care expenses.|$|E
2500|$|These critics {{assert that}} these rate {{increases}} are causing doctors {{to go out}} of business or move to states with more favorable tort systems. Not everyone agrees, though, that medical malpractice <b>lawsuits</b> <b>are</b> solely causing these rate increases. [...] A 2003 report from the General Accounting Office found multiple reasons for these rate increases, with medical malpractice lawsuits being the primary driver. [...] Despite noting multiple reasons for rate increases, the report goes on to state that the [...] "GAO found that losses on medical malpractice claims-which make up the largest part of insurersâ€™ costs-appear to be the primary driver of rate increases in the long run." [...] More recent data has indicated that medical malpractice rates are generally no longer rising. In 2011, data pooled from the industry by the publication Medical Liability Monitor indicated that medical malpractice insurance rates had declined for four straight years. The decrease was seen in both states that had enacted tort reform and in states that had not, leading actuaries familiar with the data to suggest that patient safety and risk management campaigns had had a more significant effect.|$|E

Kraft denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit, noting that the reformulation had been in planning long before the lawsuit.|$|R
50|$|In the Common law of England, the {{practice}} of financing <b>lawsuits</b> <b>was</b> connected with champerty and maintenance, which was a practice whereby the investor would {{become involved in the}} <b>lawsuit.</b> <b>Lawsuits</b> <b>were</b> won through intimidation and other methods rather than the merit of the case.|$|R
