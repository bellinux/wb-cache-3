5000|$|In Greek philotheos means [...] "loving God, pious", as philosophos means a <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> wisdom (sophia). , {{using the}} word philotheos in the plural form, speaks of certain people as φιλήδονοι μᾶλλον ἢ φιλόθεοι (<b>lovers</b> <b>of</b> {{pleasure}} rather than <b>lovers</b> <b>of</b> God). The word Theophilos was and {{is used as a}} proper name, but does not appear as an adjective or common noun in Greek, which uses instead the form theophilês, which means [...] "dear to God" [...] but also [...] "loving God".|$|R

5000|$|However, Eric Voegelin used theophilos to mean [...] "lover of God": [...] "In the Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} the true thinker. When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following Heraclitus, replies that the term sophos, one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him philosophos, a <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the philosophos, becomes the theophilos, the <b>lover</b> <b>of</b> God." ...|$|R
