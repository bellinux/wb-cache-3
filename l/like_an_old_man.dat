500|$|Epstein {{attended}} the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney, and Peter O'Toole, but Epstein dropped {{out after the}} third term, {{saying that he had}} become [...] "too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn't like being a student at all." [...] He said in 1964 that he [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> at the age of 21". He also revealed that {{he would have liked to}} produce a theatre play, or even act, [...] "in something by Chekhov", or a [...] "straight drama" [...] by John Osborne.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} entirely against the {{parliamentary}} system, but harbored two distinct currents {{when it came}} to supplanting it. Stelescu himself wrote that [...] "democracy sickens us", since it had resulted in inept governance [...] "by a mass of nitwits". The movement viewed liberalism and human rights with suspicion rather than hostility, since they left the door open for [...] "capitalism and politicking". Istrati had dissenting views. In its Christmas 1934 issue, Cruciada Românismului published his [...] "Letter to... the Right", which called democracy [...] "putrid" [...] but described dictatorship as an unsound regime: [...] "Dictatorship, of whatever kind, signals that the social organism has grown old. It is the system that will suppress in its adversary all his fighting means, to take them over for its own use, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> who ties up a robust youth and then proceeds to beat him up at his own convenience." ...|$|E
60|$|And he went on, warming {{his hands}} again, and {{thinking}} about them, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> or a young goblin.|$|E
50|$|Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, {{a famous}} screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 {{years old when}} The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so {{animated}} and energetic on the set, {{that she had to}} remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pu Som Fao Sap (ปู่โสมเฝ้าทรัพย์), a male ghost who guards treasures {{appearing}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> venerable <b>old</b> <b>man</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|He stared, and answered, [...] "Oh!" [...] {{and went}} without other words, {{carrying}} his lamp {{with him and}} moving with <b>a</b> weak-kneed shuffle, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... {Old Man} [...] (After {{inspection}} of hillside.) [...] He has chased the deer far. He is patient. [...] In the chase he is patient <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
60|$|SHIRLEY [with blighting contempt] Yes: you <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> to hit, don't you, when you've {{finished}} with the women. I ain't seen you hit a young one yet.|$|E
60|$|Then Leo {{sank back}} into the chair where we had {{discovered}} him bound, and seemed to fall {{into a kind of}} torpor, for of a sudden he grew to look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
60|$|The clock ticked {{on through}} the silence. The fire {{sputtered}} faintly, then gave <b>a</b> little wheeze, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> very <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> Derek rested his chin on his hands, gazing into the ashes.|$|R
50|$|The {{head of the}} Edajima residents' {{association}} {{who lives}} in Building #29. While he seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gruff <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> nagging the ladies {{of the community to}} keep things clean, he is actually very sweet towards children.|$|R
50|$|That night, Godber asks Fletcher what Blanco {{was convicted}} of. Fletcher {{explains}} that Blanco murdered {{his wife and}} buried her in the freezer. Godber is horrified and can’t understand it because Blanco seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was true. His flesh {{had fallen}} away; {{his face had}} {{withered}} and whitened; he stooped <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> The change for the worse had been steadily proceeding from {{the time when he}} left Vange Abbey.|$|E
60|$|Kambira, {{although}} able to stand, was doubled up <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> {{and poor}} little Obo trembled and staggered when {{he attempted to}} follow his father, to whom he still clung as to his last and only refuge.|$|E
6000|$|For he's not <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> that leisurely goes [...] About {{work that}} he knows, [24] in a track that he knows; [...] But often his mind is {{compelled}} to demur, [...] And you guess that the more then his body must stir. [...] 60 ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No use waitin' any longer; {{and now my}} papers is sold, I ain't {{afraid to}} go home,' said the boy, {{stepping}} down <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little <b>old</b> <b>man</b> with the rheumatism, and preparing to trudge away through the storm.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are so much}} changed," [...] she murmured, [...] "since {{those days}} at Enton. You were a boy then, {{although}} you were a thoughtful one--now you are a man, and when you speak <b>like</b> that, <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> Come, I want the other Mr. Brooks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please Your Worship," [...] said Little John, in <b>a</b> cracked voice <b>like</b> that of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> [...] "my name is Giles Hobble, at Your Worship's service." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{listener}} at {{the ventilator}} {{came to his}} feet slowly, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> His face was drawn and pinched and very white beneath the light copper of his skin. She was to die! And he helpless to avert the tragedy. He {{did not even know}} where she was imprisoned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Ebbits, [...] "and he {{saw that}} Yamikan had made true talk {{of the things he}} had seen. But there was no way for Bidarshik to journey to the white man's land under the sun, and he grew sick and weary <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and moved not away from the fire. No longer did he go forth to kill meat--" ...|$|E
60|$|A boy {{of about}} {{fourteen}} leaned upon the table, his bent shoulders making him look <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> His hickory shirt, {{like that of}} Grant, was still wet with sweat, and discolored here and there with grease, or green from grass. His hair, freshly wet and combed, was smoothed away from his face, and shone {{in the light of}} the kerosene lamp. As he ate, he stared at Howard, as if he would make an inventory of each thread of the visitor's clothing.|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] I {{perceive}} [...] That fear is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cloak which <b>old</b> <b>men</b> huddle [...] About their love, {{as if to}} keep it warm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] cried Peterkin. [...] "Let {{me think}} a minute. You {{remember}} that enormously big, hairy fellow, that looked so <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ugly <b>old</b> <b>man</b> that Ralph refused point-blank to fire at him, whereupon you fired at him point-blank and wounded {{him in the}} shoulder as he was running away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Welcome, Count Moranzone; 'tis {{some time}} Since {{we have seen}} you here in Padua.

6000|$|She saw Marshall Haney in a {{new light}} also. For the first time he seemed <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> sitting there, supine, garrulous, in the midst of those {{self-contained}} people. [...] "Gosh! how he did talk! He took too much wine, I reckon, but that didn't make all the difference." [...] In truth, his imperiousness, his contempt, had been melted and charmed away by the genial smiles of his auditors. Even Mrs. Crego had listened with a show of interest. It was as if a lonely old man had at last found companionship.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear one, but {{you have}} changed!" [...] she exclaimed, compassionately. [...] "After all, why not? I must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you. It seems odd, indeed, to see you sitting there, muffled up <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> afraid to show yourself. You know how foolish you are? With your black cape and that queer hat, you are so {{different}} from all the others. If you seek to remain unrecognized, why do you not dress as all the men do? Any one who was suspicious would recognize you from your clothes." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{crossing}} the passage, she {{stepped to the}} front door, where the carriage was waiting which had brought her from Dumfries, and instructed the coachman to put up his horses at the nearest inn, and to call again for her in two hours' time. This done, she accompanied Noel Vanstone into the sitting-room, stirred up the fire, and placed him before it comfortably in an easy-chair. He sat for a few minutes, warming his hands feebly <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> and staring straight into the flame. Then he spoke.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{shares the}} devastating effects of having survived a {{terrorist}} attack. One {{little boy who}} survived the attack now has burn scars all over his back and arms; he was robbed of his naiveté and now stared at his playmates <b>like</b> <b>a</b> skeptical <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> He says he thinks about death now, which is something he'd never thought about before.|$|R
50|$|While Jörmundur was, <b>like</b> Sveinbjörn, <b>an</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> {{knowledgeable}} {{in ancient}} literature, he differed from his predecessor in his greater skill at {{dealing with the}} media. Jörmundur's time as allsherjargoði saw a rapid rise in membership in the organization, going from 172 in 1994 to 628 in 2002. Jörmundur's time also saw {{an increase in the}} percentage of women members, going from 13% in 1994 to 21% in 2002.|$|R
60|$|With {{his love}} of drinking, {{his love of}} boasting came back. Because he could do no more great deeds--or rather had not the spirit left in him to do more--he must needs, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{worn-out}} <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> babble of the great deeds which he had done; insult and defy his Norman neighbors; often talk what might be easily caricatured into treason against King William himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Little one, but {{you have}} changed!" [...] she exclaimed compassionately. [...] "After all, why not? I must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you. It seems odd, indeed, to see you sitting there, muffled up <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> afraid to show yourself. You know how foolish you are? With your black cape and that queer hat, you are so {{different}} from all the others. If you seek to remain unrecognised, why do you not dress as all the men do? Anyone who was suspicious would recognise you from your clothes." ...|$|E
60|$|But, to {{get back}} to Fulton. I'm going along <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> I used to know who used to start to tell a story about his grandfather. He had an awfully {{retentive}} memory, and he never finished the story, because he switched off into something else. He used to tell about how his grandfather one day went into a pasture, where there was a ram. The old man dropped a silver dime in the grass, and stooped over to pick it up. The ram was observing him, and took the old man's action as an invitation.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time Paul felt himself able to be of any use, for he was to be left in charge of Alfred, while Mrs. King and both her other {{children}} went to church. Paul was sadly crippled still, and every frost filled his bones with acute pain, and bent him <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> so that he was still a long way from getting down-stairs, but he could make a shift to get about the room, and he looked greatly pleased when Alfred declared that he should want nobody else to stay with him in the morning.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{the king and queen}} stared at their son, {{as if he had been}} unknown to them; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that his {{shoulders}} were bowed <b>like</b> those of <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "All?" [...] Ellen cried. [...] "Bless my soul, {{as though}} it wasn't enough! A nice {{harmless}} boy as ever was until that day that you came down. You don't seem to understand. He's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> Chooses his words, corrects my grammar, keeps himself so clean you can almost smell the soap. What I say is that it isn't natural in a child of his age." ...|$|R
60|$|Tom, {{who stood}} by her, idly {{spinning}} the curtain tassel, followed the familiar figure with his eye, and seeing how gray the hair had grown, how careworn the florid face, and how <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weary <b>old</b> <b>man</b> his once strong, handsome father walked, he was smitten {{by a new}} pang of self-reproach, and with his usual impetuosity set about repairing the omission {{as soon as he}} discovered it.|$|R
