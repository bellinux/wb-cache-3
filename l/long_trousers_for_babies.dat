500|$|The Boy Scouts Association and its {{programmes}} in Britain went largely unchanged {{until it}} underwent a major {{review in the}} 1960s. [...] The Chief Scouts' Advance Party was formed in 1964 and was sent to survey the association to see why membership numbers were falling.

As a result, the word [...] "boy" [...] was dropped from the association's name which was changed to The Scout Association and major changes {{were made to the}} sections and their respective programmes. The youngest section were now named Cub Scouts, the Boy Scout section was renamed simply as the Scout section and the Senior Scouts and Rover Scout section was replaced with Venture Scouts for 16 to 20 year olds. The Scout Uniform was also changed with the inclusion of <b>long</b> <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> the Scouts, as opposed to the compulsory wearing of knee-length shorts, and the wearing of a Beret instead of the Campaign hat.|$|R
50|$|The {{uniform in}} 1958 was {{basically}} the same as when Fianna was founded in 1909 and some members were advocating change. Scouts wore a green blouse with two rows of brass buttons, an orange neckerchief, slouch hat, blacks shorts and a white lanyard that was attached to his Scout whistle. Officers were still wearing riding breeches and a military type jacket, slouch hat and a Sam Brown belt. As slouch hats were hard to find, berets became the head dress for officers. Different type uniforms were mooted and an American Boy Scout pattern was decided on. Scouts would now wear a green shirt with two pockets and a military-style side hat. The uniforms eventually arrived and were first seen at the annual Dick McKee Commemoration in Finglas Village in November 1958. Eventually, the side hats were replaced by a green beret, and the <b>long</b> <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> officers were replaced by black shorts or breeches again. Frank Lee and Terry Kiely left the Fianna after a falling out.|$|R

500|$|In 1966, the Advance Party Report {{recommended}} a total redesign and modernisation of the uniform, commenting {{that there had}} been much criticism of [...] "the Boer War appearance of our uniforms" [...] and that the [...] "wearing of shorts by members of the Movement {{is one of the most}} damaging aspects of our present public image". Although the Cub uniform barely changed, retaining short trousers, the Scout section were to wear a long sleeved dark green shirt and <b>long</b> <b>trousers</b> in a brownish colour described as [...] "mushroom". Venture Scouts and male Scouters had identical khaki shirts and mushroom trousers, but the neckerchief was replaced by a tie, brown for Venture Scouts and green for Scouters. Female Scouters had a dark green dress and a cap similar to those worn by airline flight attendants at the time. These recommendations were accepted and implemented from October 1967. Later amendments included khaki shirts for female Venture Scouts and Scouters, the abolition of all uniform headgear except Sea Scout caps and Air Scout berets, and black <b>long</b> <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> Cubs as an option to shorts. A grey sweatshirt was introduced for the new Beaver Scout section and a dark green sweatshirt replaced the Cubs' knitted jersey.

50|$|The {{social aspects}} of {{clothing}} have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area {{or another of}} the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behaviour. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude. Women's clothing in Victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauty (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's <b>trousers</b> (suitably altered) <b>for</b> outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced <b>long</b> <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. Corsets have long been used for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.|$|R

Both men and women pin a Pa'O flag badge on to their jacket. It represents the Zawgyi and dragon from their origin story. Men use a large red sling bag to carry knives, hoes or long choppers. Women use a cane or bamboo sling basket. Those from lower Myanmar wear Burmese style clothing.|$|R

50|$|Public {{schools in}} Indonesia {{tolerate}} religious freedoms. For example, Muslim girls may opt to wear long-sleeve shirts, longer skirts, and jilbab {{to cover their}} heads.

This kind of uniform consists of a batik short-sleeve or long-sleeve shirt, with <b>long</b> or short <b>trousers</b> <b>for</b> SMA and below-knee or long skirts for females. The motifs and colours of batik depend on the school. Some schools tend to issue neckties and/or vests for their students. These neckties and vests may vary from school to school in colour and sewing pattern, even among public schools.|$|R
5000|$|In Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell {{recommended}} a distinctive and practical uniform that was [...] "very like the uniform worn by my men when I commanded the South African Constabulary". This in turn, {{seems to have}} been derived from the dress adopted by Baden-Powell in the Second Matabele War of 1896, influenced by his friend and colleague, Frederick Russell Burnham. The original Boy Scout uniform consisted of a khaki shirt and shorts, a neckerchief or [...] "scarf", campaign hat and a Scout staff. At the formation of the Wolf Cub section in 1916, Baden-Powell wanted to make the younger boys totally distinct from the older Boy Scouts; the result was a green woollen jersey, shorts, neckerchief and a green cricket cap with gold piping. In 1946, the new Senior Scout section were allowed to wear a maroon beret instead of the hat; a green beret became an option for the Boy Scout section in 1954.In 1966, the Advance Party Report {{recommended a}} total redesign and modernisation of the uniform, commenting that there had been much criticism of [...] "the Boer War appearance of our uniforms" [...] and that the [...] "wearing of shorts by members of the Movement {{is one of the most}} damaging aspects of our present public image".
