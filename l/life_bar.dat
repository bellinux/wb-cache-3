5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> of either of a player's fighters runs out, that player loses the round. If time runs out, the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} games {{used only}} a simple <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> Snake Eater also {{keeps track of}} injuries over the entire body. For example, a long fall could fracture Snake's leg, slowing him down until the injury is properly treated with a splint and bandage. Unless these injuries are treated, Snake {{will not be able}} to fully recover his health for some time.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, Alisia and her monsters can improve their {{abilities}} by collecting power-ups. These enhancement items are placed throughout the first seven stages, mostly in hidden locations. The various power-ups can heal Alisia and her monsters, increase their maximum <b>life</b> <b>bars,</b> improve their attacks, or grant invulnerability for a certain time. <b>Life</b> <b>bars</b> are lost by taking damage from enemy attacks and traps. When Alisia's pets lose all their <b>life</b> <b>bars,</b> they are removed from play and cannot be brought back until a [...] "Revive" [...] power-up is collected. If Alisia loses all her <b>life</b> <b>bars,</b> she can restart the level by expending a continue. The game ends if all the continues have been used. Alisia Dragoon has no features for saving the player's progress. After the game is completed, a screen is shown, charting the overall performance of the player {{based on the number of}} kills, the power level of Alisia's attack, and the frequency the pet monsters are used.|$|R
5000|$|Killer Instinct {{features}} several gameplay elements {{unique to}} fighting {{games of the}} time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two <b>life</b> <b>bars.</b> The player that depletes the other player's <b>life</b> <b>bars</b> first wins the match. The game also introduced [...] "auto-doubles", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are [...] "combo breakers", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In combat, {{the player}} can pause the action to calmly target enemies and select {{different}} powers for the squad members to use. The enemy's <b>life</b> <b>bars</b> {{are shown in}} a frame {{at the top of}} the screen.|$|R
5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based <b>life</b> <b>bar)</b> get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's <b>life</b> <b>bar.</b> NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of the {{original}} game in which players control Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through Gallowmere to stop the evil Zarok. Dan can utilize a variety of weapons, including close range weapons such as swords and axes to long ranged weapons such as throwing knives and crossbows. If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes, where a legendary hero rewards him by giving him a new weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> throughout the game, which can be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains. The remastered version also includes some exclusive arcade-style minigames which can also be played over online multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E
50|$|The game {{introduces}} stage-specific finishing moves called Overkills. These {{are performed}} by defeating an opponent {{such that they}} fall upon a certain area of ground. If they land in the right spot, the <b>life</b> <b>bars</b> disappear and some element of the background kills them.|$|R
50|$|Tekken 5.1 {{is a free}} {{upgrade to}} the arcade version of Tekken 5. It {{includes}} changes to the character <b>life</b> <b>bars</b> and character select screen, and some changes in character moves to improve game balance. For example, Steve Fox's infinite was removed, {{and a few other}} strong moves were toned down.|$|R

25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, {{with the same}} {{percentage}} of <b>life</b> <b>bar.</b> For example, some of these games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) {{it is virtually impossible}} for a round to end tied, and that means the players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E
500|$|Once {{put into}} play from the player's hand, a card {{can be used}} to provide a benefit to the player or to attack the opponent. [...] Types of cards include {{character}}s, such as Onslaught and Namor; each character has an attack and defense rating that represents how much damage they can inflict and sustain. [...] Other cards include locations and equipment, which {{can be used to}} boost the statistics and abilities of characters, and [...] "plot twists" [...] which encompass a wide range of effects, such as forcing an opponent to forfeit some of the cards in their hand. [...] Each player has a <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> that is depleted with each successful attack by an opponent, and a player loses the match when their <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> is empty.|$|E
500|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, matches {{are divided into}} rounds, and {{the first player to}} win two rounds by fully {{depleting}} their opponent's <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> is the winner; at this point, the losing character will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity of using a finishing move. Mortal Kombat II lacks the [...] "Test Your Might" [...] bonus games and point system from the first game, in favor of a consecutive win tally where wins are represented by icons.|$|E
500|$|Injustice: Gods Among Us is a {{fighting}} {{game in which}} players control characters with different fighting styles and special attacks, engaging in one-on-one combat to deplete their opponent's life gauge. The game is in 2.5D; movement is restricted to a two-dimensional plane, while the characters and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensions. Unlike the traditional fighting game design involving multiple rounds with regenerative <b>life</b> <b>bars,</b> Injustice uses a scheme similar to the Killer Instinct series. Each match consists of a single round with each player bearing two <b>life</b> <b>bars.</b> The game utilizes a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a [...] "character trait" [...] button, which activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, Superman's character trait provides a temporary boost in strength, while Batman's character trait summons a swarm of robotic bats.|$|R

500|$|In 1979, Namco's Galaxian—"the {{granddaddy of}} all {{top-down}} shooters", according to IGN—was released. Its use of colour graphics and individualised antagonists were considered [...] "strong evolutionary concepts" [...] among space ship games. That same year saw {{the release of}} SNK's debut shoot 'em up Ozma Wars, notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> a mechanic that has now become common {{in the majority of}} modern action games. It also featured vertically scrolling backgrounds and enemies.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{other games}} from the Pendragon series, Entombed {{features}} no collectable items required {{to finish the}} game. The player-character has a <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> which will deplete every time he makes contact with an enemy. To replenish life, the player must kill crows which will spawn in rooms at various times, and upon its death the crow will drop an Ankh symbol, the ancient Egyptian [...] "Symbol of Life". If the player completely runs out of life or if all the oxygen runs out from the tomb, then the game will end.|$|E
500|$|Bart is able {{to utilize}} a variety of weapons in the game, {{including}} a burp gun, a slingshot, spray paint, and water balloons. The player controls these weapons with either a keyboard or a joystick. The joystick control has two modes: one for shooting and one for jumping. Whenever the player misses one of the creatures and {{they are able to}} hit Bart, the <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> called the [...] "Cool-O-Meter", drops. In order to regain Bart's coolness, the player must find a cool item that he can use. When the player has completed all levels, Bart goes to the Krustyland amusement park to save Krusty from Bob.|$|E

5|$|Wander and the colossi have <b>life</b> <b>bars</b> to {{indicate}} their remaining health. A colossus' health will decrease significantly when its weak points are attacked, while Wander can be harmed by a colossus' attacks or a fall from great height. Throughout the game, Wander is equipped with only a sword and a bow with arrows, but may obtain other weapons from completing the Time Attack trials.|$|R
500|$|As {{characters}} perform special moves, block oncoming attacks, or {{get hit by}} the opponent, their [...] "super meters" [...] {{will gradually}} fill. Portions of the super meter {{can be used to}} execute enhanced special moves or counter enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend their meter to interrupt a combo and enter a wager battle, dubbed the [...] "clash system", which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be triggered by a player only after they have lost their first <b>life</b> <b>bar.</b> During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.|$|E
500|$|The player {{character}} {{also has}} stealth camouflage and several vision modes that {{allow him to}} see in the dark, such as infrared vision. Health is represented by a segmented <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> that regenerates after a successful kill, and an energy bar is also available to provide power for the Predator's weapons. In addition to destroying Aliens, the Predator must eradicate other traces of their presence, including facehugger husks. Aliens, husks, humans, and other potential targets are all represented by icons on a heads-up display. The game's camera is manipulated by pressing the PlayStation Portable (PSP)'s triggers, and the Predator can [...] "lock on" [...] to opponents using a first-person view to target them with his ranged weapons.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Guilty Gear Isuka {{is like the}} other games in the series. The game uses a four attack button configuration that consists of punch, kick, slash, and high slash. Unlike previous games, it features a [...] "turn" [...] button, since a character does not automatically turn around if its opponent moves {{to the other side}} of the screen. Each character (or team) starts a fight with at least a [...] "soul"; when a character <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> is emptied, its life is filled while the player lost a soul. If the life is depleted when the player has no souls, it is defeated. It also features previous installments features like the tension gauge, which allows the player to perform super moves, and the burst gauge, which allows the player to break combinations and super moves.|$|E

500|$|Gameplay in the Super Smash Bros. series {{differs from}} many {{fighting}} games. Instead of winning by depleting an opponent's <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> players seek to launch their opponents {{off the stage}} {{and out of the}} map. Characters have a damage total which rises as they take damage, represented by a percentage value that measures up to 999%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To knock out an opponent, the player must knock that character outside the arena's boundaries in any direction. When a character is launched off the stage, the character can attempt to [...] "recover" [...] by using jumping moves and abilities to return to the stage. Some characters have an easier time recovering onto the stage than others due to their moves and abilities. Additionally, some characters vary in weight, with lighter characters being easier to launch than heavy characters.|$|E
500|$|The Super Smash Bros. {{series is}} a {{departure}} from many fighting games; instead of winning by depleting an opponent's <b>life</b> <b>bar,</b> Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100%, with a maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying {{off the edge of}} the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, many suspended in an otherwise empty space. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time [...] "recovering" [...] than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying.|$|E
500|$|Fighting game matches {{generally}} {{consist of}} several rounds (typically [...] "best of three"); {{the player who}} wins the most rounds wins the match. Fighting games widely feature life bars, which are depleted as characters sustain blows. Each successful attack will deplete a character's health, and the game continues until a fighter's energy reaches zero. Hence, the main goal is to completely deplete the <b>life</b> <b>bar</b> of one's opponent, thus achieving a [...] "knockout". Beginning with Midway's Mortal Kombat released in 1992, the Mortal Kombat series introduced [...] "Fatalities" [...] in which the victor kills a knocked-out opponent in a gruesome manner. Games such as Virtua Fighter also allow a character to be defeated by forcing them outside of the fighting arena, awarding a [...] "ring-out" [...] to the victor. Round decisions can also be determined by time over (if a timer is present), which judges players based on remaining vitality to declare a winner. Fighting games often include a single player campaign or tournament, where the player must defeat a sequence of several computer-controlled opponents. Winning the tournament often reveals a special story–ending cutscene, and some games also grant access to hidden characters or special features upon victory.|$|E
