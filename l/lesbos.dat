5|$|Aristotle was {{the first}} person to study biology systematically. He spent two years observing and {{describing}} the zoology of <b>Lesbos</b> and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of <b>Lesbos.</b> His data are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.|$|E
5|$|Sappho {{was from}} Mytilene {{on the island}} of <b>Lesbos,</b> and was {{probably}} born around 630 BC.|$|E
5|$|Williams and Catlin {{were married}} in London in July 1955 at St James's, Spanish Place, near Marylebone High Street, {{followed}} by a honeymoon in <b>Lesbos,</b> Greece.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could {{accomplish}} more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to <b>Lesbos,</b> where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on <b>Lesbos,</b> however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to <b>Lesbos,</b> where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on <b>Lesbos</b> some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
5|$|Philanthropenos {{remained}} at Philadelphia until 1326, possibly also 1327, {{but it appears}} that he was then appointed as governor of the strategically important Byzantine island of <b>Lesbos,</b> since he was dismissed from the same post in 1328 by Andronikos III Palaiologos.|$|E
5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of <b>Lesbos,</b> home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians {{gathered}} that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of <b>Lesbos,</b> including a type of wine.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} <b>Lesbos,</b> including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the mid-1890s, name ship of her class. She {{spent most of her}} career assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron (escadre de la Méditerranée). Twice she participated in the occupation of the port of Mytilene on the island of <b>Lesbos,</b> then owned by the Ottoman Empire, once as part of a French expedition and another as part of an international squadron.|$|E
5|$|In October 1901, the 1st Battleship Division, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral (contre-amiral) Leonce Caillard, was ordered to proceed to the port of Mytilene on the island of <b>Lesbos,</b> then owned by the Ottoman Empire. After landing two {{companies}} of marines that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November, Sultan Abdul Hamid II agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks. The 1st Division departed <b>Lesbos</b> in early December and returned to Toulon. In May 1902, the ship became the flagship of Vice Admiral (vice-amiral) François Fournier who led a small delegation to celebrate the unveiling of the statue of Comte de Rochambeau in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. President Theodore Roosevelt was received aboard on 23 May and the ship made port visits to New York City and Boston before heading back to France. She made another port visit to Lisbon before arriving back at Toulon on 14 June.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of <b>Lesbos</b> (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s to the 1930s, American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney held {{a weekly}} salon in Paris to which major artistic celebrities were invited and where lesbian topics were the focus. Combining Greek {{influences}} with contemporary French eroticism, {{she attempted to}} create an updated and idealized version of <b>Lesbos</b> in her salon. Her contemporaries included artist Romaine Brooks, who painted others in her circle; writers Colette, Djuna Barnes, social host Gertrude Stein, and novelist Radclyffe Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1090/91, the Byzantines under Constantine Dalassenos {{recovered}} Chios. Undeterred, Tzachas rebuilt his forces, {{and resumed}} his attacks, even proclaiming himself emperor (basileus) and seeking to conclude an alliance against Alexios I with the Pechenegs in Thrace for a joint attack on Constantinople. In 1092, Dalassenos {{and the new}} megas doux, John Doukas, were sent against Tzachas, and attacked the fortress of Mytilene on <b>Lesbos.</b> Tzachas resisted for three months, but finally had to negotiate a surrender of the fortress. During his return to Smyrna, Dalassenos attacked the Turkish fleet, which was almost destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Sappho's life. She was from a wealthy family from <b>Lesbos,</b> though the names of both of her parents are uncertain. Ancient sources say that she had three brothers; the names of {{two of them are}} {{mentioned}} in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. She was exiled to Sicily around 600 BC, and may have continued to work until around 570. Later legends surrounding Sappho's love for the ferryman Phaon and her death are unreliable.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American lesbian {{movement}} {{has been the most}} active in Mexico, but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, <b>Lesbos,</b> the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.|$|E
5|$|When Obbink {{published}} the Brothers Poem, he attributed it to Sappho {{based on its}} metre, dialect (Aeolic), and references to Charaxos and Larichos, known from other sources to have been Sappho's brothers. It {{is possible that the}} text is an ancient forgery; though the Brothers Song was included in at least some Hellenistic editions of Sappho, a classical imitation of Sappho is still possible. Nonetheless, evidence provided by Herodotus indicates that Charaxos was mentioned in poems that were attributed to Sappho during the fifth century BC; it therefore is likely that the poem is at least authentically from archaic <b>Lesbos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of <b>Lesbos</b> and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of <b>Lesbos.</b> He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living things into two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of <b>Lesbos,</b> such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice {{spent on}} average 60,000 ducats {{per year in}} this {{seemingly}} fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, {{while at the same}} time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and <b>Lesbos),</b> in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made clear to the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of <b>Lesbos,</b> where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|At Lampsacus, John {{met with}} his brother, who rewarded his {{victories}} with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half-brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. Then, or sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and <b>Lesbos</b> as personal domains (pronoiai). In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things had been going badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in Macedonia. In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes. After long and hard fighting, {{in the summer of}} 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married to Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.|$|E
5|$|By summer 821, Thomas had {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He {{set his sights on}} the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas. Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at <b>Lesbos,</b> and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended to cross over into Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros <b>Lesbos</b> (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received {{the news that the}} Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to <b>Lesbos.</b> In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that {{he would be able to}} talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caria {{surrendered}} to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, <b>Lesbos</b> and Tenedos and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.|$|E
5|$|Not {{waiting to}} take up his consulship in Rome, he left after his triumph but {{before the end of}} AD 17. He sailed down the Illyrian coast of the Adriatic Sea to Greece, where he {{restored}} the temple of Spes, and won a chariot race at the Olympic games that year. He arrived at Nicopolis near the site of the Battle of Actium, where he took up his second consulship on 18 January AD 18. He visited the sites associated with his adoptive grandfather Augustus and his natural grandfather Mark Antony, before crossing the sea to <b>Lesbos</b> and then to Asia Minor. There he visited the site of Troy and the oracle of Apollo Claros near Colophon. Piso left {{at the same time as}} Germanicus, but traveled directly to Athens and then to Rhodes where he and Germanicus met for the first time. From there Piso left for Syria where he immediately began replacing the officers with men loyal to himself in a bid to win the loyalty of his soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{fleet and}} army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp {{out the last}} embers of the revolt. They {{attacked}} and captured the islands of Chios, <b>Lesbos</b> and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation. In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal {{and they were able}} to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine Empire was {{partitioned}} between the Crusaders, while three Greek successor states were set up, the Despotate of Epirus, the Empire of Trebizond, and the Empire of Nicaea, each claiming the Byzantine imperial title. The former did not maintain a fleet, the Trapezuntine navy was minuscule and mostly used for patrols and transporting troops, while the Nicaeans initially followed a policy of consolidation and used their fleet for coastal defence. Under John III Vatatzes (1222–1254), a more energetic foreign policy was pursued, and in 1225, the Nicaean fleet was able to occupy the islands of <b>Lesbos,</b> Chios, Samos, and Icaria. It was, however, {{no match for the}} Venetians: attempting to blockade Constantinople in 1235, the Nicaean navy was defeated by a far smaller Venetian force, and in another similar attempt in 1241, the Nicaeans were again routed. Nicaean efforts during the 1230s to support a local rebellion in Crete against Venice were also only partially successful, with the last Nicaean troops being forced to leave the island in 1236. Aware of the weakness of his navy, in March 1261 the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (1259–1282) concluded the Treaty of Nymphaeum with the Genoese, securing their aid against Venice at sea, in return for commercial privileges.|$|E
5|$|For {{the motives}} of Bardanes himself, the {{situation}} is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers {{to allow him to}} leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, Thomas the Slav, Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. Although possibly a later invention, this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand. Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was {{also a member of the}} landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros's policies, both in the confessional area, where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests. Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros's usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death, however, at <b>Lesbos</b> on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|In October 1901, the 1st Battleship Division, {{under the}} command of Rear Admiral Leonce Caillard, was ordered to proceed to the port of Mytilene. After landing two {{companies}} of marines that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November, Sultan Abdul Hamid II agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks. The 1st Division departed <b>Lesbos</b> in early December and returned to Toulon. In January–March 1902, Charlemagne was deployed in Moroccan waters and participated in the summer fleet exercises later that year. Naval historians Paul Silverstone and Eric Gille claim that the ship collided with Gaulois on 2 March 1903, but was not damaged. In April 1904, {{she was one of the}} ships that escorted President Loubet during his state visit to Italy and participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers later that summer. A 100mm cartridge spontaneously ignited in a magazine in January 1905, but Charlemagne suffered no damage from the incident. Together with the destroyer , the ship was the French contribution to an international squadron that briefly occupied Mytilene in November–December 1905 and participated in a naval review by President Armand Fallières in September of the following year. She engaged in the summer naval manoeuvres in 1907 and 1908 and was transferred to the 4th division in September 1908.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} {{accounts of}} Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According {{to the first}} account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered {{the service of a}} man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished. Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803, while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of <b>Lesbos.</b> Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Andronikos II, who had disbanded the Byzantine {{army and}} navy, and who favoured monks and intellectuals, Andronikos III was an {{energetic}} ruler who personally led his forces in military campaigns. In 1329, his first {{campaign against the}} Ottomans resulted in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pelekanos, after which the Byzantine position in Bithynia rapidly collapsed. Subsequent sorties into the Balkans were nevertheless successful in shoring up Andronikos' tottering realm. Thessaly and the Despotate of Epirus, two territories separated from the Empire after the Fourth Crusade, were restored to imperial rule, almost without bloodshed in 1328 and 1337 respectively. Andronikos III also rebuilt a modest fleet, which allowed him to recover the rich and strategically placed island of Chios from the Genoese Zaccaria family in 1329 {{as well as to}} claim the allegiance of Andreolo Cattaneo, the Genoese governor of Phocaea on the Anatolian mainland. In 1335, however, Andreolo's son Domenico captured the island of <b>Lesbos</b> with Genoese assistance. The Emperor led a fleet to recover it and Phocaea, and requested the aid of the Turkish emirs of Saruhan and Aydin. Saruhan sent troops and supplies, but Aydin's ruler Umur Beg came to meet the Emperor in person. It was during this encounter that Kantakouzenos and Umur established a long-lasting close friendship and alliance.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain support to remove John VI, John V gave his sister Maria to Francesco I Gattilusio, who {{received}} the lordship of <b>Lesbos,</b> an island which remained {{under the control of}} the Genoese until the Ottoman conquest of <b>Lesbos</b> in 1462. They founded the noble family who continued into Italian Genoese aristocracy, being ancestors of the princes of Monaco.|$|E
