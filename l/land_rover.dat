5|$|Where armour is not {{required}} or mobility and speed are favoured the British Army utilises protected patrol vehicles, such as the Panther variant of the Iveco LMV, and variants of the Cougar family (such as the Foxhound, Ridgeback, Husky and Mastiff). For day-to-day utility work the army commonly uses the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Wolf, {{which is based on}} the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Defender.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road {{at the very top}} of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover,</b> during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E

5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as <b>Land</b> <b>Rover,</b> Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturing {{accounted}} for 8% of employment within Birmingham in 2012, a figure beneath {{the average for}} the UK as a whole. Major industrial plants within the city include Jaguar <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> in Castle Bromwich and Cadbury in Bournville, with large local producers also supporting a supply chain of precision-based small manufacturers and craft industries. More traditional industries also remain: 40% of the jewellery made in the UK is still produced by the 300 independent manufacturers of the city's Jewellery Quarter, continuing a trade first recorded in Birmingham in 1308.|$|E
5|$|The trailer of {{the film}} was {{revealed}} with the prints of Ready, and released online on 15 May 2011. Excel Entertainment teamed up with Aircel to make promos {{of the film}} available on mobile and Internet. The trailer got over 55 million views within 48 hours of its release. Two more promos, one for the song Ik Junoon {{and one for the}} song Senorita, were released on 27 May. The music launch and promotion event took place at Nirmal Lifestyle, Mulund, Mumbai. The promos of Khaabon Kay Parinday and Dil Dhadakne Do were released the following week. Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani visited Facebook India to promote the movie. A press conference promoting the film was held on 1 July at Chandigarh. Two dialogue promos of the movie were released on 3 July. The cast and crew embarked on a road trip from Mumbai to Delhi on 7 July via Surat, Vadodra, Ahmedabad, Udaipur, Ajmer and Jaipur that culminated with a concert at Gurgaon. It is believed that British Auto manufacturer <b>Land</b> <b>Rover,</b> which is now owned by Tata Motors, sponsored the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Discovery driven by the cast members during the trip.

5|$|Developed in the 2000s at an {{investment}} of US$2 million after IDF commitments for 1,200 units, some AIL jobs {{were believed to be}} in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
5|$|Northern England has {{a strong}} export-based economy, with trade more {{balanced}} than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to regularly export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and other manufactured goods make {{up the majority of}} Northern exports, just over half of which go to other EU countries. Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{chaired the}} government's Industrial Development Advisory Board from 1973 to 1980. In this {{position}} {{he found himself}} frustrated by Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn's decision to ignore the board's advice and found workers' co-operative schemes at struggling firms Triumph Engineering and Fisher-Bendix in the early 1970s. Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post {{for more than a}} year before the company, beset with strikes, nationalised and he handed the chair to Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors in an attempt to get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> name.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{started in}} Austria in December 2014, with {{production}} {{taking in the}} area around S√∂lden‚Äîincluding the √ñtztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station‚Äîand Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee, before concluding in February 2015. Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999, about 20 SBS {{members were}} {{involved}} in the Australian led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in East Timor. Together with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service they formed INTERFET's special forces element named Response Force. Response Force departed from Darwin by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and flew into Dili tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces to land and deploy with the SBS filmed driving a <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Defender out of a Hercules. Response Force was then utilised to perform to a variety of tasks including direct action and special reconnaissance throughout East Timor. The British forces withdrew in December 1999, including the SBS. A Sergeant was awarded the Military Cross after his patrol came under fire from pro-Indonesian militia.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film‚Äôs protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May, HV {{launched}} Operation Flash and overran the ARSK-held part of Sector West in {{the course}} of few days. ≈†ariniƒá warned Crabbe of the attack hours in advance to allow UNCRO troops to seek shelter. The RSK authorities said that some ARSK units were not able to remove antitank weapons from UNCRO depots in Stara Gradi≈°ka and near Pakrac until after the offensive began. These weapons had been stored there pursuant to the March 1994 ceasefire agreement. Nonetheless, UNCRO did not stop ARSK troops from retrieving the weapons. During the fighting, ARSK troops took 15 UNCIVPOL members, two interpreters, and 89 Nepalese and Argentinean troops hostage to use as human shields against the HV. HV troops hijacked an UNCRO armoured personnel carrier and a <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> to precede HV tanks that were moving west along the A3 motorway. On 3 May, the Argentinean battalion of UNCRO facilitated the surrender of 600 ARSK troops near Pakrac, following an agreement reached between Croatia and the RSK which was mediated by Yasushi Akashi, the personal representative of the UN Secretary-General. During Operation Flash, three Jordanian UNCRO troops were wounded by HV fire. The offensive made clear that the deployment of UNCRO would not deter further Croatian offensives.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{introduction}} of battalion specialisations‚Äîlight, parachute, mechanised and motorised‚Äîin the regiment {{and the formation of}} a ready deployment force. The later concept was first tested during Operation Morris Dance, the contingency mounted in response to the 1987 Fiji coup. 5/7 RAR subsequently developed as a mechanised battalion equipped with M113 armoured personnel carriers, while 3 RAR re-roled as a parachute battalion. In 1988, during the Australian Bicentennial celebrations, a contingent drawn from the battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Salter of 1 RAR, supported by an Australian Army Band, was deployed as part of the bicentennial celebrations to mount public duties at Buckingham Palace Windsor Castle, St James' Palace and the Tower of London, the first Australian troops to do so since the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. In 1991, the two Brisbane-based battalions‚Äî6 RAR and 8/9 RAR‚Äîthen part of the 6th Brigade, became Ready Reserve battalions. Following trials of the concept 6 RAR requipped as a motorised battalion in 1992, while 8/9 RAR commenced is conversion in 1996. Each battalion was initially issued modified 6x6 <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> Perenties until a purpose-built infantry mobility vehicle could be acquired.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a <b>Land</b> <b>Rover</b> with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E
