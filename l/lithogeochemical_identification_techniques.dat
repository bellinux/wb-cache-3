40|$|Quite {{a lot of}} {{structural}} <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> assume that the complete {{state of the structure}} can be measured which unfortunately cannot be easily met in practice. In addition, measurement data are normally contaminated with noise which unavoidably affects the performance of these techniques. In this paper, two waveletbased <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> are developed to identify time-varying parameters in a shear-beam building using incomplete and noisy measurement data. By approximating the unknown time-varying parameters using wavelet multiresolution expressions, a parametric identification problem is transformed into a nonparametric coefficient optimization. As the wavelet multi-resolution expressions can accurately represent arbitrary functions, these wavelet-based techniques can be used to identify various forms of timevarying behavior that can occur to the building’s parameters. Depending on the availability of measurement data, two wavelet-based <b>identification</b> <b>techniques,</b> story-by-story and sub-structural, are proposed. To minimize the effect of measurement noise, a wavelet decomposition level selection scheme and a multi-rate Kalman data fusion technique are adopted. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed wavelet-based timevarying structural <b>identification</b> <b>techniques.</b> Results show that the techniques can track the time-varying properties of shear-beam buildings quite accurately under incomplete and noisy measurement condition...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{identification}} of the damping, restoring, and coupling parameters in the equations describing the coupled heave and pitch motions for an underwater robotic vehicle (URV) sailing near sea surface in random waves using only its measured responses at sea is presented. The random decrement equations are derived for the URV performing coupled heave and pitch motions in random waves. The hydrodynamic parameters in these equations are identified using a new <b>identification</b> <b>technique</b> called RDLRNNT, which uses a combination of a multiple linear regression algorithm and a neural networks technique. The combination of the classical parametric <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> and the neural networks technique provides robust results and does not require a large amount of computer time.

Direct optimal sampled-data control design explicitly addresses both the digital controller implementation and the intersample behaviour. The model {{that is required}} for direct optimal sampled-data control should evolve in continuous time. Accurate models for control design, however, generally evolve in discrete time since they are obtained by means of system <b>identification</b> <b>techniques.</b> The {{purpose of this paper}} is the development of a control design framework that enables the usage of models delivered by system <b>identification</b> <b>techniques,</b> while explicitly addressing both the digital controller implementation and the intersample behaviour aspects.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present experimental, {{empirical}} and analytic <b>identification</b> <b>techniques,</b> known as non-parametric techniques. Poor dynamics and high nonlinearities are parts of the difficulties in the control of pneumatic actuator functions, which make the <b>identification</b> <b>technique</b> very challenging. Firstly, the step response experimental data is collected to obtain real-time force model of the intelligent pneumatic actuator (IPA). The IPA plant and Personal Computer (PC) communicate through Data Acquisition (DAQ) card over MATLAB software. The second method is approximating the process by curve reaction of a first-order plus delay process, and the third method uses the equivalent n order process with PTn model parameters. The obtained results have been compared with the previous study, achieved based on force system identification of IPA obtained by the (Auto-Regressive model with eXogenous) ARX model. The models developed using non-parameters <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> have good responses and their responses are close to the model identified using the ARX system identification model.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of impaired balance control and falls increases {{with age and}} disease and has {{a significant impact on}} daily life. Detection of early-stage balance impairments is difficult as many intertwined mechanisms contribute to balance control. Current clinical balance tests are unable to quantify these underlying mechanisms, and it is therefore difficult to provide targeted interventions to prevent falling. System <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> in combination with external disturbances may provide a way to detect impairments of the underlying mechanisms. This is especially challenging when studying multi-joint coordination, i. e. the contribution of both the ankles and hips to balance control. With model simulations we compared various existing non-parametric and parametric system <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> in combination with external disturbances and evaluated their performance. All methods are considered multi-segmental (both the ankles and the hips contribute to maintaining balance) closed-loop balance control. Validation of the techniques was based on the prediction of time series and frequency domain data. Parametric system identification could not be applied in a straightforward manner in human balance control due to assumed model structure and biological noise in the system. Although the time series were estimated reliably, the dynamics in the frequency domain were not correctly estimated. Non-parametric system <b>identification</b> <b>techniques</b> did estimate the underlying dynamics of balance control reliably in both time and frequency domain. The choice of the external disturbance signal is a trade-off between frequency resolution and measurement time and thus depends on the specific research question and the studied population.
