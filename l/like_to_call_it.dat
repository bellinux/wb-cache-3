Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Bringing a cherished book to the big screen? No sweat. Peter Jackson's trilogy — or, as we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> our preciousssss — exerted its irresistible pull, on advanced Elvish speakers and neophytes alike."

500|$|The Sea {{contains}} songs {{written before}} and after the death of Rae's husband, all of which she said resonated with her: [...] "The circumstances have cast it all in a different light. It began as a '{{before and after}}' record, but it's become an 'after' record". The ballad [...] "I'd Do It All Again" [...] was written by Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: [...] "When I started writing that I was thinking, 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked…' But I had to". [...] "I Would <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> <b>Call</b> <b>it</b> Beauty", she said, was written about finding beauty in the [...] "darkest times", later telling journalist Sean O'Hagan: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> <b>Call</b> <b>It</b> Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} we recorded the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E

500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] I always <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet {{wanted to work with}} Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1947, {{she went}} to live at the Abbey Art Centre, an artists' {{community}} located in New Barnet, Hertfordshire, near London. King was a fairly early resident there. Quite a number of Australian artists lived at the Abbey at various times. These included Robert Klippel, James Gleeson,Phillip Martin, , Noel Counihan and Bernard Smith, who became an art historian. Grahame King, whom King later married, arrived later in 1947. King's early works at the Abbey were figurative, but not realistic. But {{it was during this}} period that King [...] "made an arbitrary decision to move away from representational work". [...] "I could not see how I could do any more with the figure, so I decided to move into what I call non-representational work. I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> abstraction as my work was not abstract in concept. I was groping for my own way." [...] She had two exhibitions in London, then spent six months in Paris, which she enjoyed. In September 1949, {{she went to}} New York.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{coverage}} of the spill was intense {{from the moment the}} oil reached the shore. [...] The spill was the major headline in many morning newspapers on February 5, also receiving wide coverage on radio and television. [...] The same morning, a U.S. Senate subcommittee interviewed local officials as well as Fred Hartley, president of Union Oil, on the disaster in the making. [...] Three major television networks were there along with over 50 reporters, the largest media turnout for any Senate subcommittee meeting since the Committee on Foreign Relations discussed the Vietnam War. [...] During the meeting, local officials made their case that the Federal government had a conflict of interest, in that they were making money from the same drilling they were mandated to oversee and regulate. [...] Hartley defended Union's record and denied that the event was a disaster: [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a disaster, because there has been no loss of human life. [...] I am amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few birds." [...] Most controversially, offshore drilling operations – all of which were suspended immediately on February 3, by direct request of the Walter Hickel Secretary of the Interior, pending a [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment of the situation" [...] – had resumed after just a break of several hours, just long enough for a closed-door meeting between oil company representatives and Department of the Interior officials. [...] Local officials, not invited to the meeting, were furious that [...] "complete reevaluation and reassessment" [...] could have occurred in such a short time, and in a meeting that excluded them; the fierce exchange was covered on national television, along with grim footage of the thousands of dying birds on the tarred beaches of Santa Barbara, and the spontaneous efforts of hundreds of civilian volunteers to pile straw on the oil, scrub rocks with detergent, and struggle to save a few of the less-oiled birds.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Occidental school" [...] as Maria Alexandru <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> {{went into}} the {{footsteps}} of Chrysanthos with their assumption that the systema teleion or heptaphonia was the only explanation and was adaptated according to the Western perception of the modes as octave species. According to Chrysanthos the tritone B—F had become the tritos pentachord, while Oliver Strunk defined G—g as the tetartos octave unlike Chrysanthos and the living tradition as the point of reference of the [...] "Greek school" [...] who all set the tetartos octave a fifth lower C—c, so that the seventh was big and not small. Both interpretations corrupted the tetraphonic or trochos system (σύστημα κατὰ τετραφωνίαν), but they were less an ignorant confusion between metrophonia and melos, as Manuel feared it, it was motivated by a certain universalism, which the Phanariotes claimed, when they used Chrysanthos' system to transcribe Western melodies and the makamlar as well.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} twenties, {{the idea for}} {{electrified}} string instruments had been around for some time, and experimental banjo, violin and guitar pickups had been developed. George Beauchamp had himself been experimenting with electric amplification as early as 1925, but his early efforts involving microphones did not produce the effects he desired. Along the way Beauchamp also built a one-string test guitar made out of a 2X4 piece of lumber and an electric phonograph pickup. As the problems at National became more apparent, Beauchamp's home experiments took on a more rigorous shape, {{and he began to}} attend night classes in electronics as well as collaborating with fellow National employee Paul Barth. When the prototype electric pickup they were developing finally worked to his satisfaction, Beauchamp asked former National shop craftsman Harry Watson to make a wooden neck and body to which the electronics could be attached. It was nicknamed the frying pan because of its shape, though Rickenbacker <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the pancake. The final design Beauchamp and Barth developed was an electric pickup consisting of a pair of horseshoe-shaped magnets that enclosed the pickup coil and completely surrounded the strings.|$|R

5000|$|Whilst {{the engine}} was being developed, Walter Hayes (Ford) asked Colin Chapman if he would fit the engine to 1,000 Ford saloons for Group 2 homologation.

The Type 28 or Lotus Cortina or Cortina Lotus (as Ford <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> was duly launched. Ford supplied the 2-door Cortina bodyshells and took care of all the marketing and selling of the cars, whilst Lotus did all the mechanical and cosmetic changes. The major changes involved installing the 1,557 cc (...) engine, together with the same close-ratio gearbox as the Elan. The rear suspension was drastically altered and lightweight alloy panels were used for doors, bonnet and boot. Lightweight casings were fitted to gearbox and differential. All the Lotus factory cars were painted white with a green stripe (although Ford built some for racing in red, and one customer had a dark blue stripe due to being superstitious about green). The cars also received front quarter bumpers and round Lotus badges were fitted to rear wings and to {{the right side of the}} radiator grille.|$|R

I can't face the prospect of tearing up my life by the roots; I feel certain that I shouldn't bear transplanting. I can't imagine myself recreating my circle of interests in some foreign town or colonial centre or even in a country town in England. India I couldn't stand.

50|$|Unsell {{underwent}} {{training as}} a journalist and magazine writer for the Kansas City Post and attended Emerson College in Boston for her postgraduate year, studying literature and drama. The theatrical agent, Beatrice DeMille {{was so impressed with}} one of Unsell’s short stories that she hired young Eve as a play reader for her theatrical company in New York. DeMille became a mentor to Eve, giving her the motivation she needed to further her career. Beatrice’s two son’s Cecil and William, partnered with future theatre impresario David Belasco, later took over Beatrice’s company, becoming mentors to Eve as well. In the article, “The Rise Of The Continuity Writer,” featured in Writer’s Monthly, Eve wrote of her mentors, “Masters of screen technique as the DeMille’s have realized the necessity for not only recruiting the eminent authors for screen ranks but for training young writers to become technicians of screen detail, for the purpose of successfully translating the ‘big ideas’ of the big authors in screen terms, and so, close {{on the heels of the}} plot itself.” This is where she learned plot construction, or what she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> plot ‘detecting’. Eve gained much experience under the DeMille’s and David Blasco. Blasco, who cast her in the theatrical comedy Excuse Me, gave Unsell two years of on stage experience that would later help in her better understanding of acting and screen writing. It was not until 1913 that Eve’s hard work in screen writing paid off. That year Moving Picture World announced that she would sell several film scenarios to the Pathe Freres, and the Kalem Company, who decided to produce Unsell’s scenario, The Pawnbroker’s Daughter.|$|R
