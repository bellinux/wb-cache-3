50|$|After {{the crash}} of Flight 981, the <b>latching</b> <b>system</b> was {{completely}} redesigned {{to prevent them from}} moving into the wrong position. The locking system was mechanically upgraded to prevent the handle from being forced closed without the pins in place, and the vent door was altered to be operated by the pins, thereby indicating when the pins, rather than the handle, were in the locked position. Additionally, the FAA ordered further changes to all aircraft with outward-opening doors, including the DC-10, Lockheed L-1011, and Boeing 747, requiring vents be cut into the cabin floor to allow pressures to equalise {{in the event of a}} blown-out door.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause was}} later {{traced to the}} door <b>latching</b> <b>system,</b> which had failed to close completely. A {{separate}} locking system was supposed to ensure this could not happen, but proved to be inadequate. McDonnell Douglas instituted a number of {{minor changes to the}} system in an attempt to avoid a repeat, but two years later, on March 3, 1974, Turkish Airlines Flight 981's rear cargo door blew off for exactly the same reason, causing the aircraft to lose all control and crash into a forest outside Paris, killing all 346 people on board. Flight 981 would be the deadliest plane crash in aviation history until the Tenerife disaster, and the deadliest single-aircraft crash until Japan Airlines Flight 123.|$|E
5000|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors on}} the DC-10 are plug doors, designed to prevent opening while the aircraft is pressurized, but the cargo hatch is not. Owing to its large radius, the cargo hatch on the DC-10 could not open inside the fuselage without taking up valuable cargo space, so the hatch was designed to open outward, allowing cargo to be stored directly behind it. The outward-opening design would allow the hatch to be blown open by the pressure inside the cargo area if the latch failed during flight. To prevent this, the DC-10 used a <b>latching</b> <b>system</b> that incorporated [...] "over-center latches" [...] - four C-shaped latches mounted on a common torque shaft that were rotated over latching pins ("spools") fixed to the aircraft fuselage. Due to their shape, when the latches were in the proper position, internal pressure on the hatch did not place enough torque to open them. The latches were engaged by electric actuators, with a hand crank provided as a backup.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a method}} and apparatus for joining structures, an active structure and a passive structure, and imposing a tensile pre-load on the joint by a remotely operable mechanism comprising a heat contractible joining element. The method and apparatus include mounting on the structure, a probe shaft of material which is transformable from an expanded length to a contracted length when heated to a specific temperature range.

40|$|Payloads are secured in {{the orbiter}} payload bay by the payload {{retention}} system or {{are equipped with}} their own unique retention systems. The orbiter payload retention mechanisms provide structural attachments for each payload by using four or five attachment points to secure the payload within the orbiter payload bay during all phases of the orbiter mission. The payload retention system (PRS) is an electromechanical system that provides standarized payload carrier attachment fittings to accommodate up to five payloads for each orbiter flight. The mechanisms are able to function under either l-g or zero-g conditions. Payload berthing or deberthing on orbit is accomplished by utilizing the remote manipulator system (RMS).

40|$|Efficient {{handling}} of payloads destined for a planetary surface, {{such as the}} moon or mars, requires robust systems to secure the payloads during transport on the ground, in space and on the planetary surface. In addition, mechanisms to release the payloads need to be reliable to ensure successful transfer from one vehicle to another. An efficient payload handling strategy must also consider the devices available to support payload handling. Cranes used for overhead lifting are common to all phases of payload handling on Earth. Similarly, both recent and past {{studies have demonstrated that}} devices with comparable functionality will be needed to support lunar outpost operations. A first generation test-bed of a new high performance device that provides the capabilities of both a crane and a robotic manipulator, the Lunar Surface Manipulation System (LSMS), has been designed, built and field tested and is available for use in evaluating a system to secure payloads to transportation vehicles. A payload handling approach must address all phases of payload management including: ground transportation, launch, planetary transfer and installation in the final system. In addition, storage may be required during any phase of operations. Each of these phases requires the payload to be lifted and secured to a vehicle, transported, released and lifted in preparation for the next transportation or storage phase. A critical component of a successful payload handling approach is a latch and associated carrier system. The latch and carrier system should minimize requirements on the: payload, carrier support structure and payload handling devices as well as be able to accommodate a wide range of payload sizes. In addition, the latch should; be small and lightweight, support a method to apply preload, be reusable, integrate into a minimal set of hard-points and have manual interfaces to actuate the latch should a problem occur. A <b>latching</b> <b>system</b> which meets these requirements has been designed and fabricated and will be described in detail. This <b>latching</b> <b>system</b> works in conjunction with a payload handling device such as the LSMS, and the LSMS has been used to test first generation latch and carrier hardware.

40|$|Silicon based Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} has produced radio-frequency (RF) micro switches {{for the past}} two decades and exhibit low loss, high linearity and low power consumption compared with conventional solid state switch. However, it has been challenged beyond 10 watts since its limited power handling capability. We have introduced Laminate technology to overcome limited power handling capability in conventional RF MEMS switch. It made possible large actuation stroke, strong force to actuate movable part, more robust conductor lines and less lossy substrate. The microswitch reported here is how to design high power RF laminate switch, addressing design trade-off; how mechanical, RF performance and switching performance are correlated and how power handling capability changes by design. The main device failure mechanisms in high power application are self-actuation due to high incident power and high temperature in device. We have guided how to minimize self-actuation problem and reduce heat source which cause increasing device temperature. <b>Latching</b> <b>system,</b> switch stays switched state without having operation signal, is also a part of this switch.

40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{have increased in}} the last four decades in high technology applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties and low weight. In the automotive industry carbon fiber have become popular exclusively in luxury cars because of its high cost. However, Carbon-glass hybrid composites offer an effective alternative to designers to implement fiber-reinforced composites into several conventional applications without a considerable price increase maintaining most of their mechanical properties. A door <b>latch</b> <b>system</b> is a complex mechanism that is under high loading conditions during car accidents such as side impacts and rollovers. Therefore, the Department of Transportation in The United States developed a series of tests that every door <b>latch</b> <b>system</b> comply in order to be installed in a vehicle. The implementation of fiber-reinforced {{composite materials}} in a door <b>latch</b> <b>system</b> was studied by analyzing the material behavior during the FMVSS No. 206 transverse test using computational efforts and experimental testing. Firstly, a computational model of the current forkbolt and detent structure was developed. Several efforts were conducted in order to create an effective and time efficient model. Two simplified models were implemented with two different contact interaction approaches. 9 composite materials were studied in forkbolt and 5 in detent including woven carbon fiber, unidirectional carbon fiber, woven carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites and unidirectional carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites. The computational model results showed that woven fiber-reinforced composite materials were stiffer than the unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite materials. For instance, a forkbolt made of woven carbon fibers was 20 % stiffer than a forkbolt made of unidirectional fibers symmetrically stacked in 0 ° and 90 ° alternating directions. Furthermore, Hybrid composite materials behaved as expected in forkbolt noticing a decline in the load-displacement slopes while the percentage of glass fiber increased. In the other hand, results showed that a detent made of only glass fiber layers was preferable than a carbon-glass fiber hybrid detent due to the high stresses shown in carbon fiber layers. Ultimately, forkbolt and detent were redesigned according to their functionality and test results. It was observed that the new design was stiffer than the original by showing a steeper load-displacement curve. Subsequently, an experimental procedure was performed in order to correlate computational model results. Fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and detent were waterjet cut from a composite laminate manufactured by Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VART) process. Then, samples were tested according to the computational model. Six testing sample combinations of forkbolt and detent were tested including the top three woven iterations forkbolts from the computational model paired with woven and unidirectional glass fiber detents. Test results showed a stiffness drop of 15 % when the carbon fiber percentage decreases from 100 % to 75 %. Also, it was observed that woven glass fiber detent was superior to the unidirectional glass fiber detent by presenting a forkbolt-detent stiffness 38 % higher. Moreover, the new design of forkbolt and detent were tested showing a stiffness increment of 29 %. Furthermore, it was observed that fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and detent did not reach the desired load of 5000 N. However, the redesigned forkbolt made of 100 % woven carbon fiber and the redesign detent made of 100 % woven glass fiber were close to reach that load. The design review based on test results performed (DRBTR) showed that components did not fail where the computational model concluded to be the areas with the highest maximum principal stress. In contrast to the computational model, all samples failed at the contact area between forkbolt and detent. ...|$|R
