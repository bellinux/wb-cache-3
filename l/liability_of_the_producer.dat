40|$|The {{ultimate}} physical {{outcomes of}} compliance with halal requirements in Islamic production are high quality and safe products. The producers or suppliers, who claim that their products are halal but in actual fact are not halal, are subject to criminal sanctions under relevant laws in Malaysia. The question arises {{as to whether the}} producers of non-halal products can also be liable for physical or emotional injury caused to the victims of such products. This paper aims to explore the potential <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>producer</b> and supplier of false halal products under the product liability law which generally concerns with providing protection to consumers against unsafe products. The paper specifically examines the provisions of strict liability for defective products under Part X of Consumer Protection Act 1999 (CPA). The main questions to be answered are whether non-halal products can be considered as ‘defective ’ and what kind of injury can be recovered by the victims. The findings of this study provide insights to producers and suppliers on the civil liability for supplying supposedly halal products and recognition of consumer right of redress for injury caused by non-halal products...|$|E
40|$|The TaBoRR{reg_sign} (Tank Bottom Recovery and Remediation) process being {{developed}} at Western Research Institute (WRI) offers {{an alternative to}} current disposal methods. The TaBoRR process is designed to: (1) process these wastes, (2) provide a cost saving, and (3) limit or reduce <b>the</b> environmental <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>producers.</b> This process removes the water through evaporation, eliminating water disposal costs, creates a salable crude oil that has been valued {{at or above the}} current market price for sweet West-Texas intermediate crude, and reduces the solids to a benign state for disposal at a landfill. This report presents the background information associated with this program, a detailed description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process, and the work that has been completed during <b>the</b> first year <b>of</b> this program. <b>The</b> plant assembly, unit operations, product analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials created during operations, the pyrolyzer design, and permitting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process in Wyoming are described.

In line with the Association Council Decisions n ° 1 / 95 and 2 / 97, a Framework Law relating to the preparation and implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical legislation regarding products has entered into force on 11 January 2002. The Law was adopted by the Parliament on 29. 06. 2001 and published in the Official Gazette on 11 July 2001. This Framework Law establishes the legal basis for full harmonisation with the EC legislation, and it lays down the basic principles for product safety and <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> Old and New Approach Directives.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a current}} and highly important problem {{because we are}} {{in front of an}} unrecorded growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production volume in parallel with its diversification. Due {{to the fact that the}} introduction in production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new products is preceded by <b>the</b> subsequent execution <b>of</b> some manually manufactured prototypes, the products are manufactured afterwards on an industrial scale. Under these circumstances there is <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> small errors which affect the consumer’s behaviour towards the new products. That is why, in auditing the focus is on <b>the</b> careful supervision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumers and especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortcomings <b>of</b> some products indicated by consumers in order to remove these from the manufacturing line. Under these circumstances, a very tight connection is required between <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> and <b>the</b> consumers, and a special <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>producers</b> towards those products. At the same time this is also a worldwide concern for <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products responsibility which has already been adopted by some large manufacturing countries. <b>The</b> recent example <b>of</b> USA was followed by the European legislation. That is why American organisations which export to Europe have to be warned because <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> product <b>liability</b> has been adopted in many European countries. The insurance companies are usually paying the initial losses for <b>the</b> cases <b>of</b> product <b>liability.</b> <b>The</b> manufacturer <b>of</b> a product has to protect itself from <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> being brought to trial or at least to reduce the risk to a level where he could afford a reasonable profit or a continuous growth. In order to meet this objective, we need a product liability prevention program. This study analyses the product liability prevention program and presents some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essential common elements for such a program. Therefore, one can argue that in order to have an effective product liability prevention program, some operations are required as for example: organisation, education, new revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products, initial revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products, periodical control of production, warranties control, warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contracts, complaints and claims, revocation plan, subrogation, risk criteria, standards, services control, reparation, etc. All these elements are described according to their own characteristics, as well as to the specific situation from the USA economy. There have also been outlined some characteristics of these elements which could allow for a product liability prevention program in other countries. That is why these elements have an important role in <b>the</b> economy <b>of</b> this material and underline once again the theoretical and practical importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studied problem. logistics, consumer’s behaviour, product liability prevention program, risk criteria, standards...|$|R
