5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{can lead}} to death {{as a result of}} a number of complications: severe infections, blood clots, and cardiac arrest <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> autonomic neuropathy. Despite optimum care this occurs in about 5% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Kenna {{killed four}} people in Mexico and injured over a hundred. The low death toll is <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> massive {{evacuations}} in San Blas, Nayarit, and elsewhere ahead of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|About 8% of {{lung cancer}} is due to {{inherited}} factors. In relatives of people with lung cancer, the risk is doubled. This is <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a combination of genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk {{of lung cancer}}.|$|E

5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|At age six, Howerton {{was living}} in McCleary, Washington, with his parents and five brothers, Albert, Ernest, Forrest, LeRoy, and Charles. His father was {{employed}} {{at the time as}} a factory mechanic. Howerton never attended school, <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his physical size and associated emotional consequences.|$|E
5|$|CORALIE and the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) {{revealed}} {{the spectrum of}} WASP-15, which was used to derive the star's characteristics. The science team studying WASP-15 found that, after running best-fit models, WASP-15's radial velocity and transit shifts were most <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E
50|$|Often, lower quality sheet cymbals {{are more}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> crack, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> stress caused {{in some areas}} by {{pressing}} sheet metal. Thicker cymbals are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> crack <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their brittleness, and less freedom to vibrate.|$|R

5|$|He died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, most <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a stroke. His funeral {{gathered}} 20,000 people, {{including the}} viceroy of the Congress Poland, Józef Zajączek. He {{was buried in}} the cemetery of the Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Kraków. His testament left his property at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fast food}} chains stopped {{use of the}} product after the {{controversy}} arose, or stated {{that they had not}} used the product before. In April 2012 the Concord Monitor reported increased business in some small neighborhood markets where the product's use was less <b>likely,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> consumer concerns about the additive.|$|E
5|$|Mole {{suffered}} a heart attack in 1896, <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> excessive work and the ensuing illness lead to her taking a step back from organisational work the following year. Her son, Fred, died in 1905. On 15 April 1912, whilst on holiday in Paris, Mole died.|$|E
50|$|The first {{theory is}} more <b>likely,</b> though, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the {{arrangement}} of the videos on the DVD and the progression of the story told through them.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the species}} {{status in the}} wild has not been {{formally}} identified, it is <b>likely</b> endangered <b>due</b> <b>to</b> large amounts of deforestation around its habitat area.|$|R
50|$|According to Dilan himself, Bekas {{refused to}} believe he was the writer which most <b>likely</b> was <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the poem having such depth in meaning and strict lyricality.|$|R
5|$|Nuyts was {{released}} from captivity in 1636, most <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the efforts of François Caron, who knew Nuyts from serving as his interpreter during the unsuccessful Japanese embassy of 1627. On returning from Japan, Nuyts was fined by the VOC, before being dishonorably dismissed from the company and {{sent back to the}} Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{signals from}} {{spacecraft}} {{in orbit around}} Mars and on its surface {{have been used to}} estimate the mass of Juno from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars. Juno's orbit appears to have changed slightly around 1839, very <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> perturbations from a passing asteroid, whose identity has not been determined.|$|E
5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity is <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> SEGA's {{desire to}} maintain Sonic's free and youthful nature, believing that committing {{to a relationship}} {{at this point in}} his life would simply be uncharacteristic of him. In addition, given that chasing Sonic and the ensuing antics are fundamental parts of Amy's character, their relation seems unlikely to change any time soon.|$|E
50|$|The {{series has}} not been rerun and is most <b>likely</b> wiped <b>due</b> <b>to</b> network {{policies}} at the time. For NBC in particular, this was quite common through 1980.|$|R

5|$|With {{ten minutes}} remaining, he was reintroduced by manager Mickey Harte, <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his {{experience}} as {{the only member of}} the team who had played in an All-Ireland final before. This reintroduction, while not the first time it had happened (blood substitutions had been used sporadically, for example), was seen as one of the greatest moments in the GAA in the last forty years.|$|E
5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
50|$|However, {{some people}} with {{schizophrenia}} {{have the ability to}} tickle themselves. This is most <b>likely</b> largely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the difficulty many people with the disorder have recognising their own actions.|$|R

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the limited number of}} workplaces within walking distance.|$|E
5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia. Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most <b>likely</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the amount of missing information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Choctaw Battalion and the 14th Mississippi Infantry Regiment were {{delayed by}} a down bridge at Brookhaven, Mississippi. The bridge was <b>likely</b> {{destroyed}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> flooding {{by the recent}} hurricane.|$|R
