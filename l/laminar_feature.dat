40|$|Aims: This study {{investigates the}} nuanced {{effect of the}} CACNA 1 C {{mutation}} on neurocognition and neurodevelopment via an extended study of the Timothy Syndrome (TS) mediated Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) mouse model – TS 2 -neo. It includes: (1) an expanded assessment of the TS 2 -neo behavioral phenotype, and (2) a comprehensive histological analysis of cortical structural and <b>laminar</b> <b>features.</b> Methods: 24 age-matched male mice – 12 TS 2 -neo (B 6. Cg-Cacna 1 ctm 2 Itl, knock-in G 406 R mutation), 12 WT (C 57 BL/ 6 J) – were tested on paradigms examining motor, socio-communicative and cognitive abilities. Neural tissue was processed for either volumetric analysis through Nissl stain (8 TS 2 -neo, 8 WT) or immunohistochemical analysis (4 TS 2 -neo, 4 WT). Statistics for all analyses were run through SPSS 19. Results: Analyses of task performance illustrate that TS 2 -neo mice show impaired sensorimotor and procedural motor learning ability, socio-communicative deficits, increased habitual digging, and strengths in detecting temporal auditory sound cues as compared to WT controls (p 3 ̆c. 05). Histological analyses of TS 2 -neo brains reveal significant and marginal decreases in the volumes of the external capsule and fornix (p 3 ̆c. 05; p=. 059), aberrant patterns of cortical lamination (p 3 ̆c. 05), and atypical expression of cortical neuron subpopulations marked by Satb 2 and Foxp 2 (p 3 ̆c. 1). Discussion: In this paper we replicate and extend the “ASD-like” behavioral phenotype of the TS 2 -neo mouse model and report novel findings of atypical white matter development and cortical laminar anomalies in the relative thickness of input and output layers and distribution of markers for projecting neuron populations. These results shed light on possible shifts in global cortico-cortical and cortico-sub-cortical connections in TS-mediated ASD...|$|R
40|$|The {{ozone data}} {{assimilation}} {{system at the}} NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Data Assimilation Office (DAO) has operationally provided near real time global three dimensional analyzed ozone fields since December 1999. Presently, 4 system assimilates both total column ozone and profile measurements from the NOAA - 16 SBUV/ 2 instrument into an off-line transport model using a physical space statistical analysis scheme (PS AS). Recently, this system was modified to investigate a possible impact from including MLS profile observations. Over a period from December 13, 1991 to March 1, 1992 the system assimilated both NOAA 11 SBUV/ 2 profile measurements and TOMS total column measurements. Short term ozone forecasts were produced and compared to MLS observations. The resulting observed -minus -forecast (O-F) residuals were studied regionally (by both latitude bands and pressure levels) in order to explore {{the potential impact of}} MLS observations on the assimilation and sensitivity to the UARS yaw maneuver and other instrument and algorithm characteristics. In addition, MLS profiles were compared to nearest neighbor SBUV and analysis profiles. In the tropics, analyzed ozone values tend to be too high from 1 - 3 hPa and too low from 10 - 20 hPa. MLS measurements in these regions tend be lower and higher (respectively) than forecast ozone values. This indicates that assimilating MLS measurements may improve, analysis results in these areas. Further, nearest neighbor profile comparisons in the southern high latitudes indicate that <b>laminar</b> <b>features</b> present in the analysis but not present in SBUV measurements, are also present in MLS measurements. This, together with the availability of MLS measurements in polar night regions indicates that assimilating MLS measurements in polar night regions indicates that assimilating MLS measurements may improve analyzed ozone values in high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approximate method for estimating effects of turbulence on the unsteady flowfield {{and on the}} stability of wave motions in a solid propellant rocket chamber. Recent work has illuminated the <b>laminar</b> <b>features</b> of this problem. The objective of the present work is to determine in a simplified way some {{of the effects of}} turbulence on these processes. A fundamental question to be answered {{is whether or not the}} presence of fully developed turbulence modifies the linearized stability integrals (e. g. flow-turning) that arise naturally in the laminar analysis. The problem is treated by combining realistic numerical solutions for the turbulent field with detailed analytical solutions for the organized oscillatory gas motions. The main influence of turbulence is modification of the transport properties and the mean chamber velocity profile. The results show that the organized vorticity waves that fill the entire chamber in the laminar case reduce to a thin acoustic boundary layer in the presence of strong turbulence. From the standpoint of vorticity production, this can be viewed as a transition from organized vorticity associated with the periodic wave structure to the wideband vorticity distribution of the turbulent field. This process is similar in many respects to the turbulent transition process in a flow without organized oscillations. In that case organized oscillations (e. g. Tollmein-Schlichting waves) appear naturally as an intermediate stage in the transition to a fully turbulent field. Despite the major impact of turbulence on the flow geometry, there is little change in linear acoustic stability gain/loss terms related to vorticity propagation. This reinforces the concept that the flow-turning interaction is not the result of viscous losses at the chamber boundaries. However, it is clear that stochastic fluctuations can have a major influence on the flame zone dynamic behavior especially in the nozzle end of a long motor burning port where the flow becomes fully turbulent...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{magnetic}} resonance imaging can now resolve <b>laminar</b> <b>features</b> within the cerebral cortex in vivo. A variety of intracortical contrasts {{have been used to}} study the cortical myeloarchitecture with the purpose of mapping cortical areas in individual subjects. In this article, we first briefly review recent advances in MRI analysis of cortical microstructure to portray the potential and limitations of the current state-of-the-art. We then present an integrated framework for the analysis of intracortical structure, composed of novel image processing tools designed for high resolution cortical images. The main features of our framework are the segmentation of quantitative T 1 maps to delineate the cortical boundaries [8], and the use of an equivolume layering model to define an intracortical coordinate system that follows the anatomical layers of the cortex [83]. We evaluate the framework with 150 isotropic post mortem T 2 ⁎-weighted images and 0. 5 isotropic in vivo T 1 maps, a quantitative index of myelin content. We study the laminar structure of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) in the post mortem and in vivo data, as well as the central sulcus region in vivo, in particular Brodmann areas 1, 3 b and 4. We also investigate the impact of the layering models on the relationship between T 1 and cortical curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that the equivolume intracortical surfaces and transcortical profiles best reflect the laminar structure of the cortex in areas of curvature in comparison to the state-of-the-art equidistant and Laplace implementations. This framework generates a subject specific intracortical coordinate system, the basis for subsequent architectonic analyses of the cortex. Any structural or functional contrast co-registered to the T 1 maps, used to segment the cortex, can be sampled on the curved grid for analysis. This work represents an important step towards in vivo structural brain mapping of individual subjects...|$|R

40|$|Archaeological {{records from}} {{excavations}} {{of the last}} forty years in the Campania region (southern Italy) attest an intense human occupation from the Early Bronze Age (EBA) to the present day. Findings of the cultural sphereof the EBA, known asfacies of Palma Campaniain the southern Italy, have beenwidelyburied by the pyroclastic deposits of the Vesuvius Pomici diAvellino eruption (3945 yrcalBP). Because of the exceptional importance and preservation of the relicsfoundin the excavation of the 1995 in Balle/Pirucchi locationat Palma Campania (Naples),a detailed (micromorphological and chemical) soil study was carried out oni) avery deepsoil chronosequence (approximately 9 m), composed of soil and pyroclastic deposits dating from the Pomici di Mercato eruption (8890 yrcal BP) until the present day and ii) a wide (4500 m 2) paleo-surface belonging to the EBA. As shown by the chemical (i. e. organic matter– OM, cation exchange capacity– CEC, pH, ammonium oxalate extractable Al and Fe–Alo+ 0. 5 Feo index, organic and inorganic phosphorous fractions – OP and IOP) and physical (i. e. particle size distribution - PSD) properties, allsoils of the sequence i) formed by weathering of volcanic materials,ii) satisfy the requirements for Andosolclassification,iii) are markedly different in terms ofdepth, degree of andic properties and chemical fertility, iv) show micromorphological features (e. g. clay and silty coatings, <b>laminar</b> <b>features,</b> iron segregations, weathering rims,ecc.) indicatingspecific weathering environments. Moreover, the comparison of selected soil properties, such as Alo+ 0. 5 Feo index(essential for Andosols) and OM,andthe estimated pedogenetic times (EPT), calculated {{on the basis of the}} volcanological markers,withthe climatic conditions by the literature,highlights a markedrelationship between the degree of development of those properties (i. e. their content) in the soils of Palma Campania and the humidity/aridity of the environment. These resultsencourage furtherapplications aimed to use these soil propertiesas proxy for the reconstruction of past climatic conditions in volcanic environments. The soil properties measured in the different areas of the EBA paleo-surface showed very consistent with both archaeological findings and reconstructed agricultural uses. Indeed, the very high OP content, along with the enrichment of OMin the soils of the North and Central sectors are in accordance with the pasture and agricultural activities, respectively,suggested by the numerous chaotically scattered animal track sand the parallel furrows of “strip” cultivation, while both OP and OM are markedly lower in the coetaneous soil analyzed along the soil chronosequence, where no anthropic or animal traces were found. Regarding to the controversial interpretation about the use of the South area, peculiar pedological features and chemical properties strongly suggest the anthropic genesis for the ancient micro-topography. Indeed, the presence of a broken soil structure, horizontal planar pores and vertical orientated laminar aggregates in a massive structure reveal a process of deeply mixing and strongly compacting soil horizons to form micro-relieves and micro-concavities. High O Pand OM content are found at 7 - 25 cm below the soil surface, probably as a consequence of manuring and ploughing. Further abandonment and waterlogging of the area are consistent with the presence of Phragmites footprints,previously found during the archaeological survey, and absence of a specific shape of ploughing traces...|$|R
40|$|A Reflux Classifier {{involves}} the liquid fluidization of particles into {{a set of}} parallel inclined channels. Closely spaced inclined channels promote a combination of laminar flow and a high shear rate, which in turn promote the elutriation of the particles according to their density. The hydrodynamics of the particle transport within the inclined channels was examined theoretically by combining established equations for describing the fluid flow, the terminal velocity of a particle, and the shear induced inertial lift, with no adjustable parameters. The theoretical calculations provided excellent agreement with a comprehensive experimental data set, demonstrating {{the significance of the}} inertial lift force that arises at a high shear rate under the condition of <b>laminar</b> flow.

In two instances in which specimens {{were obtained}} from oligodendrogliomas in regions where the tumor had infiltrated but not entirely destroyed cortical tissues, glial processes were found to be arranged in a highly organized <b>laminar</b> fashion. This <b>feature</b> was not observed in two additional oligodendrogliomas nor in other types of intracerebral neoplasms. Three types of laminar structures were recognized: (a) perikaryal sheaths composed of several layers of overlapping or concentrically orientated glial processes, (b) layers of longitudinally orientated glial processes along the outer aspect of myelinated axons, and (c) small laminated figures composed of several concentrically disposed glial processes. Spirally constituted lamellar systems were not demonstrated. These findings indicate that under certain circumstances glial cells have the capacity to form sheaths and sheath-like structures by concentric lamination of several processes, rather than by spiraling of a single process...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} neocortex {{is organized}} into layers which include circuits that form functional columns in cortical maps. A major unsolved problem concerns how bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal interactions are organized within cortical layers to generate adaptive behaviors. This article summarizes a model, called the LAMINART model, {{of how these}} interactions help visual cortex to realize: (1) the binding process whereby cortex groups distributed data into coherent object representations; (2) the attentional process whereby cortex selectively processes important events; and (3) the developmental and learning processes whereby cortex stably grows and tunes its circuits to match environmental constraints. Such Laminar Computing completes perceptual groupings that realize the property of Analog Coherence, whereby winning groupings bind together their inducing features without losing their ability to represent analog values of these <b>features.</b> <b>Laminar</b> Computing also efficiently unifies the computational requirements of preattentive filtering and grouping with those of attentional selection.

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{consequences of}} age-related alterations in neural function are well documented, but less {{is known about}} their cellular bases. To characterize such changes, we analyzed 14 molecularly identified subsets of mouse retinal projection neurons (retinal ganglion cells or RGCs) and interneurons (amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells). The retina thinned but expanded with age, maintaining its volume. There was minimal {{decline in the number}} of RGCs, interneurons, or photoreceptors, but the diameter of RGC dendritic arbors decreased with age. Together, the increased retinal area and the decreased dendritic area may lead to gaps in RGC coverage of the visual field. Axonal arbors of RGCs in the superior colliculus also atrophied with age, suggesting that the relay of visual information to central targets may decline over time. On the other hand, the laminar restriction of RGC dendrites and the interneuronal processes that synapse on them were not detectably disturbed, and RGC subtypes exhibited distinct electrophysiological responses to complex visual stimuli. Other neuronal types aged in different ways: amacrine cell arbors did not remodel detectably, whereas horizontal cell processes sprouted into the photoreceptor layer. Bipolar cells showed arbor-specific alterations: their dendrites sprouted but their axons remained stable. In summary, retinal neurons exhibited numerous age-related quantitative alterations (decreased areas of dendritic and axonal arbors and decreased density of cells and synapses), whereas their qualitative <b>features</b> (molecular identity, <b>laminar</b> specificity, and <b>feature</b> detection) were largely preserved. Together, these data reveal selective age-related alterations in neural circuitry, some of which could underlie declines in visual acuity...|$|R

This microfluidies exploits the advantage of lab-on-a-chlip technology by integrating the generation of drug concentration gradients {{and a series of}} cell operations including seeding, culture, stimulation and staining into a chip. The microfluidic network was patterned on a glass wafer, which was further bonded to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film. A series of Weir structures were fabricated on the cell culture reservoir to facilitate cell positioning and seeding. Injection of cell and delivery of medium and reagents were controlled by a syringe pump. Steady parallel concentration gradients were generated by flowing two fluids in each network. Over time observation showed the microchip was suitable for seeding and culture of MCF- 7 cell. The microchip described above was applied in studying the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in MCF- 7 cells' chemotherapy sensitivity. MCF- 7 breast cancer cell was treated with concentration gradients of As 2 O 3 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) for GSH modulation, followed by exposure to adriamycin. GSH levels were down-regulated upon As 2 O 3 treatment and up-regulated upon NAC treatment. Suppression of intracellular GSH by treatment with As 2 O 3 has been shown to increase adriamycin sensitivity, conversely, elevation of intracellular GSH by treatment with NAC leads to the increased drug resistance.

40|$|Visual cortex of macaque monkeys {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of cortical areas that span the occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes and occupy more than half of cortical surface. Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the contributions of many occipital areas to visual perceptual processing, much less is known concerning the specific functional contributions of higher areas in the temporal and frontal lobes. Previous behavioral and electrophysiological investigations have demonstrated that the inferotemporal cortex (IT) is essential to the animal 2 ̆ 7 s ability to recognize and remember visual objects. While it is generally recognized that IT {{consists of}} a number of anatomically and functionally distinct visual-processing areas, there remains considerable controversy concerning the precise number, size, and location of these areas. Therefore, the precise delineation of the cortical subdivisions of inferotemporal cortex is critical for any significant progress in the understanding of the specific contributions of inferotemporal areas to visual processing. In this study, anterograde and/or retrograde neuroanatomical tracers were injected into two visual areas in the ventral posterior and central portions of IT (areas PITv and CITvp) to elucidate the corticocortical connections of these areas with well known areas of occipital cortex and with less well understood regions of inferotemporal cortex. The locations of injection sites and the delineation of the borders of many occipital areas were aided by the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed following callosal transection and subsequent labeling with HRP. The resultant patterns of connections were represented on two-dimensional computational (CARET) and manual cortical maps and the laminar characteristics and density of the projection fields were quantified. The <b>laminar</b> and density <b>features</b> of these corticocortical connections demonstrate thirteen anatomically distinct subdivisions or areas distributed within the superior temporal sulcus and across the inferotemporal gyrus. These results serve to refine previous descriptions of inferotemporal areas, validate recently identified areas, and provide a new description of the hierarchical relationships among occipitotemporal cortical areas in macaques. ...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A fine grained calcic soil has developed upon Pliocene-Miocene alluvial gravels derived from Cretaceous limestone of the Stockton Plateau and Paleozoic limestone, chert, and novaculite from the Marathon uplift. This soil is located in an area classified by the Soil Conservation Service as having "marginal" conditions for calcic soil development. Establishing pedogenesis as the mechanism of carbonate accumulation will allow the use of a calcic soil developmental index to obtain age-dates in this "marginal" area. The soil has a 109 cm thick Stage IV K horizon at depths of 68 - 80 cm. In gravelly areas of the soil a 15 - 20 cm thick laminar Km horizon caps the K horizon. Microprobe analyses on portions of the Km horizon show that CACO, is the dominant material present and displaced the clays forming <b>laminar</b> and pisolith <b>features.</b> The carbonate chemistry is dominated by CaCO 3 (98 % by weight) with minor amounts of MgCO 3 (0. 7 % by weight). Two stable C and 0 isotope transacts sampled at I and 2. 5 mm intervals across the laminated Km horizon were analyzed, The comparison of individual laminae within two transacts shows that individual laminae have a distinct isotopic signature and correlate with depth. Bulk isotopic analyses were run on the K horizon and local Cretaceous (Segovia) limestone. 8 "O differences between the K horizons (- 3. 0 to- 1. 7 %o) and local limestone (- 6. 1 to- 4. 9 []) indicate the Km and K horizon carbonates are the result of soil processes. Transects across limestone clasts within the Km horizon show a 8 "O shift of 2 - 49 voo across the soil-rock interface. After ruling out atmospheric mixing and isotopic inheritance from limestone as factors influencing isotopic composition, the 8 "C results (- 3. 4 to 1. 4 %o) are interpreted as reflecting carbonate precipitation in a C 4 vegetative environment. This C 4 environment remained dominant throughout Km horizon deposition. These results imply pedogenesis is responsible for the carbonate in the soil. Thus, a calcic soil development index can be response applied to obtain an age-date. The index analysis of the K horizon yields an average amount of secondary carbonate of 92 g/CM 2 in the soil resulting in an average soil development age of 180 ? 20 Kyr...|$|R
