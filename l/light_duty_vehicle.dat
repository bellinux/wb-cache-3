5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without government subsidies {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E

40|$|Unknown {{remaining}} time {{of signal}} phase at a signalized intersection generally results in extra accelerations and decelerations that increase variations of operating conditions and thus emissions. A cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system can reduce unnecessary speed changes by establishing communications between vehicles and the signal infrastructure. However, {{the environmental benefits}} largely depend on drivers’ compliance behaviors. To quantify the effects of drivers’ compliance rates on emissions, this study applied VISSIM 5. 20 (Planung Transport Verkehr AG, Karlsruhe, Germany) to develop a simulation model for a signalized intersection, in which <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> were equipped with a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system. A vehicle-specific power (VSP) -based model was used to estimate emissions. Based on simulation data, the effects of different compliance rates on VSP distributions, emission factors, and total emissions were analyzed. The results show the higher compliance rate decreases the proportion of VSP bin = 0, {{which means that the}} frequencies of braking and idling were lower and <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> ran more smoothly at the intersection if more <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> complied with the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system, and emission factors for <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> decreased significantly as the compliance rate increased. The case study shows higher total emission reductions were observed with higher compliance rate for all of CO 2, NOx, HC, and CO emissions.

50|$|According to a 2011 {{study by}} Pike Research, {{annual sales of}} plug-in {{electric}} vehicles in the U.S. were predicted to reach 360,000 vehicles by 2017.

In 2012, and as sales have fallen short of projections, Pike Research projected that annual sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. will reach 400,073 units in 2020, with California as the state with the highest PEV sales over {{the remainder of this}} decade, with nearly 25% of all PEVs sold in the United States between 2012 and 2020.

The main objective of this work is not to provide accurate price estimations, but to help understanding the main cost drivers of transport electrification and to illustrate how the final system cost is influenced by the different parameters considered. The main conclusion obtained is that, despite the substantial initial investments required for the deployment of electric roads, a system featuring only static charging and vehicles with large size batteries results in a higher total system cost. Moreover, due to the much larger number of <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the fleet, the deployment of an ERS system that can be used by both long-haul and <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> is substantially more advantageous than a solution restricted only to long-haul vehicles...|$|R
