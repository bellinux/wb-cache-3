Green features include a 400kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides {{a significant amount of}} power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an addressable <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> from Encelium Technologies both allow the store to dim its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors covering nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms, and loading docks ensure the lights are automatically switched off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.|$|E
