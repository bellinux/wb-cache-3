5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets.</b> One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E

5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1965, the United States Government {{launched}} Operation Rolling Thunder, a major bombing campaign, {{with several}} objectives. Firstly, {{the operation was}} supposed to retaliate against North Vietnam for their military activities inside South Vietnam, thereby raising {{the morale of the}} South Vietnamese people, especially the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Secondly, it aimed to impede North Vietnam’s ability to wage war by reducing, if not stopping, the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Thirdly, the overall objective was to persuade the North Vietnamese Government to find a compromise through negotiations. Originally the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a list of 94 targets to be hit over a period of 16 days, but U.S. President Lyndon Johnson decided to include military targets in order to gradually apply pressure on the North Vietnamese Government, so the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> grew to 427 {{by the end of the}} campaign. In the first phase of the operation, which lasted from spring to summer of 1965, American airpower mainly targeted the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and its limited industrial base.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{became aware}} of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying {{extensive}} new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket production site in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe Jacques de Duve, who was interned {{for the rest of the}} war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> for Operation Crossbow, the ongoing bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V-1 launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction across a wide area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.|$|E

When LeT decided to target the Nariman House, a Jewish community center, Headley visited the location posing as a Jew. Headley also took boat tours to look for places where the attackers could reach the city through the waterfront; he found a landing location at a fishermen's slum in the Colaba area of southern Mumbai, where he gathered GPS coordinates. For the maritime reconnaissance, Headley received assistance from a frogman in the Pakistan Navy.|$|E

25|$|America officially {{entered the}} Vietnam War {{as a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin {{incident}} on 4 August 1964. There was a prompt escalation of RLAF activities and losses as a result. Ambassador Unger pressured the RLAF to strike communist forces on the Plaine des Jarres and the Ho Chi Minh trail by presenting the Royalist government with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> that he wanted the RLAF to hit. Losses escalated. A T-28 was shot down by Vietnamese 37mm anti-aircraft guns on 14 August. On 18 August 1964, Lieutenant Colonel Viripong, commander of the RTAF's 223rd Squadron, went down in an RLAF T-28 on the Plaine des Jarres while on an unauthorized mission, while another T-28 was lost in North Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In January 1943 at the Casablanca Conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{agreed to}} begin the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) in June and set {{targeting}} priorities. Based on these priorities but with some changes, the British Air Ministry issued the Casablanca directive on 4 February, targeting the German military, German industrial and economic systems, and German morale. More methodically, USAAF General Ira C. Eaker assembled an Anglo-American planning team to take the COA's <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> and schedule them for combined bomber operations. This unnamed group, sometimes called the CBO Planning Team, was led by Hansell and included among others USAAF Brigadier General Franklin Anderson and RAF Air Commodore Sidney Osborne Bufton. Finished in April 1943, the plan recommended 18 operations during each three-month phase against a total of 76 specific targets. The Combined Bomber Offensive began on 10 June 1943.|$|E

500|$|The {{details of}} the plot were {{finalized}} {{over the next few}} weeks by the CIA, the United Fruit Company, and Somoza. The coup plotters contacted Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-supported right-wing dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The two dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding. Although PBFORTUNE was officially approved on September 9, 1952, various planning steps had been taken earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA's Directorate of Plans compiled a list of [...] "top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup." [...] The assassination plans represented the first time that the US had considered assassination in Guatemala. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> had been drawn up by the CIA even before the operation had been formally authorized. They were created using a list of communists that the Guatemalan army had compiled in 1949, as well as its own intelligence. Nine months later the CIA also received through Seekford a list of 58 Guatemalans that Castillo Armas wanted killed, in addition to 74 others that he wanted arrested. Seekford also said that Trujillo's support was conditional on the assassination of four individuals from Santo Domingo who were at that point living in Guatemala. The plan was to involve no direct intervention from the US. It was instead to have been carried out by Castillo Armas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{journalist}} Alexander McKee {{cast doubt}} on the meaningfulness of the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not in fact targeted during the raid. The [...] "hutted camps" [...] mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge {{to the west of the}} city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: [...] "The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped". McKee further asserts [...] "The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure." ...|$|E
