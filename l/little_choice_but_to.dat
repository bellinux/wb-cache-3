5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets {{and that the government}} create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's commodity market. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> go along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E

It was generally assumed he was murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some junta members. Phát remained on the run for three years. During that time, Kỳ's power was eclipsed by Thiệu in a continuing power struggle, and the latter removed Kỳ supporters in the military from positions of high power.

5|$|The {{cumulation}} of {{all these}} events led Washington to request Congress to establish a standing navy. After a contentious debate, Congress passed the Naval Armament Act on March 27, 1794, authorizing construction of six frigates (to be built by Joshua Humphreys). These ships were the first ships of what eventually became the present-day United States Navy. Soon afterward, Congress also authorized funds to obtain a treaty with Algiers and to ransom Americans held captive (199 were alive at that time, including a few survivors from the Maria and the Dauphin). Ratified in September 1795, the final cost of the return of those held captive and peace with Algiers was $642,000, plus $21,000 in annual tribute. The president was unhappy with the arrangement, but realized the U.S. had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> agree to it. Treaties were also concluded with Tripoli, in 1796, and Tunis in 1797, each carrying with it an annual U.S. tribute payment obligation for protection from attack.

40|$|The study {{reported}} in this article examines Hong Kong secondary school students' recognition of and attitudes towards Hong Kong English (HKE) as an autonomous variety of English and thus as a potentially suitable pronunciation model in the local ELT classroom. The study is based on findings derived from a questionnaire survey of 531 participants {{from a wide range}} of secondary schools in the territory. The survey findings reveal that local students have a generally negative attitude towards the existence of HKE as a variety and the adoption of HKE as a teaching model. However, there is no consensus among the participants as to whether the use of HKE equates to a low level of English. The evidence also suggests that the majority of students have limited exposure to spoken English. While students' reservations about the localised pronunciation seem to accord with earlier research, the article argues that Hong Kong students are indeed offered <b>little</b> or no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> accept other pronunciation models due largely to the emphasis on native-speaker norms in the curriculum and their limited exposure to spoken English, and therefore accent variation, in their everyday lives.

40|$|In {{order to}} dispel Adam Smith’s liberal {{narrative}} of original accumulation, Karl Marx offered his own historical {{account of the}} rise of capitalism in England. He also pointed to the English colonies, where the conditions for capitalist development were being created by government intervention in his own era. 1 Playing on the discussion of the ‘art of colonisation’ in Edward Gibbon Wakefield’s comparative study of England and America, Marx argued that Wakefield’s candid advice on colonial policy and prosperity revealed the shaky foundations upon which Adam Smith’s concept of original accumulation was built. According to Marx, the value of Wakefield’s work rested in his recognition that the social property relations of capital did not evolve naturally and spontaneously as liberal speculative history might imply, <b>but</b> had <b>to</b> be enforced by state power. In this case, ‘wasteland’ in America had to be sufficiently priced so as to render it difficult for most immigrants to obtain land. 2 Without access to affordable land, newcomers to America would have <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> outside starvation <b>but</b> <b>to</b> work for someone else upon arrival. In this way, state policy featured as a prominent lever of primitive accumulation insofar as it blocked people from gaining the means by which they could work for themselves and their families. Thus, even a cursory consideration of state policy in the colonies made a mockery of Adam’s Smith’s claim that capital was ‘silently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality and good conduct of individuals, by their universal, continual and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition’. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, Congress {{passed a}} law {{commonly}} known as the Solomon Amendment, threatening universities and law schools with loss of federal funding if they deny or effectively prevent military recruiters from accessing campuses and directory information about students. It was the opening salvo in what has become a voluble expressive battle between the military and law schools. This fall, under cover of war, the Department of Defense (DoD) attempted to bring a decisive end to the conflict. Helping themselves to millions of dollars of ammunition from the coffers of their fellow agencies—with ambiguous authority at best—the military successfully forced Judge Advocate General (JAG) recruiters onto campuses around the country, upending carefully wrought compromises in favor of a show of force. This Comment takes this queer brinksmanship as its subject. There are numerous ways to criticize both the Solomon Amendment and the recent DoD enforcement campaign. It appears, for example, that the DoD is operating in violation of its own regulations, and relying upon statutory interpretations that raise serious constitutional questions under the Spending Clause. There are also potential First Amendment problems with the Solomon Amendment, particularly because of the special zone of speech protection that universities enjoy. From a pragmatic point of view, Solomon and the recent escalation look like colossal cognitive error. By refusing to hire openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, and by adopting tactics that generate protests and ethical dilemmas for potential recruits, the military sharply undermines its own recruiting efforts. This Comment contends, however, that we cannot measure Solomon’s success or failure against its pragmatic impact on military recruiting, because Solomon is not and has never been about effective military recruiting. Rather, Solomon and its recent enforcement are maneuvers in an expressive battle, fought over the role that homosexuals play in a community, the purpose of the modern university, and the meaning of good citizenship. But if Solomon is a symbolic conflict, who is winning? This Comment suggests a surprising possibility: The military may be serving the cause of homosexuals by calling attention to its discriminatory policies in their most transparently homophobic context (the JAG Corps). The military also may have done universities a favor by returning them to their heritage of dissent: Forced to relinquish the accommodations upon which they relied to manage the conflict, universities and law schools now have <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> simply <b>to</b> confront it. Finally, I suggest that those of us dedicated to nondiscrimination principles that include sexual orientation should welcome this opportunity for engagement—but also think seriously about what it would mean to win, and what we are willing to risk to do so...|$|R

By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon.

The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they had <b>little</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> accept Philip's terms.

Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere.

The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall.

40|$|At {{the launch}} of the {{research}} report 'Towards sustainable credit union development (Jones 1999) on 8 th December 1998, the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, Geoffrey Fitchew CMG, argued that not only had the report aroused strong interest in Westminster and Whitehall, but that it would "act as a significant catalyst" for change within the British credit union movement (Fitchew 1999). For despite the rapid expansion from the mid- 1980 s onwards of the number of credit unions established in low-income communities, {{by the end of the}} 1990 s the growth in membership in these credit unions had stalled. Even with local government support and the commitment of local volunteers, most community credit unions, particular 1 y in England and Wales, were unable to attract more than a few hundred members. The result was that only four were recognised as self-sufficient and economically viable according to criteria utilised by the Birmingham Credit Union Development Agency at the time (Jones 1999, pp 24 - 25). In fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that many credit union activists assumed that community credit unions would always be small local organisations, staffed entirely by volunteers. Indeed, the fact that they only served a few hundred members was often seen as a strength, as it generated a strong sense of community identity and of security in the knowledge that the credit union was manageable at a local level. Yet, for others, the need for change was beginning to surface. They were increasingly concerned that credit unions were reaching only a small proportion of the people on low incomes or in poverty who had <b>little</b> or no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> use high-cost alternative financial providers. For them, credit unions were failing to realise the potential they had of making a significant contribution to the economic regeneration of communities. Yet, even for people who recognised the need to change, how credit unions might develop remained unclear and problematic. The importance of the 1999 report' was that it revealed, for the first time, the organisational and economic reality of the credit union movement, and indicated a way forward for the sector. It was for this reason that Fitchew described the report as a catalyst for change; for not only did it question the assumptions that underpinned the beliefs and actions of many credit union activists, it offered a plan of action to stimulate and enable the transformation of the movement Subsequently, the report was recognised by Government and the credit union sector as a whole as a key driver for credit union change and development (HM Treasury 1999, Local Government Association 1999, 2001; ABCUL 2000, 2007; Donnelly 2004, McKillop and Wilson 2003; O'ConneIl 2005; Goth, McKillop, and Ferguson 2006; CRC 2007; Collard 2007). The report was the original, seminal work which formed a theoretical grounding for all the author's subsequent research and research publications...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{descriptions}} of nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and experiences of falling asleep behind the wheel on the drive home after a worked night shift. ^ Background: While the evidence suggests that the problem of drowsy driving and fall asleep driving is a strong contributor to vehicular accidents, little is known about nursing perceptions of the issue. ^ Methods: The design of the study is qualitative and descriptive. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 registered nurses who had experienced falling asleep behind the wheel on the drive home from work after a worked night shift. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. ^ Results: The eight themes which emerged from the data evolved from factors identified by the participants during the interviews. They are: (1.) night shifts better for new grads, (2.) auto-pilot, (3.) struggling to stay awake, (4.) it 2 ̆ 7 s scary, (5.) just need to get home, (6.) not a night person, (7.) feeling awful, and (8.) don 2 ̆ 7 t know how to fix it. ^ Conclusion: This study strongly suggests the need for additional research. Because we know that drowsy and fall asleep driving after a worked night shift is a ubiquitous phenomenon among night nurses, the need to develop interventions to mitigate the risks of the phenomenon was confirmed. The findings emphasize the importance of open dialogue and heightened awareness of the dangers faced by the nurses when they have finished their shift and are driving home. Understanding the context of nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences with falling asleep behind the wheel may elicit stronger communications between nurses and their nursing leaders. Targeted education on sleep hygiene, drowsy driving, and fall asleep driving for nurses, nursing leaders, and hospital administrators may serve to open the dialogue. Negative physiologic and psychological influences of night shift centered around poor quality and quantity of sleep. These negative influences were consistently presented by all participants. The nurses 2 ̆ 7 beliefs that they are physically unable to adapt to shiftwork warrants further research into screening for physiological and psychologocial ability to engage in shiftwork. Further studies are needed to explore the efficacy of restorative napping, and other interventions to prevent drowsy and fall asleep driving. Many participants expressed the fact that they had <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> work the night shift as new graduates. We need to closely examine why the newest members of the nursing profession are placed on the shift with the least amount of resources. The phenomenon of fall asleep driving after a worked night shift environment in nursing is poorly understood. The goal of this qualitative descriptive study was to elicit a description of the experience of night shift nurses with the goal of obtaining information that would serve to find ways to eliminate the occurrence of drowsy/fall asleep driving in nurse shiftworkers. Nursing and hospital administrators may be able to utilize the information gleaned from this study to optimize the nurse scheduling, implement evidence based interventions, and subsequently, keep the nurses safe. ...|$|R
