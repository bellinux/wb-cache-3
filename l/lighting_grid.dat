40|$|It {{is shown}} how weight {{reduction}} of cylindrical grid structures {{can be achieved}} by using axial-helical instead of helical-circumferential orientation of ribs. The optimization process mainly relies on an analytical model. A finite element model is used for validation and fine-tuning. Constraints are stability and material failure. Studies on the influence of rib heights and Young’s modulus reveal potential to create <b>lighter</b> <b>grids</b> in axial helical design. Also, the main mechanical differences of both grid types and their influence on structural weight are elaborated...|$|R
50|$|The new Alley Theatre became “the most modern, elastic theatre {{house in}} the world for the {{dramatic}} arts” thanks to Yale University professor George Izenour’s first-of-its-kind <b>light</b> <b>grid,</b> adjustable walls and analogue recorder. The tension wire grid, which Izenour described as similar to a bedspring, was made of a couple miles of aircraft cable, which formed a mesh 19 feet above the stage, allowing lighting technicians to easily walk on it before shows to adjust lighting and eliminated the need for footlights, spotlights and curtains.|$|R
40|$|The minimum mass {{designs of}} {{state of the art}} helical {{circumferential}} grids are compared to axial helical grids. Analytical models based on the classical laminate theory deliver optimization results in less than one second. Using finite element models the obtained results are validated and adjusted in a second optimization step. Studies on the influence of rib heights and Young’s modulus show potential to create <b>lighter</b> <b>grids</b> in axial helical design than in helical circumferential design. This is shown for medium length cylinders from relatively low up to very high load levels...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to calculating {{the amount of}} light in a space, AGi32 can create photo-realistic renderings of how an area will look once light fixtures are installed. It can compute {{the amount of energy}} used as well as glare metrics, and can incorporate a variety of situational design needs such as custom aiming, numerous rooms and objects in the same project, and it includes utilities for estimating fixture spacing. The software is designed to determine the amount of light reaching a designated surface or work plane for any type of application. Obtrusive light (exterior) may be calculated and compared against several US and international standards for code compliance. Roadway <b>lighting</b> <b>grids</b> may be laid out per North American (IES) specifications or per several different global lighting standards.|$|R
40|$|LIPA (Laser Induced Photochemical Anemometry) {{was used}} to measure velocity, vorticity, Reynolds stress, and {{turbulent}} intensity distributions in a subsonic jet. The jet region of interest was the area close to the jet-orifice. The LIPA-technique is a nonintrusive quantitative flow visualization technique, consisting of tracking a phosphorescing grid of fluid particles, which is impressed by laser-beams directed into the flow. The phosphorescence of biacetyl gas {{was used to}} enable tracking of the impressed <b>light</b> <b>grid.</b> In order to perform measurements in a jet, LIPA was developed and implemented for the specific flow requirements. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas to avoid quenching of the phosphorescent radiation of the tracer gas biacetyl by ambient oxygen. The use of sulfur dioxide to sensitize phosphorescent emission of biacetyl was examined. Preliminary data was used in a discussion of the potential of the LIPA technique...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} theater {{also had}} very few women's restrooms opening with four women's stalls for a 750-seat hall. The renovation {{increased the number}} of stalls to 16.

The press box included two radio broadcast booths and an organ booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25people, as well as a locker room for umpires. The field measured 330feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 375feet (114m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405feet (123m) to center field. Bullpens are located in foul territory in the outfield, with the home team occupying the third base dugout, and the visitors occupying the first base dugout.
