5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was taken}} ill with an {{undetermined}} infection in late 1917 and was granted leave. His health remained poor {{for the rest}} of his life, and he spent much of it convalescing. It was during this period of <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> he learned that he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order, for his work with the First Army School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting. For his wartime work with the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps, he was appointed a Commander of the Military Order of Avis.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

50|$|There are two named varieties. S. nanchuanensis var. nanchuanensis has <b>leaves</b> <b>that</b> are 1-2 pinnately compound, with {{terminal}} leaflets {{that are}} ovate to lanceolate. S. nanchuanensis var. pteridifolia has <b>leaves</b> <b>that</b> are 3-4 pinnately compound, with terminal leaflets or lobules linear.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in Drosophila germarium have identified the signals decapentaplegic and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.|$|E
25|$|In that case, Rehnquist went on, {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} have been a constitutional violation for an adverse action to have resulted even significantly from protected activity. The Court {{did not want to}} <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> reading in place, since it would allow a misbehaving employee to insulate themselves from adverse action by engaging in protected conduct.|$|E
25|$|Osman Pasha {{organized}} a defense and repelled two Russian attacks with colossal casualties on the Russian side. At that point, the sides were almost equal in {{numbers and the}} Russian army was very discouraged. Most analysts agree that a counter-attack would have allowed the Ottomans to gain control of, and destroy, the Russians' bridge. However, Osman Pasha had orders to stay fortified in Plevna, {{and so he did}} not <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> fortress.|$|E
50|$|Delairea odorata has 2 to 4 -inch multi-lobed <b>leaves</b> <b>that</b> {{somewhat}} {{resemble those}} of the unrelated English ivy. Its flowers are yellow. A feature that distinguishes it from Senecio angulatus are the small appendages {{at the base of}} the stalks of the <b>leaves</b> <b>that</b> are shaped like an ear.|$|R

25|$|A visa is a {{conditional}} authorization {{granted by}} {{a country to}} a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> country. Some countries – {{such as those in}} the Schengen Area – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The World Tourism Organization announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{evacuation}} of the internees began on February 11. Sixty-four U.S army and navy nurses interned in Santo Tomas {{were the first}} to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> day and board airplanes for the United States. Flights and ships to the United States for most internees began on February 22. Although food became adequate with the arrival of American soldiers, life continued to be difficult. The lingering effects of near-starvation for so many months saw 48 people die in the camp in February, the highest death total for any month.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} the Harriet Lane {{involved}} also possibly the oldest active combatant of the Civil War. Captain Levi C. Harby of the Texas Maritime Service, 69 years old, was {{in command of the}} Neptune, and was the last to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> vessel after ramming the Harriet Lane portside. The Neptune was hit by Federal gunners and sank, but the water was shallow enough that Harby and his men could continue firing their guns from her deck. This distraction enabled the Bayou City to carry out the successful starboard attack that captured the Harriet Lane.|$|E

25|$|After a sub-standard {{start to}} the 1983–84 season, Aberdeen's form {{improved}} and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours, and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers and Arsenal during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984–85 season, but had a disappointing season in 1985–86, finishing fourth in the league, although they did win both domestic cups. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, {{that he intended to}} <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> summer.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 Dantzig {{joined the}} {{mathematics}} {{division of the}} RAND Corporation. By 1960 he became {{a professor in the}} Department of Industrial Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966 he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973 he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> year, he headed the Methodology Group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at Stanford, and kept going, well beyond his mandatory retirement in 1985.|$|E
25|$|As Ciprigna makes {{preparations}} to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> {{night with}} the mysterious ambassador, Cilia discovers the plot to kidnap Isabella who is then rescued by Lelio. Later that night Ciprigna is about to depart for the magic island, but hears gunfire and then finds herself locked outside in a huge thunderstorm. Terrified, she begs to be let back into the house, seeks Bonario's forgiveness, and promises to submit to his authority. She is further humiliated when Fiuta reveals {{that he was the}} fictitious ambassador and the family berate her for her foolishness. She acknowledges her debt to Fiuta for bringing about her reform. Giglio is forgiven by the family but sent on his way. Bonario orders a feast to be prepared to celebrate the family's reconciliation.|$|E

25|$|For {{distinguished}} {{conduct in}} the line of his profession, extraordinary courage and disregard of his own life during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on 7 December 1941. When his station in the forward dynamo room of the U.S.S. Nevada became almost untenable due to smoke, steam, and heat, Machinist Ross forced his men to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> station and performed all the duties himself until blinded and unconscious. Upon being rescued and resuscitated, he returned and secured the forward dynamo room and proceeded to the after dynamo room where he was later again rendered unconscious by exhaustion. Again recovering consciousness he returned to his station where he remained until directed to abandon it.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} city of Cinania was rich, {{its inhabitants}} had several Luxury goods, but kept their independence {{due to the}} city's strong defensive walls, and despise for Rome. Brutus wished to conquer it before leaving Iberia and not <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> conquest for other officials. He planned a siege. The Romans used catapults to destroy the city's walls and invade the citadel, but the inhabitants resisted the attempted Roman assaults, causing Roman casualties. The Romans had to withdraw. The Cinanians used a tunnel, used for mining, for a surprise assault on the Roman camp destroying the catapults. Nonetheless, Appian mentioned two battles led by Brutus, in which women fought alongside the men, both ended in Roman victory. Archaeological data in Cividade de Terroso and tribesmen's Last stand behavior, which included their children {{in one of those}} battles, highlight the barbarity of the conquest.|$|E
25|$|Hearing that UFO bassist Pete Way was keen to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> band, {{the two met}} {{and decided}} their new band's name would be an {{amalgamation}} of their own two names, resulting in Fastway. They advertised in the music press for a drummer and a vocalist. Meanwhile, a rehearsal was organised for which The Clash drummer, Topper Headon, filled in on drums. Headon was doing this as a favour so that Clarke and Way could rehearse. The ads began showing positive results, cassettes from potential band members arrived; one of these was from a young, Dublin-based singer {{by the name of}} Dave King. Clarke was impressed with his voice and financed a trip to London for King and, after an audition together, he became the Fastway vocalist. Ex-Humble Pie member, Jerry Shirley, became the drummer.|$|E

25|$|It was {{established}} by 10 leaders called Datus (then reduced to 9, since Datu Puti, their leader, disappeared). Datus were high officials (just rendered high-official during the invasion but before the Hindu invasion, Datus were considered co-equal Paramount Rulers of a Kedatuan). They were connected with the court of Indianized native kingdoms of Brunei and Srivijaya, who were forced to <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> land on account of enmity with the Rajah, who was ruling the land at that time. The Datus, together with their wives and children, {{as well as a}} few faithful servants and followers; monks, scholars, soldiers were secretly escorted out of the country by the Rajah's Chief Minister, whose name was Datu Puti. The local folklore says that the name of the Bornean Rajah was Makatunao.|$|E
25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's performance contract and <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is not afraid of the Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman behind the counter. When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul must go back to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} of near-exclusivity by CBS, the network {{provided}} to its local affiliates three types of feeds from each venue: constant feed, swing feed, and flex feed. Constant feeds remained primarily on a given game, and were used primarily by stations with a clear local interest in a particular game. Despite its name, a constant feed occasionally veered away to other games for brief updates (as is typical in most American sports coverage), but coverage generally remained with the initial game. A swing feed tended to stay on games believed to be of natural interest to the locality, such as teams from local conferences, but may <b>leave</b> <b>that</b> game to go to other games that during their progress become close matches. On a flex feed, coverage bounced around from one venue to another, depending on action at the various games in progress. If one game was a blowout, coverage could switch to a more competitive game. A flex feed was provided {{when there were no}} games with a significant natural local interest for the stations carrying them, which allowed the flex game to be the best game in progress. Station feeds were planned in advance and stations had the option of requesting either constant or flex feed for various games.|$|E
