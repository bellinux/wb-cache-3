50|$|A low-noise block {{downconverter}} (LNB) is {{the receiving}} device mounted on satellite dishes used for satellite TV reception, which collects the radio waves from the dish.

40|$|Methods {{for obtaining}} {{improved}} performance from switching regulators {{with respect to}} their noise generation characteristics and dynamic response are developed through topology selection, refinement and generation, and by application of modern control techniques to both continuous and discrete time converter models. Reduction in switching noise is attained by focusing analysis and design effort on rendering the external converter current waveforms as near to the ideal dc quantities as possible. Three techniques, not relying on conventional low-pass filtering, are promoted and several new or refined converter topologies are generated with these methods. In addition, a power-processing elliptic-function filter specifically designed to meet the requirements of the switching conversion environment and applicable to many common converter types is presented. Performance of the new <b>low-noise</b> <b>converter</b> topologies is substantiated by several circuit realizations and laboratory measurements. Switching regulator dynamic performance is optimized by use of modern control theory in conjunction with the state-space-averaging technique. State-vector feedback coefficients which will minimize transient error excursions are determined through use of generally applicable algorithms for optimal linear regulator design. An alternative approach is developed that relies on a discrete-time formulation of converter and regulator that is the dual to state-space-averaging. Among the important results are a simple expression for duty-ratio-controlled inductive current bandwidth of wide applicability, and a general solution for obtaining the fastest possible transient response from a switching regulator. The results of the control analysis are convincingly supported with laboratory measurements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{number of}} {{wireless}} communication links is witnessing tremendous growth and new standards are being introduced at high pace. These standards heavily rely on digital signal processing, making CMOS the first technology of choice. However, RF CMOS circuit development is costly and time consuming due to mask costs and design iterations. This pleads for a Software Defined Radio approach, {{in which one}} piece of flexible radio hardware is re-used for different applications and standards, downloadable and under software control. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, little work has been done in this field based on CMOS technology. Recently, a bipolar downconverter front-end has been proposed [1]. In CMOS, only wideband low-noise amplifiers have been proposed, and some CMOS tuner ICs for satellite reception (which have less stringent noise requirements because they are preceded by an outdoor <b>low-noise</b> <b>converter).</b> This paper presents a wideband RF downconverter frontend in 0. 18 um CMOS (also published in [2]), designed {{in the context of a}} research project exploring the feasibility of software defined radio, using a combined Bluetooth/WLAN receiver as a vehicle. Usually, RF receivers are optimised for low power consumption. In contrast, we have taken the approach to optimise for flexibility. The paper discusses the main system and circuit design choices, and assesses the achievable performance via measurements on a front-end implemented in 0. 18 um CMOS. The flexible design achieves a 0. 2 - 2. 2 GHz- 3 dB bandwidth, a gain of 25 dB with 6 dB noise figure and + 1 dBm IIP 3. I...|$|E
50|$|The dishes consist usually of {{stepper motors}} {{to drive and}} aim the dish, {{gyroscopes}} to detect changes in position while the vehicle is in motion, a parabolic reflector, <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter,</b> and control unit.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{parabolic}} {{satellite dishes}} with one <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB) {{are able to}} receive a satellite television broadcast from one communications satellite at a time, parabolic torus reflector antennas are capable of establishing views to more than 35 C and Ku band satellites simultaneously, by employing multiple LNBs.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{a signal}} {{received}} from a satellite is firstly downconverted (this {{is done by}} a <b>Low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> - LNB), then demodulated by a modem, and at last handled by data terminal equipment.

40|$|In this thesis, design {{aspects of}} fully {{integrated}} multibandmultistandard front-end receivers are investigated based onthree fundamental aspects: noise, linearity and operatingfrequency. System level studies {{were carried out}} to investigatethe effects of different modulation techniques, duplexing andmultiple access methods on the noise, linearity and selectivityperformance of the circuit. Based on these studies and thelow-cost consideration, zero-IF, low-IF and wideband-IFreceiver architectures are promising architectures. These havea common circuit topology in a direct connection between theLNA and the mixer, which has been explored in this work toimprove the overall RF-to-IF linearity. One front-end circuitapproach is used to achieve a low-cost solution, leading to anew multiband multistandard front-end receiver architecture. This architecture needs a circuit whose performance isadaptable due to different requirements specified in differentstandards, works across several RF-bands and uses a minimumamount ofexternal components. Five new circuit topologies suitable for a front-endreceiver consisting of an LNA and mixer (<b>low-noise</b> <b>converter</b> orLNC) were developed. A dual-loop wide-band feedback techniquewas applied in all circuits investigated in this thesis. Threeof the circuits were implemented in 0. 18 mm RF-CMOS and 25 GHzbipolar technologies. Measurement results of the circuitsconfirmed the correctness of the design approach. The circuits were measured in several RF-bands, i. e. in the 900 MHz, 1. 8 GHz and 2. 4 GHz bands, with S 11 ranging from 9 ̆ 69. 2 dB to 9 ̆ 617 dB. The circuits have a typicalperformance of 18 - 20 dB RF-to-IF gain, 3. 5 - 4 dB DSB NF and upto + 4. 5 dBm IIP 3. In addition, the circuit performance can beadjusted by varying the circuit 9 ̆ 2 s first-stage biascurrent. The circuits may work at frequencies higher than 3 GHz, as only 1. 5 dB of attenuation is found at 3 GHz and nopeaking is noticed. In the CMOS circuit, the extrapolated gainat 5 GHz is about 15 dB which is consistent with the simulationresult. The die-area of each of the circuits is less than 1 mm 2. NR 2014080...|$|E
5000|$|BUCs are {{generally}} {{used in conjunction}} with <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converters</b> (LNB). The BUC, being an up-converting device, makes up the [...] "transmit" [...] side of the system, while the LNB is the down-converting device and makes up the [...] "receive" [...] side. An example of a system utilizing both a BUC and an LNB is a VSAT system, used for bidirectional Internet access via satellite.|$|R
50|$|Hence {{this device}} serves in an {{essential}} role as the junction element of the outdoor unit (ODU) of a VSAT modem. It protects the receiver front-end element (the <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter,</b> LNB) from burn-out {{by the power of}} the output signal generated by the block up converter (BUC). The BUC is also connected to the feed horn through a wave guide port of the OMT junction device.|$|R
50|$|Bias is used {{in direct}} {{broadcast}} satellites such as DirecTV and Dish Network, the integrated receiver/decoder (IRD) box actually powers the feedhorn or <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB) receiver mounted on the dish arm. This bias is changed from a lower voltage to a higher voltage to select the polarization of the LNB, so that it receives signals that are polarized either horizontally or vertically, thereby allowing it to receive twice as many channels.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, BSB launched, {{broadcasting}} five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC {{format and}} using the EuroCypher video encryption system which {{was derived from the}} General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, a flat plate antenna and <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB). Sky's system used conventional and cheaper dish and LNB technology.|$|R
50|$|Technology-wise, the Squarial pioneered {{a system}} of layered circuitry, {{effectively}} thin sheets of plastic embedded with the conductive reception nodes. Three of these sheets were stacked upon each other, padded with polystyrene layers to add rigidity to the unit. This is now commonly known as a 'phased array' setup. All this was engineered into a 38 cm wide plastic body, presented in white and adorned with the BSB logo at the bottom. The <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB) was based in the center, behind the layers, and contained a simple reception unit in line with other satellite antennae of the time. It was manufactured by Matsushita and rated as a 10 GHz standard unit.|$|R
50|$|The {{propagation}} of (low-frequency) ripple current through antenna cables may be prevented by capacitive coupling {{of the two}} conductors. Such elements are available as adapters called braid-breakers or ground breakers and have, in both the signal and ground connection, coupling capacitors (with a capacitance of approximately 1 nF). They are generally only capable of passing frequencies greater than approximately 50 MHz - ripple current cannot flow. Capacitive coupling adapters have an upper limit frequency of around 1 GHz, so UHF signals can pass through. A passband of approximately 50 MHz to 1 GHz makes the devices useful for analog and digital television reception, and broadcast FM radio reception. Such ground breakers cannot be used in commercial satellite receivers, since low-frequency control signals and the supply voltage for the <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> have to be transferred.|$|R
5000|$|The downlinked {{satellite}} signal, weaker after {{traveling the}} great distance (see inverse-square law), is collected {{by using a}} rooftop parabolic receiving dish ("satellite dish"), which reflects the weak signal to the dish's focal point. Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a feedhorn which passes the signals through a waveguide to a device called a <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB) or low noise converter (LNC) attached to the horn. The LNB amplifies the weak signals, filters the block of frequencies in which the satellite television signals are transmitted, and converts the block of frequencies to a lower frequency range in the L-band range. [...] The signal is then passed through a coaxial cable into the residence to the satellite television receiver, a set-top box next to the television.|$|R
25|$|The DRS {{undertook}} {{terrestrial broadcasting}} for large cities and direct broadcasting to SITE television sets for remote villages. However, {{it did not}} provide for small towns where the TV set density was {{higher than in the}} villages while not as much as in a city. The concept of a low-power limited rebroadcast (LRB) TV transmitter system was evolved to overcome such situations. The LRB consisted of a simple receiver system having a 4.5m chicken-mesh parabolic antenna with a <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter,</b> that served as the front-end for a low-power TV transmitter at the same location. Two suitable locations, Sambalpur in Orissa (75 villages) and Muzaffarpur in Bihar (110 villages), were tentatively identified for implementing LRB transmitter systems. This experiment was expected to provide useful data on the trade-off between DRS and LRB. However, due to financial constraints, these two LRBs had to be shelved, and instead an LRB was set up at SHAR, Sriharikota.|$|R
40|$|The CMS {{experiment}} foresees upgrades of its silicon pixel {{and strip}} detectors for the luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), CERN. Due {{to an increase}} in the number of readout channels and higher complexity, larger currents will have to be provided to the detector. Since cable channels are difficult to access and space for cables is limited, this would lead to excessively large resistive power losses in the supply cables, which increase with the current squared. CMS has therefore chosen a novel powering scheme based on DC-DC converters, which allows power to be delivered at a higher voltage and consequently lower current. The development of low-mass, <b>low-noise</b> DC-DC <b>converters</b> for application in CMS is presented, including studies of switching noise, magnetic emissions and power efficiency as well as system tests with silicon strip and pixel modules.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{high-speed}} flash style or a pipelining style analog-to-digital converter (A/D converter), the DC reference fluctuation caused by external noises becomes serious, as the sampling frequency is increased. To reduce the fluctuations in conventional A/D converters, capacitors have been simply used, but the layout area was large. Instead of capacitors, a low-noise and small-size DC reference circuit based on transmission gate (TG) is proposed in this paper. In order {{to verify the}} proposed technique, we designed and manufactured a 6 -bit 2 GSPS CMOS A/D converter. The A/D converter is designed with a 0. 18 um 1 -poly 6 -metal n-well CMOS technology, and it consumes 145 mW at 1. 8 V power supply. It occupies the chip area of 977 um by 1040 um. The measured result shows that SNDR is 36. 25 dB and INL/DNL is within 0. 5 LSB, even though the DC reference fluctuation is serious.

40|$|We {{present the}} NEFOCAST project (named by the {{contraction}} of "Nefeleâ", {{which is the}} Italian spelling for the mythological cloud nymph Nephele, and "forecast"), funded by the Tuscany Region, about the feasibility of a system for the detection and monitoring of precipitation fields over the regional territory based {{on the use of}} a widespread network of new-generation Eutelsat "SmartLNB" (smart <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter)</b> domestic terminals. Though primarily intended for interactive satellite services, these devices can also be used as weather sensors, as they have the capability of measuring the rain-induced attenuation incurred by the downlink signal and relaying it on an auxiliary return channel. We illustrate the NEFOCAST system architecture, consisting of the network of ground sensor terminals, the space segment, and the service center, which has the task of processing the information relayed by the terminals for generating rain field maps. We discuss a few methods that allow the conversion of a rain attenuation measurement into an instantaneous rainfall rate. Specifically, we discuss an exponential model relating the specific rain attenuation to the rainfall rate, whose coefficients were obtained from extensive experimental data. The above model permits the inferring of the rainfall rate from the total signal attenuation provided by the SmartLNB and from the link geometry knowledge. Some preliminary results obtained from a SmartLNB installed in Pisa are presented and compared with the output of a conventional tipping bucket rain gauge. It is shown that the NEFOCAST sensor is able to track the fast-varying rainfall rate accurately with no delay, as opposed to a conventional gauge...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{levels of}} {{integration}} {{through the use}} of GaAs and silicon MMIC devices, a die-cast housing, and the reduction of the number of subassemblies has enabled a large reduction of the size and weight of the electronics package for commercial and military satellite communications. This paper presents an electronics architecture and hardware that utilizes many new integrated circuits and design techniques, and allows flexibility for future satellite frequency changes and expansion. Key features of the radio are extended C-band, InSat, Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), and Ku-band coverage options; 70 (or 140) MHz transponder bandwidth or L-band block bandwidth IFs; integrated RS- 232 control through local handheld terminal or remote computer; remote control of crystal reference oscillator for aging and temperature compensation; integrated 2 or 5 watt solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA); optional integrated solid-state booster amplifiers to 40 watts; optional external amplifiers to 100 watts; integral beacon tracking with second integrated downcoverter for antenna positioning; radio, including <b>low-noise</b> block <b>converter</b> (LNB) and SSPA, weighs 8. 5 kg and measures 32 x 23 x 16. 5 cm; environmentally ruggedized for - 40 to + 60 C; O-ring sealed for waterproofing; passive (convection) cooling; and simple cabling and installation, with a single cable between radio and LNB, and two cables between radio and IF interface.

30|$|The RLS {{instrument}} {{used for this}} study was an elegant breadboard for the ExoMars mission, originally designed as a combined Raman and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument [24]. In order to decrease the weight and power usage of the payload aboard the ExoMars mission, the LIBS capability had in the meantime been removed from the flight mode instrument. Therefore, the effect of Mars atmospheric conditions on the LIBS performance of the instrument is not discussed in this article. The Raman modality uses a 659  nm laser with a maximum output of 20  mW. The RLS focal plane assembly incorporates a charge coupled device (CCD), a thermal/mechanical interface (cold finger) and proximity electronics. The proximity electronics include CCD bias voltage filters and a pre-amplifier circuit for amplifying the analogue video output signal produced by the on-chip amplifier. The thermal design of the spectrometer allows the CCD to be operated between − 40  °C and room temperature, with the CCD thermally isolated {{from the rest of the}} spectrometer including the proximity electronics. The spectrometer was designed to project multiple grating orders at different heights of the CCD. This way the instrument could be used over a broad wavelength range (for LIBS) and still offer a high spectral resolution (for Raman and LIBS). The CCD was a back-illuminated e 2 v Technologies CCD 42 - 40 with an imaging area comprising 2048 [*]×[*] 2048, 13.5  μm pixels. The device is Ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced, with a quantum efficiency of at least 50  % between 240 and 840  nm and imaging pixels with a full-well capacity in excess of 105 electrons. The device is a full-frame CCD but is usually operated in pseudo frame transfer mode in order to reduce smearing effects at short integration times (which can result in cross contamination of the spectral orders). The CCD is bonded to a ceramic Dual-In-Line (DIL) package but is flight representative with respect to its functional and thermal performance (including the mechanical interface to the rest of the spectrometer). The analogue video output from the focal plane assembly is digitised using a correlated double-sampling circuit and <b>low-noise</b> analogue-to-digital <b>converter.</b> A programmable digital signal processor (DSP) enables flexible detector operating modes, including synchronised CCD readout and laser emission.|$|R
40|$|Cellular handset {{evolution}} {{requires the}} front end transmitter to support multiple 3 G/ 4 G bands for global roaming, and also to be backward compatible with the existing 2 G (quad-band GSM/EDGE) network. The cost and size would be prohibitive if one power amplifier (PA) only supports one band or if multiple supplies are required for multiple PAs. Solutions of interest are based on multi-standard multi-band PAs (e. g. 2 multi-mode PAs instead of 8 + mode-specific PAs), and an efficient power supply that supports these multi-mode PAs. The thesis starts with a study of PA supply architectures and DC-DC converters. A series architecture consisting of a boost converter followed by a buck converter has advantages of <b>low-noise</b> buck <b>converter</b> output, together {{with the ability to}} deliver full power at low battery voltages to extend the battery life. The buck converter presents a constant power load for the boost converter, which raises stability concerns. Small-signal control-to-output transfer functions are derived for peak or valley current mode controlled boost converter with a downstream regulated converter modeled as constant power load. It is shown how current mode control provides active damping to ensure stability and well-behaved dynamic response. Furthermore, it is shown how load current feedforward presents an effective way to improve power load transient response. Modeling and design approaches are validated by test circuit simulations, demonstrating stable operations using current mode control under constant power loads, and improved power step load transient response based on load current feedforward. A buck/boost and LDO series architecture is proposed as the solution to address efficiency, linearity, noise and time mask requirements for the supplies supporting multi-standard, multi-band PAs. A monolithic integrated circuit (IC) has been designed and implemented in a standard 0. 5  5 V CMOS process for supplying the multi-mode PAs. The buck/boost converter with wide output range delivers the peak efficiency of 92 %.
