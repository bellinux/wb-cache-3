When for {{the second or third}} time the crowd was flocking in to view me, my eyes chanced to fall on a figure standing in the clouded light a little apart. He was dressed in a high-peaked hat and a long and seemingly brown cassock-like garment, with buttoned tunic and silver-buckled leather belt. Spurs were on his boots, a <b>light</b> <b>whip</b> in his hand. Aloof, his head a little bowed down, his face in profile, he stood there, framed in the opening, dusky, level-featured, deep-eyed--a Stranger.|$|E
6000|$|The two {{carried a}} long rope to which were fastened, at {{intervals}} {{of about two}} sofads, what she later guessed were light manacles, for she saw the warriors passing among the poor creatures in the enclosure and about the right wrist of each they fastened one of the manacles. When all had been thus fastened to the rope one of the warriors commenced to pull and tug at the loose end as though attempting to drag the headless company toward the tower, while the other went among them with a long, <b>light</b> <b>whip</b> with which he flicked them upon the naked skin. Slowly, dully, the creatures rose {{to their feet and}} between the tugging of the warrior in front and the lashing of him behind the hopeless band was finally herded within the tower.

6000|$|But {{they were}} too soft. He went through the long grass to a clump of young fir-trees, that were no higher than a man. The soft sharp boughs beat upon him, as he moved in keen pangs against them, threw little cold showers of drops on his belly, and beat his loins with their {{clusters}} of soft-sharp needles. There was a thistle which pricked him vividly, but not too much, because all his movements were too discriminate and soft. To lie down and roll in the sticky, cool young hyacinths, to lie on one's belly and cover one's back with handfuls of fine wet grass, soft as a breath, soft and more delicate and more beautiful than the touch of any woman; and then to sting one's thigh against the living dark bristles of the fir-boughs; and then to feel the <b>light</b> <b>whip</b> of the hazel on one's shoulders, stinging, and then to clasp the silvery birch-trunk against one's breast, its smoothness, its hardness, its vital knots and ridges--this was good, this was all very good, very satisfying. Nothing else would do, nothing else would satisfy, except this coolness and subtlety of vegetation travelling into one's blood. How fortunate he was, {{that there was this}} lovely, subtle, responsive vegetation, waiting for him, as he waited for it; how fulfilled he was, how happy! ...|$|E

Australian stockwhips can be as short as 3 feet (child's whip) or as long as 10 feet (3 metres). The standard Australian stockwhip is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long. Stronger people generally prefer a larger and heavier whip to be used on horseback. Small and <b>light</b> <b>whips</b> that are designed for crowded environments such as cattle yards are called yard whips. Yard whips are swift and easy to use.|$|R

5000|$|Doctor Light is {{a fairly}} minor villain in the Teen Titans {{animated}} series voiced by Rodger Bumpass. His character mostly draws from the less-competent version in the comics, though he does {{prove to be a}} formidable opponent. His powers are derived from his suit. Light is generally portrayed as more of a nuisance than a real threat, though he has his moments, and his frequent short appearances and easily defeats are something of a running gag. Doctor Light first appears in the season one episode [...] "Nevermore", where he proves to be a fairly dangerous opponent. He wears a simple, form-fitting suit which can fire energy blasts and create shields. Though he succeeds in defeating four of the five Titans, he angers Raven while attacking her. In her rage, she loses control of her powers and drags him into the darkness within her cloak. His second major appearance is in [...] "Birthmark". His suit is larger and more powerful, adding a <b>light</b> <b>whip</b> to his arsenal; he appears on an oil rig which he plans to steal the energy from, but was stopped by the Teen Titans who pointed out that they could see him on the rig from the living room of their tower. In the fifth season Doctor Light {{is one of the few}} villains that does not join the Brotherhood of Evil. In [...] "Kole", he tries to harness the power of the Aurora Borealis with a special crystal, only to fail when the Titans intervene and destroy it. Both he and the Titans fall through the ice into an underground prehistoric land. There, he kidnaps Kole to replace his broken crystal, which makes him virtually unstoppable. Gnarrk removes Kole from the machine, allowing Kole to defeat Doctor Light by focusing Starfire's starbolts into a powerful laser. In [...] "Titans Together", he attempts to rob a bank while the heroes and villains were occupied. All thirty Titans, having dispatched the Brotherhood, ready themselves to take him down, to which Raven remarks, [...] "He's totally gonna freak this time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bullwhips come in many {{different}} weights, materials, and designs. Some <b>light</b> <b>whips</b> use shot loading or lead weighting to affect their balance. Though usually made of strips of leather, nylon whips (often using paracord) have become popular—they were initially developed {{for use in the}} wetlands of Florida specifically, where leather is difficult to maintain hence the name [...] "Florida Cow Whip" [...] but have recently gained in popularity because they are less expensive than leather. In the old days in America, regular cowhide, rawhide and oxhide leathers were most commonly used for the construction of bullwhips because they were readily available. They tend to be quite thick and sturdy and are good for harsh conditions. Some whip-crackers doing target work prefer a whip made of kangaroo skin and kangaroo hide is preferred by whip makers because it is many times stronger than cow hide and can be cut into fine, strong laces allowing for more intricate braiding patterns that in the past could only be done with rawhide, which is much harder to work with.|$|R

The Potraj are nomads who get alms for displaying what must be an extremely grueling profession. The women balance a small platform with their deity perched on their heads and play a drum to a foot-tapping beat while the men dance, twirl and smack themselves with heavy whips made out of woven coir or leather. The whips may weigh in the region of 10 kg (22 lbs) each and are knotted for added measure and land on the backs of these performers with a resounding ‘thwack’.Children are thrust into this profession {{at a very early age}} so that they may grow up and be able to bear the crack of the whip on their backs.

In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth. The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of <b>light</b> as they <b>whip</b> in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange spectral lines that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days. The kB9 suffix to the spectral type indicates that the calcium K line is present and representative of a B9 spectral type even though the rest of the spectrum indicates A1.|$|R

Concrete foundations for the diesel power plant (which has been removed) are located alongside the stamp battery. Parts of another five head stamp battery are scattered to the south west of the battery area, however there are no foundations to indicate installation of a second stamper.

6000|$|Or perhaps, again, {{a portion}} of readers stumble at the threshold. In so vast a mansion there were sure to be back stairs and kitchen offices where no one would delight to linger; but {{it was at least}} unhappy that the {{vestibule}} should be so badly lighted; and until, in the seventeenth chapter, d'Artagnan sets off to seek his friends, I must confess, the book goes heavily enough. But, from thenceforward, what a feast is spread! Monk kidnapped; d'Artagnan enriched; Mazarin's death; the ever delectable adventure of Belle Isle, wherein Aramis outwits d'Artagnan, with its epilogue (vol. v. chap. xxviii.), where d'Artagnan regains the moral superiority; the love adventures at Fontainebleau, with St. Aignan's story of the dryad and the business of de Guiche, de Wardes, and Manicamp; Aramis made general of the Jesuits; Aramis at the Bastille; the night talk in the forest of Sénart; Belle Isle again, with the death of Porthos; and last, but not least, the taming of d'Artagnan the untamable, under the lash of the young King.

40|$|Charlotte Gray’s article “Second-hand-smoke {{story goes}} {{up in flames}} ” (CMAJ 1998; 158 [9]: 1178 - 80) {{demonstrated}} how entirely debased the pro-smoking lobby can be, and it also outlined the problems that can arise when scientific reasoning is ap-plied to what is primarily an ethical problem. To demonstrate just how un-sound arguments in favour of smoking in public can be, complete the follow-ing simple thought experiment. Imagine finding a novel carcino-gen that at modest levels clearly, {{in the words of}} the tobacco industry, is only “associated ” with lung cancer in animals and humans when inhaled as an aerosol. Reduce the concentration down a notch or two, and then pack-age the carcinogen in an inert and harmless base in an aerosol container. This new product can be marketed as Carcinogen-in-a-Can (CIAC). It is simple to use the product. When people near you <b>light</b> up, sim-ply <b>whip</b> out your CIAC and spray it liberally in their direction, providing the necessary reassurance that al-though the agent has been associated with lung cancer in rats and humans, studies to date have not conclusively demonstrated that the agent causes cancer when inhaled at low levels. In the event that low levels are shown to be harmful, you can simply reduce the concentration of the product, ar-guing once again that it is now safe. It is possible that the smokers near you will be upset by your apparently thoughtless and self-centred behav-iour, but they will undoubtedly be re-lieved to hear that this senseless and ill-mannered act gives you substantial enjoyment. (The more individuals who use CIAC, the more acceptable its use will become.) To argue that smokers should have a “right ” to expose others to a known carcinogen simply to satisfy their de-sire for a cigarette defies any system of ethical reasoning. In a civilized so-ciety, the ability of any individual to interfere with the well-being of an-other stops at the skin — which is why there never has been and never will be a rational argument in favour of smokers having a widespread right to smoke in public...|$|R
40|$|In a {{majority}} of culture media hitherto devised for Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv), use of animal sera was inevitable to meet the nutritional requirement of this parasite. In this meaning, Samuels'C_ 6 and C_ 7 medium (Samuels, 1963, 1965), in which <b>light</b> cream or <b>whipping</b> cream was used for serum, was of much interest. This experiment was done to examine Samuels'C_ 7 and further to make up an improved milk medium. A serum-containing medium (V-Bouillon) {{was used in this}} experiment as a control. The outline of results obtained was summarized as follows: 1) Subcultures of Tv with modified C_ 7 media in which various milk products were used in place of whipping cream were found impossible. It was, however, observed that fresh cow milk fairly stimulated the growth of Tv (Table 1). 2) As an improved C_ 7, TTM medium (Trypticase-Thiomalic acid-Milk Medium) which was finally prepared through the quantitative examination of each medium component demonstrated an excellent capability of supporting the growth of Tv. TTM medium was prepared as described below: 4. 2 g of trypticase, 1. 2 g of liver extract, 0. 3 g of yeast extract and 7. 5 mg of KH_ 2 PO_ 4 were dissolved in 100 ml of boiling distilled water. 8 mg of citric acid, 20 mg of thiomalic acid, 40 mg of ascorbic acid and 0. 5 g of glucose were added to the solution after cooling. The solution was adjusted the pH to 6. 0 with 1 N NaOH and sterilized with a Seitz filter. To the solution was further added 0. 8 mg of cholesterol, which was dissolved in absolute ethanol at the rate of 20 mg per ml, and 0. 25 ml of fresh milk which was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 ℃ for 20 min. or by intermittent boiling at 100 ℃ for 30 min. 3 times, and distributed into sterile test tube　 5 ml per tube. (Tables 2 and 3). 3) The following substances were found to be essential for Tv cultivation in TTM: cow milk, cholesterol, ascorbic acid and thiomalic acid. From the fact that thiomalic acid could be replaced by cysteine HCI, it was assumed that these substances might play a role in lowering the oxidation-reduction potential of medium. (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). 4) It was thought that trypticase and liver extract were the important sources of amino acids in TTM. Trypticase could not be completely replaced by polypeptone but by each 2 g of trypticase and polypeptone, the growth of Tv was satisfactorily promoted. (Tables 8, 9 and 10) From the results described above, it was concluded that TTM medium would be practically useable in the serial cultivation of Tv. The principal differences of TTM from C_ 7 medium were in; firstly the sterilization of medium with the Seitz filter apparatus, secondarily the addition of cow milk instead of whipping cream and lastly adjusting the pH to 6. 0. As to isolation culture of Tv from vaginal secretion of patients with use of TTM and other two milk media derived from C_ 7 medium, a report was previously published by the present authors (Nakabayashi and Miyata, 1967) ...|$|R
