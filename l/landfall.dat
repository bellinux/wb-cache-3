5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made <b>landfall,</b> most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel to make <b>landfall</b> between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a <b>landfall</b> on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a <b>landfall</b> {{in the northeastern}} portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted <b>landfall</b> position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its <b>landfall</b> was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final <b>landfall</b> prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made <b>landfall,</b> the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the <b>landfall</b> area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before <b>landfall,</b> which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before <b>landfall,</b> and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the strongest}} {{recorded}} tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual <b>landfall</b> or demise. However, three of the storms remained intense enough at <b>landfall</b> to be considered some {{of the strongest}} landfalling hurricanes– three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history. The 1935Labor Day hurricane made <b>landfall</b> at peak intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic <b>landfall.</b> Though it weakened slightly before its eventual <b>landfall</b> on the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900mbar (hPa; 26.58inHg) at <b>landfall,</b> making its <b>landfall</b> the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made <b>landfall</b> on the peninsula, though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its <b>landfall</b> marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.|$|E
5|$|Of {{all of the}} Category5 Pacific hurricanes, {{the only}} ones to make <b>landfall</b> at any {{intensity}} were Hurricane Kenna, Hurricane Rick, and Hurricane Patricia. None made <b>landfall</b> as Category5 hurricanes; Patricia and Kenna had weakened to Category4 {{at the time of their}} landfalls, and Rick was a tropical storm at its <b>landfall.</b> Patricia was the strongest <b>landfall</b> among Pacific hurricanes; 1976's Hurricane Madeline and 1992's Hurricane Iniki are tied as the second strongest storms at <b>landfall,</b> both of which didn't reach Category5 strength, but made <b>landfall</b> as stronger Category 4 storms than Kenna. Originally, a hurricane in 1959 was thought to have struck Manzanillo at Category5 intensity, but a reanalysis in 2016 indicated the storm had peaked as a Category4 hurricane, and made <b>landfall</b> with the same winds as Kenna. Patricia was also originally thought to have made <b>landfall</b> as a Category5 hurricane near Manzanillo before post-season analysis in 2016.|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{method for}} predicting <b>landfalling</b> hurricane numbers is to first predict {{the number of}} hurricanes in the basin and then convert that prediction to a prediction of <b>landfalling</b> hurricane numbers using an estimated proportion. Should this work better than just predicting <b>landfalling</b> hurricane numbers directly? We perform a basic statistical analysis of this question {{in the context of}} a simple abstract model, and convert some previous predictions of basin numbers into <b>landfalling</b> numbers.

40|$|The {{impact of}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes on the {{variability}} in the <b>landfalling</b> pattern of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific is studied using the bootstrap technique. It is found that, relative to neutral years, in the months September, October, and November or the late season of El Niño years the number of tropical cyclones <b>landfalling</b> in the landmasses rimming the western North Pacific is significantly reduced. The exception is Japan and the Korean Peninsula. On the other hand, in the late season of La Niña years, China can expect significantly more <b>landfalls.</b> The predictability {{of the number of}} <b>landfalling</b> tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific is found to be the highest for China in the late season of La Niña years. The {{reduction in the number of}} <b>landfalls</b> during the late season of El Niño years seems to be related to an eastward shift in the mean tropical cyclone genesis position and a break in the 500 -hPa subtropical ridge near 1308 E. In contrast, the increase in the number of <b>landfalls</b> during the late season of La Niña years appears to be related to a westward shift in the mean genesis position together with a contiguous 500 -hPa subtropical ridge. 1...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{economic}} {{damage from}} tropical cyclones (TCs) {{around the world}} has increased dramatically. Scientific literature published to date finds {{that the increase in}} losses can be explained entirely by societal changes (such as increasing wealth, structures, population, etc) in locations prone to tropical cyclone <b>landfalls,</b> rather than by changes in annual storm frequency or intensity. However, no homogenized dataset of global tropical cyclone <b>landfalls</b> has been created that might serve as a consistency check for such economic normalization studies. Using currently available historical TC best-track records, we have constructed a global database focused on hurricane-force strength <b>landfalls.</b> Our analysis does not indicate significant longperiod global or individual basin trends in the frequency or intensity of <b>landfalling</b> TCs of minor or major hurricane strength. This evidence provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to TC <b>landfalls,</b> which adds confidence to the fidelity of economic normalization analyses. 1...|$|R
5|$|A California {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{that affects the}} state of California. Usually, only the remnants of tropical cyclones affect California.

5|$|About {{six hours}} after Lam moved ashore, Cyclone Marcia made <b>landfall</b> along Queensland, {{making it the}} first time on record that two storms of at least Category4 {{intensity}} struck Australia on the same day. Lam was the first severe tropical cyclone to strike Northern Territory since Cyclone Monica in April 2006. In addition, Lam's <b>landfall</b> on February19 marked the third latest date for Australia to receive its first <b>landfall,</b> and the latest since 1988.|$|E
5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} <b>landfall</b> at some {{location}} at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make <b>landfall</b> {{because of their}} proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, {{as opposed to the}} westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made <b>landfall</b> while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made <b>landfall</b> at this intensity.|$|E

5|$|Allison {{remained}} somewhat disorganized, as no eye was visible, {{even when}} Reconnaissance flights confirmed {{that it was}} at hurricane intensity. The storm maintained itself as a minimal hurricane throughout the day on June 4 before it began {{to turn to the}} northeast, in response to southwesterly shear. Late that evening, the storm began to weaken, dropping back to tropical storm intensity as it approached the Florida Big Bend area. The intensity leveled off on June 5 until it made <b>landfall</b> that morning. Allison made its first <b>landfall</b> at about 10:00 am EDT (1400 UTC) near Alligator Point, Florida as a high-end tropical storm with 70mph (110km/h) winds. It briefly re-emerged over Apalachee Bay and made another <b>landfall</b> near St. Marks, Florida about one hour later with 65mph (100km/h) winds. Operationally, Allison was considered a hurricane until it made <b>landfall,</b> and was considered the earliest hurricane <b>landfall</b> in the United States for some time.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{multiple}} tropical cyclones {{affected the}} state, of which six made <b>landfall</b> as hurricanes; three made <b>landfall</b> as major hurricanes. Hurricane Alicia {{is the most}} destructive hurricane of the decade, severely impacting the Greater Houston area. The names of all three major hurricanes that impacted Texas during the 1980s were later retired by the World Meteorological Organization. In contrast to the 1980s, during the 1990s only one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Bret, made <b>landfall</b> on the Texas coast. In the next decade five hurricanes would make <b>landfall</b> on Texas. Hurricane Ike, the second costliest hurricane to impact Texas, made <b>landfall</b> during the decade. Other notable systems include Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Rita.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} {{underestimated the}} peak intensity of Pauline by 65mph (105km/h). On October 7, about 41hours before <b>landfall,</b> {{the government of}} Mexico issued a hurricane warning from Tapachula in Chiapas to Punta Maldonado in Guerrero. Shortly after Pauline made <b>landfall,</b> the warning was extended northwestward to Manzanillo, Colima, and later to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Pauline's turn to the west-northwest near <b>landfall</b> was unexpected, resulting in hurricane conditions {{with only a few}} hours notice in some areas.|$|E

It hit {{almost a month}} after the more powerful Hurricane Pauline made <b>landfall</b> in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E

5|$|Of the 118 Category 4 hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} eastern and central Pacific basins, 25 have made <b>landfall.</b> Of them, four made <b>landfall</b> at Category 4 intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as {{tropical}} storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than one Category 4 hurricane made <b>landfall,</b> and only during one year – 1992 – did three Category 4 hurricanes made <b>landfall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Officials from Trinidad and Tobago {{reported}} that Joyce made <b>landfall</b> in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any <b>landfall</b> to Joyce.

5|$|Several storms made <b>landfall</b> or {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Bonnie made <b>landfall</b> in southeastern North Carolina as a Category2 hurricane in late August, killing five people and causing about $1billion in damage. Hurricane Earl caused $79million in damage and three deaths after making <b>landfall</b> in Florida as a Category1 hurricane. The two deadliest and most destructive hurricanes of the season, Hurricane Georges and Mitch, caused $9.72billion in damage and $6.2billion in damage, respectively. Hurricane Georges was an intense Category4 hurricane that moved through {{many of the}} Caribbean Islands, causing significant damage before making <b>landfall</b> near Biloxi, Mississippi. Hurricane Mitch was a very powerful and destructive late-season hurricane that affected much of Central America before making <b>landfall</b> in Florida as a tropical storm. The significant amount of rainfall that Mitch produced across Central America caused significant damage and killed at least 11,000people, making the system the second deadliest hurricane in recorded history, behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} a climatology (1981 – 2012) of <b>landfalling</b> tropical {{systems in the}} eastern U. S. Corn Belt and investigates the total contribution of these storms to the monthly climatological rainfall in the Midwestern United States. The primary focus is on rainfall impacts from <b>landfalling</b> tropical systems on historic corn yields at the climate division and crop reporting district level. Climatologically dry to drought conditions for historic monthly observed rainfall are identified using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). It was found that without <b>landfalling</b> tropical system rainfall, the percentage increase in climatologically dry (or drier) conditions across the domain at state climate division resolution increased from 16 % up to over 200 %. The study also considers the effects of climatologically wet conditions on crop yields. <b>Landfalling</b> tropical system rainfall accounts for approximately 20 % of the observed monthly rainfall during the tropical storm season (June–November) across the eastern U. S. Corn Belt (1981 – 2012). Correlation between the annual number of <b>landfalling</b> tropical systems and annual yield by state results in no relationship, but correlation of August monthly observed rainfall by climate division to crop reporting district annual yields has a weak to moderate, statistically significant correlation in Ohio districts 30 – 60 and Indiana CRD 90. ANOVA analysis suggests that <b>landfalling</b> tropical rainfall may actually reduce yields in some state's climate divisions/crop reporting districts while increasing yield in others. Results {{suggest that there is}} a balance between <b>landfalling</b> tropical storms providing sufficient rainfall or too much rainfall to be of benefit to crops. Findings aim to provide information to producers, crop advisers, risk managers and commodity groups so that seasonal hurricane forecasts can potentially be utilized in planning for above or below normal precipitation during phenologically important portions of the growing season...|$|R
