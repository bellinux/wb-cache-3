The technique was applied to naturally infested soil and root samples; the two pathogens were detected and the target DNA concentrations were quantified. Significant correlations of DNA quantities in roots and the surrounding soils were found. The minimum soil DNA concentration predicting the development of disease symptoms was estimated as 20 pg (g soil) − 1. In three strawberry greenhouses examined, the target DNA concentrations ranged from 1 to 1, 655 pg (g soil) − 1 for P. nicotianae and from 13 to 233 pg (g soil) − 1 for P. cactorum.

40|$|Phytophthora fragariae var. fragariae Hickman, {{which causes}} red core disease <b>of</b> <b>strawberry,</b> is a {{quarantine}} organism {{on which a}} nil tolerance is placed. Detection of the fungus is by a root tip bait test which is highly specific and sensitive but time-consuming (5 – 6 weeks), {{has to be done}} at 12 °C and can require some taxonomic experience. Even with the test, detecting red core can still be difficult, especially with early primary infection of propagation beds or infected symptomless resistant cultivars. Moreover, P. cactorum, a closely related fungus, causes crown <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>strawberry.</b> It is not a quarantine organism, typical tolerances of 1 ␒nfection are allowed, and can confuse diagnosis.

In nested PCR, combinations of these primers can detect both pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity. Competitive PCR has also been developed to allow quantification of P. cactorum infection in strawberry crowns.

In this study, the Rhizoctonia species and anastomosis groups isolated from diseased strawberries in the Western Cape Province of South Africa were determined and their pathogenicity and relative virulence assessed. Both binucleate and multinucleate types were recovered from diseased roots and identified as R. fragariae and R. solani, respectively. Anastomosis grouping of the isolates was carried out on a sub-sample using the conventional method of hyphal fusion, and molecular techniques were employed to confirm results of the former. RFLP analysis of the 28 S RNA gene was used to further characterise relationships among the isolates of Rhizoctonia. The molecular results correlated with those obtained from the conventional methods. In the sub-sample tested, all isolates of R. solani were members of Anastomosis Group 6, whereas three AG types were identified among isolates of R. fragariae, viz. AG-A, AG-G and AG-I at a relative occurrence of 69 %, 25 % and 6 %, respectively. Pathogenicity trials were conducted on 8 -week-old cv. Tiobelle plants. All Rhizoctonia isolates tested were pathogenic to strawberry, but R. solani (AG 6) was the most virulent causing severe stunting of plants. R. fragariae AG-A and AG-G were not as virulent as R. solani but also caused stunting. R. fragariae AG-I was the least virulent, and did not cause stunting of the plants; however, it incited small, pale, spreading lesions on infected roots.

30|$|The genus Pratylenchus {{has a wide}} {{host range}} feeding on almost every species of {{cultivated}} plants. Many weeds also serve as good hosts. Numerous species of Pratylenchus {{are known to be}} associated with crops, grasses, and weeds in Egyptian soils. Consequently, it is quite possible to plant strawberries in such soils reported by Ibrahim et al. (2010) infested with {{one or more of the}} following species: P. coffeae, P. brachyurus, P. crenatus, P. goodeyi, P. minyus, P. musicola, P. neglectus, P. penetrans, P. pratensis, P. scribneri, P. thornei, P. vulnus, and P. zeae. In Egypt, information is scanty on the exact strawberry yield loss caused by a definite nematode species. Yet, in addition to their role as pathogens, some species of Pratylenchus can also predispose plants to invasion by some genera of soil fungi including Cylindrocarpon, Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and Verticillium (Warner 2018). For example, lesion nematodes, principally P. penetrans, are implicated in the black root <b>rot</b> disease complex <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> in Connecticut, USA. It was demonstrated that lesion nematodes and Rhizoctonia fragariae interacted to more than double the development <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> black root <b>rot</b> under controlled conditions. The interaction of P. penetrans, black root rot disease caused by R. fragariae, and strawberry root damage caused by feeding of the scarab larva, Maladera castanea, was determined in greenhouse studies (LaMondia and Cowles 2005 a). Averaged over all experiments after 12 [*]weeks, root weight was reduced 13 % by R. fragariae and 20 % by M. castanea. The percentage of the root system affected by root rot was increased by inoculation with either R. fragariae (35 % more disease) or P. penetrans (50 % more disease) but was unaffected by M. castanea. The percentage of R. fragariae-infected root segments was increased 3.6 -fold by inoculation with R. fragariae on rye seeds. The presence of P. penetrans also increased R. fragariae root infection.

40|$|The {{strawberry}} {{root rot}} complex or {{black root rot}} is common and increasing problem in perennial strawberry plantings worldwide. In many cases the causes <b>of</b> root <b>rot</b> are not detected or it is referred to several pathogens. During the survey on strawberry decline in Latvia and Sweden the root rot complex {{was found to be}} the major problem in the surveyed fields. Isolations from diseased plants showed that several pathogens such as Cylindrocarpon spp., Fusarium spp., Phoma spp., Rhizoctonia spp. and Pythium spp. were involved. Among these well known pathogenic fungi a poorly studied ascomycetous fungus, Gnomonia fragariae, was repeatedly found in association with severely diseased plants. An overall aim of the work described in this thesis was then to characterize G. fragariae as a possible pathogen involved in the root <b>rot</b> complex <b>of</b> <b>strawberry,</b> and to investigate biological control possibilities of the disease caaused. In several pathogenicity tests on strawberry plants G. fragariae was proved to be an aggressive pathogen on strawberry plants. The pathogenicity of G. fragariae has been evidently demonstrated for the first time, and the disease it causes was named as strawberry root rot and petiole blight. In order to investigate the process how G. fragariae invades and colonizes the roots and petioles <b>of</b> <b>strawberry,</b> the fungus was genetically transformed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. As revealed by studies with GFP-tagged strain, G. fragariae is an aggressive invader <b>of</b> both <b>strawberry</b> root and petiole tissues, and the cortex are the most affected tissues. Observations of the pathogen development in root and petiole tissues showed that the petioles are more sensitive to the pathogen infection resulting in more severe damages in shorter period of time. Gnomonia fragariae was also able to infect vascular tissues of petioles in later stages of the disease development. Ascospores were found to be highly infective suggesting that they {{could be one of the}} major means of disease spread in the field. Gnomonia fragariae isolates were further characterized and phylogenetic relationships inferred with other Gnomonia species and members of Diaporthales based on the nucleotide sequence analyses of two loci (nuLSU rDNA and ITS/ 5. 8 S region) of the ribosomal rDNA array. In addition to molecular methods, morphological examination was also performed. Results showed that G. fragariae is genetically distinct from the genus type species, G. gnomon, and other members of Gnomoniaceae, although morphological evidences to support this discrepancy were not found. It was suggested, that G. fragariae together with G. rubi, G. rosae and Hapalocystis represents a genetically distinct group, possibly a new family, within Diaporthales. In a series of biocontrol and root inoculation experiments carried out with two non-pathogenic Fusarium sp. strains originated from strawberry roots it was shown, that these strains have beneficial effect on strawberry plants and can reduce root rot on strawberry caused by G. fragariae. However, the evaluation of disease suppression efficiency and effect on strawberry productivity in actual culturing systems and elucidation of the modes of action of these Fusarium sp. strains need to be further studied...|$|R

40|$|The {{superior}} flavour <b>of</b> <b>strawberries</b> {{grown in}} the brown earth soils in Ireland compared with those grown on podsolics derived from calcium rich chalk has been recognised by UK wholesalers for some time. The strawberry variety Elsanta {{is the most common}} variety grown in both regions and it is reasonable to conclude that environmental factors especially soil type are mainly responsible for the superior flavour <b>of</b> <b>strawberries</b> grown on brown earth soils. The differences in soil pH, calcium and potassium concentrations were used as the main basis in drafting a research project investigating the effect of nutrition on the flavour <b>of</b> <b>strawberries.</b> A research project on the effect of nutrition on the flavour <b>of</b> <b>strawberries</b> under protection was undertaken at Clonroche in 1997.

30|$|Due to the {{increased}} economic and social benefits <b>of</b> the <b>strawberry</b> crop yield in Egypt, more {{attention has been paid}} to control its pests and diseases. Leaf blight, caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans, is one of the important diseases <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> plants. Therefore, effect of silicon and potassium, sodium and calcium silicates, and a fungicide on Phomopsis leaf blight <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> under laboratory and field conditions was examined.|$|R
