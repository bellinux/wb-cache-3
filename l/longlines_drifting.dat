However, there is little quantitative knowledge of the current field around the islands {{due to lack of}} long-term current measurements. We performed a systematic analysis of a total of 28917 points of fishing gear drifts from setting and recovery positions of demersal longlines deployed between 2002 and 2007 for Patagonian Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) fisheries in Kerguelen waters. This enabled the construction of a realistic field of depth-averaged time-mean slope currents along the 1000 m isobath all around the Kerguelen Islands. The strongest depth-mean velocities of 25 cm s− 1 are associated with the Polar Front, which rounds the islands from the south and flows northward along the inner continental slope immediately east of the islands, strongly supporting previous hydrographic evidence. These results demonstrate the potential for hitherto unexploited historic <b>longline</b> <b>drift</b> data from demersal fishing grounds to provide valuable quantitative information on the regional circulatio...|$|R
50|$|STRP {{began the}} Save the Leatherback Program in 2000 when a {{scientific}} {{article published in}} Nature magazine stated that the Pacific leatherback sea turtle could become extinct within 10-30 years if its adult mortality was not drastically reduced. Industrialized fishing practices, particularly <b>longlining</b> and <b>drift</b> gillnetting, used to catch swordfish, shark, and tuna, were cited as causing the most adult leatherback mortality. In response, STRP convened the International Leatherback Survival Conference in April 2002. The outcome was a call by leading sea turtle and marine scientists for a moratorium on Pacific <b>longlining</b> and <b>drift</b> gillnetting. In {{the next few years}} STRP organized over 1,000 scientists from 97 countries and 280 NGOs to sign a petition to the United Nations seeking a moratorium on high seas industrial longline fishing to prevent the extinction of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle. In 2004 the documentary Last Journey for the Leatherback? was released, which depicts the plight of the Pacific leatherback sea turtle.|$|R

50|$|Brachyplatystoma are {{important}} food fish. In the Amazon Basin, thousands of {{metric tons of}} fish from this genus are caught for both local consumption as well as exportation. These fish are usually caught {{with the use of}} <b>longlines</b> or <b>drift</b> nets. They are also captured by harpoon as well as ropes with large fish hooks at the end. B. filamentosum is a major fishery, and B. rousseauxii has become the most important species in the Amazon River basin. B. rousseauxii and B. vaillantii constitute a significant percentage of Amazonian food fish. Based on a review by IBAMA, B. vaillantii was by far the most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998, B. rousseauxii the fourth most caught and B. filamentosum the sixth (Semaprochilodus spp. second, Prochilodus nigricans third and Brycon spp. fifth).

Some seabird species can be captured incidentally as bycatch marine fauna. From July 1999 to August 2000 information on 554 surface longline sets was collected by onboard observers of the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (IEO) on 18 longline fishing boats working within the Spanish Mediterranean fishing area.

40|$|Bycatch {{is one of}} {{the main}} threats {{affecting}} marine megafauna worldwide, not only because of its prevalence, but also because the impact of high levels of bycatch in small oceanic regions may spread over whole oceans due to the complex dispersal patterns of bycaught species. Here, we use intrinsic and genetic markers to understand the impact of bycatch on the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the loggerhead turtle sharing the same foraging grounds in the western Mediterranean Sea. Turtles of Atlantic origin settle on the continental shelf later and at a larger size than turtles of Mediterranean origin and hence have been suggested to be more vulnerable to pelagic fishing gears, whereas those of Mediterranean origin would be more vulnerable to neritic ones. To assess whether this hypothesis holds true, we compared the genetic make-up of turtle bycatch from <b>drifting</b> <b>longlines</b> and bottom trawl/trammel nets in three different regions (eastern mainland Spain, southern Balearic Islands and southern Italy). A total of 176 incidentally caught turtles were considered, and size and habitat use, as revealed by stable isotopes, were incorporated to the analysis. No genetic, size or isotopic differences were found between turtles caught with <b>drifting</b> <b>longlines</b> and bottom trawl/trammel nets within any of the three regions. However, genetic, size and isotopic differences were detected among regions, regardless of the fishing gear. Thus, the population make-up of loggerhead bycatch depends on the area where the fishing operations are conducted, but not on the fishing gear used. Accordingly, the actual impact of loggerhead bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea will depend not only on the total number of turtles taken, but also on the geographic distribution of the fishing effort...|$|R

Since the year 2000 until the year 2013, 3007 longline fishing operations were monitored. In these 14 years, we recorded 57, 574 pelagic stingrays by-catches by Spanish longline. Two gear types concentrate 96. 05 % of pelagic stingray by-catch observed: traditional surface longliners targeting swordfish (LLHB) and surface drifting longliners targeting albacore (LLALB). We obtained two statistically significant explicative models for the gears LLHB and LLALB. In both cases, fisheries over continental shelf and summer variables are important parameters. Furthermore, for the LLHB explicative model included the variables: number of hooks, latitude where the setting started, Distance between both extremes of the longline and spring.

40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} that {{regional}} abundance of loggerhead and leatherback turtles could oscillate interannually according to oceanographic and climatic conditions. The Western Mediterranean is an important fishing area for the Spanish <b>drifting</b> <b>longline</b> fleet, which mainly targets swordfish, bluefin tuna, and albacore. Due to the spatial overlapping in fishing activity and turtle distribution, there is an increasing sea turtle conservation concern. The main goal {{of this study is}} to analyse the interannual bycatch of loggerhead and leatherback turtles by the Spanish Mediterranean longline fishery and to test the relationship between the total turtle by-catch of this fishery and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). During the 14 years covered in this study, the number of sea turtle bycatches was 3, 940 loggerhead turtles and 8 leatherback turtles, 0. 499 loggerhead turtles/ 1000 hooks and 0. 001014 leatherback turtles/ 1000 hooks. In the case of the loggerhead turtle the positive phase of the NAO favours an increase of loggerhead turtles in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|The isotopic {{concentrations}} of carapace scutes, skin, muscle and blood of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from the Balearic Archipelago were analysed {{to investigate the}} pattern of variation between tissues and to assess the position of this species in the trophic webs of the Algerian Basin. Skin showed higher δ 13 C values than muscle or carapace scutes and these showed higher values than blood. Conversely, muscle showed higher δ 15 N values than skin, skin showed higher values than blood and blood showed higher values than carapace scutes.

40|$|The {{leatherback}} turtle is endangered in the Pacific Ocean and concern about their persistence has increased {{as a result}} of declines in nesting populations over the last three decades. Due to the extensive migratory nature and complex life history of this trans-boundary species, population recovery requires a coordinated international effort that will boost reproductive output on nesting beaches while ensuring maximum survival of juveniles and adults in the ocean. To reduce adult mortality in shallow set <b>longline</b> (SSLL) and <b>drift</b> gillnet (DGN) fisheries, the U. S. has implemented a series of measures restricting fishing activity. The implementation of these measures has come at great economic cost to the U. S. fishing industry. For example, there has been a 50 percent decline in both the number of vessels and annual revenue for the west coast swordfish DGN fishery. The conservation benefits of the U. S. fishery management actions are uncertain and may have unintentionally led to a net increase in bycatch in the Pacific due to the potential transfer of fishing effort to foreign fleets, many of which have not instituted conservation measures to protect leatherbacks. Although no analysis has been conducted for west coast swordfish fisheries, two recent papers suggest {{that there may have been}} a market transfer when the Hawaii-based SSLL was closed in 2001.

40|$|Oceanic {{juvenile}} loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, foraging in Azorean waters, are incidentally {{caught in}} <b>drifting</b> <b>longlines</b> that target swordfish, Xiphias gladius, and blue shark, Prionace glauca. Data were recorded during a longline gear modification experiment conducted in 2000. The {{results show that}} the captures are not uniformly distributed in relation to fishing effort, with 81 % of the loggerheads (N = 232) caught in one-third of the sets (N = 93). The highest turtle catch rates were around the eastern group of islands, an area characterized by the presence of mesoscale eddies induced by bathymetric features. High catch rates coincided with the presence of the thermohaline front, between August and October, and when targeting blue shark. To investigate the causes of these differences we fitted a general linear model to evaluate the influence of mean depth, minimum depth, sea surface temperature (SST), soak area, soak time, moon phase and wind force on turtle and target species catch rates. These results revealed that mean depth and SST were most important for loggerhead catch rates, while minimum depth was the only significant variable for swordfish and mean depth, SST, wind force, moon phase and soak time influenced blue shark catches. The distribution of loggerhead sea turtles can be predicted by monitoring fishing areas in relation to bathymetry and SST. The impact of longline fishing could be greatly and quickly reduced by regulating the blue shark fishery and by increasing fishermen awareness for sea turtle conservation...|$|R

40|$|Bycatch {{reduction}} technologies (BRTs) {{have been}} developed to limit the incidental capture of non-target marine species in fishing gear, especially those species of special concern. However, in the absence of enforcement, the proven effectiveness of a BRT alone does not guarantee its adoption by fishermen. Human factors also play a fundamental role. This case study was directed at evaluating the willingness of Sicilian longline fishermen to use relatively large circle hooks (size 16 / 0) as a BRT for the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta. Fishermen were involved in testing circle hooks with their fishing vessels and their own commercial fishing gear, and their opinions before and after trials at sea were recorded. The present study showed the importance of creating a positive human context for testing a BRT. Findings provided additional confirmation about the usefulness of relatively large circle hooks to reduce the bycatch of loggerhead sea turtles on <b>drifting</b> <b>longlines.</b> Interviews before and after trials at sea indicated that socio-economic and emotional factors are essential for successful uptake of BRTs. Crews of large fishing vessels stated that {{they would be willing to}} use circle hooks in months with a high probability of turtle captures (June-September) if an economic incentive was provided and there was also public acknowledgement of their efforts.

40|$|Based on an {{extensive}} sampling regime from both nesting populations and bycatch, frequency analyses of mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region haplotypes in the Mediterranean {{were used to}} assess the genetic structure and stock composition of the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, in different marine fisheries. The analyses show the following. (i) In <b>drifting</b> <b>longline</b> fisheries working in Mediterranean pelagic habitats 53 - 55 % of turtles caught originated from the Mediterranean stock; (ii) In bottom-trawl fisheries all turtle bycatch is derived from this regional stock; (iii) This regional stock contribution to fishery bycatch suggests that the population size of the Mediterranean loggerhead nesting population is significantly larger than previously thought. This is consistent with a recent holistic estimate based on the discovery of a large rookery in Libya. (iv) Present impact of fishery-related mortality on the Mediterranean nesting population is probably incompatible with its long-term conservation. Sea turtle conservation regulations are urgently needed for the Mediterranean fisheries. (v) The significant divergence of mtDNA haplotype frequencies of the Turkish loggerhead colonies define this nesting population as a particularly important management unit. Large immature and adult stages from this management unit seem to be harvested predominantly by Egyptian fisheries. (vi) Combined with other data, our findings suggest that all the nesting populations in the Mediterranean should be considered as management units sharing immature pelagic habitats throughout the Mediterranean (and possibly the eastern Atlantic), with distinct and more localized benthic feeding habitats in the eastern basin used by large immatures and adults.

40|$|Radiographic {{studies are}} among the most {{important}} diagnostic procedures in the clinical evaluation of sea turtles. The anatomical structures for which it is possible to obtain an optimal assessment by radiographic examination are respiratory tact, digestive tract, skeleton, carapace, and plastron. The fundamental and indispensable projections for a proper radiographic estimation of the body are dorsoventral view, vertical beam, horizontal beam, lateral view, and craniocaudal view. Radiographs in the dorsal-ventral projection usually allow achieving the detection of fishhooks in the various sections of the digestive tract. In fact, hooks are poorly detectable in other projections due to the intense radiopacity determined by the superimposition of other anatomical structures, and to the inability to set the radiographic cassette in strict contact with the body of the animal. On the contrary, when the hooks are stacked in the esophagus wall, especially in the intracoelomatic tract, images in the dorsoventral beam do not allow to ascertain if the tip or the hook barbs are dangerously close to airways (trachea and bronchi) or great vessels (brachycephalic trunk). Without this information, the surgeon risks to cause irreparable injuries during the removal of the hook. On the other hand, a complete radiographic study in two orthogonal projections is invaluable to correctly assess position and orientation of the hook to properly schedule the surgery. The present study included 21 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) referred to the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Bari University (Italy), which showed <b>drifting</b> <b>longlines</b> hooks located in the caudal cervical or intracoelomatic esophagus subsequently to a first radiographic evaluation in dorsoventral beam. The other radiographic projections were obtained in horizontal beam lateral view, with turtles set on a radiolucent support (plastic box) with the surface of the radiographic cassette adherent to the lateral margin of the bridge. In order to reduce the overlap of soft tissues of the pectoral girdle, the front flippers were forward stretched below the neck, and temporarily wrapped together with self-adhesive elastic bandage. X-ray images were obtained with a digital acquisition system, which allowed improving contrast and brightness of images by graphic processing. The opportunity to evaluate different radiograms obtained in two orthogonal projections has allowed to precisely locate the position of hook, shank and bend with respect to the horizontal midsagittal plane the animal, the orientation of the tip (cranially, caudally or laterally), and above all the closeness to vital anatomical structures. These significant assessments have allowed choosing the most appropriate surgical approaches, and to avoid dangerous intraoperative maneuvers during removal of hooks...|$|R
40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) {{and blue}} shark (Prionace glauca) are two apex predators in the pelagic {{ecosystem}} {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea. Our current knowledge on their spatio-temporal distribution patterns and {{the effect that the}} surrounding environment has on them is limited. During the period of 1998 - 2001 and 2003 - 2005, data gathered from a series of surveys on the Greek surface <b>drifting</b> <b>longline</b> fleet were analyzed in order to estimate the effect of spatial, temporal, environmental and operational factors on the abovementioned species distribution and relative abundance (expressed in number of fish caught per 1000 hooks deployed). Application of generalized additive models allowed the identification of various parameters influencing catches as well as the contribution of each one. The optimum model was derived using a cross validation procedure which was based on the principal of parsimony: this principal tends to select those variables that depict more closely the actual trends than those that fit best the underlying dataset. Three sets were investigated for swordfish: (i) all specimens; (ii) individuals of size less than 100 cm of lower jaw fork length; (iii) individuals of size greater than 100 cm. The latter two partitions were considered with the intention to confirm whether maturation differentiates the animal’s behavior. The low number of blue shark catches, compared to swordfish, led us to a diverse modeling approach. Firstly, as a first step we modeled the probability of making a catch and secondly we modeled the positive catch rates separately, as in swordfish. It was deduced that spatio-temporal variables (Longitude, Latitude, Month, year) along with the fishing gear type were the most influential on the catches. Environmental constituents (Lunar index, thermal fronts, sea surface temperature) were of less importance and had only some partial effect. Distance from coast was proven to be a very significant factor, bearing a dual property as a variable: spatial and environmental. In particular, immature and mature swordfish differentiated significantly: adult specimens were more abundant to the south-east (Levantine), at the open seas preferring cooler water masses. In contrast, juveniles were more frequently observed to the north-west (Ionian), close to warmer coastal waters. Seasonally, juvenile swordfish were more proliferate in catches during the start and end of the fishing period, and during years of high water temperatures. Increased concentrations of swordfish were detected in the vicinity of thermal fronts. The lunar disc illumination affected positively all year classes, with maximum catches observed around full moon. Although no obvious decline of swordfish abundance was noticed, average size of specimens caught did decrease considerably during the study period. An extended migratory pattern was not confirmed. However, there were strong indications suggesting that Ionian and Levantine actually represent spawning grounds. Blue sharks were encountered more frequently to the north-west of our study area, during late summer in open sea cool water masses. However, the probability of locally high concentrations was higher to the south-east, during springtime, in coastal warm waters. Their presence in catches showed a constant plummeting trend through the years. Annual spring movements towards the shore are most probably related to reproductive activity. Both species are considered to be under severe fishing pressure. Annual closure of swordfish fishery during the winter months, enforced the past 20 years, represent a set of beneficial measures. Introduction of a minimum landins size for blue sharks, appears to be absolutely essential, since the declining annual abundance trends presented in this study, come as a confirmation of other analogous research. ...|$|R
