Remineralisation {{may be needed to}} replace minerals removed from the water by desalination. Although this process has proved to be costly and not very convenient if it is intended to meet mineral demand by humans and plants. The very same mineral demand that freshwater sources provided previously. For instance water from Israel’s national water carrier typically contains dissolved magnesium levels of 20 to 25 mg/liter, while water from the Ashkelon plant has no magnesium. After farmers used this water, magnesium deficiency symptoms appeared in crops, including tomatoes, basil, and flowers, and had to be remedied by fertilization. Current Israeli drinking water standards set a minimum calcium level of 20 mg/liter. The postdesalination treatment in the Ashkelon plant uses sulfuric acid to dissolve calcite (limestone), resulting in calciumconcentration of 40 to 46 mg/liter. This is still lower than the 45 to 60 mg/liter found in typical Israeli freshwaters.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of agricultural limestone to acid soils {{has often been}} found to be beneficial for crop production, especially when legumes are included in the cropping system. The extent to which these benefits are realized depends to a great extent on the chemical and physical properties of the <b>liming</b> <b>material,</b> rate of its application, degree of incorporation, and a variety of soil and climatic factors.

40|$|Although some {{methods for}} {{determining}} lime requirement of pond soils {{are available and}} commonly used, {{there is still no}} consensus on whether it is more effective to apply <b>liming</b> <b>materials</b> to the bottoms of empty ponds or to wait and apply them over the water surface after ponds are filled. There is also little information on how deep lime reacts in pond sediment over time, and whether the depth of reaction is different when <b>liming</b> <b>materials</b> are applied to the water or to the soil. Therefore, three techniques for treating fish ponds with agricultural limestone were evaluated in ponds with clayey soils at a commercial fish farm.

Effectiveness of agricultural limestone applications did not differ among treatment methods. Agricultural limestone also reacted quickly to increase total alkalinity and total hardness of pond water to acceptable concentrations within 2 weeks after application.
