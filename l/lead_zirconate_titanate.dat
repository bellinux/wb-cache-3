25|$|During World War II, {{independent}} research {{groups in the}} United States, Russia, and Japan discovered {{a new class of}} synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop barium titanate and later <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> materials with specific properties for particular applications.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{ferroelectric material}} for applications is <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> (PZT), {{which is part}} of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and anti-ferroelectric lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lead</b> {{lanthanum}} <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> actuators {{taken as}} {{one type of}} photo-deformable actuators have been widely applied for micro-driven systems and active vibration control of photostrictive laminated flexible structures. However, the slow response of photodeformation of single patch <b>lead</b> lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> actuator greatly affects its application. In this article, the main factors for the slow response of the <b>lead</b> lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> actuator are investigated using experimental method. The increasing temperature during light on state and the residual photovoltage and photodeformation during light off state are considered as dominant factors causing the slow response of the <b>lead</b> lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> actuator. To gain a better driving capability of <b>lead</b> lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> actuator, some effective solutions through weakening the effect of increasing temperature and eliminating residual photovoltage and photodeformation are proposed and experimentally validated in this article. Considering the effective solutions proposed in this article, a novel optical driving mechanism based on multi-patches combination is proposed...|$|R

40|$|A Flexure Plate Wave (FPW) {{resonator}} using piezoelectric <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanates</b> (PZT) films {{is proposed}} for liquid density sensing. FPW device {{is suitable for}} liquid sensing because of less scattering of the energy from the FPW to the loading liquid due to its low phase velocity. This study adopts Sol-Gel derived PZT thin films to fabricate the FPW resonator. The material system is Pt/Ti/PZT/LSMO/SiNx. The COM theory is used to simulate the response of a two-port SAW resonator, which is extended {{to the design of}} the FPW resonator. The preliminary measurement results show that the resonant frequency and the relative liquid density have a good linear correlation, and demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor application using the FPW resonator.

25|$|The {{piezoelectric}} effect {{is understood as}} the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The {{piezoelectric effect}} is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E
500|$|A {{piezoelectric}} {{material is}} one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field {{when it is}} distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability. [...] This precluded the transducer from functioning {{as one of the}} resonators; {{it had to be a}} separate component. [...] This problem was solved with the introduction of <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is quartz, which has also been used in mechanical filters. [...] However, ceramic materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater electromechanical coupling coefficient.|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{piezoelectric}} effect in thin film <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> [...] PZT, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) power generating device has been developed. During recent improvement in piezoelectric technology, Aqsa Abbasi (also known as Aqsa Aitbar, General secretory at IMS, IEEE MUET Chapter and Director Media at HYD MUN [...] ) diffentiated two modes called [...] and [...] in vibration converters and [...] re-designed to resonate at specific frequencies from an external vibration energy source, thereby creating [...] electrical energy via the {{piezoelectric effect}} using electromechanical damped mass.|$|E
50|$|The Burns {{temperature}}, Td, is {{the temperature}} where a ferroelectric material, previously in paraelectric state, starts to present randomly polarized nanoregions, that are polar precursor cluster. This behaviour {{is typical of}} several, but not all, ferroelectric materials, and was observed in lead titanate (PbTiO3), potassium niobate (KNbO3), <b>lead</b> lanthanum <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> (PLZT), <b>lead</b> magnesium niobate (PMN), lead zinc niobate (PZN), K2Sr4(NbO3)10, and strontium barium niobate (SBN), Na1/2Bi1/2O3(NBT).|$|R

2500|$|The {{standard}} US Navy scanning sonar {{at the end}} of the World War II operated at 18kHz, {{using an}} array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range, however, required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics, and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanate</b> (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons, and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first, the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and [...] "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication and preliminary experimental {{results of a}} flexure plate wave (FPW) resonator using sol-gel derived <b>lead</b> <b>zirconate</b> <b>titanates</b> (PZT) thin films. The resonator adopts a two-port structure with reflecting grates on the composite membrane of PZT and SiNx. The design of the reflecting grate is derived from a SAW resonator model using COM theory to produce a sharp resonant peak. The comparison between the mass and the viscosity effects from the theoretical expression illustrates the applications and {{the constraints of the}} proposed device in liquid sensing. Multiple coatings of sol-gel derived PZT films are adopted because of the cost advantage and the high electromechanical coupling effect over other piezoelectric films. The fabrication issues of the proposed material structure are addressed. Theoretical estimations of the mass and the viscosity effects are compared with the experimental results. The resonant frequency has a good linear correlation with the density of low viscosity liquids, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed device.
