5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of <b>legal</b> <b>change.</b> Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{drinking}} age {{was lowered}} to 18 in 1973 {{as part of}} a broader <b>legal</b> <b>change</b> which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or <b>legal</b> <b>change,</b> although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

Although initially removing the ban introduced by the previous government, the Borisov Cabinet re-introduced it in 2012 with the aim {{to reduce the number of}} smokers from 40% of the population to about 15–20%.During its term, Borisov's first government also achieved the second-lowest debt burden in the European Union, and the third-lowest budget deficit in the European Union. Parliament also adopted changes in the organic budget law that mandate budget deficits below 2% of GDP in any one year. These changes were fashioned after a similar <b>legal</b> <b>change</b> in Germany and have the effect of curbing wasteful government spending. The strong fiscal policy is the main achievement of the GERB government. For it Boyko Borisov has received accolades from Angela Merkel, David Cameron, José Manuel Barroso and Barack Obama.|$|E

All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yılmaz and Çiller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking {{nearly two-thirds of the}} seats.

500|$|Clifton approvingly {{quoted the}} {{arguments}} in Animal Rights Without Liberation concerning animals killed in crop harvest, and observed that, {{other than a}} hypothetical openness towards ethically produced eggs and dairy, Cochrane's arguments would seem to favour veganism over vegetarianism. Clifton also showed interest in Cochrane's arguments concerned pet-keeping, writing [...] "Cochrane never mentions pit bulls, but his argument is in effect a case for prohibiting pit bull breeding: pit bulls have never been more than 5% of the U.S. dog population, but are 20% of the dogs impounded in cruelty and neglect cases." [...] Boisseau worried that animal activists may find the imprecise positions of [...] "animal rights" [...] or [...] "animal liberation" [...] more useful than Cochrane's comparatively nuanced position, and questioned {{the extent to which}} political and <b>legal</b> <b>change</b> could be possible given continued use of animals.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have something important {{to contribute to the}} debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that <b>legal</b> <b>change</b> does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E

Erskine, however, perceived it differently, and had records of the entire trial printed and sent to Charles James Fox and Lord Camden. Taking this as a hint, Fox (after much delay) introduced a Bill to Parliament in May 1791, seeking to reform the law relating to libel. After it was passed through the Commons {{it went to the}} House of Lords, where members of the judiciary attemted to delay it; in response Lord Camden, then 78, rose and bluntly stated that if the judges were to be the sole arbiters of public opinion, nothing would be able to appear that criticised the government, leading to a stifling of the freedom of the press. His appeal was successful – without it, historian H. M. Lubasz writes, the Bill would never have passed the Lords – and within three weeks Parliament had formally passed the Libel Act 1792, commonly known as Fox's Libel Act, allowing juries {{for the first time to}} decide precisely what constituted libel.<45> ...|$|E

40|$|This essay uses consequence-based inquiry (“CBI”) {{to derive}} a {{normative}} framework for determining when financial market <b>changes</b> should drive <b>legal</b> <b>changes.</b> This framework {{can improve the}} current ad hoc and politically distorted lawmaking process, which often results in over- or under-reactive <b>legal</b> <b>changes</b> that are made too late, after harm has occurred. Under the framework, {{the extent to which}} financial market <b>changes</b> should drive <b>legal</b> <b>changes</b> should depend on the consequences of the market failures resulting from financial market changes and the consequences of changing the law to attempt to correct those market failures. CBI is broader in several ways than traditional cost-benefit analysis, addressing not only the “how” but also the “when” of regulation and also addressing the “how” more objectively than cost-benefit analysis. Whereas traditional cost-benefit analysis assumes a decision, which may well be politically motivated, to implement specific proposed regulation if its benefits exceed its costs, CBI begins by identifying a financial market change, determining whether any market failures result from the market change, and assessing the consequences of those failures. If those consequences are significantly negative, CBI gets to the next steps of considering <b>legal</b> <b>changes</b> that could correct the harmful failures, examining the consequences of making those changes, and finally balancing consequences to reach a course of action. Those next steps are more objective than cost-benefit analysis; they avoid confirmation bias because they do not necessarily start with any specific proposal, and they are less subject to political distortions...|$|R

The Oregon wine industry received a stern challenge from nature, when the Phylloxera root louse {{was discovered in}} Oregon. This necessitated the use of Phylloxera-resistant rootstocks, many vineyards took {{this as an opportunity}} to select different varieties of grapes more suited to their particular location. The Rogue Valley AVA was established; three years later, the Oregon Wine Marketing Coalition was founded. In 1995, the Oregon Legislature enacted several new laws which were beneficial to winemakers. Direct in-state wine shipments from wineries to customers were legalized, allowing Oregon winemakers to partially bypass wine wholesalers. In-store wine tasting was also legalized, as were certain off-site special events hosted by wineries. Oregon State University established a professorship in fermentation science. In 1998, the wine industry contributed USD $120 million to the Oregon economy. A further <b>legal</b> <b>change</b> occurred in 1999, when legislation (HB 3429) was passed allowing multiple winery licensees on a single premise. This led to new winemaking arrangements, such as the Carlton Winemakers Studio and the SE Wine Collective.|$|E
