5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death {{have become the}} subjects of modern art and literature. His death was a popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust.|$|E

Once back in Rock Springs, the Chinese laborers found scorched tracts of land where their homes once stood.

They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.|$|E

The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs.

The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely.

Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in the vault at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E

5|$|In North America, {{the fungus}} has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, Michigan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, and South Dakota. In Canada, {{it has been found}} in Ontario. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are likely to be found on old hemlock knots <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps. In Europe, it {{has been recorded}} from Britain, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, and Turkey. In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} trade and {{transport}} became more important. The surrounding area was discovered to have large phosphorus reserves which brought industry to Northallerton {{due to the}} easy trade routes. Lying on the main route between Edinburgh and London it became an important stopping point for coaches travelling the route, eventually superseded by {{the growth of the}} railways in the 19th century. <b>Lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of a large rural area Northallerton was established as a market town in 1200 by Royal Charter, and there is still a market in the town today.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E

5|$|Nevado del Ruiz {{lies within}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, {{a region that}} encircles the Pacific Ocean and {{contains}} some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As {{is the case for}} many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).|$|E
5|$|Norris {{began to}} plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than a {{kilometer}} behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of April 18, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord and ran into a local villager who alerted the North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass. Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E

Between 1988 and 2008, the Cook Islands sent delegations to all six Summer Olympic games. The size of the Cook Islander delegation was largest in 1988, when it reached seven athletes. The size of the nation's delegation has not risen past four since then as of the Beijing Olympics.|$|E
