50|$|Lobing is {{measured}} {{as having a}} comb filtering response (i.e., areas of peaks and dips) as the <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> varies vertically‡ w.r.t. the nominal on-axis position.

50|$|Since it is {{rare for}} a tweeter and {{mid-range}} (or woofer) to have their diaphragms or acoustic centers in the same physical plane, it follows that sound waves emitted by them (of the same frequency) will not reach a particular <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> in the on-axis plane at the same time. Conversely, the MT or TM combination's on-axis plane is not coincident with the physical on-axis plane - it is tilted w.r.t. the physical plane. The overall effect {{is that at the}} crossover frequency (when both drivers are reproducing the same frequency) the sound from both drivers does not acoustically sum ideally at the on-axis <b>listening</b> <b>position.</b> There will, however, be some off-axis <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> where the acoustic sum is ideal - but the <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> itself may be such that it is not practical.

50|$|The {{physical}} {{reason for}} a lobe to form {{is the fact that}} at any point that is at a position unequal from both drivers, at certain frequencies (i.e., wavelengths) and depending on d and relative difference between the distances to the <b>listening</b> <b>position,</b> the wavefronts from each driver will interfere constructively or destructively.

50|$|The {{large black}} dot is the {{vertical}} <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> {{relative to the}} centre, at a certain fixed horizontal distance from the speaker. For wavelengths much greater than d, the wavefront is almost spherical (circular, when seen from the side) and the sound level is constant {{for a variety of}} such <b>listening</b> <b>positions</b> - the off-axis response of the speaker is almost omnidirectional. As the distance d approaches &lambda;/4, the wavefront starts becoming narrower. At the <b>listening</b> <b>position,</b> the sound level {{is not the same as}} it would have been, had it been exactly midway between the drivers. The area where the sound level is constant for a given range of vertical <b>positions</b> (and fixed <b>listening</b> distance) is the lobe. Outside the lobe, the sound level is much less and this is what causes the speaker to have a change in tonality as ones listening height changes.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{surround}} sound in cinema {{can be considered}} fairly ubiquitous today, and with {{that the practice of}} using the center channel for playback of dialogue content. The studies done for dialogue or speech content in the center channel have utilised Speech-in-Noise tests, without placing the test procedure in a realistic application. This study investigated how untrained listeners rated different excerpts of film with accompanying {{surround sound}} in three different playback options for dialogue content: center channel, phantom center and the dialogue positioned in the soundscape according to the actors' positions on screen. The purpose of these ratings was to examine whether one of these three playback options better preserved audio quality in a non-ideal <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> compared to an ideal one.

40|$|Loudspeaker-based spatial audio {{systems are}} often {{designed}} {{with the aim}} to create an auditory event or scene to a listener positioned in the optimal <b>listening</b> <b>position.</b> However, in real-world domestic listening environments, listeners can be distributed across the listening area.

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the MTM {{configuration}} is {{the interaction between the}} two midwoofers. For any frequency (over the operating range of the midwoofers), the off-axis response exhibits different lobing patterns because of the vertical distance between the midwoofers, and {{as a function of the}} frequency and horizontal distance from the speaker. At any off-axis <b>listening</b> <b>position,</b> although both midwoofers operate in phase (are time-aligned), the waves from each reach the <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> at different times (and therefore have a relative phase difference) - at frequencies where the time displacement between the two midwoofers corresponds to one-half of one wavelength, the outputs of the two midwoofers will null. However, the time displacement itself is a function of the distance from the speaker and frequency, which means that the lobing for a given listening distance and off-axis position will be different at different frequencies. Since the basic reason for this is the distance between the midwoofers, again the solution is to use as small drivers as possible, placed as close as possible. With this, for listening distances much greater than the distance between the drivers the lobing effects are much less obvious.|$|R

This paper presents the results of two listening tests that investigate how the inter-channel correlation between loudspeakers affects the perceived diffuseness. In the first experiment inter-channel cross-correlation coefficient (ICC) was varied for pink noise stimuli reproduced using 4 different loudspeaker layouts and at two <b>listening</b> <b>positions.</b> In a second experiment, 1 / 3 octave noise stimuli were investigated in a similar manner using variable ICC and two <b>listening</b> <b>positions.</b> The ICC was found to have a large effect on the perceived diffuseness in both experiments and for all frequency bands (125 Hz, 1 kHz and 8 kHz) where correlation between loudspeakers would reduce the perceived diffuseness. Although frequency was found to be a significant factor, the ICC and listener position had larger effects with although moving off-centre only reduced the perceived diffuseness when fewer loudspeakers were used. Off-centre appears more robust to small amounts of correlation between loudspeakers as the loudspeakers signals no longer arrived at the listener at the same time...|$|R

40|$|According to the literature, {{the seat}} dip effect creates a valley in the {{frequency}} responses of the direct sound and some early reflections in concert halls. The low frequencies are attenuated up to 20 dB between 100 and 500 Hz due to the sound passing over seating at near grazing incidence. The seat dip effect includes several phenomena due to the wave nature of sound, such as diffraction and scattering. In this paper we simulate several stage and seat configurations with 3 D FDTD modeling. The modeling results are shown to be {{in close agreement with}} the simulated and measured data presented in the literature. However, the main point of the paper is to analyze and visualize how the low frequency energy is propagating in concert halls. The seat dip effect attenuates the low frequencies of early sound at the <b>listening</b> <b>position</b> despite that the seats are not always absorbing the energy.

40|$|Acoustical Indexes as {{described}} in ISO 3382 - 11, with their optimal values, are not necessarily positively correlated. Some {{of them are in}} fact negatively correlated 2. This means that when designers try to shape a room {{in such a way as}} to obtain optimal EDT and C 80 values for a certain position in the room, they face contrasting objectives. This problem is further complicated by the fact that rooms are designed for multiple <b>listening</b> <b>positions</b> with different distances from the sound source and from reflecting surfaces. The distribution of energy in time and space that is required to obtain optimal acoustical values for all <b>listening</b> <b>positions</b> in a room is a complex problem.
