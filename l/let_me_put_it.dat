2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{began in}} earnest on October 16, 2007, when Colbert officially announced his candidacy on his own 11:30 pm–12:00 am EST Comedy Central program, The Colbert Report. Colbert had earlier appeared on The Daily Show, the program immediately preceding his own on the Comedy Central lineup, but had stated that his final declaration of candidacy would be made on a [...] "more prestigious show". Subsequent to his declaration, Colbert appeared on Meet the Press on October 21, 2007, where he asserted the reality of his campaign: [...] "I'm far realer than Sam Brownback, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> that way," [...] said Colbert.|$|E

When asked by a reporter where in the United States that Sharia law was being practiced, Moore said [...] "Well, there's Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there.

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> that way." ...|$|E

They'd be listening to music I hate, watching TV all the time, and talking about Big Brother. I needed to remove it, to get to the essence of adolescence without the paraphernalia of today. In a way I am arrested in my adolescent emotions, like most of us I think are, so film is very personal, funnily enough, despite it being about two girls. I identify with Mona to an unhealthy degree laughs, so the main thing was to make these teenagers the sort of teenagers I could relate to myself, slightly more timeless and removed from now.
