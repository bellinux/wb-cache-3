40|$|The {{general area}} of {{management}} of marine resources {{is one that}} has gained worldwide prominence {{since the beginning of the}} negotiations on the new Law of the Sea at the United Nations in 1968. The paper takes the premise that part of the reason for that concern has been to find a framework for general conservation and rational use of marine resources as natural resources. However, the central reason is that individual states want what they consider an access to equitable share of the resources for use by their nationals. Kenyan delegates have been particularly active at the international negotiations. This paper takes the fisheries sector alone, and examines the range of activities in which Kenya nationals and companies are involved. A primary focus is on the amount of fishing done; where, along the coast, the fishing activities are done; and the contribution of that sector to employment especially to the coastal population. The role of relevant government departments in promoting the activities is appraised and the degree of intrusion of foreign <b>long-distance</b> <b>fleets</b> in Kenyan waters is examined...|$|R
50|$|As of 2002, much of {{the former}} Soviet Union still applied limits on sulfur in diesel fuel {{substantially}} higher than in Western Europe. Maximum levels of 2,000 and 5,000 ppm were applied for different uses. In Russia, lower maximum levels of 350 ppm and 500 ppm sulfur in automotive fuel were enforced in certain areas, particularly in regions. Euro IV and Euro V fuel with a concentration of 50 ppm or less was available at certain fueling stations, {{at least in part}} to comply with emissions control equipment on foreign-manufactured cars and trucks, number of which is increased every year, especially in big cities, such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. According to the technical regulation, selling a fuel with sulfur content over 50 ppm was allowed until 31 December 2011. Euro IV diesel may in particular be available at fueling stations selling to <b>long-distance</b> truck <b>fleets</b> servicing import and export flows between Russia and the EU.|$|R

50|$|In 1996, {{as part of}} {{a massive}} {{modernization}} program, TRA placed an order for 64 electric locomotives from Union Carriage & Wagon and 384 passenger cars from Hyundai Mobis to expand the service. Rated at 6600 hp apiece, the E1000 was and still is TRA's most powerful locomotive. The units were arranged into trainsets of fourteen units, with two locomotives bracketing 12 coaches. As part of TRA's attempt to attract riders in 2002, 32 restaurant cars were ordered to supplement the trainsets. However, with the elimination of dining service, these were converted to baggage cars. With the withdrawal of the EMU100 series from regular service, the E1000 has established itself as the backbone of TRA's <b>long-distance</b> <b>fleet,</b> though it has found its role undermined by delivery of the TEMU lineup.|$|E
50|$|Central Railway Station has {{a network}} of suburban, {{interurban}} and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalised and run by the FFCC (Ferrocarriles de Cuba - Railways of Cuba). Rail service connects the Central Rail Station to various Cuban provinces. In 2009, the annual passenger volume was roughly 7.5 million, almost 400,000 less from the previous year, and 3.5 million less than 2004, mainly after the government upgraded ASTRO's <b>long-distance</b> inter-city buses <b>fleet</b> with brand new air conditioned Yutong buses. Santiago de Cuba is the busiest route from the Central Station, some 836 km apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Passenger {{cars are}} either {{imported}} to or assembled in South Africa, and then {{distributed to the}} customer. An {{important part of the}} supply chain is formed by the auto carrier companies who do this distribution. The basis of this thesis is a study that was executed in collaboration with a South African auto carrier company, and the objective was to improve the <b>long-distance</b> auto carrier <b>fleet</b> management through improved tactical operational policies. These policies focus on application of the fleet by assigning transportation vehicles to routes, as well as the business rules that must be followed at pick-up and drop-off locations. Several rules were developed during this study, which, together with specific transportation vehicle (carriers) assignments, form operational scenarios. The quality of each scenario was evaluated using discrete event simulation over a six month time-span, and considering four decision parameters simultaneously. These parameters are 1) useful kilometres travelled by the long-distance carriers, 2) empty kilometres travelled by the same long-distance carriers, 3) the expected number of cars waiting to be transported and 4) the expected time it takes to deliver a car to its destination. A high level of uncertainty prevails in these transportation operations, while fluctuating demand calls for the dynamic allocation and management of carriers in order to sustain an acceptable service level in a cost-effective manner. The best tactical policies should maximize the number of cars delivered on time at the lowest cost. Major constraints considered are staff- and maintenance schedules. While searching for the best of several scenarios, multiple, conflicting criteria had to be evaluated, as mentioned above. Two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods were used namely SAW and TOPSIS, while the Mahalanobis distance method was also applied as an evaluation technique. These methods were used to rank scenarios. Additionally, the application of Portfolio theory and the efficient frontier was investigated for applicability to the problem studied. An analogy to the efficient frontier providing an additional means for scenario selection and evaluation was developed. The result of this study provides the decision maker of the auto carrier company with a tactical decision aid, consisting of the MCDA and Mahalanobis scenario rankings, a cost-benefit graph and a fleet portfolio efficient frontier, to aid long-distance carrier management. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was also done for strategic planning concerned with the sufficient <b>long-distance</b> carrier <b>fleet</b> size. The first part of this thesis comprises a study of literature in which freight operations, auto carrier studies and the auto carrier context in South Africa are investigated. The problem is formulated and a suitable formulation and solution tool identified. Multi-criteria decision analysis is also investigated in order to enable scenario evaluation. The solution development phase consisted of the simulation model concept development, acquisition of input data, model verification and validation, scenario construction, simulation execution, and analysis of results...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} NZR had {{a need for}} new guards vans for new vans for both freight and {{moderately}} fast passenger and express freight services, to replace old and increasingly decrepit vans, most of the existing vans were built before 1946, including passenger express vans, post war construction being only two batches of 35/30 in 1955 and 1963-67.Cabinet works approval for made for the Van order on 15/5/73 and NZR GM T M Small made a second request for Cabinet Works Committee approval on 15/8/74, but no work was made on design until 1975 {{due to the fact}} the NZR design staff were preoccupied with design of the Wagons and the reconstruction of the Northerner express. The first order for 56 FM vans was approved in the last Cabinet meeting of the Rowling, Labour Government on 18/11/1975 for 4.32 million, officially on Treasury report 1624, 3.4 million being applied to the overseas constructed basic van imported from Japan They were built by Mitsubishi, and were the first all-steel vans. The body was composed of three modules that could be detached from the underframe: a central module, classed GM (guard's module), which contained the guard's office,five first class seats [...] and facilities; and two outer modules, classed LM (luggage module), for freight and luggage. The idea was that should a module become damaged in service it can be removed for repairs and replaced with another, allowing the van to return to service sooner than otherwise would have been the case. It was because of these modules that the vans were given the FM classification, as opposed to the traditional F designation given to all previous NZR guards vans. The FM also pioneered the X28020 bogie, now used under New Zealand's <b>long-distance</b> passenger <b>fleet.</b> The first batch was very well received by guards. Fifty-six were built, and in 1976 an order was placed for an additional 17. The vans were not however entirely appreciated as the passenger train crews on the large crewed prestige trains preferred the old 56 ft passenger vans and the luggage and van space on the Fm vans was not adequate for carriage and fast transfer of mail at parcels from express freight trains at intermediate stations requiring extra ZA vans having to be used for highly profitable mail and parcels on many North Island express freigths and the Northerner.|$|R
