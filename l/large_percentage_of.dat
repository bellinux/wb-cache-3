5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Staunton's often-criticized {{description}} of Anderssen as Germany's second best player, after Anderssen {{had won the}} 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable {{on the basis of}} what is now known about von der Lasa's skill. Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> his 1860 book Chess Praxis was devoted to Morphy's games, which he praised highly; and in The Chess-Player's Companion (1849) Staunton sometimes criticised his own play, and presented a few of his losses.|$|E

5|$|A <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{the people}} killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather {{days to weeks}} after the event; rather than {{improving}} after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs {{at the moment of}} trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 {{percent of those}} killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as {{support for the war}} in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield.|$|E
5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This {{is one of the}} areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group.

5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that a <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> these drivers are aging, {{and are expected to}} retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also facing an image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E

The most notable of these corporations are dataDyne, headed by Zhang Li, and the Carrington Institute, headed by Daniel Carrington. The player is cast as Joanna Dark, a bounty hunter working with her father Jack Dark and computer hacker Chandra Sekhar. The team is after Nathan Zeigler, an independent researcher who has been captured by a Hong Kong triad gang led {{by a man named}} Killian. Joanna and her father successfully rescue Zeigler, but Killian manages to escape. Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research, which contains information about a dangerous weapon. As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research, Joanna is sent to retrieve it while her father stays with Zeigler. After Joanna retrieved a case with Zeigler's research from a nearby safe house, Zeigler takes a device called a neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research data into Jack's mind. Afterwards, Zeigler succumbs to his injuries sustained by Killian and dies. Before dying, Zeigler says that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll.|$|E
