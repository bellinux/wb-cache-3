50|$|Townsend's ground {{squirrels}} consume mainly green {{vegetation and}} some seeds and insects. Green grasses are apparently a staple from late winter until {{just prior to}} grass senescence and Townsend ground squirrel estivation, when seeds become the primary diet item. Seeds are {{an important source of}} calories just prior to estivation. Wherepresent, winterfat is browsed heavily, but only light browsing of other shrubs has been reported. From March through May on the Arid <b>Land</b> <b>Ecology</b> Reserve in eastern Washington, the Townsend's ground squirrel diet is 49% Sandberg bluegrass, 11% western yarrow (Achillea millefolium var. occidentalis), 8% pinnate tansymustard(Descurania pinnata) seed, 31% other plant species (mostly forbs), and 1% insects. On a big sagebrush-crestedwheatgrass community in southeastern Idaho, 80% of Townsend's ground squirrels trapped in June had consumed crested wheatgrass, and Townsend's ground squirrels became dormant after the crested wheatgrass senesced. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an important food item in some years. As an annual with wide year-to-year swings in productivity, however, it is not a reliable food source.|$|E

30|$|The {{scientific}} understanding of biocrusts and {{their roles in}} arid <b>land</b> <b>ecology</b> is strong and improving. Soil crusts are known to inhibit seed germination, including of annual grasses in the intermountain west (Serpe et al. 2006; Deines et al. 2007). These grasses take advantage of openings in the soil-surface niche (Chambers et al. 2007). The strength of the bare soil variable in the annual grass model here further supports this concept of the soil surface niche. Since biocrusts occupy the same niche, we might expect that annual grass invasion could be inhibited when biocrusts occupy {{a large portion of}} the soil surface.|$|E

Such relationships have two types: land symbiosis and land antagonism.

Alien species, especially cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and cereal rye (Secale cereale), were the major competitors to the natives.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office {{is working}} to remove a number of {{facilities}} on the Fitzner Eberhardt Arid <b>Lands</b> <b>Ecology</b> Reserve (ALE), {{which is part of}} the Hanford Reach National Monument. Decommissioning and removal of buildings and debris on ALE will leave bare soils and excavated areas that need to be revegetated to prevent erosion and weed invasion. Four main areas within ALE are affected by these activities (DOE 2009;DOE/EA- 1660 F) : 1) facilities along the ridgeline of Rattlesnake Mountain, 2) the former Nike missile base and ALE HQ laboratory buildings, 3) the aquatic research laboratory at Rattlesnake Springs area, and 4) a number of small sites across ALE where various types of debris remain from previous uses. This revegetation plan addresses the revegetation and restoration of those land areas disturbed by decommissioning and removal of buildings, facilities and associated infrastructure or debris removal. The primary objective of the revegetation efforts on ALE is to establish native vegetation at each of the sites that will enhance and accelerate the recovery of the native plant community that naturally persists at that location. Revegetation is intended to meet the direction specified by the Environmental Assessment (DOE 2009; DOE/EA- 1660 F) and by Stipulation C. 7 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the Rattlesnake Mountain Combined Community Communication Facility and InfrastructureCleanup on the Fitzner/Eberhardt Arid <b>Lands</b> <b>Ecology</b> Reserve, Hanford Site, Richland Washington(DOE 2009; Appendix B).

The strategy and implementation approach for each revegetation unit identifies an appropriate native species mix and outlines the necessary site preparation activities and specific methods for seeding and planting at each area. evegetation work is scheduled to commence during the first quarter of FY 2011 to minimize the amount of time that sites are unvegetated and more susceptible to invasion by non-native weedy annual species...|$|R

These resources are spread across all the agro-ecological zones of the country.

Weeds are the most prominent of all the stresses across all the ecologies in term of yield reduction, labour demand and control cost.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{possibility}} that a nearby supernova explosion could have caused {{one or more of the}} mass extinctions identified by palaeontologists. We discuss the likely rate of such events in the light of the recent identification of Geminga as a supernova remnant less than 100 pc away and the discovery of a millisecond pulsar about 150 pc away, and observations of SN 1987 A. The fluxes of γ radiation and charged cosmic rays on the Earth are estimated, and their effects on the Earth’s ozone layer discussed.
