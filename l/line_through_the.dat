5|$|NSB {{operates}} a commuter rail service from Bergen with two hourly departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which {{up to six}} continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is the Class 69 multiple units. The first part to Arna represents {{an important part of}} the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountain Ulriken is considerably faster than driving around.|$|E

5000|$|Like all nonsingular cubic surfaces, the Clebsch cubic can be {{obtained}} by blowing up the projective plane in 6 points. [...] described these points as follows. If the projective plane is identified with <b>the</b> set of <b>lines</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> origin in a 3-dimensional vector space containing an icosahedron centered at the origin, then the 6 points correspond to <b>the</b> 6 <b>lines</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> icosahedron's 12 vertices.

5|$|The Severn Beach Line {{declined}} {{over the}} latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. All station staff were withdrawn in 1967, with the <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station reduced to single track in 1970, with the second platform taken out of use. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day.|$|E
5|$|The canyon {{was finally}} {{bypassed}} completely with {{the completion of}} the Surf Line on August 12, 1888, and the <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> canyon was relegated to branch line status. By 1900 it had been abandoned by AT Finally, the 1928 construction of Railroad Canyon Dam submerged the section of track between Elsinore and Perris beneath Railroad Canyon Lake (now known as Canyon Lake).|$|E

5|$|All eight {{lines of}} the Oslo Commuter Rail have {{some or all of}} their {{services}} operate through the tunnel, although many of these terminate at Skøyen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold Line and intercity trains along the Sørland Line and Bergen <b>Line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. Freight trains along the Sørland Line operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss Line.|$|E
5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cemetery. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased's family.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|From the 8th century AD onward, astronomers {{developed}} {{methods for}} approximating and calculating the direction to Mecca (qibla)—and its distance—from any {{location on the}} Earth. From the 9th century onward they were using spherical trigonometry and map projection methods to determine these quantities accurately. The calculation is essentially {{the conversion of the}} equatorial polar coordinates of Mecca (i.e. its longitude and latitude) to its polar coordinates (i.e. its qibla and distance) relative to a system whose reference meridian is the great circle through the given location and the Earth's poles, and whose polar axis is the <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> location and its antipodal point.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) spurred the planning of a modern light rail system for Seattle. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground light rail <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> University District with a station near The Ave. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, with the University District as its northern terminus; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, complex {{projective}} space is the {{projective space}} {{with respect to}} the field of complex numbers. By analogy, whereas the points of a real projective space label <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> origin of a real Euclidean space, the points of a complex projective space label <b>the</b> complex <b>lines</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> origin of a complex Euclidean space (see below for an intuitive account). Formally, a complex projective space is the space of complex <b>lines</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> origin of an (n+1)-dimensional complex vector space. The space is denoted variously as P(Cn+1), Pn(C) or CPn. When n [...] 1, the complex projective space CP1 is the Riemann sphere, and when n [...] 2, CP2 is the complex projective plane (see there for a more elementary discussion).|$|R
5|$|The Oslo Metro {{opened in}} 1966, {{consisting}} of a <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Common Tunnel to Jernbanetorget and the upgraded Lambertseter light rail line. The same year the Grorud Line opened. The next year the Østensjø Line was connected, and in 1970 the Furuset Line opened. The city council decided to close the tramways in 1960, and several lines were closed until the decision was revoked in 1977. In 1987, the Common Tunnel was completed. From 1993, the western lines were upgraded and connected to the Metro, allowing Metro trains to run through the city centre. The Metro's Ring Line was completed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The club {{moved to}} the second Hampden Park, 150yards from the original, because the Cathcart District Railway planned a new <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> site of the ground's western terrace. A lawn bowling club at the {{junction}} of Queen's Drive and Cathcart Road marks {{the site of the}} first Hampden. The second Hampden Park opened in October 1884. It became a regular home to the Scottish Cup Final, but Celtic Park shared some of the big matches including the Scotland v England fixture in 1894.|$|E
5|$|A joint <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Denburn Valley to {{link the}} Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E

5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and forestry products became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E
5|$|In 1872, the Deutsche Eisenbahnbaugesellschaft (German Railway Construction Company - DEG) {{filed the}} {{planning}} {{application for a}} railway <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city, connecting the then-Schlesischer Bahnhof (today Berlin Ostbahnhof) to Charlottenburg, and continuing to Potsdam. In December 1873, the state of Prussia {{as well as the}} private rail enterprises Berlin-Potsdamer Eisenbahn, Magdeburg-Halberstädter Eisenbahn and Berlin-Hamburger Bahn bought shares in the DEG, and jointly founded the Berliner Stadteisenbahngesellschaft (Berlin City Railway Company). However, things did not go as expected and the DEG went into bankruptcy in 1878, which forced the Prussian state government to take over operations, pay for the construction of the line with state money and to reimburse the former private owners of the DEG. The state's interest in the line was attributed to the military, which after the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was of the opinion that the railway networks would hinder mobilisation when not properly interconnected.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} to become the Metropolitan line of the London Passenger Transport Board's London Underground, including Quainton Road. The LPTB aimed {{to move away from}} freight operations, and saw no way in which the rural parts of the MR could be made into viable passenger routes. In 1935 the Brill Tramway was closed. From 1936 Underground trains were withdrawn north of Aylesbury, leaving the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GCR) as the only operator using the station, although Underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1963 stopping passenger services were withdrawn but fast passenger trains continued to pass through. In 1966 the line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using the station. The <b>line</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only.|$|E
