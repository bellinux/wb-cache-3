5|$|During Roman times, {{the land}} {{surrounding}} the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city {{is prone to}} flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive (and until 2015 mostly effective) network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a <b>liftable</b> barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000 York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years with more than 300 homes flooded. In December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land {{in and around the}} city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The ings are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city.|$|E

50|$|Oil {{platforms}} are key {{fixed installations}} from which drilling and production activity is carried out. Drilling rigs are either floating vessels for deeper water or jack-up designs {{which are a}} barge with <b>liftable</b> legs. Both {{of these types of}} vessel are constructed in marine yards but are often involved during the construction phase to pre-drill some production wells. Other key factors in offshore construction are the weather window which defines periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place. Safety is another key construction parameter, the main hazard obviously being a fall into the sea from which speedy recovery in cold waters is essential.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project was}} not {{successful}} overall. Any {{attempt to use}} the full exoskeleton resulted in a violent uncontrolled motion, and as a result, the exoskeleton was never turned on with a person inside. According to General Electric's Hardiman Project Report from 1969, [...] "When turned on power to operate the shoulder joint, the arm lurched and the elbow would not operate." [...] Further research concentrated on one arm. Although it could lift its specified load of 750 pounds (340 kg), it weighed {{three quarters of a}} ton, just over twice the <b>liftable</b> load.

5000|$|The Minica Skipper (A101C) was {{introduced}} in May 1971 as a two-door coupé with <b>liftable</b> rear window, and a choice of Red or Gold 2G10 engines. The Skipper was available either as the S/L, L/L or GT. This also meant that the GSS sedan was gradually becoming obsolete, {{as the focus of}} the sportier Minicas shifted to the coupé versions. Styling wise, the Skipper represented a miniature version of the seminal hardtop Mitsubishi Galant GTO. To allow for a combination of fastback styling with rearward visibility, a secondary small rear window was placed on the back panel, à la the Maserati Khamsin and Honda CR-X. The top rear window opened for access to the luggage area, which featured a folding rear seat. Besides chassis and internals, the Skipper shared the front clip and lower door panels with the sedan.|$|E
5000|$|A Superdump is a {{straight}} dump truck {{equipped with a}} trailing axle, a <b>liftable,</b> load-bearing axle rated as high as 13000 lb. Trailing 11 to 13 ft behind the rear tandem, the trailing axle stretches the outer [...] "bridge" [...] measurement—the distance {{between the first and}} last axles—to the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle configuration, Superdumps can be rated as high as 80000 lb. GVW and carry 26 ST of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to offload, the trailing axle toggles up off the road surface on two hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed the payload, productivity, and return on investment of a conventional dump truck. The Superdump and trailing axle concept was developed by Strong Industries of Houston, Texas.|$|E
50|$|Some {{machines}} {{which actually}} load {{from the top}} are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, {{but there is no}} front door; instead there is a <b>liftable</b> lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life.|$|E

50|$|While {{the general}} idea sounded {{somewhat}} promising, the Hardiman had major limitations. It was impractical, {{due to its}} 680-kilogram (1,500 lb) weight. Another issue was {{that it is a}} master-slave system, where the operator is in a master suit, which, in turn, is inside the slave suit that responds to the master and handles the workload. This multiple physical layer type of operation may work fine, but responds slower than a single physical layer. When the goal is physical enhancement, response time matters. Its slow walking speed of 0.76 metres per second (2.5 ft/s) further limited practical uses. The project was not successful. Any attempt to use the full exoskeleton resulted in a violent uncontrolled motion, and as a result it was never tested with a human inside. Further research concentrated on one arm. Although it could lift its specified load of 340 kg (750 lb), it weighed three quarters of a ton, just over twice the <b>liftable</b> load.
