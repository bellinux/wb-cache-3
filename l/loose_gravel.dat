Also in 2014 the IUCN rated the torrentfish as [...] "Vulnerable". Torrentfish require a specialised habitat with cool, highly oxygenated, fast-flowing water, {{and so are}} threatened by water being taken for irrigation, water pollution, and climate change. River sedimentation is also a threat, as torrentfish need to live amongst <b>loose</b> <b>gravels</b> and are less common in waterways with compacted substrate.|$|R

25|$|The {{composition}} of the riverbed at Rotherhithe was often little more than waterlogged sediment and <b>loose</b> <b>gravel.</b> An ingenious tunnelling shield designed by Marc Brunel helped protect workers from cave-ins, but two incidents of severe flooding halted work for long periods, killing several workers and badly injuring the younger Brunel. The latter incident, in 1828, killed the two most senior miners, and Brunel himself narrowly escaped death. He was seriously injured, and spent six months recuperating. The event stopped work on the tunnel for several years.|$|E
25|$|By 2003, {{two-thirds of}} the city's {{streetcar}} tracks were in poor condition as the older track was poorly built using unwelded rail attached to untreated wooden ties lying on <b>loose</b> <b>gravel.</b> The result was street trackage falling apart quickly requiring digging up everything after 10–15 years. Thus, the TTC started to rebuild tracks using a different technique. With the new technique, concrete is poured over compacted gravel, and the ties are placed in another bed of concrete, which is topped by more concrete to embed rail clips and rubber-encased rails. The resulting rail is more stable and quieter with less vibration. The new tracks are expected to last 25 years after which only the top concrete layer needs to be removed in order to replace worn rails.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{the area around the}} site has received more than 72 inches of rain since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by <b>loose</b> <b>gravel.</b> On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because it was much more rich than the soil higher up the mountain.|$|E
50|$|Torrentfish are {{primarily}} found in shallow, fast-flowing riffles and rapids. They spend little time actively swimming against the rapids, living instead amongst and beneath <b>loose</b> <b>gravels</b> and cobbles. They {{emerge from the}} rapids at night to feed. Torrentfish are solitary and benthic, but {{may be found in}} high densities where there is a large population. Because part of their life cycle is spent in the sea, they are found in higher numbers near the coast.Torrentfish are mainly found in gravelly rivers, particularly braided rivers with wide, open channels. They favour rivers with highly unstable substrates, as the regular movement of the gravels maintains open gaps around and underneath the stones where the torrentfish can take refuge from fast water. Although they are strong swimmers, they are poor climbers and are only found far inland if the gradient is low and there are no barriers.|$|R

500|$|A key {{requirement}} that enables a geyser to erupt is a material called geyserite found in rocks nearby the geyser. [...] Geyserite—mostly silicon dioxide (SiO2), is dissolved from {{the rocks and}} gets deposited {{on the walls of}} the geyser's plumbing system and on the surface. The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure-tight. This allows the pressure to be carried all the way to the top and not be leaked out into the <b>loose</b> <b>gravel</b> or soil that are normally under the geyser fields.|$|E
500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on <b>loose</b> (<b>gravel,</b> dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One. It always takes a lot of luck, and now [...] one can doubt if he would have been granted that. But he would have won Grands Prix– of that I'm absolutely sure." ...|$|E

But Latvala pushed too hard and when he drove over some <b>loose</b> <b>gravel</b> he lost control and slid the car into the end of a stone wall.

The NTSB accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the Lake Piru riverbed near Santa Clarita, California, on a routine training flight. While making his second attempt at an autorotation with powered recovery, Ford allowed the aircraft's altitude to drop to 150–200 feet before beginning power-up. The aircraft was unable to recover power before hitting the ground.

2500|$|The use of {{magnesium}} chloride on roads remains controversial. [...] Advocates claim (1) Cleaner air, {{which leads to}} better health as fugitive dust can cause health problems in the young, elderly and people with respiratory conditions; and (2) Greater safety through improved road conditions, including increased driver visibility and decreased risks caused by <b>loose</b> <b>gravel,</b> soft spots, road roughness and flying rocks. It reduces foreign sediment in nearby surface waters [...] (dust that settles in creeks and streams), helps prevent stunted crop growth caused by clogged pores in plants, and keeps vehicles and property cleaner. Other studies show the use of salts for road deicing or dust suppressing can contribute substantial amounts of chloride ions to runoff from surface of roads treated with the compounds. The salts MgCl2 (and CaCl2) are very soluble in water and will dissociate. The salts, when used on road surfaces, will dissolve during wet weather and be transported into the groundwater through infiltration and/or runoff into surface water bodies. [...] Groundwater infiltration can be [...] a problem and the chloride ion in drinking water is considered a problem when concentrations exceed 250mg/l. [...] It is therefore regulated by the EPA’s drinking water standards. The chloride concentration in the groundwater or surface water depends on several factors including: ...|$|E

40|$|Standing crops of {{salmonids}} in the Connemara {{region are}} described from 80 site fishings made between March 1982 and May {{of the following}} year. Trout were more widely distributed than salmon, being able to exploit isolated water bodies as resident populations. High salmonid densities were associated with salmon which during the dry summer months were caught in large numbers on riffles. The smallest streams in the region supported only trout presumably because there was insufficient depth of water to permit the entry of salmon. Trout biomass and density within the region were distributed within the lower range reported {{from a number of}} countries in which brown trout are endemic and naturalised. Low saimonid densities at 16 % of sites were in some cases associated with the rooting of angiosperms, and possibly oligotrophic conditions resulting from geological structure. Length at age of salmon and trout was similar to measurements recorded in Britain. The streams were important only for {{the first year of the}} trout life cycle. Because trout move downstream as they grow, occupying lakes during the later parr phase, and the entire streambed area in Connemara is one fortieth of the lake area, space is unlikely to be a critical constraint on the later parr phase. The condition of the stream substratum may be a factor in the production of sea trout; where <b>loose</b> <b>gravels</b> do not occur in shallow nursery streams, the catchments tend towards producing "brown" or "resident" rather than sea trout.
