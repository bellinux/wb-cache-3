The morphology of gel filled NR and SBR systems has been studied using X-ray dot mapping, TEM, and AFM. These show that the gels are evenly distributed at low loadings, while they tend to form agglomerates at relatively higher loadings. SBR nanogels have greater tendency for agglomeration.|$|R

Aloe products, which include the <b>latex,</b> <b>gel,</b> and whole leaf, are used, among other reasons, as laxatives, in creams for skin ailments, and as a {{treatment}} {{for a wide range of}} diseases, respectively. The heterogeneous nature of Aloe products may contribute to the diverse biological and therapeutic activities that have been observed.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesives were prepared with constant glass transition temperature, using emulsion polymerization. The monomers chosen were butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate, {{along with a}} small amount of acrylic acid. The proportion of acrylic acid monomer was held constant for each polymer preparation but acrylic ester monomer levels were varied. The glass transition temperatures of the acrylate copolymers were measured by using differential scanning calorimetry. Drying and weighing the tetrahydrofuran-insoluble polymer fractions were used to determine the polymer gel fractions. Films of constant coating thickness were applied to poly(ethylene terephthalate) film and adhesive properties (tack and shear) were examined. Peel was examined through the construction of master curves derived from peel tests conducted over a range of temperatures and peel rates. As the 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate content increased, the <b>latex</b> <b>gel</b> fractions were found to increase. With increasing EHA and gel fraction, peel shear was found to increase. When peel force master curves were compared, divergence in peel master curves occurred as peel rates increased where polymers with higher butyl acrylate contents reached greater peel stress values...|$|R
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the gel particles, {{as well as}} the gel filled matrices {{was analyzed}} with the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM studies were carried out in air at ambient conditions (25 °C, 60 % RH) using multimode AFM, from Veeco Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA. Topographic height and phase images were recorded in the tapping mode AFM with the set point ratio of 0.9, using silicon tip having spring constant of 40 N/m. The cantilever was oscillated at it resonance frequency of ~ 280 kHz. Scanning was done at least 3 different positions of each sample and the representative images were taken. The <b>latex</b> <b>gel</b> samples were diluted several times before testing with doubly distilled water. A drop of this diluted sample was placed on a freshly cleaved mica surface which was allowed to dry before taking the image. In the case of gel filled matrices, very thin cast film samples were used for morphology. Due to the difference in their elastic modulus, one of the phases appears darker (NR) and the other one brighter (SBR) in all the AFM micrographs.|$|R
30|$|Although not {{strictly}} categorized as filler, use of gels to improve various physical properties of elastomers, with an added advantage of superior processability, {{can be found}} in the prevailing literature [13 – 15]. Kawahara et al. [16] have reported the effect of gel on green strength of natural rubber. In most of the above work, the authors have used physically crosslinked or entangled network gels. However, our recent preliminary work with chemically crosslinked nanogels and quasi-nanogels has revealed that addition of these gels leads to a considerable improvement in processability, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical properties of virgin natural rubber (NR) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) [17 – 19]. Optimization of these as-prepared crosslinked gels has been carried out by measuring various physical properties including crosslink density and the optimum level of gel loading has been determined from the rheological properties of the gel filled systems [17, 19]. However, the extent of property enhancement upon the addition of chemically crosslinked gels varies with the nature of matrix and gels. In the present work, our aim was to improve the deficiency in virgin NR property by using SBR nanogels and vice versa. For example, we have attempted to improve the thermal stability of NR using SBR gels which have inherently better thermal stability, without sacrificing any other properties. Similarly, green strength of SBR can be improved greatly by using the relatively high strength NR gels. For this purpose, NR and SBR latex nanogels having gradient of crosslink density and different particle sizes were prepared by sulfur prevulcanization technique and thoroughly characterized. These <b>latex</b> <b>gels</b> were then intermixed with neat NR and SBR lattices at different loadings. Finally, influence of these chemically crosslinked gels on mechanical, dynamic mechanical, and thermal behavior of virgin elastomers was studied in detail along with an extensive morphological study, for the first time.|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Aloe vera {{has been}} used as a {{medicinal}} herb for thousands of years. Aloe vera leaves can be separated into <b>latex</b> and <b>gel</b> which have biological effects. Aloe gel is a potent source of polysaccharides. When the gel is exposed to air, it quickly decomposes and decays and loses most of its biological activity. There are various processing techniques for sterilizing and stabilizing the gel. The aim of this study was to improve stabilization of the gel by adding some chemical and natural preservatives. Methods: The gel was obtained from Aloe vera leaves and after some processing chemical and natural preservatives were added. Chemicals included citric acid, ascorbic acid, vitamin E and potassium sorbate while natural preservatives were two essential oils derived from Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Eugenia caryophyllata. All these operations were performed under sterile conditions and they were evaluated at different temperatures and times. Appearance and taste changes of gel were studied organoleptic. Microbiological tests and some physical assays such as pH, refractometry and viscosity properties as well as determination of total sugars were measured. NMR and FT-IR analyses were performed for determining the quality of samples. Results: After data analyzing, the results showed that the samples formulated with chemical additives together with essential oils were more suitable and stable compared to the control samples after 90 days and the effective ingredient acemannan, remained stable. Conclusion: The stable gel can be considered for therapeutic properties and be used for edible and medicinal purposes...|$|R

This paper describes a head and neck vascular labeling procedure, and describes some of the technical complications that may occur. Fifteen specimen cadaver heads were prepared. After drying the vascular system, the internal carotid arteries were ligated and a solution with <b>latex</b> and a <b>gelling</b> agent was injected into the internal carotid arteries and external jugular veins. Two different colors were employed to differentiate arteries from veins. A total of 60 ml latex was injected into each blood vessel. Subsequently, the specimens were refrigerated at 5 °C for a minimum of 24 hours. Finally, a dissection was performed to identify the venous and arterial systems of the maxillofacial region. In most specimens, correct identification of the vascular structures (lingual artery, pterigoyd plexus, and the major palatal arteries, among others) was possible. However, in three heads a major technical problem occurred (the latex remained liquid), making the dissection unfeasible. Other minor complications such as latex obstruction due to the presence of atheromas were found in two further specimens. The vascular labeling technique is a predictable, effective and simple method for analyzing the vascular system of the maxillofacial area in cadaveric studies, including vessels of reduced diameter or with an intraosseous course.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is {{a leading}} cause of bacterial food-borne illness in countries where consumption of meat and poultry is high. For example, each year in the United States, this organism is the second or third most common cause of confirmed cases of food-borne illness. Surveys of the incidence of this organism in retail foods were done in the 1960 s without regard to whether isolates were enterotoxigenic. It is now known that not all strains of this organism possess the enterotoxin gene responsible for illness. We examined the incidence of this organism in 131 food samples from retail food stores in an area of the northeastern United States. Forty isolates were obtained by using the iron milk method at 45 °C, with confirmation by use of motility nitrate and lactose gelatin media. The presence of the C. perfringens enterotoxin (cpe) and alpha toxin (cpa) genes was determined by PCR using previously published primer sequences. All isolates possessed cpa. None of the isolates were identified as carrying the cpe gene by this method or by another method using a digoxigenin-labeled gene probe. Consistent with these results, none of the sporulating-cell extracts contained enterotoxin as determined by reverse passive <b>latex</b> hemagglutination. Pulsed-field <b>gel</b> electrophoresis was used to determine the genetic relatedness of the isolates. About 5 % of the isolates were considered to be closely related (2 - to 3 -band difference). The others were considered to be unrelated to one another. The results demonstrate the rarity of cpe+ strains in retail foods and the genetic diversity among nonoutbreak strains...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{performance}} of latex-based pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). PSA performance is usually evaluated by tack, peel strength and shear strength. Tack and peel strength characterize a PSA’s bonding strength to a substrate while shear strength reflects a PSA’s capability to resist shear deformation. In general, increasing shear strength leads to a decrease in tack and peel strength. While there are several commercial PSA synthesis methods, {{the two most important}} methods consist of either solvent-based or latex-based techniques. While latex-based PSAs are more environmentally compliant than solvent-based PSAs, they tend to have much lower shear strength, at similar tack and peel strength levels. Therefore, the goal in this thesis was to greatly improve the shear strength of latex-based PSAs at little to no sacrifice to tack and peel strength. In this study, controlling the polymer microstructure of latexes or their corresponding PSA films was used as the main method for improving the PSA performance. The research was sub-divided into four parts. First, the influence of chain transfer agent (CTA) and cross-linker on latex polymer microstructure was studied via seeded semi-batch emulsion polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA). Three techniques were used to produce the latexes: (1) adding CTA only, (2) adding cross-linker only, and (3) adding both CTA and cross-linker. It was found that using CTA and cross-linker simultaneously allows one to expand the range of latex microstructural possibilities. For example, <b>latexes</b> with similar <b>gel</b> contents but different Mc (molecular weight between cross-links) and Mw (molecular weight of sol polymers) could be produced if CTA and cross-linker concentration are both increased. However, for the corresponding PSAs with similar gel contents, the relationship between their polymer microstructure and performance was difficult to establish as almost all of the medium and high gel content PSAs showed very low tack and peel strength as well as extremely large shear strength readings. In the second part of this thesis, in order {{to improve the}} tack and peel strength of medium and high gel content PSAs, the monomer composition and emulsifier concentration were varied. It was found that changing the monomer mixture from BA/MMA to BA/acrylic acid (AA) / 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) while simultaneously decreasing emulsifier concentration dramatically improved the corresponding PSAs’ shear strength as well as tack and peel strength. The addition of polar groups to the PSA increased its cohesive strength due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonding; meanwhile, PSA films’ surface tension increased. In the third part, two series of BA/AA/HEMA latexes were generated by varying the amounts of CTA either in the absence or presence of cross-linker. The latexes produced in the absence of cross-linker exhibited significantly larger Mc and Mw compared to their counterparts with similar gel contents prepared with cross-linker. The PSAs with the larger Mc and Mw showed much larger shear strengths due to improved entanglements between the polymer chains. In the final part of the thesis, the performance of the BA/AA/HEMA PSAs was further improved by post-heating. Compared with original latex-based PSAs with similar gel contents, heat-treated PSAs showed not only significantly improved shear strengths, but also much larger tack and peel strengths. The different shear strengths were related to the PSAs’ gel structures, which were discrete in the original PSAs but continuous in the heat-treated PSAs. The improved tack and peel strengths were related to the PSA films’ surface smoothness. During the post-heating process, the PSA polymer flowed, resulting in much smoother surfaces than the original PSA films. In addition, the effect of post-heating was related to the polymer microstructure of the untreated PSAs. Decreasing the amount of very small or very big polymers or simultaneously increasing Mc and Mw could lead to post-treated PSAs with significantly better performance. Moreover, it was found that by optimizing the polymer microstructure of the original latex-based PSAs, it was possible to obtain a treated PSA with similar or even better performance than a solvent-based PSA with similar polymer microstructure. Our original objective was surpassed: in two cases, not only was shear strength greatly improved, but so were tack and peel strength due to the simultaneous modification of PSA bulk and surface properties...|$|R
