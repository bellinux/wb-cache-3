5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average IQ scores, but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> chess skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Influenza is a {{significant}} worldwide public health issue. Knowledge and perceptions regarding the flu vaccination are associated with whether individuals obtain the vaccination. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how such perceptions were related to knowledge and self-efficacy regarding influenza and the flu vaccination in Vietnam and the US. Methods College students (n= 932) in Vietnam (n= 495) and the US (n= 437) completed a self-administered survey regarding knowledge and perceptions of influenza vaccinations in September and October 2016. Results Vietnamese participants reported significantly <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> awareness about flu risk, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative attitudes toward flu vaccination, <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about the flu and vaccination, and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-efficacy than US participants. Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> flu and flu vaccination knowledge and self-efficacy regarding general responsible health practices were associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative perceptions of flu risk and attitudes toward vaccination. At the same time, self-efficacy regarding responsible health practices was associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> awareness of flu risk and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative attitudes toward vaccination. Self-efficacy regarding exercise was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceptions of flu risk and higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> negative attitudes toward vaccination. Conclusions Vietnam could benefit from influenza education based on this comparison with the US. In both countries, knowledge and self-efficacy were found to be important factors influencing perceptions of influenza risk and vaccination...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations.

It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered to require a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> skill.

40|$|The {{development}} of self-regulation {{is one of}} the major challenges of a child’s healthy development. In the current thesis, the contribution and interplay of parental and biological factors in the {{development of}} self-regulation in preschoolers are studied in a large population-based cohort, the Generation R Study. We found that attachment insecurity in infancy was related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> toddler active resistance during Clean-Up. Maternal negative discipline was related to <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> committed compliance in toddlers, and the association between maternal positive discipline and child committed compliance was moderated by the child’s COMT rs 4680 genotype, indicating that the association was stronger in children with the Met/Met variant than for children with other COMT genotypes. Maternal family-related stress during pregnancy predicted <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> toddler committed compliance through <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> maternal positive discipline. Maternal sensitivity was associated with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> executive function problems and <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> internalizing problems in preschool age. In children with a relatively short corpus callosum in infancy, higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> maternal positive discipline predicted <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> inhibition problems. Our studies demonstrate the role of various aspects of positive parenting and mother-child relationship quality in preschool children’s regulation of emotions and behavior. Promotores: M.

5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; {{the growth of the}} volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

More specifically, do countries with <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> compliance with laws in general also experience <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> tax compliance or, in other words greater rates of tax evasion?
