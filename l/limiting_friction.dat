40|$|A {{successful}} {{golf swing}} {{is dependent on}} the performance of a complex sequential action. This movement involves the feet, knees, rotation of the hips and trunk, which result in a transmission of forces and torques between the feet/shoes and the ground (Williams and Sih, 1998). The aim of this thesis was to investigate golf shoe interface aspects relevant to the golf swing process. One flat-soled, one traditional and three alternative spiked golf shoe sole interfaces were evaluated. Using a mechanical traction-testing device, specific linear forces and rotational torques were applied to the forefoot and whole-foot of the five different golf shoe sole interface designs on a grass covered force platform. Greater linear and rotational ground action forces were identified within the traditional sole (whole-foot <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> 1. 01) and alternative sole conditions (whole-foot <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> Blue 1. 00, Red 1. 02, Yellow 1. 01) when compared to a flat-soled shoe (whole-foot <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> 0. 88). The traditional shoe was also identified to frequently produce greater friction (forefoot <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> 0. 97) in comparison to the alternative shoe soles (forefoot <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> Blue 0. 92, Red 0. 91, Yellow 0. 91). Due to the mechanical nature of the study it was important to gain an understanding of how the golf shoe sole interface interacted with the ground and if between-shoe differences were repeated when subjected to dynamic human movement during the golf swing. Dynamic analysis of the five soles identified two between shoe-sole differences (P = <. OS); Driver back foot Tz range (BW. m) (Traditional shoe (IS. 98 ± 1. 11) was significantly different to the Blue alternative (12. 77 ±. 83) and flat-soled shoe (12. 73 ±. 8 S)); and 7 iron front foot, Mz maximum time (s) (Flat-soled shoe (1. 39 ±. 02) was significantly different to Blue (1. 72 ±. 03) Red (1. 71 ±. 03) and Yellow (1. 72 ±. 04) alternative spiked shoes). The low handicap group (0 - 7) produced significantly slower weight transfer times (s) when compared to the medium (8 - 14) and high (15 +) groups within all club conditions (3 iron Low 0. 73 ±. 03, Medium 0. 43 ±. 02 and High 0. 41 ±. 02; 7 iron Low 0. 76 ±. 01 Medium 0. S 4 ±. 01 and High 0. 54 ±. 01; Driver Low 0. 70 ±. 01, Medium 0. 48 ±. 01 and High 0. 43 ±. 01). However, no significant differences in forces or torques were identified between handicap groups. The findings contradict the previous mechanical testing results concluding mechanical traction tests are not an appropriate test of between shoe differences when relating the findings to the golf swing. The differences in forces created between the shoe and ground identified between the mechanical and dynamic studies was a result of the adaptation by the golfer to the footwear condition. Dynamic in-shoe pressure analysis identified regional pressures created between the golfer and shoe throughout the swing process. The highest peak pressures (N/cm 2) were associated with the lateral regions of the front-foot from the point of ball impact (Front foot Traditional (R 5) 114. 33 ± 6. 29 N/cm 2 Back foot Traditional (R 5) 7. 18 ± 1. 07 N/cm 2 supporting previous kinematic and ground action force findings. The traditional spiked shoe produced greater in-shoe pressures within the front foot lateral mid-foot region however all sole conditions provided significantly higher pressures within specific in-shoe regions at different stages of the swing process. The comparable between shoe findings support the previous dynamic findings. The thesis enhanced current understanding of between shoe-ground and shoe-golfer interactions. Different demands were placed on the front and back shoes during the golf swing highlighting the need for asymmetrical shoe sole designs. Limited differences were identified between the different shoe sole interface designs, concluding that golf shoe interface designs are not effective for the demands of the golf swing, subsequently shoe outsole modifications were suggested...|$|E

A third trial of welding was performed at a rotational speed of 1500 r/min and feed rate 120 mm/min. It is found that with increase in the tool rotation speed, from 1300 to 1400 r/min, for a constant feed rate, the forming <b>limit</b> of <b>friction</b> stir welded blank has improved and with increase in feed rate, from 90 to 100 mm/min, for a constant tool rotation speed, it has decreased.

40|$|Pin {{geometry}} is {{a fundamental}} consideration in friction stir welding (FSW). It influences the thermal behaviour, material flow and forces during the weld and reflects on the joint quality. This work studies four pin tools with circular, triflute, trivex, and triangular profiles adopting a validated model of FSW process developed by the authors. The effect of the rotating tool geometry on the flow behaviour and process outcomes is analysed. Additionally, longitudinal and transversal forces and torque are numerically calculated and compared for the different pin shapes. The study is carried out for slip and stick <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> cases between pin and workpiece. The main novelties of the paper are a “speed-up” two-stage simulation methodology and a piecewise linear version of the constitutive model, both of them conceived for the use in real case industrial applications, where the achievement of accuracy with affordable simulation times is of importance. The Norton-Hoff constitutive model is adopted to characterize the material behaviour during the weld. The piecewise linear version of the model developed by the authors greatly facilitates the convergence of the numerical solution ensuring both computational efficiency and accuracy. A two-stage computational procedure is applied. In the first stage, a forced transient is carried out; in the second one, the magnitudes of interest are computed. The study shows that the proposed modelling approach {{can be used to}} predict and interpret the FSW behaviour for a specific pin geometry.

40|$|The EHD {{friction}} {{properties of}} a wide range of base fluids have been measured and compared in mixed sliding???rolling conditions at three temperatures and two pressures. The use of tungsten carbide ball and disc specimens enabled high mean contact pressures of 1. 5 and 2. 0 ??GPa to be obtained, comparable to those present in many rolling bearings. The measurements confirm the importance of molecular structure of the base fluid in determining EHD friction. Liquids having linear-shaped molecules with flexible bonds give considerably lower friction than liquids based on molecules with bulky side groups or rings. EHD friction also increases with viscosity for liquids having similar molecular structures. Using pure ester fluids, it is shown that quite small differences in molecular structure can have considerable effects on EHD friction. The importance of temperature rise in reducing EHD friction at slide???roll ratios above about 5 % has been shown. By measuring EHD friction at several temperatures and pressures as well as EHD film thickness, approximate corrections to measured EHD friction data have been made to obtain isothermal shear stress and thus EHD friction curves. These show that under the conditions tested most low molecular weight base fluids do not reach a <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient and thus shear stress.

40|$|Many powders and {{particulate}} solids {{are stored}} and handled {{in large quantities}} across various industries. These solids often encounter handling and storage difficulties that are caused by the material cohesion. The cohesive strength of a bulk material {{is a function of}} its past consolidation stress. For example, high material cohesive strength as a result from high storage stresses in a silo can cause ratholing problems during discharge. Therefore, it is essential to consider the stress-history dependence when evaluating such handling behaviour. In recent years the Discrete Element Method (DEM) has been used extensively to study the complex behaviour of granular materials. Whilst extensive DEM studies have been performed on cohesionless solids, much less work exists on modelling of cohesive solids. The commonly used DEM models to model adhesion such as the JKR, DMT and linear cohesion models have been shown to have difficulty in predicting the stress-history dependent behaviour for cohesive solids. DEM modelling of cohesive solid at individual particle level is very challenging. To apply the model at single particle level accurately would require one to determine the model parameters at particle level and consider the enormous complexity of interfacial interaction. Additionally it is computationally prohibitive to model each and every individual particle and cohesion arising from several different phenomena. In this study an adhesive elasto-plastic contact model for the mesoscopic discrete element method (DEM) with three dimensional non-spherical particles is proposed with the aim of achieving quantitative predictions of cohesive powder flowability. Simulations have been performed for uniaxial consolidation followed by unconfined compression to failure using this model. Additionally, the scaling laws necessary to produce scale independent predictions for cohesionless and cohesive solids was also investigated. The influence of DEM input parameters and model implementation have been explored to study the effect of particle (meso-scale) properties on the bulk behaviour in uniaxial test simulation. The DEM model calibration was achieved using the Edinburgh Powder Tester (EPT) – an extended uniaxial tester to measure flowability of bulk solids. The EPT produced highly repeatable flowability measurements and was shown to be a good candidate for DEM model calibration. The implemented contact model {{has been shown to be}} capable of predicting the experimental flow function (unconfined compressive strength versus the prior consolidation stress) for a limestone powder which has been selected as a reference solid in the Europe wide PARDEM research network. Contact plasticity in the model is shown to affect the flowability significantly and is thus essential for producing satisfactory computations of the behaviour of a cohesive granular material. The model predicted a linear relationship between a normalized unconfined compressive strength and the product of coordination number and solid fraction. Significantly, it has been found that contribution of adhesive force to the <b>limiting</b> <b>friction</b> has a significant effect on bulk unconfined strength. Failure to include the adhesive contribution in the calculation of the frictional resistance may lead to under-prediction of unconfined strength and incorrect failure mode. The results provide new insights and propose a micromechanical based measure for characterising the strength and flowability of cohesive granular materials. Scaling of DEM input parameters in a 3 D simulation of the loading regimes in a uniaxial test indicated that whilst both normal and tangential contact stiffness (loading, unloading, and load dependent) scales linearly with radius of the particle, the adhesive forces scales with the square of the radius of the particles. This is a first step towards a mesoscopic representation of a cohesive powder that is phenomenological based to produce the key bulk characteristics of a granular solid and the results indicate that it has potential to gain considerable computational advantage for large scale DEM simulations. The contact model parameters explored include particle contact normal loading stiffness, tangential stiffness, and contact friction coefficient. The DEM model implementation parameters included numerical time step, strain rate, and boundary condition. Many useful observations have been made with significant implications for the relative importance of the DEM input parameters. Finally the calibration procedure was applied to a spray dried detergent powder and the simulation results are compared to whole spectrum of loading regime in a uniaxial experiment. The experimental and simulation results were found to be in reasonable agreement for the flow function and compression behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{have become}} a reality, many vehicles have implemented some features to allow partial or full autonomy; however, full autonomous driving near the <b>limit</b> of <b>friction</b> still presents many obstacles, especially near the <b>limit</b> of <b>friction.</b> Autonomous test vehicles are expensive to build and maintain, running the vehicles usually requires highly specialized training, and testing can be dangerous. Research has shown that small sized scaled vehicles {{may be used as}} an alternative to full size vehicle testing. The first part of this thesis presents the construction of a 1 = 5 th scaled vehicle testbed. This testbed is inexpensive to construct, easy to maintain, and safe to test compared to full size vehicles. In the linear region, the dynamic response of the tires also closely mimics full size tires and the Dugoff tire model. The small sized testbed is therefore an ideal alternative to full size vehicles. The interaction between the road and the tires remains a challenge to estimate, but a requirement for eff ective control. Tire dynamics are highly non-linear, and are dependent on many variables. Tire slip angles are di fficult to estimate without expensive sensors set-up. Many linear and non-linear estimation methods have been developed to tackle this problem, but each having its limitations. The second part of the thesis presents a method for slip angle estimation, and proposes an observer design which integrates a linear component with the Dugoff tire model and a pneumatic trail estimator. This design is fast to operate, and does not require expensive sensors. With the addition of the pneumatic trail block, accurate slip angles can be obtained in the tires linear and saturation regions equally. Controlling near the <b>limit</b> of <b>friction</b> requires consistently accurate tire states, which is di fficult to achieve with slip angles. With the margin of error under a degrees, a slight error in slip angle estimates while operating at the <b>limit</b> of <b>friction</b> may result in loss of control.
