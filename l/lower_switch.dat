50|$|The {{advantages}} of the synchronous buck converter do not come without cost. First, the <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> typically costs more than the freewheeling diode. Second, {{the complexity of the}} converter is vastly increased due to the need for a complementary-output switch driver.|$|E
5000|$|When a MOSFET is {{used for}} the <b>lower</b> <b>switch,</b> {{additional}} losses may occur during the time between the turn-off of the high-side switch and the turn-on of the low-side switch, when the body diode of the low-side MOSFET conducts the output current. This time, known as the non-overlap time, prevents [...] "shootthrough", a condition in which both switches are simultaneously turned on. The onset of shootthrough generates severe power loss and heat. Proper selection of non-overlap time must balance the risk of shootthrough with the increased power loss caused by conduction of the body diode. Many MOSFET based buck converters also include a diode to aid the lower MOSFET body diode with conduction during the non-overlap time. When a diode is used exclusively for the <b>lower</b> <b>switch,</b> diode forward turn-on time can reduce efficiency and lead to voltage overshoot.|$|E

5000|$|One major {{challenge}} {{inherent in the}} multiphase converter is ensuring the load current is balanced evenly across the n phases. This current balancing can be performed {{in a number of}} ways. Current can be measured [...] "losslessly" [...] by sensing the voltage across the inductor or the <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> (when it is turned on). This technique is considered lossless because it relies on resistive losses inherent in the buck converter topology. Another technique is to insert a small resistor in the circuit and measure the voltage across it. This approach is more accurate and adjustable, but incurs several costs—space, efficiency and money.|$|E

The lamps were still composed of three vertical segments, reminiscent of the original. Minimal changes occurred from year-to-year, most noticeable was a redesigned center panel in the dashboard for 2001, which now allowed double-din stereo head units, including an in-dash six-CD player. The rear window defroster switch, previously mounted below the headlamp pull switch, was moved to the lower center stack below the stereo. When equipped, the fog lamp switch was relocated to the lower center stack as well, previously, it was on the center console adjacent to the cup holders. The third button on the <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> panel was for the traction control system (on V8 models). On convertible models, the power roof switch remained on the center console - on coupe models, that switch was replaced with a small coin holder.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the water}} level is below both switches, the float switch {{physical}} contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal [...] "Fill Valve" [...] contact latches the circuit so that even when the [...] "Low Level" [...] contact opens (as the water passes the <b>lower</b> <b>switch),</b> the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as {{the water level}} remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the [...] "High Level" [...] switch is off (opened), the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; {{this is an example}} of seal-in (latching) logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.|$|E

This report presents information about several multilevel inverter topologies, such as the Neutral-Point Clamped Inverter and the Cascaded Multicell Inverter. These multilevel inverters will also be compared with two-level inverters in simulations to investigate the advantages of using multilevel inverters. Modulation strategies, component comparison and solutions to the multilevel voltage source balancing problem will also be presented in this work. It is shown that multilevel inverters only produce 22 % and 32 % voltage THD while the two-level inverter for the same 1 kHz test produces 115 % voltage THD.

30|$|Since the {{principle}} of FeRAM {{is based on the}} polarization reversal by an externally applied electric field of metal-ferroelectric-metal capacitors, the computational ' 0 'and ' 1 ' are represented by the nonvolatile storage of the negative or positive remnant polarization state, respectively [12]. The ferroelectric films with different thickness need different coercive voltages. A staggered structure with two distinct thickness layers on a PZT thin film can be readily created by a one-step embossing process. In principle, the thinner layer should give rise to the <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> voltage and the thicker layer to the higher switch voltage [13]. The voltage magnitude corresponds to one of the two polarization charge levels stored in the ferroelectric memory cell. In this way, multiple bits of data can be obtained from a single ferroelectric memory cell by applying different voltages.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} bilingual adults have {{suggested}} that bilinguals’ experience with code-switching contributes to superior executive function (EF) abilities, although this claim is debated to this date. This thesis tested {{the hypothesis that the}} relationship between CS and EF may be a non-necessary one, especially in a homogeneous and highly bilingual population in Singapore where CS occurs pervasively. Accordingly, CS and EF measures were obtained from 43 English-Chinese 8 -year-old children (27 females, M = 8. 33 years). Spontaneous CS was measured with a novel task, and EF was measured in terms of verbal and non-verbal task-switching (e. g., Semantic Fluency, Hearts and Flowers) and verbal inhibitory control (e. g., Stroop task). Contrary to previous work with adults, children’s CS performance did not significantly predict general EF performance. On the other hand, some aspects of bilingual language proficiency did predict EF performance. Chinese school exam scores predicted Semantic Fluency switch cost (higher Chinese scores, higher switch cost), while English school exam scores predicted English Stroop Interference (higher English scores, lower Stroop Interference). In addition, correlational analyses also showed that broad bilingual language proficiency (measured in terms of school exam Oral and Written components) did correlate with EF performance. For Semantic Fluency, higher Oral Chinese scores were correlated with more items produced on the Pure Chinese block as well as <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> cost. Higher Written and Oral English scores also correlated with more items produced on the Mixed Language blocks as well as <b>lower</b> <b>switch</b> cost. For Stroop, higher Written English and English EI scores correlated with lower English Stroop Interference. Thus, we conclude that the relationship between CS and EF may be non-necessary in this particular population. These results suggest that in a proficient bilingual population that frequently engages in CS, the relationship between CS and EF may be an indirect one, even in a developmental population where EF and bilingual language proficiency are still developing. 2019 - 06 - 0...|$|E
