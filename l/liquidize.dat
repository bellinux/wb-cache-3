Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally <b>liquidize</b> their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E

40|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between parents}} feeding {{themselves and their}} young is an important life history problem that can be considered in terms of optimal behavioral strategies. Recent studies on birds have tested how parents allocate the food between themselves and their young. Until now the effect of food consumption by parent birds on their food delivery to their young {{as well as other}} parental activities has rarely been studied. I have previously shown that parent Palestine sunbirds (Nectarinia osea) will consume nectar and <b>liquidized</b> arthropods from artificial feeders. However, they will only feed their young with whole arthropods. This provided a unique opportunity to experimentally manipulate the food eaten by parents independent of that fed to their offspring. Here, I hypothesized that parents invest in their current young according to the quality of food that they themselves consume. Breeding pairs with two or three nestlings were provided with feeders containing water (control), sucrose solution (0. 75 mol) or <b>liquidized</b> mealworms mixed with sucrose solution (0. 75 mol). As food quality in feeders increased (from water up to <b>liquidized</b> mealworms mixed with sucrose solution) : 1) Parents (especially females) increased their food delivery of whole arthropod prey to their young. 2) Only males increased their nest guarding effort. Nestling food intake and growth rate increased with increasing food quality of parents and decreasing brood size. These results imply that increasing the nutrient content of foods consumed by parent sunbirds allow them to increase the rate at which other foods are delivered to their young and to increase the time spent on other parental care activities...|$|R

40|$|Korean REITs {{started as}} CR-REITs, {{vehicles}} with specific objectives to relieve real estate liabilities off the balance sheets of distressed companies and <b>liquidize</b> {{them back into}} the real estate market. CR-REITs were finite-lived, closed-end, passively managed vehicles with public offerings heavily weighed to institutional investors. Not only was REITs a new investment vehicle but CR-REITs and its AMC were also brand new companies with no proven track records. A finite-lived REIT has two sources of income, the first being monthly rental income which is paid out as dividends and the second being the capital gain redistributed at reversion when the REIT is terminated. Analysis shows that Korean REIT prices are more connected with appreciation earnings than rental income earnings specifically due to their finite-lived, passively managed structure. Not to be mistaken, average annual dividend yields were at historically around 9 % giving them the highest REIT returns in the Asian market. This thesis aims to study the overall REITs market in Korea and conduct detailed analysis on REITs stock price determinants using various factors in the Korean financial and real estate market. Individual Korean REITs were analyzed in detail sorting out categories such as stock price, shareholder characteristics, underlying assets, Net Asset Value, Earnings and Dividends. REITs Linear regression analysis on Korean REIT stock returns were conducted to show performance relation with the financial market. Further P/NAV analysis were focused on analyzing the different P/NAV patterns and eventually developed into REIT price connected with its underlying assets, especially with the appreciation value of the land.

Perfusion decellularization is applicable when an extensive vasculature system {{is present in}} the organ or tissue. It is crucial for the ECM scaffold to be decellularized at all levels, and evenly throughout the structure. [...] Because of this requirement, vascularized tissues can have chemicals and enzymes perfused through the present arteries, veins, and capillaries. Under this mechanism and proper physiological conditions, treatments can diffuse equally to all of the cells within the organ.

Cardiac and pulmonary decellularization often uses this process of decellularization to introduce the treatments because of their heavily vascularized networks.

They form in response tounstable density contrasts (density loading) or lateral variations i load (uneven loading) when sediment becomes <b>liquidized</b> or otherwise loses strength. They are here classified into five varieties: imple and pendulous load casts, in which the upper (denser) layer is laterally continuous; and attached pseudonodules, detached pseudonodules and ball-and-pillow structure, in which discrete masses of the upper layer are separated by matrix. Conceptual models demonstrate that here are several possible modes of formation for each type ofload structure. One interpretation of the variation of load structure morphology is as a deformation series representing varying degrees of deformation, controlled by the magnitude ofthe driving force and/or the duration of its effective action.

Temperature, humidity and pressure assure that the wood's own lignin, a polymer that is responsible for the firmness in the plant issue, <b>liquidizes.</b> Through the subsequent cooling, during which the lignin hardens again, the pellets achieve their firmness.

5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash <b>Liquidizing</b> Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water.

40|$|Orthodox-Rotor-vane teas dried in <b>liquidized</b> bed driers in tea {{factories}} {{at present}} have, on average, smaller size particles {{than that of}} teas produced a decade ago. Further particles are distributed over a wide size range. As a result, achieving desired fluidization {{was found to be}} difficult in the drier and that affected quality of the product. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted to understand the fluidizing behaviour of tea particles. Fluidization behaviour of drier-mouth teas from a commonly used drier called TRICCC FBD was studied using six different bedplates having varying opening area percentages and number of perforations. The study was conducted using a pilot scale fluidized bed unit. Desired bubbling phase in tea-bed was observed with three different bedplates: bedplate with perforations of 0. 5 mm wide, opening area percentage of 4 and 2, 217 perforations per square meter, bedplate with perforations of 0. 5 mm wide, opening area percentage of 5 and 2, 779 perforations per square meter and bedplate with perforations of 0. 6 mm wide, opening area percentage of 5 and 2, 269 perforations per square meter. These bedplates could be used in the drier to dry and improve the quality of the teas produced at present. A statistical analysis conducted on the data of bed pressure drop with varying loading rates of teas indicates that desired bubbling phase in tea-bed is achievable using these bedplates. This was confirmed bystudying change in bed pressure drop and fluidization velocity when airflow for fluidization of teas varied. The bedplate with perforations of 0. 5 mm wide, opening area percentage of 4 and 2, 217 perforations per square meter was found to be most suitable for the drier as desired bubbling phase in tea-bed could be achieved at lowest fluidization velocity {{for a wide range of}} loading rates, 21 - 29 kg/ m 2. Low fluidization velocity may lead to a reduction in energy consumption for drying the teas in the drier. 28...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{preserve}} food in times of plenty against the times of shortage has been faced from time immemorial. Probably {{the oldest and most}} usual method is air-drying which is simple fast and cheap. The only problem is that the appearance, texture and smell of the product changes and, even when reconstituted, rarely regains its original fresh flavour and appearance. Scientists at a laboratory in Cambridge, UK have been working on a substance called trehalose, a disaccharide made up of two glucose molecules that are linked by their reducing carbons. This makes trehalose a very stable, non-reducing sugar which is very soluble, chemically inert and biologically non-toxic colourless and virtually tasteless; properties which make the sugar ideal for the preservation of unstable biological molecules in natural food. As far as food was concerned the scientists concentrated on using trehalose dissolved in liquid or <b>liquidized</b> foods, where the trehalose could come into close contact with the food molecules. Blended fresh eggs dried with trehalose at 300 - 500 C produced an odourless yellow-orange powder that could be stored at room temperature. On rebydration it was almost indistinguishable from a fresh egg. It was found that dehydrated pur 9 es of banana, strawberries, mangoes, avocados, apples and raspberries recovered the colour, flavour and smell of the original product when the dried powder was reconstituted. Fresh herbs that were dried after being dipped in trehalose solutions (area just as well. The characteristic aromas and flavours of many foods, especially fresh fruits and herbs, depend on the release of volatile aromatic molecules. The powders produced by using trehalose do not smell like the fresh product until water is added, after which they soon emit the unique aroma of fresh foodstuffs. Industrial methods of air-drying food are too harsh for the trehalose method so the scientists have developed their own drying techniques which are referred to as a captive atmosphere partial pressure (CAPP) drying; this is a method where very dry air is circulated to remove water vapour. This allows food to be dried at room temperatures and pressure, but has the added benefit that it does not remove volatiles other than water. Aromatic foodstuffs can be dried while retaining the greater part of their fresh volatile components.

The soils from dome in the upper part of soil tunnel will mix up if rains come during the young stage of nymphs while drain firmly during near-mature or mature stages. The infiltration test for connection of the tunnel shows a final stable infiltration rate, after 2 hours escape time, tunnel seems like a maceopore, and lead to a conclusion that seepage is not at all directly or indirectly formed and no soil ruin occurs, thus, no erosion potential is expected and it is stable even after a long rain during cricket in mature stage [...] The important reason of transfer action in nymph period is due to uncomfortable and dirty，while adult male is never change. The tunnel again. The evolution of earth tunnel sighificently occurred in diameter enlargement one reason is water dissipation,an additionl reason perhapes the construction action for a femal adult after matching. The variation of diameter curve is proposed in the shape to account these influences. 木賊葉木麻黃森林草坪為重要台灣大蟋蟀棲地，森林草坪(forest lawn) 一般意指墓園，但本文係指有林木的草地。台灣大蟋蟀成蟲身長約 4. 5 公分，深入土中建構的地道，一方面提供棲身安全、儲糧、進食、活動、交配、 排洩之處理，二方面兼作為儲蛋與孵育場所。由於成蟲在每一年白露節氣即會死亡。而台灣大蟋蟀若蟲幼蟲絕大部分在白露節氣後才會陸續出土，此時氣候上，先有梅雨後有颱風雨，短期內地道功能任務繁瑣，變化巨大懸殊，種族繁衍又如何以賴？ 本研究首先取得木賊葉木麻黃森林草坪棲地內台灣大蟋蟀成蟲地道形狀，方法是採用水泥和水，以重力方式灌入地道中，俟水分脫乾後挖取水泥模型。在若蟲期，模型有如「y」。且Y字二頭相距以 20 cm為主，至 40 cm。成蟲期配對時，這種基本造型，在雌蟲進入雄蟲洞中後，有革命性變化。雌蟲依垂直擴充框架挖出另一地道，準備生產；地道深入地下可超過 1. 5 m。本文根據現場資料模擬出典型結構進行滲透測定，成蟲期地道通水 2 小時餘後依然安穩，而有一穩定終滲透率；依其功能尚可歸入為土壤粗孔隙。是以本研究做成台灣大蟋蟀成蟲地道不會間接或直接形成滲流的結論；不僅如此，也不會引發土壤沖蝕或其他可能結構崩潰災害。 若蟲期，當地道因處理排洩物而失去部分空間後，如已造成地道環境不佳，台灣大蟋蟀會抛棄該舊地道而另築新地道；但成蟲期台灣大蟋蟀除非是母蟲，否則即不再遷移，一但決定藏身地道中必在進洞時均以土粒形成土塚保護在地道穿口外，土塚土粒含有養分常低於鄰近土壤。台灣大蟋蟀成蟲常擴大地道半徑來因應氣候上大量水的衝擊，另一個原因引起地道的演化是因為母蟲在配對後，在地道的新建築行為，這些行為影響地道直徑曲線之形狀。目錄 摘要……………………………………………………………………Ⅱ Astract…………………………………………………………………Ⅳ 目錄………………………………………………………………………Ⅵ 表目錄……………………………………………………………………Ⅷ 圖目錄……………………………………………………………………Ⅸ 照片目錄……………………………………………………………Ⅹ 第一章 前言…. …………………………………………………………. 1 第二章 前人研究. ……………………………………………………… 4 第三章 材料與方法………………………………………………… 6 第一節 樣區概述…………………………………………. … 6 第二節 地道模型複製………………………………………. 8 第三節 滲透試驗……………………………………………. 9 第四節 土壤分析………………………………………… [...] . 11 1 、地道土塚取樣……………………………………… 11 2 、地道底土取樣. ……………………………………… 12 3 、一般區土壤取樣………………………………… [...] . 13 4 、採樣試體自然風乾…………………………………. 14 5 、土壤有效肥份分析…………………………… [...] . 14 6 、地道直徑測量…………………………… [...] … 15 第四章 結果與討論…………………………………………………… [...] . 16 第一節 地道形狀模型與地道功能區……………………. 16 第二節 稚蟲地道通水時間…………………………… [...] . 18 第三節 成蟲期滲透率……………… [...] ……………… [...] 19 第四節 土壤分析…………………………… [...] ………… [...] 21 第五節 地道直徑曲線……………………………………. 27 第五章 結論與建議……………………………………………… 29 第一節 結論………………………………………. ……… 29 第二節 建議………………………………………. ……… 31 參考文獻…………………………………………………………… 3...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} flow bioreactor is a well-stirred vessel containing microorganisms (X) through which a substrate (S) flows at a continuous rate. The microorganisms grow through {{the consumption of}} the substrate, producing more microorganisms and products. The products will typically contain carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water and other species, including biological compounds, specific to the process under consideration. The nature of these products is unimportant in this study. Unused substrate, microorganisms, and products flow out of the reactor. The use of a {{continuous flow}} bioreactor to treat sewage or industrial wastewaters {{is known as the}} activated sludge process. One drawback associated with the activated sludge process is the production of ‘sludge’. Traditional methods for disposing of excess sludge, which include incineration, the use of landfill sites and dumping at sea, are becoming increasingly regulated in many countries due to environmental concerns about the presence of potentially toxic elements in the sewage sludge. Furthermore, a combination of the limited amount of land available for landfill, particularly in urban areas, with stringent legislation has seen the economic costs of using landfill sites to increase sharply. It should be noted that incineration does not eliminate the need for landfill sites as a product of incineration is an ash containing high heavy materials content and general toxicity. Thus there is a pressing need, and growing interest, in methods that reduce the volume and mass of excess sludge produced as part of biological wastewater treatment processes. A promising method to reduce excess sludge production is to increase the biodegradability of the sludge by disintegrating it within the reactor. This approach works primarily by causing the disintegration of bacterial cell walls. Among the many techniques that have been reported for application to the activated sludge process, chemical treatments and ozone treatments have been the most widely adopted commercially [Oh et al (2007) ]. In processes involving ozonation a part of the sludge is removed from the reactor and treated with ozone in a sludge disintegrator. This ozonation stage converts the live sludge into a mixture of soluble substrate and particulates. The <b>liquidized</b> sludge is then returned to the bioreactor as a feed solution where the soluble substrate is biodegraded by live sludge. These techniques have shown to lead to much lower levels of MLSS (mixed liquor suspended solids). A simple model is considered for a reactor cascade in which each reactor may be connected to both a settling unit and a sludge disintegration unit (SDU). The sludge disintegration unit is not modelled per se. Instead sludge disintegration terms are added to a conventional activated sludge model. These terms assume that the disintegrator unit destroys the biochemical activity of the sludge, converting a fraction,, directly into usable substrate and the remainder, (1 −), into organic particulates. We obtain a qualitative understanding of the performance of the process by finding the steady-state solutions of the model and determining their stability. For a specified mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) content the values of the dimensionless residence time and the sludge disintegration factor are determined that ensure zero excess sludge production. We show that if the sludge disintegration factor is sufficiently high then the MLSS content is guaranteed to be below the target value provided that the residence time is higher than the washout value...|$|R
40|$|My dissertation, "Essays in Public Economics," is {{comprised}} of three chapters. The first one, titled "Altruism, Reciprocity, and Equity: A Unified Motive for Intergenerational Transfers" is to address the following question: Why do parents divide bequests equally while transferring inter vivos gifts unequally? Across times and places, why have there mainly been only two extreme choices of distribution of bequests: either to give them to just one child (unigeniture) or to divide them equally (equigeniture) ? How can a motive for intergenerational transfers explain both "equal division puzzle" (the former) and polarized inheritance patterns (the latter) ? This chapter presents a behavioral model that coherently rationalizes these empirical realities. Namely, as head of a family, a parent altruistically cares about children but also wants them to spend effort for family. However, effort is costly and individual level of each child is unverifiable to a third party adjudicator. Given this incomplete information, there rise only two stable equilibria: either equigeniture or unigeniture. When the productivity of effort rises, the evolution of inheritance pattern from unigeniture to equigeniture occurs. So equigeniture is eventually adopted due to {{a rise in the}} productivity throughout industrialization. Furthermore, if the parent wants to counterbalance inequality among children who exert equal effort, the greater amount of inter vivos gift is transferred to a child with lower relative income compared to his siblings, while bequests remain equally divided. This model is consistent with the aforementioned empirical realities but also lends itself to further empirical tests. First of all, with a data set of pre-industrial agrarian societies, we find that a rise in the productivity of effort causes equigeniture to be chosen over unigeniture, which is consistent with the model. Second of all, through an empirical analysis on a micro-level data on inter vivos transfers in contemporary families, we find supporting evidence as follows: (i) income inequality among children increases the probability that their parent gives any inter vivos gift; and (ii) the amount of the gift is negatively associated with relative income of each child compared to his siblings. The second chapter "Retirement and Exposure of Pension to Financial Market Fluctuations" studies how exposure of pension wealth to stock market fluctuations affects retirement behavior both theoretically and empirically. Characteristics of optimal plan for retirement are elaborated with reflecting that <b>liquidizing</b> pension wealth is more tied to retirement decisions than non-pension wealth as well as embodying time-sensitive restrictions on availability of pension benefits. Theoretical analysis finds that exposure of pension to financial market fluctuations does not always entail perfectly symmetric response of retirement. Exposure of pension to a positive shock actually brings responses of retirement only if the magnitude of the positive shock is large enough to compensate for foregone labor earnings and demand for resources necessary for post-retirement consumptions. In particular, whereas exposure of pension to a small negative shock leads to a decrease in retirement, exposure of pension to a positive shock with the same magnitude might not yield an increase in retirement. Next, empirical analysis is conducted with Health and Retirement Study, micro-level biennial panel data of senior workers in U. S., to examine actual retirement responses over the recent business cycle. Little evidence is found on a discernible increase in retirement rate owing to exposure of pension to the 2004 and 2006 positive shocks. However, the 2002 and 2008 negative shocks prove to lead to a decrease in retirement rate. In the view of theoretical findings, this is not self-contradictory but still can be consistent with a positive wealth effect on retirement; rather, it points to a case where these positive shocks are not sharp and large enough to bring substantive earlier retirement. The third chapter, titled "Optimal Income Taxation and Optimal Revenue Mobilization," analyzes characteristics of nonlinear optimal income taxation and optimal revenue mobilization when the tax enforcement of a government is not costless (and thus not presumed to be perfect). The government cannot observe and verify an individual's innate ability although that ability turns out to cause inequality amongst them. This prevents the government from avoiding efficiency loss in the taxation, since each taxpayer can take advantage of private information over their own ability by reducing working hours to pretend to be less able than he truly is. Optimal income tax schedule is designed to minimize the efficiency loss from deterring such behavior to maximize social welfare. Moreover, the desired expenditure of the government is set for enhancing minimum living standard of society. In executing the tax schedule to finance this, however, tax evasion occurs due to imperfect enforcement. Although the government can verify the true amount of taxpayer's earnings, unlike their ability, it is costly to increase the enforcement rate. The optimal rate equalizes a gain of net increase in the tax revenue with a loss of decreased utility of risk-averse taxpayers from an increment in the rate. Notably, this chapter shows that aggregate loss of tax revenue can theoretically justify non-zero tax rate on top earners...|$|R
