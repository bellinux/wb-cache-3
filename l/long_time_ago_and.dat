Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man".

[...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere".

A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R".

2500|$|The Germanic {{language}} which diutisc {{most likely}} comes from is West Frankish, a language which died out a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> {{which there is}} hardly any written evidence for today. This was the Germanic dialect used in the early Middle Ages, spoken by the Franks in Western Francia, i.e. in the region which is now northern France. The word is only known from the Latin form theodiscus. Until the 8th century the Franks called their language frengisk; however, when the Franks moved their political and cultural centre to the area where France now is, the term frengisk became ambiguous, as in the West Francian territory some Franks spoke Latin, some vulgar Latin and some theodisc. For this reason a new word was needed to help differentiate between them. Thus the word theodisc evolved from the Germanic word theoda (the people) with the Latin suffix -iscus, to mean [...] "belonging to the people", i.e. the people's language.|$|E
