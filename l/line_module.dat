It was proved in [21] {{that the point}} modules are in {{bijection}} with the points of an elliptic curve E in P 3 together with 4 other points. Here it is proved that the <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> are in bijection with the lines in P 3 which are secant lines to E. The point and <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> are precisely the Cohen-Macaulay modules of multiplicity 1, and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 1 and 2 respectively. Further algebraic properties of these modules are shown to be consequences and analogues of the geometric properties of the elliptic curve and the 4 points. For example, if two lines lie on a smooth quadric containing E, {{and they do not}} intersect, then the two corresponding <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> have the same annihilator. It is also shown that the Sklyanin algebra may be defined in terms of the bilinear forms vanishing on a certain subvariety of P 3 Θ P 3.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{geospatial}} {{models are}} developed using command <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> of GIS packages. To utilize scientific workflow technology in geospatial model-ing, {{it is important}} to support command <b>line</b> GIS <b>modules</b> in scientific work-flow systems. However, straightforward representation of command <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> as workflow components conflicts with conventional conceptual de-sign patterns. We propose a two-step geospatial scientific workflow composi-tion approach. Simple conceptual workflows are composed in the first step. These allow data type-based workflow validation. The validated conceptual workflows are then transformed automatically into executable workflows using command <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> in the second step.

The <b>line</b> <b>module</b> also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|E

40|$|Tidal cracks are linear {{features}} that appear parallel to coastlines in fast ice regions {{due to the}} actions of periodic and non-periodic sea level oscillations. They can influence energy and heat exchange between the ocean, ice, and atmosphere, as well as human activities. In this paper, the <b>LINE</b> <b>module</b> of Geomatics 2015 software was used to automatically extract tidal cracks in fast ice regions near the Chinese Zhongshan Station in East Antarctica from Landsat- 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data with resolutions of 15 m (panchromatic band 8) and 30 m (multispectral bands 1 – 7). The detected tidal cracks were determined based on matching between the output from the <b>LINE</b> <b>module</b> and manually-interpreted tidal cracks in OLI images. The ratio {{of the length of}} detected tidal cracks to the total length of interpreted cracks was used to evaluate the automated detection method. Results show that the vertical direction gradient is a better input to the <b>LINE</b> <b>module</b> than the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance input for estimating the presence of cracks, regardless of the examined resolution. Data with a resolution of 15 m also gives better results in crack detection than data with a resolution of 30 m. The statistics also show that, in the results from the 15 -m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 8 performed best with values of the above-mentioned ratio of 50. 92 and 31. 38 percent using the vertical gradient and the TOA reflectance methods, respectively. On the other hand, in the results from the 30 -m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 5 performed best with ratios of 47. 43 and 17. 8 percent using the same methods, respectively. This implies that Band 8 was better for tidal crack detection than the multispectral fusion data (Bands 1 – 7), and Band 5 with a resolution of 30 m was best among the multispectral data. The semi-automatic mapping of tidal cracks will improve the safety of vehicles travel in fast ice regimes...|$|E

The delay paths which their lengths are in binary fashion are free-space based delay lines. Micro-mirrors operate as a switch to redirect the light through delay paths. One of the main characteristic of this design is to provide constant optical power loss for different delay times.

Moreover, we prove the following counter-intuitive result: if the zero locus of the dening relations of a quadratic (not necessarily regular) algebra on four generators with six dening relations is nite, then it determines the dening relations of the algebra. Although this result is non-commutative in nature, its proof uses only commutative theory.

40|$|AbstractWe {{define a}} family of graded {{quadratic}} algebras Aσ (on 4 generators) depending on a fixed nonsingular quadric Q in P 3, a fixed line L in P 3 and an automorphism σ ∈ Aut(Q ∪ L). This family contains Oq(M 2 (C)), the coordinate ring of quantum 2 × 2 matrices. Many of the algebraic properties of Aσ are shown {{to be determined by}} the geometric properties of {Q ∪ L, σ}. For instance, when Aσ = Oq(M 2 (C)), then the quantum determinant is the unique (up to a scalar multiple) homogeneous element of degree 2 in Oq(M 2 (C)) that vanishes on the graph in P 3 × P 3 of σ|Q but not on the graph of σ|L. Following results of M. Artin, J. Tate, and M. Van den Bergh ("The Grothendieck Festschrift," Birkhäuser, Basel, 1990; and Invent. Math. 106, 1991, 335 - 388), we study point and <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> over the algebras Aσ, and find that their algebraic properties are consequences of the geometric data. In particular, the point modules are in one-to-one correspondence with the points of Q or L, and the <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> are in bijection with the lines in P 3 that either lie on Q or meet L. In the case of Oq(M 2 (C)), when q is not a root of unity, the quantum determinant annihilates all the <b>line</b> <b>modules</b> M(l) corresponding to lines l ⊂ Q; the determinant generates the whole annihilator for such l ⊂ Q if and only if l and L = ∅...|$|R
40|$|A moving line L(x, y; t) = 0 is {{a family}} of lines with one {{parameter}} t in a plane. A moving line L(x, y; t) = 0 is said to follow a rational curve P(t) if the point P(t 0) {{is on the line}} L(x, y; t 0) = 0 for any parameter value t 0. A μ-basis of a rational curve P(t) is a pair of lowest degree moving lines that constitute a basis of the module formed by all the moving lines following P(t), which is the syzygy module of P(t). The study of moving lines, especially the μ-basis, has recently led to an efficient method, called the moving line method, for computing the implicit equation of a rational curve [3, 6]. In this paper, we present properties and equivalent definitions of a μ-basis of a planar rational curve. Several of these properties and definitions are new, and they help to clarify an earlier definition of the μ-basis [3]. Furthermore, based on some of these newly established properties, an efficient algorithm is presented to compute a μ-basis of a planar rational curve. This algorithm applies vector elimination to the moving <b>line</b> <b>module</b> of P(t), and has O(n 2) time complexity, where n is the degree of P(t).

To be the reference of the output, manual lineament extraction with directional filtering in four principal directions (N-S, E-W, NE-SW, NW-SE) is found to be the most suitable method. For the comparison of automatic lineament extraction and manual lineament extraction processes, total length and number of lineaments and directional analyses are carried out by constructing the rose diagrams. Besides these, field studies and previous studies carried out in the study area are also taken into consideration. After the accuracy assesssment, final parameters of automatically extracted lineaments are determined.

Many floating wind turbine concepts have been proposed, but dynamics models, which account for the wind inflow, aerodynamics, elasticity and controls of the wind turbine, along with the incident waves, sea current, hydrodynamics, and platform and mooring dynamics of the floater, were needed to determine their technical and economic feasibility. This work presents the devel-opment of a comprehensive simulation tool for modelling the coupled dynamic response of offshore floating wind turbines and the verification of the simulation tool through model-to-model comparisons.
