5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} <b>Lex</b> <b>mercatoria,</b> a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E
5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria,</b> which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E

25|$|English {{contract}} {{law is a}} body of law regulating contracts in England and Wales. With {{its roots in the}} <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> and the activism of the judiciary during the industrial revolution, it shares a heritage with countries across the Commonwealth (such as Australia, Canada, India), {{and to a lesser extent}} the United States. It is also experiencing gradual change because of the UK's membership of the European Union and international organisations like Unidroit. Any agreement that is enforceable in court is a contract. Because a contract is a voluntary obligation, in contrast to paying compensation for a tort and restitution to reverse unjust enrichment, English law places a high value on ensuring people have truly consented to the deals that bind them in court.|$|E
2500|$|The Lex {{column is}} a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It {{features}} analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The FT calls Lex its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for <b>Lex</b> <b>Mercatoria,</b> a Latin expression meaning literally [...] "merchant law". It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the Financial News in the 1930s {{and moved to the}} Financial Times when the two merged.|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly, the English law on {{contractual}} bargains {{was affected}} by its trading relations with northern Europe, particularly since the Magna Carta 1215 had guaranteed merchants [...] "safe and secure" [...] exit and entry to England [...] "for buying and selling by the ancient rights and customs, quit from all evil tolls". In 1266 King Henry III had granted the Hanseatic League a charter to trade in England. The [...] "Easterlings" [...] who came by boats brought goods and money that the English called [...] "Sterling", and standard rules for commerce that formed a <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria,</b> {{the laws of the}} merchants. Merchant custom was most influential in the coastal trading ports like London, Boston, Hull and King's Lynn. While the courts were hostile to restraints on trade, a doctrine of consideration was forming, so that to enforce any obligation something of value needed to be conveyed. Some courts remained sceptical that damages might be awarded purely for a broken agreement (that was not a sealed covenant). Other disputes allowed a remedy. In Shepton v Dogge a defendant had agreed in London, where the City courts' custom was to allow claims without covenants under seal, to sell 28 acres of land in Hoxton. Although the house itself was outside London at the time, in Middlesex, a remedy was awarded for deceit, but essentially based on a failure to convey the land.|$|E
2500|$|Democratic {{ideals of}} {{integration}} for international and European nations are {{as old as}} the modern nation-state. Ancient concepts of European unity were generally undemocratic, and founded on domination, like the Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, or the Catholic Church controlled by the Pope in Rome. In the Renaissance, medieval trade flourished in organisations like the Hanseatic League, stretching from English towns like Boston and London, to Frankfurt, Stockholm and Riga. These traders developed the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria,</b> spreading basic norms of good faith and fair dealing through their business. In 1517, the Protestant Reformation triggered a hundred years of crisis and instability. Martin Luther nailed a list of demands to the church door of Wittenberg, King Henry VIII declared a unilateral split from Rome with the Act of Supremacy 1534, and conflicts flared across the Holy Roman Empire until the Peace of Augsburg 1555 guaranteed each principality the right to its chosen religion (cuius regio, eius religio). This unstable settlement unravelled in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), killing around a quarter of the population in central Europe. The Treaty of Westphalia 1648, which brought peace according to a system of international law inspired by Hugo Grotius, is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the nation-state system. Even then, the English Civil War broke out and only ended with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by Parliament inviting William and Mary from Hannover to the throne, and passing the Bill of Rights 1689. In 1693 William Penn, a Quaker from London who founded Pennsylvania in North America, argued that to prevent ongoing wars in Europe a [...] "European dyet, or parliament" [...] was needed. The French diplomat, Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre, who worked negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht {{at the end of the}} War of Spanish Succession proposed, through [...] "Perpetual Union", [...] "an everlasting peace in Europe", a project taken up by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant after him. After the Napoleonic Wars and the Revolutions of 1848 in the 19th century, Victor Hugo at the International Peace Congress in 1849 envisioned a day when there would be a [...] "United States of America and the United States of Europe face to face, reaching out for each other across the seas". World War One devastated Europe's society and economy, and the Versailles Treaty failed to establish a workable international system in the League of Nations, any European integration, and imposed punishing terms of reparation payments for the losing countries. After another economic collapse and the rise of fascism led to a Second World War, European civil society was determined to create a lasting union to guarantee world peace through economic, social and political integration.|$|E
50|$|The {{nationalisation}} of the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> did not {{neglect the}} practises of merchants or their trans-border trade. Some institutions continued to function, and state judges also were appointed for their merchant expertise, just as modern commercial arbitrators. The {{laws of the}} merchants were not eradicated, but simply codified. National codes built on the principles laid down by trade commercial practise and {{to a large extent}} they embodied <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> substantial rules. This was for example the case in France. The Code Commercial was issued in 1807, where <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> rules were preserved to govern formation, performance and termination of contracts. In effect, the nation states reconstituted the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> in their image.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> was {{the product}} of customs and {{practices}} among traders, and could be enforced through the local courts. However, the merchants needed to solve their disputes rapidly, sometimes on the hour, with the least costs and by the most efficient means. Public courts did not provide this. A trial before the courts would delay their business, and that meant losing money. The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> provided quick and effective justice. This was possible through informal proceedings, with liberal procedural rules. The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> rendered proportionate judgements over the merchants’ disputes, in light of [...] "fair price", good commerce, and equity.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> was {{composed}} of such usages and customs as were common to merchants and traders {{in all parts of}} Europe, varied slightly in different localities by special peculiarities. Less procedural formality meant speedier dispensation of justice, particularly when it came to documentation and proof. Out of practical need, the medieval <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> originated the “writing obligatory”. By this, creditors could freely transfer the debts owed to them. The “writing obligatory” displaced the need for more complex forms of proof, as it was valid as a proof of debt, without further proof of; transfer of the debt; powers of attorney; or a formal bargain for sale. The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> also strengthened the concept of party autonomy: whatever the rules of the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> were, the parties were always free to choose whether to take a case to court, what evidence to submit and which law to apply.|$|E

5000|$|English courts applied {{merchant}} customs only if {{they were}} [...] "certain" [...] in nature, [...] "consistent with law" [...] and [...] "in existence since time immemorial." [...] English judges also required that merchant customs were proven before the court. But even as early as 1608, Chief Justice Edward Coke described <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> as [...] "a part of the common law," [...] and William Blackstone would later concur. The tradition continued especially under Lord Mansfield, {{who is said to}} be the father of English commercial law. Precepts of the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> were also kept alive through equity and the admiralty courts in maritime affairs. In the US, traditions of the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> prevailed in the general principles and doctrines of commercial jurisprudence.|$|E

5000|$|These law principles, the <b>Lex</b> <b>mercatoria,</b> {{on which}} a court can then make its {{decision}} to settle the disputes of the parties, are composed of the [...] "laws of several systems, {{the work of the}} legal writers and the published arbitral awards," [...] and thus the entirety of the international legal practices in a special field of law. Thus, the PECL are, like the Unidroit Principles or the CISG, also part of the <b>Lex</b> <b>Mercatoria.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> in England {{is divided into three}} stages: the first prior to the time of Coke, when it was a special kind of law - as {{distinct}} from the common law - administered in special courts for a special class of the community (i.e. the mercantile); the second stage was one of transition, the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> being administered in the common law courts, but as a body of customs, to be proved as a fact in each individual case of doubt; the third stage, which has continued to the present day, dates from the presidency over the king's bench of Lord Mansfield (q.v.), under whom it was moulded into the mercantile law of to-day. To the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> modern English law owes the fundamental principles in the law of partnership, negotiable instruments and trade marks.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> was {{originally}} {{a body of}} rules and principles laid down by merchants to regulate their dealings. It consisted of rules and customs common to merchants and traders in Europe, with some local variation. It originated from the need for quick and effective jurisdiction, administered by specialised courts. The guiding spirit of the merchant law was that it ought to derive from commercial practice, respond {{to the needs of}} the merchants, and be comprehensible and acceptable to the merchants who submitted to it. International commercial law today owes some of its fundamental principles to the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria.</b> This includes choice of arbitration institutions, procedures, applicable law and arbitrators, and the goal to reflect customs, usage and good practice among the parties.|$|E

50|$|In summary, {{nation states}} {{somewhat}} fragmented the medieval <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> {{but it is}} far from destroyed. Local interests triumphed in the medieval ages, just as national interests do today. A modern variant of the <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> is the evolving law and dispute resolution in cyberspace. Internet traders are the fastest growing body of merchants in history. Parties can solve domain-name disputes online expeditiously and quickly. In a virtual court documents are filed and examined online, arguments are made online and decisions are published online - seldom challenged before traditional courts of law. ICANN's UDRP (and its proposals for Rapid Suspension) and Nominet's DRS are examples of this. The medieval, the modern and cyberspace merchant laws face comparable issues of enforceability. They solve the problems somewhat differently, but the reaction of the market is the main incentive to comply with a ruling.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> (from the Latin for [...] "merchant law"), often {{referred}} to as [...] "the Law Merchant" [...] in English, is the body of commercial law used by merchants throughout Europe during the medieval period. It evolved similar to English common law as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce. It emphasised contractual freedom and alienability of property, while shunning legal technicalities and deciding cases ex aequo et bono. A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade. Under <b>lex</b> <b>mercatoria</b> trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation.|$|E
