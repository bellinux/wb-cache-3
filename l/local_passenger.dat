5|$|On 8 October 1952, {{locomotive}} No. 46242 City of Glasgow was hauling {{an express}} passenger train when it overran signals {{and crashed into}} a <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> train at , Middlesex. Another express passenger train ran into the wreckage. In the second deadliest railway accident in the United Kingdom, 102 people were killed at the scene and 10 more died later from their injuries; no fewer than 340 people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Since {{privatisation}} in 1987, {{dozens of}} Japanese railway companies compete in regional and <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains {{are known for}} their safety and punctuality. Proposals for a new Maglev route between Tokyo and Osaka are at an advanced stage.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Federal Railroad Administration {{identified}} ten regions {{for potential}} development as high-speed rail corridorsErie lies in a gap near three corridors: the Chicago Hub Network, the Empire Corridor, and the Keystone Corridor. The <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> rail advocacy group, All Aboard Erie, proposed a feasibility study in 2014 for high-speed rail service to connect to the corridors at Cleveland and Buffalo. The group also sought to determine if rail service would be possible using the existing tracks and right of way between Erie, Youngstown and Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, on 1 January 1923 the North Eastern Railway became the North Eastern area of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The {{passenger}} service was withdrawn north of Tow Law on 1 May 1939. Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the lines were placed under the control of British Railways. In the early 1950s control was split between the North Eastern and London Midland regions with Kirkby Stephen as the boundary. <b>Local</b> <b>passenger</b> trains were withdrawn between Kirkby Stephen and Tebay on 1 December 1952. The service along Weardale was withdrawn on 29 June 1953 and services north of Crook on 11 June 1956.|$|E
5|$|The line {{continued}} to serve <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight trains for decades, but flooding in August 1955 destroyed the critical bridge work in Putnam {{and lead to}} its closure in the 1960s. Several years after its abandonment the railroad was sold to Connecticut's Department of Transportation. By 1983, the abandoned railroad bridge had its span sealed off and its tracks lifted. The bridge is in the Salmon River State Forest and {{is a part of}} the Air Line State Park Trail. A new wooden bridge allows transportation over the Blackledge River. Constructed prior to 2007, the new wooden bridge decks the railroad bridge. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection was assisted by the Coast Guard Academy and the 192nd Engineering Battalion of the Connecticut National Guard.|$|E
5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} an {{important}} transportation gateway to Ukraine. The station serves freight and <b>local</b> <b>passengers</b> trains. Among the services provided at the station is only embarkment and disembarkment of passengers for commuter lines.|$|R

50|$|The {{line through}} Whittington {{remained}} busy with <b>local</b> <b>passengers,</b> {{particularly with the}} rapidly expanding industry. The original station was replaced with a station 1.5 mi further north in 1873. This 1873 station was the final Whittington station in the area.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{building}} is a two-story building with reinforced concrete boree piles. The ground floor is for passenger arrivals and the first floor for passengers departures.

25|$|Bus and tram {{competition}} hit {{the passenger}} service badly as {{the twentieth century}} progressed, and in 1962 the line closed to <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> trains. It continues in use for freight traffic and diverted and excursion passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{multiple}} unit operation on the suburban line was introduced on 9 June 1958. However {{the costs of}} operating a passenger service considerably exceeded the income, and on 10 September 1962 the <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> service was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|<b>Local</b> <b>passenger</b> {{services}} {{stopped using}} the Fallowfield Line in 1958 (though through trains continued until 1969). The Beeching Report of 1963 {{recommended that the}} Woodhead Line be retained and the Hope Valley line (serving Reddish North Station) closed; in 1966 BR controversially implemented the reverse.|$|E

The firm which operated this service was called Turner, after which Turner Street was named.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intended}} primarily for goods and mineral traffic, the topography {{of the route}} forced the inclusion of significant gradients, climbing at 1 in 88 westbound and 1 in 60 eastbound to Morningside. There {{was considered to be}} limited potential for <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic on the line; most of the route was remote and rural. It was hoped that the passenger traffic would build up over time.|$|E

After they have opened, all rail traffic will still {{need to use the}} {{existing}} route north of Erstfeld, between Biasca and Bellinzona, and south of Lugano. The bypassed sections of the existing route will be retained for <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> services, for general capacity and as a diversionary route.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{stations}} on the radius, Akademmistechko {{does not}} follow the Peremohy avenue but instead takes a northwards turn and is located near the intersection of Palladin avenue and Vernadsky boulevard/Uborevich street.

And finally, Dothan was a stop for the South Wind passenger train, later Amtrak's Floridian, with service ending in 1979. The Floridian was the last passenger train to operate through Dothan.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} {{moderately}} successful {{as a tourist}} railway although <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight traffic remained limited, {{to the extent that}} the harbour branch was very little used throughout its existence. However, efforts were made to develop the tourist service over the summer seasons with the construction of open-sided carriages and such was the level of the tourist trade the locomotive Palmerston had to be hired from the Festiniog Railway over a number of summers pre-war.|$|E
25|$|The Boston and Lowell {{was faced}} with a new problem; it had a {{reputation}} for speed which made it very popular and highly competitive with stagecoaches. Many people wanted to go not only from Lowell to Boston but to places in between. The Boston and Lowell ordered another locomotive and cars for <b>local</b> <b>passenger</b> rail in 1842, and had them make six stops along the route. Passenger rail proved to be almost as profitable as freight.|$|E
