5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

25|$|However, it {{is clear}} that in a general case the {{behaviour}} of Bose–Einstein condensate can be described by coupled evolution equations for condensate density, superfluid velocity and distribution function of elementary excitations. This problem was in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a <b>limiting</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Poisson {{distribution}} can {{be derived}} as a <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> to the binomial distribution {{as the number of}} trials goes to infinity and the expected number of successes remains fixed — see law of rare events below. Therefore, it can be used as an approximation of the binomial distribution if n is sufficiently large and p is sufficiently small. There is a rule of thumb stating that the Poisson distribution is a good approximation of the binomial distribution if n is at least 20 and p is smaller than or equal to 0.05, and an excellent approximation if nnbsp&≥nbsp&100 and npnbsp&≤nbsp&10.|$|E
25|$|In {{practical}} terms, the equivalence of {{inertial reference}} frames means that scientists within a box moving uniformly cannot determine their absolute velocity by any experiment (otherwise the differences {{would set up}} an absolute standard reference frame). According to this definition, supplemented with the constancy {{of the speed of}} light, inertial frames of reference transform among themselves according to the Poincaré group of symmetry transformations, of which the Lorentz transformations are a subgroup. In Newtonian mechanics, which {{can be viewed as a}} <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> of special relativity in which the speed of light is infinite, inertial frames of reference are related by the Galilean group of symmetries.|$|E

25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, and I believe that this theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The two diagonals {{and the two}} {{tangency}} chords are concurrent. One way to {{see this}} is as a <b>limiting</b> <b>case</b> of Brianchon's theorem, which states that a hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a single conic section has three diagonals that meet at a point. From a tangential quadrilateral, one can form a hexagon with two 180° angles, by placing two new vertices at two opposite points of tangency; all six of the sides of this hexagon lie on lines tangent to the inscribed circle, so its diagonals meet at a point. But two of these diagonals {{are the same as}} the diagonals of the tangential quadrilateral, and the third diagonal of the hexagon is the line through two opposite points of tangency. Repeating this same argument with the other two points of tangency completes the proof of the result.|$|E
