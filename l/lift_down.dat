6000|$|The first apprentices' {{dormitory}} {{was a long}} bleak {{room with}} six beds, six chests of drawers and looking glasses {{and a number of}} boxes of wood or tin; it opened into a still longer and bleaker room of eight beds, and this into a third apartment with yellow grained paper and American cloth tables, which was the dining-room by day and the men's sitting-and smoking-room after nine. Here Mr. Polly, who had been an only child, first tasted the joys of social intercourse. At first there were attempts to bully him on account of his refusal to consider face washing a diurnal duty, but two fights with the apprentices next above him, established a useful reputation for choler, and the presence of girl apprentices in the shop somehow raised his standard of cleanliness to a more acceptable level. He didn't of course have very {{much to do with the}} feminine staff in his department, but he spoke to them casually as he traversed foreign parts of the Bazaar, or got out of their way politely, or helped them to <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> heavy boxes, and on such occasions he felt their scrutiny. Except in the course of business or at meal times the men and women of the establishment had very little opportunity of meeting; the men were in their rooms and the girls in theirs. Yet these feminine creatures, at once so near and so remote, affected him profoundly. He would watch them going to and fro, and marvel secretly at the beauty of their hair or the roundness of their necks or the warm softness of their cheeks or the delicacy of their hands. He would fall into passions for them at dinner time, and try and show devotions by his manner of passing the bread and margarine at tea. There was a very fair-haired, fair-skinned apprentice in the adjacent haberdashery to whom he said [...] "good-morning" [...] every morning, and for a period it seemed to him the most significant event in his day. When she said, [...] "I do hope it will be fine to-morrow," [...] he felt it marked an epoch. He had had no sisters, and was innately disposed to worship womankind. But he did not betray as much to Platt and Parsons.|$|E

A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes {{that seem to be}} burning. That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when told that he will be pay well, and though he swear much at the first he agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box. This he himself <b>lift</b> <b>down,</b> though it take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place. But the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no,' that he come not yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood, {{before the turn of the}} tide, with blood. Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit, but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues, tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship, with blood on her also. And so, after asking where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.|$|E
50|$|The two {{caught the}} train to Beenleigh and bought some clothes, then {{proceeded}} to hitchhike south, down the Gold Coast highway.

5000|$|The main lift span weighs 750 ST, with {{an equal}} amount in counterweights, so the lift {{mechanism}} operates 1500 ST using two [...] electric motors, one in each tower. In the event of electrical failure, backup electrical power is provided by a [...] diesel generator set. The main lift span can be raised to its full height in less than 90 seconds, although the total operating cycle can disrupt road traffic for 8-25 minutes. Clearance under the raised lift is 135 ft to the highest anticipated water level, and the navigation channel is 270 ft wide between the timber fenders protecting the tower piers. With the <b>lift</b> <b>down,</b> vertical clearance is only 18 ft.|$|E
5000|$|Chan and Lau meet on {{the same}} rooftop where Wong was killed earlier. Chan disarms Lau and holds a pistol to his head as a rebuke to Lau's plea for {{forgiveness}} and request to remain as a cop. Inspector B arrives on the scene shortly and orders Chan to release Lau. Chan holds Lau as a hostage at gunpoint and backs into the lift, but upon moving his head from behind Lau he is suddenly {{shot in the head}} by B.

5000|$|The {{game was}} based heavily, and unofficially, on the Alien films, {{specifically}} Aliens, {{and also on}} the 8-bit-era games Laser Squad and Paradroid (although the game bears some gameplay similarities with Gauntlet, with which it has been compared, as well an obvious comparison with Sega's Alien Syndrome). Alien Breed consists of the player or players having to find the <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> to the next level, occasionally setting the self-destruct sequence {{to blow up the}} level above them. The players collect or purchase a variety of weapons from the space station's computer terminals. In some versions of the game, these so-called Intex terminals provide additional features such as a clone of the classic computer game Pong. Credits found on the ground have to be saved for these weapons and other enhancements, each giving the players an edge over the gradually more and more powerful Alien forces. In advanced levels, players are occasionally trapped in enclosed spaces with huge [...] "boss" [...] aliens, reminiscent of the Alien Queen.|$|E
5000|$|A popular {{route for}} those staying in Mayrhofen {{is to take}} the Penken lift to the top station and then walk along route 23 to Penkenjoch with {{stunning}} views actross the Zillertal Alps. Route 57 should then be followed(clearly signposted)past the Wanglalm hut. Route 57 then climbs up to the summit of the Wanglspitze at 2420m continuing on to Hoarbergjoch at 2590m. Continue NNW along route 57 until it joins route 51. Continue along route 51 which becomes steeper until the ridge is reached. Turn west along a well marked trail that leads to the summit of Rastkogel. The final km involves some mild scrambling. The recommended time for the walk is 3.5 - 4hrs each way. These timings are for an average walker in good conditions. The Penken lift starts at 9.00 am and the last trip down is at 4.30pm (2011). It is worth checking before you start as if you miss the last <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> it is another 2-3hrs walk down to Mayrhofen! (The 1:35000 Mayr map 33 Zillertaller Alpen has all the route numbers for the area clearly marked.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{training}} operation involved {{junior officers}} {{who had undergone}} three weeks prior training and who were given considerable leeway in planning and executing the operation. The mock hostage rescue was staged on the 10th floor of the hotel without {{the permission of the}} hotel's owner or staff. When ASIS operators were refused entry into a hotel room, they broke down the door with sledgehammers. The hotel manager, Nick Rice, was notified of a disturbance on the 10th floor by a hotel guest. When he went to investigate, he was forced back into the lift by an ASIS operator who rode the <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> to the ground floor and forcibly ejected Rice into the lobby. Believing a robbery was in progress, Rice called the police. When the lift started returning to the ground floor, ASIS operators emerged wearing masks and openly brandishing 9mm Browning pistols and Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns, two of them with silencers. They forced their way through the lobby to the kitchen, where two getaway cars were waiting outside the kitchen door. Police stopped one of the cars and arrested the occupants, two ASIS officers and three ASIS civilian trainees, who refused to produce any form of identification.|$|E

5000|$|The {{adjacent}} {{hills to}} the south of Ellmau have several lifts and a brand new gondola ascending them (which replaced the funicular) [...] In the winter several Drag Lifts are in operation for skiers going into the lower stage of hills, in addition to smaller nursery slope lifts. The main lifts are open in both summer and winter. The Astberg is located about 1.5 km east from the village, it is a 4-person chair lift going {{to the top of the}} Astberg, where there is a cafe. About 2 km to the west of the Village is the Hartkaiser heated gondola which ascends the Hartkaiser taking around 7 minutes. The funicilar car has now been placed at the top of the slopes as a monument to the former lift. At the top of the Hartkaiser is a restaurant and park with various interactive exhibits and wood carvings. About 4 km to the west at Scheffau is the Brandstadl Gondola Lifts, which are 4-man cars suspended by cable. There is also an 8-man gondola lift. 9 km away is the Hohe Salve lift which is also a gondola lift. You can then take the <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> the other side of the Hohe Salve to Hopfgarten.Individual tickets for these lifts can be bought at the stations or weekly, fortnightly and season passes from tourist information; these cover most lifts in the Skiwelt area.There are no lifts going up the Wilder Kaiser side except for one located in Kufstein. Taxis are available up to the Wochenbrunn from which you need to walk to ascend further.|$|E
50|$|The scene then {{shifts to}} St Cadix {{and an annual}} Christmas drinks party held by George’s neighbours, the Walpoles. Most of the people there, like George, are retirees and spend their time talking about their past lives. It is here that George meets Diana Pym, who gives him a lift back to his house, Thalassa, where he discovers {{that she was the}} former singer, Julie Midnight. When down by the harbour, George is {{approached}} by a St Cadix resident and informed about a boat, the Calliope, that is for sale - it belongs to a Wing Commander and his wife who are in financially strained circumstances and they need to sell it. He reflects back on a time in Bom Porto when he was given some money by the President for previously attending a Pan-African shipping convention whilst a Portuguese patrol vessel was sabotaged during the PAIM revolution against its colonial masters. George refused the money but it was automatically transferred to a Geneva bank account, and it is this money that he uses to purchase Calliope. George travels to London to visit Sheila who, as S.V. Grey, {{is the author of a}} popular feminist book. During his visit he is presented with an old sextant that Tom had been planning to sell. George had learnt how to use one whilst studying at Pwllheli, under Commonader Prynne, an elderly navigation instructor and he is pleased to find out he has still retained his skills. As Tom gives him a <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> to Heathrow, from which George is flying to collect his money in Geneva, George tells him of his plans to sail round England.|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Indiana Jones hunting for an ancient ram's head idol in Sudan in 1939. Indy {{traverses}} a canyon {{and enters the}} temple of the idol. After a few narrow escapes, including a swarm of spiders and collapsing statues, Indy finds the idol and is about to exit, when he encounters a group of Nazis. Indy is confronted by their leader, Magnus Voller, and a Nazi aide bearing a pistol. Indy is forced to give up the Idol, but makes an escape when he distracts Voller. Indy then makes his way outside, and fights off some Nazi soldiers. He gets in a truck and chases after a plane that is taking off down the runway. After catching up to the plane, he disposes of the pilot and takes off. He is briefly pursued by some Nazi fighters, but escapes and heads back to the United States. Back in America, Indiana receives a letter from an old friend, Archie Tan. He explains that he has information about the disappearance of Indy's former college professor, Charles Kingston. Indy heads to San Francisco to talk to Archie, only to find that he and his granddaughter Suzie have been kidnapped. Indy tracks down Suzie, and learns from her the location of her grandfather's office. He also learns of an ancient artifact that Archie was guarding, the Jade Sphere. Indy heads to the office and finds a secret passageway, leading to some waiting thugs. He defeats the thugs and rides a rickety chair <b>lift</b> <b>down</b> into a subterranean chamber filled with old ships. The chairlift gets hit by a thug with a pistol but Indy manages to survive the ride down. He also survives when a mast falls down. He meets more thugs down below, but dispatches them. He then finds the Jade Sphere in a pile of cannonballs. A day later, Indy is standing outside a San Francisco office, when he spots Archie across the street being held by Magnus Voller and a Nazi agent. Voller orders Indy to hand over the Sphere, lest Professor Tan die. Indy appears to throw the Sphere to Voller before he and Archie flee, but when Magnus opens the packaging he discovers it is a worthless statue. Indy and Archie are chased by cars with machine gunners inside. Indy uses his pistol to shoot out the tires or engines of the cars (in the Nintendo DS version, this is replaced by a brawl on top of the cable car), and the trolley is stopped by Archie. After Archie tells Indy about the events that transpired, Indiana decides to head for Central America, where Kingston found the Sphere years ago.|$|E
