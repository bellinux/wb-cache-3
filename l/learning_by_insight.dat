40|$|Applying user-centered design methodology, we {{developed}} a usability training workshop for beginning developers which has remarkable impact on participants ’ attitudes towards the collaboration with nontechnical professions. Mainly through a simulation game we let course participants experience typical pitfalls of and opportunities for collaboration with non-technical professions in the development team, with the primary focus on User Interface Designers. Rather than teaching abstract high-level usability principles we induce <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>insight</b> and social forms of learning. 1 The Challenge: What & How to Teach Developers? Computer science curriculum studies are still slow to embrace user-centered development methods (Kaasinen & Clarke 1998). Consequently, much of the usability training and education for developers is left to corporate training organizations. In their specific context, corporate instructional designers need to address a set of typical problems {{in order to create}} effective usability training for developers. Because tasks related to usability are not the professional focus of a developer, the allotment of time and resources for training is limited. As usability and interaction design experts, we face the problem that boiling down our expertise to a 2 -day course runs the danger of resulting in commonplac...|$|E

30|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{organizational}} learning often looks to describe the underlying processes of how organizations learn, change, and adapt (Levitt and March 1988). Here, we provide a descriptive analysis of the functions of six SECs, which provides information of center roles that support horizontal and vertical integration. Understanding these areas contributes to organizational <b>learning,</b> <b>by</b> offering <b>insight</b> into the ways in which institutions might best utilize such a structure. As we describe, these centers engage institutions and departments in processes that foster change in undergraduate STEM education, which if sustained could lead to the adaptation of traditional norms. A center structure offers an institution the opportunity to be proactive in addressing challenges related to STEM education adding institution-level efforts to grass-root approaches at the department level, which may at times be more individualized or reactive in nature (Huber 1991).|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reflection and learning is evident. Reflection plays {{a significant role}} in <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> encouraging <b>insight</b> and complex learning. However, most students consider their work experiences at school as isolated and unrelated events. This work aims to investigate how to improve the students’ fluency in writing computer programs through reflection. A new deliverable, the Practice and Refactoring Log (“PAR Log”), is requested for each assignment in order to engage students in the process of making meaning from their experiences when completing their assignments. The PAR Log shows and justifies all changes through the assignment development cycle. Two student groups were required to develop and submit the PAR Log with all assignments, for credit. The performance of each group was compared to a similar group taught the same course by the same professor using the same assignments but without requesting the PAR Log. This paper presents the background, methodology, results, analysis and conclusion of this investigation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a rapid {{development}} of mobile applications (apps) for language learning purposes. An app namely VocBlast is designed to provide new learning experiences for engineering students to improve knowledge in technical vocabulary. The paper investigates the students’ viewpoints about the impact of using VocBlast to learn technical vocabulary between genders. 68 students from University Malaysia Pahang (UMP) were selected as samples using purposive random sampling method. A Likert-type questionnaire was employed to gauge students’ perceptions in using VocBlast. Using independent samples t-test, {{the results of the study}} revealed that there was no significant difference between genders on the impact of using VocBlast to learn technical vocabulary. This suggests that both genders equally perceived VocBlast as a useful vocabulary mobile app to learn technical vocabulary. In terms of learning pedagogy, the study extends the knowledge of mobile <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> providing <b>insights</b> on engineering students’ positive attitude in adopting vocabulary mobile app to learn technical vocabulary. ...|$|R
40|$|Metacognition fosters {{independent}} <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> providing personal <b>insight</b> into one's own thinking. Such awareness {{can lead}} to flexible and confident problem solving as well as feelings of self-efficacy and pride. This {{is especially important for}} students who encounter difficulty in school because they do not understand how to appraise and manage their own resources for learning. Too often, students develop debilitating expectations and behavior that undermine learning in school and inhibit transfer of effective learning strategies. We describe four general kinds of instruction that help students learn to think: metacognitive explanation, scaffolded instruction, cognitive coaching, and cooperative learning. Teachers can adapt and combine these methods to teach students how to think as they read, write, and compute in classrooms...|$|R
40|$|While {{research}} suggests that organizational capabilities are learned from experience, surprisingly {{little is known about}} how learning actually takes place over time. Using an inductive logic and indepth case studies, we explore this gap. The focal capability is internationalization and the setting is entrepreneurial firms. First, we show that organizations create a cognitive template to shape decision making. These cognitive templates consist of prototype rules and routines and are useful in seeding experience even though they are usually fundamentally flawed and thus lead to surprise. Second, we describe how attributions for surprise influence whether and how initial cognitive templates will be updated over time. Broadly, we contribute by complementing existing behavioral views of <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> combining <b>insights</b> from the cognitive sciences with rich field based data across multiple experiences to set forth an emergent construal based view. These findings have implications for the important, yet relatively unexplored, longitudinal interplay between cognition and behavior that {{lies at the heart of}} learning from experience and the growing cognitive view of organizations. ii Capabilities are a central concept within strategy and organizations literature (Eisenhardt & Martin...|$|R

In the proposed unified hybrid architecture, features from a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that processes the visual cues and features from a fully connected DNN that processes the audio signal are integrated using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{understandings of the}} experiential nature of leadership <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> drawing attention {{to the role of}} disruption as an organizing influence on women’s leadership <b>learning,</b> and <b>by</b> generating <b>insights</b> for leadership teaching. Examining leadership learning as an experiential process, we present the development of a typology intended to act as a summary of literature focusing on women’s experiences of leadership <b>learning.</b> Informed <b>by</b> our experiences of developing and using the typology as a teaching aid in two leadership development interventions we progress through a cycle of critical reflections to present a reflexive analysis of the typology’s performative effect and how it brings into being representations of women’s leadership.

The article considers how we, as educators, might forefront disrupting as a process in leadership <b>learning</b> interventions <b>by</b> re-positioning instruments, such as the typology, to problematize and deconstruct leadership <b>learning.</b> We conclude <b>by</b> proposing a reflexive process in the classroom that {{takes the form of a}} critical dialogue to enable educators and participants to de-construct their experience...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new multi-agent learning algorithm for stochastic games based on replicator dynamics from evo-lutionary game theory.

40|$|Background: Cross-fertilisation {{of ideas}} across industries, {{settings}} and contexts potentially improves <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> providing fresh <b>insights</b> into error pathways. Objectives and hypotheses: To investigate six cases of human error drawn from disasters in the space, shipping, aviation, mining, rail and nuclear industries, and to apprehend {{similarities and differences}} in the antecedents to errors, the way they manifest, {{the course of events}} and the way they are tackled. The extent to which human intervention can exacerbate the problems by introducing new errors, how the cases are resolved and the lessons learnt were examined.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{evidence}} of ice melt, sea level rise to + 5 - 9 meters, and extreme storms in the prior interglacial period that was less than 1 °C warmer than today. Human-made climate forcing is stronger and more rapid than paleo forcings, but much can be <b>learned</b> <b>by</b> combining <b>insights</b> from paleoclimate, climate modeling, and on-going observations. We argue that ice sheets {{in contact with the}} ocean are vulnerable to non-linear disintegration in response to ocean warming, and we posit that ice sheet mass loss can be approximated by a doubling time up to sea level rise of at least several meters. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield sea level rise of several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. Paleoclimate data reveal that subsurface ocean warming causes ice shelf melt and ice sheet discharge. Our climate model exposes amplifying feedbacks in the Southern Ocean that slow Antarctic bottom water formation and increase ocean temperature near ice shelf grounding lines, while cooling the surface ocean and increasing sea ice cover and water column stability. Ocean surface cooling, in the North Atlantic as well as the Southern Ocean, increases tropospheric horizontal temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, which drive more powerful storms. We focus attention on the Southern Ocean’s role in affecting atmospheric CO 2 amount, which in turn is a tight control knob on global climate. The millennia...|$|R

Our primary concern is to characterise more precisely how the context of the industrial process is constitutive of the meaning of graphs of data derived from this process. We draw on data {{from a variety of sources}} including ethnographic studies of workplaces and reflections on the design of prototype <b>learning</b> activities supplemented <b>by</b> <b>insights</b> obtained from trying out these activities with a range of employees. The core of this article addresses how different groups of employees react to graphs used as part of statistical process control, focussing in particular on the meanings they ascribe to mean, variation, target, specification, trend and scale as depicted in the graphs. Using the notion of boundary crossing we try to characterise a method that helps employees to communicate about graphs and come to data-informed decisions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a {{research}} study that examined aspects of the implementation of the Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma. Particular emphasis is given to the compulsory integration of Essential Skills Wales into the upper-secondary curriculum {{and the extent to which}} this contributes towards fulfilling the policy promise to offer a common learning Core to all students irrespective of their programmes of study and site of <b>learning.</b> <b>By</b> drawing <b>insights</b> from Bernstein’s sociology, I provide a principled analysis of the challenge of integrating these generic forms of everyday knowledge and make empirically visible their theoretically identified misrecognition and complexity. Based on a comparative twin case study (i. e. Communication and Application of Number) carried out across six considerably different educational sites, my findings uncover the peculiarities and challenges of pacing and evaluating the teaching and learning involved in Essential Skills Wales, and also point to administrative constraints, individual and institutional commitment to the demonstration of knowledge acquisition (i. e. certification). Students’ choices of subjects and qualifications (i. e. A level and BTECs), and the prioritisation of these, point to the power Higher Education institutions have to influence upper-secondary education. This is a separate strand of empirical work in the study, through which we see the possibility of a shift towards vocational qualifications under the overarching Welsh Baccalaureate Advanced Diploma. Based on this indication, I put forward the suggestion that, although the Welsh Baccalaureate is a notable attempt to change the relationship between specialised and everyday knowledge, and between academic (general) and vocational qualifications, it remains the latest form of the applied studies track in a tripartite upper-secondary system. To conclude, the Welsh Baccalaureate may contribute to the creation of a more subtle system of pedagogic differentiation, but upper-secondary education in Wales and the rest of the UK will most likely continue to be highly specialised, competitive and stratified...|$|R
40|$|Humans learn {{robust and}} {{efficient}} strategies for visual tasks through interaction with their environment. In contrast, most current computer vision systems {{have no such}} <b>learning</b> capabilities. Motivated <b>by</b> <b>insights</b> from psychology and neurobiology, I combine machine learning and computer vision techniques to develop algorithms for visual learning in open-ended tasks. Learning is incremental and makes only weak assumptions about the task environment. ^ I begin by introducing an infinite feature space that contains combinations of local edge and texture signatures not unlike those represented in the human visual cortex. Such features can express distinctions {{over a wide range}} of specificity or generality. The learning objective is to select a small number of highly useful features from this space in a task-driven manner. Features are <b>learned</b> <b>by</b> general-to-specific random sampling. This is illustrated on two different tasks, for which I give very similar learning algorithms based on the same principles and the same feature space. ^ The first system incrementally learns to discriminate visual scenes. Whenever it fails to recognize a scene, new features are sought that improve discrimination. Highly distinctive features are incorporated into dynamically updated Bayesian network classifiers. Even after all recognition errors have been eliminated, the system can continue to learn better features, resembling mechanisms underlying human visual expertise. This tends to improve classification accuracy on independent test images, while reducing the number of features used for recognition. ^ In the second task, the visual system learns to anticipate useful hand configurations for a haptically-guided dextrous robotic grasping system, much like humans do when they pre-shape their hand during a reach. Visual features are learned that correlate reliably with the orientation of the hand. A finger configuration is recommended based on the expected grasp quality achieved by each configuration. ^ The results demonstrate how a largely uncommitted visual system can adapt and specialize to solve particular visual tasks. Such visual learning systems have great potential in application scenarios that are hard to model in advance, e. g. autonomous robots operating in natural environments. Moreover, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of human visual <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> providing a computational model of task-driven development of feature detectors. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to knowledge about relationships between teaching and learning in school. The framework used in this research, variation theory, states that, to improve student learning, attention must be paid to what is being learned, the capability {{that is to be}} improved and the features (critical features) that it is necessary for the learner to discern. The studies reported here focus on the significance of critical features and are based on two ‘learning studies’ in mathematics, one of the density of rational numbers and one of the addition and subtraction of negative numbers. In a learning study, teachers work together with design, analysis and revision of their teaching of a single lesson with the aim of enhancing students’ <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> gaining <b>insight</b> about features that are assumed to be critical and enacting them in their teaching. The question answered in this research is whether the insight gained in the learning studies about critical features can be shared by other teachers and used to enhance other students’ learning. Two studies based on the previous studies were carried out together with a total of eight teachers and sixteen groups of students. Each teacher enacted two lessons with different conditions in terms of the critical features made use of. The lessons were video recorded and analysed with respect to which critical features were enacted in the lessons and what the students learned as indicated in pre and post tests. It is suggested that the critical features were transferable in two regards, in terms of student learning and in terms of a means of communication that could be shared among teachers. It was indicated that the critical features that were enacted in the teaching constrained what it was possible to experience in the classroom and what students learned. What was taught seemed to be reflected in what the students learned. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that it was not sufficient to simply name the critical features to the students; it seems that they must be discerned in order for learning to take place. It was found that the teachers made use of the critical features that were identified by other teachers in a learning study as a means to plan and teach lessons. This suggests that teachers can make use of the notion of critical features in their own teaching to enhance student learning...|$|R
