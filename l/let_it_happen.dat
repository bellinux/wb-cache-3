"Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth.

Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: In {{this study}} we aimed to better {{understand}} the occurrence and experience of flow in elite golf. As flow is more likely to occur during peak performances, and for elite athletes, our objectives were to: (i) identify golfers who achieved exceptional performances (e. g., winning a professional tournament), and (ii) explore if and how they experienced flow within that performance. Design: Mixed-method multiple case study. Method: Participants were 10 professional golfers (M age = 30; SD = 9. 9). Performance data and participant observations informed semi-structured interviews which took place as soon as possible after an excellent performance (M = 4 days). Data were interpreted using within-case then cross-case thematic analysis. Results: These golfers reported that they experienced two different psychological states during their excellent performances. These states were described as: (i) 2 ̆ 2 <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> 2 ̆ 2 which corresponded with the definition and description of flow; and (ii) 2 ̆ 2 making <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> 2 ̆ 2 which was more effortful and intense, involved a heightened awareness of the situation, and therefore differed to flow. Both states occurred through different processes, and 2 ̆ 2 <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> 2 ̆ 2 was a relatively gradual build-up of confidence, whereas 2 ̆ 2 making <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> 2 ̆ 2 was a more sudden stepping-up of concentration and effort. Conclusion: These findings are discussed in relation to existing literature on flow and related optimal psychological states in sport. Recommendations are then made for future research into the experience and occurrence of both states reported in this study...|$|R
