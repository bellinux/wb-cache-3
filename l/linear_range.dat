25|$|Young's modulus {{represents}} the factor of proportionality in Hooke's law, which relates {{the stress and}} the strain. However, Hooke's law is only valid under the assumption of an elastic and linear response. Any real material will eventually fail and break when stretched over a very large distance or with a very large force; however all solid materials exhibit nearly Hookean behavior for small enough strains or stresses. If the range over which Hooke's law is valid is large enough compared to the typical stress that one expects {{to apply to the}} material, the material is said to be linear. Otherwise (if the typical stress one would apply is outside the <b>linear</b> <b>range)</b> the material is said to be non-linear.|$|E
2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the <b>linear</b> <b>range</b> of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.|$|E

The separate determination of uric acid was found to produce three <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> from 100 nM to 3400 μM with a detection limit of 30 nM found to be possible.

The detection of ascorbic acid in the presence of uric acid was also explored over three <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> of ascorbic acid with a limit of detection of 80 nM. Last the simultaneous determination of both uric acid and ascorbic acid is investigated over the range 100 nM to 1000 μM where detection limits of 50 nM and 120 nM were obtained respectively. Analysis of uric acid in a growth tissue medium was found to be successful, confirming the applicability of the methodology to real matrices.

40|$|International audienceFour {{quantitative}} PCR (qPCR) assays {{were evaluated}} for quantitative detection of and fimbrial types F 4 and F 18 in pig feces. Standard curves {{were based on}} feces spiked with the respective reference strains. The detection limits from the spiking experiments were 10 bacteria/g feces for Bpilo-qPCR and Laws-qPCR, 10 CFU/g feces for F 4 -qPCR and F 18 -qPCR. The PCR efficiency for all four qPCR assays was between 0. 91 and 1. 01 with R above 0. 993. Standard curves, slopes and elevation, varied between assays and between measurements from pure DNA from reference strains and feces spiked with the respective strains. The <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> found for spiked faecal samples differed both from the <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> from pure culture of the reference strains and between the qPCR tests. The <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> were five log units for F 4 -qPCR, and Laws-qPCR, six log units for F 18 -qPCR and three log units for Bpilo-qPCR in spiked feces. When measured on pure DNA from the reference strains used in spiking experiments, the respective log ranges were; seven units for Bpilo-qPCR, Laws-qPCR and F 18 -qPCR and six log units for F 4 -qPCR. This shows the importance of using specific standard curves, were each pathogen is analyzed in the same matrix as sample DNA. The qPCRs were compared to traditional bacteriological diagnostic methods and {{found to be more}} sensitive than cultivation for and. The qPCR assay for was also more sensitive than the earlier used method due to improvements in DNA extraction. In addition, as samples were not analyzed for all four pathogen agents by traditional diagnostic methods, many samples were found positive for agents that were not expected on the basis of age and case history. The use of quantitative PCR tests for diagnosis of enteric diseases provides new possibilities for veterinary diagnostics. The parallel simultaneous analysis for several bacteria in multi-qPCR and the determination of the quantities of the infectious agents increases the information obtained from the samples and the chance for obtaining a relevant diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a high {{sensitive}} and selective hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) sensor was successfully constructed with Pt-Au bimetallic nanoparticles (Pt-Au NPs) /reduced graphene sheets (rGSs) hybrid films. Various molar ratios of Au to Pt and different electrodeposition conditions were evaluated {{to control the}} morphology and electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-Au bimetallic nanoparticles. Upon optimal conditions, wide <b>linear</b> <b>ranges</b> from 1 µM to 1. 78 mM and 1. 78 mM to 16. 8 mM were obtained, with a detection limit as low as 0. 31 µM. Besides, due to the synergetic effects of the bimetallic NPs and rGSs, the amperometric H 2 O 2 sensor could operate at a low potential of 0 V. Under this potential, not only common anodic interferences induced from ascorbic acid, uric acid and dopamine, but also the cathodic interference induced from endogenous O 2 could be effectively avoided. Furthermore, with rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12) as model, the proposed sensor had been successfully used in the detection of H 2 O 2 released from the cancer cells.
