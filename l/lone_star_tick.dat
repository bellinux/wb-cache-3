5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the <b>lone</b> <b>star</b> <b>tick</b> (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E

40|$|Although Borrelia theileri, {{the agent}} of bovine borreliosis, was {{described}} {{at the turn of}} the century (in 1903), its relationship with borreliae causing Lyme disease or relapsing fever remains undescribed. We tested the previously published hypothesis that spirochetes infecting <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks</b> (Amblyomma americanum) may comprise B. theileri by analyzing the 16 S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) and flagellin genes of these spirochetes. B. theileri, the Amblyomma agent, and B. miyamotoi formed a natural group or clade distinct from but most closely related to that of the relapsing fever spirochetes. B. theileri and the Amblyomma agent were 97 and 98 % similar at the nucleotide level within the analyzed portions of the 16 S rDNA and the flagellin gene respectively, suggesting a recent divergence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks</b> (Amblyomma americanum) {{have been}} {{suggested}} as a vector of the agent of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) in the USA, based on associations with an infection manifesting mainly as erythema migrans. In laboratory experiments, however, they failed to transmit B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. METHODS: In this study, carried out from 1994 to 1996, we determined the seroprevalences of B. burgdorferi (1. 2 %), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (7 %), E. phagocytophila (0 %), Rickettsia rickettsii (0 %), R. typhi (0 %), Coxiella burneti (0 %), Francisella tularensis (0 %), and Babesia microti (0 %) by standard serological methods for 325 residents (97 % of the total population) of Gibson Island, coastal Maryland, USA, where 15 % of the residents reported having had Lyme disease within a recent 5 -year span. FINDINGS: Of the 167 seronegative individuals who were followed up prospectively for 235 person-years of observation, only 2 (0. 85 %) seroconverted for B. burgdorferi. Of 1556 ticks submitted from residents, 95 % were identified as <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> ticks; only 3 % were deer ticks (Ixodes dammini), the main American vector of Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi s. s. infected 20 % of host-seeking immature deer ticks, and borreliae ("B. lonestari") were detected in 1 - 2 % of <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks.</b> Erythema migrans was noted in 65 % of self-reports of Lyme disease, but many such reports indicated that the rash was present while the tick was still attached, suggesting {{a reaction to the}} bite itself rather than true Lyme disease. Sera from individuals reporting Lyme disease generally failed to react to B. burgdorferi or any other pathogen antigens. CONCLUSION: The residents of Gibson Island had an exaggerated perception of the risk of Lyme disease because they were intensely infested with an aggressively human-biting and irritating nonvector tick. In addition, a Lyme disease mimic of undescribed etiology (named Masters' disease) seems to be associated with <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks,</b> and may confound Lyme disease surveillance. The epidemiological and entomological approach used in this study might fruitfully be applied wherever newly emergent tickborne zoonoses have been discovered...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve {{understanding}} of several factors related to the ecology and environmental risk of Borrelia infection in northern Florida. Small mammals and host-seeking adult ticks were collected at several sites, and specimens were tested for the presence of Borrelia species, primarily by PCR amplification. Tissues from some vertebrates and ticks were initially cultured in BSK-H medium to isolate spirochetes, but none were recovered. However, comparison of partial flagellin (flaB), 66 -kDa protein (p 66), and outer surface protein A (ospA) gene sequences from DNAs amplified from small mammals and ticks confirmed the presence of several Borrelia species. Borrelia lonestari DNA was detected among <b>lone</b> <b>star</b> <b>ticks</b> (Amblyomma americanum) at four sites. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains were detected in all small mammal species tested and in A. americanum, Ixodes affinis, and Ixodes scapularis ticks. Borrelia bissettii was found in a cotton mouse and cotton rats and in I. affinis ticks. The study findings extend the known geographic distributions of B. lonestari in A. americanum and of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in A. americanum, I. affinis, I. scapularis, and small mammals to new sites in Florida. The presence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains in host-seeking <b>lone</b> <b>star</b> <b>ticks</b> at two sites in Florida suggests that A. americanum should still be considered a possible vector of B. burgdorferi sensu lato...|$|R

40|$|Infestation {{of cattle}} by <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks,</b> Amblyomma americanum, leads to damage of hides {{intended}} for leather, weight loss, infertility, and potentially death of cattle, which contribute to production losses for farmers. Public concerns regarding chemical residues {{in food and}} the environment necessitate development of chemical-free alternative tick controls, such as breeding for tick-resistant phenotypes and developing anti-tick vaccines. Thus, {{the goal of this}} study was elucidation of mechanisms that mediate immune responses in cattle infested with A. americanum using gene expression techniques. Methods for isolation of total RNA from bovine tick bite-site biopsies and blood leukocytes were optimized to provide RNA suitable for gene expression studies. Tick bite-site biopsies (6 mm) and blood leukocytes were collected from a total of 13 calves (N= 6, Group 4 and N= 7, Group 5 calves) during experimental tick infestations to determine A. americanum tick-susceptible and -resistant phenotypes. Microarray experiments compared gene expression in tick bite-sites from tick-susceptible, moderately tick-resistant, and highly tick-resistant calves. A total of 35 genes were profiled in tick bite-site biopsies and 12 genes were evaluated in blood leukocytes via gene-specific qRT-PCR assays, and analyzed for each phenotype and for each group of calves as a whole. Analysis of microarray data revealed differential expression of IL- 1 R-mediators among the three cattle phenotypes. Expression profiles generated by qRT-PCR for TLR-mediating genes such as TLR 2, TLR 4, CD 14, and MyD 88 suggest that a MyD 88 -dependent signaling pathway may mediate the development of acquired immunity in cattle infested with <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> <b>ticks.</b> Additionally, increased expression for IL 12, IFNgamma, and TNFalpha suggests that a Th 1 -type cell-mediated reaction may be activated, whereas increased expression of IL 6, IL 10, and IGHG 1 supports the involvement of a Th 2 -type humoral-mediated response at tick bite-sites in cattle infested with at A. americanum. Regression analyses identified strong correlations between factors involved in pattern recognition in tick bite-site biopsies, including associations between TLR 4 and IL 1 alpha, and between IL 1 alpha and IL 1 RN. In conclusion, this dissertation reports optimal methodology for gene expression studies in tick-infested cattle and provides preliminary data concerning the underlying mechanisms associated with the immune response in <b>Lone</b> <b>Star</b> tick-infested cattle...|$|R
40|$|TO THE EDITOR: Smith {{and colleagues}} (1) {{provided}} much-needed {{information about the}} characteristics of erythema migrans caused by Borrelia burgdorferi that will grow in Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly cul-ture.

50|$|The <b>lone</b> <b>star</b> <b>tick</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across the East, Southeast, and Midwest United States. It lives in wooded areas, particularly in second-growth forests with thick underbrush, where white-tailed deer (the primary host of mature ticks) reside. Lone star ticks {{can also be}} found in ecotonal areas (transition zones between different biomes) such as those between forest and grassland ecosystems. The <b>lone</b> <b>star</b> <b>tick</b> utilizes thick underbrush or high grass to attach to its host by way of questing. Questing is an activity in which, in response to stimuli from biochemicals such as carbon dioxide or heat and vibration from movement, the tick climbs up a blade of grass or to the edges of leaves and stretches its front legs forward, mounting the passing host as it brushes against the tick's legs. Once attached to its host, the tick is able to move around and select a preferred feeding site.|$|E
