5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes {{that have become}} quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. <b>Laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding employs a highly focused <b>laser</b> <b>beam,</b> while electron beam welding is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E

Translation of the focused <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.|$|E

40|$|We {{find the}} {{solution}} of the Dirac equation for two plane waves (<b>laser</b> <b>beams)</b> and we determine the modified Compton formula for the scattering of two photons on an alectron. The practical meaning of the two <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> is, that two <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> impinging on a targed which is constituted from material {{in the form of a}} foam, can replace 100 - 200 <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> impinging on a normal targed. It means that the nuclear fusion with two <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> is realistic in combination with the nuclear reactor such as ITER. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to obtain power-balanced <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> for doing quantum-state {{manipulation}} experiments with phase-stable double optical lattices. Double optical lattices are constructed using four pairs of overlapped <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> with different frequency. Our optical scheme provides a phase stability between the optical lattices of 5 mrad/s and <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> with a very clean polarisation state resulting in a power imbalance in the individual <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> of less than 1 %.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>beams</b> are wave-like optical disturbances. They are {{characterized}} by a dominant direction of propagation and a finite extent transverse to the direction of propagation. Many characteristics of <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> {{can be described in}} terms of a scalar function multiplied by a constant vector, which can be real (for linear polarization) or complex (for elliptical polarization). The scalar function is a solution to the paraxial scalar wave equation. This scalar description, however, fails to describe the polarization and focusing characteristics of <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> correctly. For a correct accounting of these characteristics, the electric and magnetic fields associated with <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> must satisfy not only the wave equation but also the Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations. We show that, due to the finite transverse size of <b>laser</b> <b>beams,</b> Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations require that the electric field (as well as the magnetic field) associated with <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> will possess all three nonzero Cartesian components even in free space. Each component can be expressed in terms of the scalar solutions of the paraxial wave equation. We construct three-component solutions giving expressions for the dominant, cross, and longitudinal-polarization components, for linearly polarized Hermite-Gauss and Laguerre-Gauss beams. Such a description correctly accounts for focusing as well as polarization properties of <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> We demonstrate the validity of this description experimentally by generating two families of <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> and verify the existence of cross-polarization field components and their evolution in propagation. We generate experimental higher-order Hermite-Gauss <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> intracavity via a pair of crossed fibers. Laguerre-Gauss <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> were generated by converting Hermite-Gauss beams into Laguerre-Gauss beams of the same order by using a pair of cylindrical lenses to manipulate Guoy phase of the beams. Intensity profiles of the dominant and cross-polarization components of linearly polarized Hermite-Gauss and Laguerre-Gauss beams are measured and their evolution as the beam propagates away from its focal region was studied. The transverse profiles of the cross-polarization components of these beams undergo an evolution with propagation. The theoretically expected and experimentally observed intensity profiles are in reasonable agreement confirming the field structure of <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> derived in this thesis...|$|R

By analyzing the reflected <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> for Doppler shifts, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated. The thermal structure, diurnal/semi-diurnal tides, and seasonal variations in the mesopause region may thus be studied. This is a valuable faculty for meteorologists and climatologists, as these properties can be significant.|$|E

Other than that, it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions, just with Japanese subtitles.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a vehicle {{collision avoidance system}} using <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> First, our system estimates the position in which the vehicle will be 1 second later, and projects it onto the road surface by <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> Second, our system captures positions of the each <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> using a special camera installed in the vehicle. And the system calculates {{the difference between the}} positions on normal roads and that of on abnormal roads like an obstacle on the road. By using our system, we are able to identify bumps, hollows and obstacles on the road surface with a high accuracy. Additionally, our system is able to detect the <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> of other vehicles, so by detecting the <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> of other vehicles, we are able to judge whether or not the vehicle will collide, even if the incoming vehicle is not visible at a blind corner. We assert that our system is effective in many situations, such as head-on encounters at a blind corner, merging roads and changing lanes. In order to evaluate the validity of our system, we have evaluated the detection rate of the <b>laser</b> <b>beams,</b> the obstacle detection rate and the collision avoidance rate with other vehicles. Higher rate of success in our tests obtained, even if environments with high luminosity that are difficult to detect <b>laser</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} several unique properties, {{propagation}} invariant <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> (PILBs) are playing {{an increasingly important}} role in several photonics applications. This paper describes some practical aspects of producing propagation invariant <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> with different symmetries and structured light field distributions. Both intra-cavity and extra-cavity schemes can be employed. In the case of extra-cavity implementations, we show several practical layouts of anamorphic optical systems (AOSs) for shaping the propagation-invariant <b>laser</b> <b>beams</b> based on the size and waist locations of the input <b>laser</b> <b>beams.</b> We also establish matrix equations required to quantify the influence of input PILBs lateral and angular misalignments {{with respect to the}} AOSs onto the spatial characteristics of the produced output PILBs, and present examples of the resulting PILBs affected by the input PILBs misalignments...|$|R

However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms out to show a shack camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
5|$|If a <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> is swept quickly {{across a}} distant object, the {{spot of light}} can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of the spot is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E

5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E

He derides Cortex for failing to retrieve the crystals and gems, {{both of which are}} vast sources of world energy. However, feeling generous after being freed from prison, Uka Uka recruits Doctor Nefarious Tropy to join him and Cortex in their latest plan. Tropy has created the Time-Twisting Machine, a time machine that allows the villains to travel through time to find more gems and crystals scattered across the timeline.|$|E

5|$|Identical to its {{predecessor}} however, {{the core of}} the gameplay is centred on the player's ability to make Robbit jump and shoot projectiles at enemies. Robbit can jump up to three times (as indicated by the new interface), allowing him to reach extreme heights in the game. As with the first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 introduced new in-game power ups and weapons such as a powerful <b>laser</b> <b>beam,</b> missiles and trip mines. In addition to the new weapons, the player can find and use the older weapons in form of fireworks to deal massive damage to enemies. Other weapons include cherry bombs, rockets and Roman candles. The player still has the ability to shoot low-powered projectiles where a target reticle is centred {{in the middle of the}} screen.|$|E
5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on the player's ability to make Robbit jump. Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights. Unlike other platform games that continue to face horizontally when the player jumps, in Jumping Flash! the camera tilts downwards when a double-jump or triple-jump is performed to allow the player to see Robbit's shadow and easily plan a landing spot. The player has the ability to shoot a low-powered <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> at a target indicator {{in the middle of the}} screen. The player can find and use fireworks for Robbit to damage enemies.

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|Mission {{objectives}} vary {{in quantity}} and length {{depending on the}} difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings also affect enemy accuracy and damage, {{and the availability of}} the game's optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a <b>laser</b> <b>beam</b> to open locks. In some missions, the player can also use night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E
