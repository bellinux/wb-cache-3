Rarely built in modern times because of their relatively short lifespan and the limited height to which they can be built, timber dams must be kept constantly wet in order to maintain their water retention properties and limit deterioration by rot, similar to a barrel. The locations where timber dams are most economical to build are those where timber is plentiful, cement is costly or difficult to transport, and either a <b>low</b> <b>head</b> diversion dam is required or longevity is not an issue. Timber dams were once numerous, especially in the North American West, but most have failed, been hidden under earth embankments, or been replaced with entirely new structures.

40|$|For centuries mankind {{have used}} water wheels {{as a source}} of {{mechanical}} power for mills, weaving factories and machine workshops. By the time the theories and manufacturing methods of water wheels improved; the most developed technology took a significant leap into the turbines {{at the end of the}} Nineteenth century and water wheels development ceased.

The present work illustrates some theoretical, experimental and numerical results related to a breastshot and an overshot water wheel.
