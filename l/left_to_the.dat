5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation, {{there was also}} a heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so {{the reader is}} forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience's imagination.|$|E

5|$|In early Asomtavruli, {{the letters}} are of equal height.

5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

5|$|Teller {{later learned}} of Oppenheimer's {{solicitation}} {{and his role}} in the Interim Committee's decision to drop the bombs, having secretly endorsed an immediate military use of the new weapons. This was contrary to the impression that Teller had received when he had personally asked Oppenheimer about the Szilard petition: that the nation's fate should be <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensible politicians in Washington. Following Teller's discovery of this, his relationship with his advisor began to deteriorate.|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family life had been <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states. Because of this, Santoskys direct intervention into the affairs of state interests was seen as contrary to United States v. Yazell, which held that federal courts should only overturn state statutes when those statutes cannot adequately serve a clear and substantial federal interest.|$|E
5|$|United {{were without}} first-choice central midfielders Keane and Scholes, as both were {{suspended}} {{after receiving a}} second yellow card in the competition. Ferguson reorganised the team, with Blomqvist and Butt replacing Keane and Scholes, Beckham moving from right-wing to centre-midfield and Giggs moving from the <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right wing. United lined up in their normal 4–4–2 formation. This was the final match for Peter Schmeichel, who captained the team.|$|E

5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right side of the heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E

5|$|Allcroft's {{descendants}} {{fell into}} financial difficulties {{during the early}} 20th century, however, and it became increasingly {{difficult for them to}} cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation, {{there was also}} a heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E

5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the {{creation}} of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS), Austria-Hungary transferred the vessels of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to the new nation. The Kingdom of Italy was unhappy with this, and convinced the Allies to share the Austro-Hungarian ships among the victorious powers. As a result, the only modern sea-going vessels <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> KSCS were 12 torpedo boats, and they had to build their naval forces almost from scratch.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{important}} win on December 15, 1899, Connolly defeated William [...] "Kid" [...] McPartland in a twenty-five round points decision, {{again at the}} Broadway Athletic Club in Brooklyn. Both boxers fought at a weight near 138, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lightweight limit. Connolly took the initiative from the early fighting scoring points with <b>lefts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body, and rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head of McPartland. McPartland may have landed heavier blows particularly <b>lefts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chest and face, but Connolly landed more often, thus winning on points. Connolly never seemed in danger of a knockdown and had McPartland at a safe distance. In 1902, McPartland would contend unsuccessfully for the Lightweight Championship of the World against the great Joe Gans.|$|R
