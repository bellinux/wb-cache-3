40|$|The use {{of local}} phoneme {{posterior}} probabilities has been increasingly explored for improving speech recognition systems. Hybrid hidden Markov model / {{artificial neural network}} (HMM/ANN) and Tandem are the most successful examples of such systems. In this thesis, we present a principled framework for enhancing the estimation of local posteriors, by integrating phonetic and lexical knowledge, as well as long contextual information. This framework allows for hierarchical estimation, integration and use of local posteriors from the phoneme up to the word level. We propose two approaches for enhancing the posteriors. In the first approach, phoneme posteriors estimated with an ANN (particularly multi-layer Perceptron – MLP) are used as emission probabilities in HMM forward-backward recursions. This yields new enhanced posterior estimates integrating HMM topological constraints (encoding specific phonetic and lexical knowledge), and long context. In the second approach, a temporal context of the regular MLP posteriors is post-processed by a secondary MLP, in order to <b>learn</b> <b>inter</b> and intra dependencies among the phoneme posteriors. The learned knowledge is integrated in the posterior estimation during the inference (forward pass) of the second MLP, resulting in enhanced posteriors. The use of resulting local enhanced posteriors is investigated {{in a wide range}} of posterior based speech recognition systems (e. g. Tandem and hybrid HMM/ANN), as a replacement or in combination with the regular MLP posteriors. The enhanced posteriors consistently outperform the regular posteriors in different applications over small and large vocabulary databases...|$|E

The findings show that channels of technological transfer such as export, FDI and technological alliances, influence the R&D activity of enterprises positively. In particular, technological alliances constitute the most important source of <b>learning</b> <b>inter</b> enterprises. The results highlight the complementarity between trade, FDI and technological alliances. On the other hand, we have verified that an improvement in the qualification level of the labour force increases the technological effort of enterprises. Moreover, we focus on positive interactions of the human capital with the different channels of technological transfer. We found that domestic R&D activity is more sensitive to the interaction between human capital and FDI. Our empiric analysis specified that the engagement in the Program of Stake to Level and the achievement of certification play an important role in developing the technological absorptive capacity of Tunisian enterprises.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{works in}} Computer Science, Neurosciences, Education, and Psychology {{have shown that}} {{emotions}} {{play an important role}} in learning. Learner’s cognitive ability depends on his emotions. We will point out the role of emotions in learning, distinguishing the different types and models of emotions which have been considered until now. We will address an important issue con-cerning the different means to detect emotions and introduce recent approaches to measure brain activity using Electroencephalograms (EEG). Knowing the influ-ence of emotional events on learning it becomes important to induce specific emo-tions so that the learner can be in a more adequate state for better learning or memorization. To this end, we will introduce the main components of an emotion-ally intelligent tutoring system able to recognize, interpret and influence learner’s emotions. We will talk about specific virtual agents that can influence learner’s emotions to motivate and encourage him and involve a more cooperative work, particularly in narrative learning environments. Pushing further this paradigm, we will present the advantages and perspectives of subliminal <b>learning</b> which <b>inter...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{shift in}} {{emphasis}} {{away from the}} processes involved in teaching languages towards the processes involved in learning languages in formal educational contexts has brought {{about one of the}} most remarkable changes to the language classroom since the communicative approach. The elaboration of the role `learner? in this paradigm frequently involves discussion of autonomy in language learning, although perhaps not in so many words. A range of terms are employed in the discourse as practitioners and researchers attempt to depict and unpick the involvement and responsibility of the learner in <b>learning,</b> including, <b>inter</b> alia, agency (van Lier, 2010; Swain, 2007), selfdetermination (Deci & Ryan, 2000; see also Sisamakis, 2006 and Carson, 2007 with reference to foreign language learning), self-regulation (Pintrich & de Groot, 1990), learner-centredness (Tudor, 1996), learner engagement (van Lier, 1996; Ohta, 2001; Corno & Mandinach, 1983) and learner empowerment (Frymier et al., 1996; Schrodt et al., 2008).

40|$|This report {{provides}} an analysis {{and evaluation of}} the CCATCH – Beaulieu to Calshot Pathfinder project; the aim being to draw out the lessons learned and areas of best practice so as to inform the wider CCATCH - the Solent project, {{as well as the}} Interreg IVa funded CC 2150 and Beyond. The methods employed to gather data included interviewing the key stakeholders involved in the process as well as the engagement consultants who facilitated it. This was supplemented by carrying out a public survey to gauge the project awareness and to interview the project managers of several other coastal adaptation projects, so as to enable a comparison with the work being carried out elsewhere. The results are generally very supportive of the approach taken and the tools and techniques employed during the Pathfinder, though highlighting with some clear room for improvement and consideration. On the basis that the selection of the area and the need for the project has already been established, the lessons <b>learned</b> relate <b>inter</b> alia to the application of stakeholder engagement and the commitment to implement identifiable actions; where engagement relates to its use both {{at the outset of the}} project and as a part of a developed on-going network beyond the lifetime of the funding. Commitment to following through with specific actions identified as part of the Adaptation Plan could then be implemented. In order to agree the Plan, and identify actions, it was clear that there was a need for specialist skills, and that these had been available for the Pathfinder. However, further consideration should be given to the use and interaction of consultants so as to their maximise effectiveness. In relation to tools and techniques, many of those employed were innovative, but not all were well attended. Local specificity means that the activities selected should best reflect the nature of the area. However, maximising the use of high quality visual tools as a way of communicating scientific and technical information is recommended. One of the key areas identified as a lesson learned relates to the Pathfinder’s communication and publicity, with the evaluation identifying scope for improvement in the project website, and use of local newspapers, TV and radio. Employing a more developed communication strategy should certainly help with public awareness as well as lead to greater engagement with some of the activities. ...|$|R
40|$|The 21 st {{century is}} {{commonly}} referred to as the computer age. This term characterises the important place computers have in our everyday lives and the increasingly crucial role they will play in the future, determining the way we work, play, learn and teach. Computers are also slowly – but surely – finding their way into South African classrooms. In Gauteng, for example, the number of schools equipped with computers have grown from 24 % in 1998 to 89 % in 2003. This increase can be attributed directly to the concerted efforts of the National Education Department and other non-governmental organisations to close the digital divide between South Africa {{and the rest of the}} world. Apart from launching various projects to supply schools with computers, the National Education Department has further committed itself to the implementation of E-learning in a Draft White Paper on E-Learning in September 2003. The integration of computers in learning and teaching has, thus, now become a reality. This situation neccesitates much needed empirical research on how the use of computers can be effectively integrated into the teaching and <b>learning</b> of, <b>inter</b> alia, languages. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of computers in teaching Afrikaans as an Additional Language. To do this, an extensive literature study has been undertaken to investigate international best practices of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Subsequently, an empirical study – in the form of a quasi-experiment – was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of CALL in the teaching and learning of Afrikaans as an Additional Language, by comparing it with conventional language teaching methods. A longitudinal study was done with two groups of Grade 9 learners at the Bishops Diocesian College in Cape Town and the development of their language skills was assessed by using a standardised language proficiency test (EVAT – Evaluering van Afrikaans Taalvaardigheid) as pre and post tests. The literature review indicates that computers possess certain unique characteristics that can enhance the language learning process. The results of the empirical study, furthermore, indicates that computers can be used in the teaching and learning of Afrikaans as an Additional Language and in such a way that learners’ language skills can develop in a similar way to using conventional language teaching. It further shows that learners can improve certain language skills better when using computers. This study also suggests that these results could be used as guidelines for the integration of computers in the teaching and learning of Afrikaans as an Additional Language. Prof. A. E. Coetze...|$|R
40|$|Quando o tema é formação inicial de professores para o Ensino Fundamental I, o primeiro elemento que surge como foco de pesquisa é o papel da polivalência no exercício profissional. Essa perspectiva tem a intenção de garantir na formação a compreensão de uma pedagogia global que de um lado atenda às necessidades e aos interesses dos alunos e de outro {{incentive}} o professor a perceber os conhecimentos de maneira integral e articulada, resultando assim um docente polivalente. Existe uma tensão que caracteriza essa polivalência: o professor é visto como profissional que domina o conhecimento dos diferentes componentes curriculares e, ao mesmo tempo, que atua no desenvolvimento do aluno sob sua responsabilidade. Assim, a formação entende que esse papel deve ser exercido por um único profissional que atenda a essas especificidades. Trata-se de uma ação possível, desde que subsidiada por uma visão crítica do currículo e um ensino voltado para a inter e transdisciplinaridade. Este trabalho, por meio de pesquisa documental e bibliográfica, identificou que a polivalência nos anos iniciais deve ser entendida como competências gerais capazes de formar seres humanos em todas as suas dimensões; porém, é necessário não trata-la como sinônimo de profissional multitarefa, ou seja, aquele que cumpre muitas funções, sem articulá-las. Esse professor deve, pois, adotar uma ação interdisciplinar articulada a diversos conhecimentos, bem como compreender o desenvolvimento e a aprendizagem de seus alunos, dos pontos de vista social, cognitivo e emocional. Em suma, trata-se do professor polivalente se transformando em profissional interdisciplinarWhen {{the theme}} is teachers initial training to the Basic Educacion, the first element that emerges as a research focus {{is the role of}} polyvalence in the professional exercise. This perspective has the intention to ensure in its formation the comprehension of a global pedagogy that in one side meets the students needs and interests and in the other side encourages the teacher to realize the knowledges comprehensively and articulated, thus resulting a polyvalent teacher. There is a tension that characterizes this polyvalency: the teacher is seen as a professional that masters the knowledge of different curricular components and at the same time, acts in the student development under his responsibility. Therefore, the formation understands that this role must be to exercised by only a professional who meets these specificities. It regards a possible action since subsidized by criticizes view of the curriculum and an oriented <b>learning</b> to the <b>inter</b> and transdisciplinary. In this assignment, by a documentary research and bibliographic, has been identified that the polyvalency in the early years must be understood as a general skills able to form humam being in all dimensions; however, it is necessary not to treat as a mult task professional synonymous, in other words, that one fulfills many functions, without articulate them. This teacher must then adopt an interdisciplinary articulated action in many knowledge, as well as to understand the development and the learning of his student, from the social, cognitive and emotional point of view.

40|$|Adolescence is a {{turbulent}} {{time and a}} critical transformational phase during which major physical, emotional, cognitive and social shifts occur. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore ways in which female adolescents can acquire anger management skills. The study proposes that emotional competency is cultivated as a result of the neurological plasticity of the brain and by applying learning material based on the work of scholars in the fields of neuroscience and Applied Drama. Adolescence is an opportune time for girls to learn emotional competency skills as the incomplete development of the prefrontal area of the brain makes them more inclined to risk taking and less aware of logical thinking processes. The study indicates that anger floods the body with secretions like cortisol and adrenaline, blocking logical thinking. Angry incidences can have destructive consequences for relationships. The empirical study includes discussions of training levels for anger management, such as the identification of anger-related emotions and anger styles, understanding anger, and curbing angry expressions through assertive communication. As anger management is a practical aptitude, the empirical study applied selected Process Drama conventions (as modes of Applied Drama), specifically role play, tableaux, Mantle of the Expert and dramatized poetry. The benefit of these conventions lies in the facility with which they can alternate between dual modes of engagement and learning content. Process Drama launches the workshops’ participants into a make-believe world in which they can identify with a situation from the inside out while simultaneously observing the situation from the outside in, a phenomenon called metaxis. The female adolescent, while protective of her social relationships, can safely enter a fictitious world and face the problems raised by anger without jeopardizing her privacy or dealing with real-life emotions. The convention of dramatized poetry enabled creative expression as the participants wrote their own poems to personalize their insight into their need for anger management. While the methodology was being practised, it was also assessed. As the outcomes of the learning objectives were the participants’ responsibility, I could assess during the activities if they accommodated learning objectives in their biography. In this study the participants were, for example, not able to fully utilize the skill of assertive communication. The integrity of the methodology of Process Drama for girls was affirmed when it was successfully combined with the principles of brain-based learning. The literature review and the outcomes of the empirical study confirmed that Process Drama adheres to the principles of brain-based <b>learning</b> which is, <b>inter</b> alia, physiological, social and emotional, and occurs in tandem with the developmental phase of the participant. The research study is the culmination of various disciplines and an endeavour to present a multimodal anger management programme that incorporates the adolescent female on a cognitive, emotional and physical level, and in a sound collaborative environment.
