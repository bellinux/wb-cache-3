5000|$|All {{inscriptions}} of the altarpiece {{were written}} in Latin. The font of the dedicatory inscription is overall classified as Gothic capitalis. Modern commentators agree that the inscriptions were produced by hammering individual letter punches one by one into the silver plate. Evidence for this typographic method {{can be derived from}} the observation that the letterforms comply with the criterion of type identity according to which every letter imprint must come from one and the same <b>letter</b> <b>punch.</b> The type identity is inter alia evident in the repeated occurrence of the faulty letter [...] "R" [...] throughout the text that indicates a damaged <b>letter</b> <b>punch.</b> The high relief letters stand proud in rectangular recesses created by the bases of the low relief punches; the fine edges between these recesses are a further indication of the sequential use of individual letter punches. A number of letters which are not properly aligned to their baseline provide additional evidence that the artisan worked with separate punches.|$|E
5000|$|Punchcutting: If the glyph design {{includes}} {{enclosed spaces}} (counters) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief (cameo) onto {{the end of}} a rectangular bar of mild steel using a specialized engraving tool called a graver. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching (tempering), or exposure to a cyanide solution (case hardening). The counterpunch is then struck against {{the end of a}} similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces (intaglio). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive smoke proofs; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished <b>letter</b> <b>punch</b> is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} {{panel of}} type and design experts gathered at Sheridan on September 21, 2015 {{to talk about}} the form of typography and how its history contributes to its future. The panelists were Matthew Carter, Rod McDonald, Allan Haley and Charles Nix of Monotype. The discussion followed an exhibition and world premiere screening of a digitized and expanded film by Carl Dair, who designed Cartier – Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface. The film, Carl Dair at Enschedé: The Last Days of Metal Type features a digitized version of the 1957 silent film shot by Dair while studying in Holland with one of the last great European <b>letter</b> <b>punch</b> cutters, Paul Rädisch. It begins with a prologue by Canadian type designer Rod McDonald, who in 1998, updated and expanded Dair 2 ̆ 7 s Cartier typeface for digital technology. The film is narrated by Matthew Carter, one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading typeface designers who also studied with Rädisch. The film was co-produced by Sheridan College and Massey College at the University of Toronto. The exhibit in the Sheridan Art Gallery, opened prior to the film screening, included artifacts such as didactic panels, photographs, sketches, tools, letters and books. It told the story of Carl Dair 2 ̆ 7 s quest to create Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface as part of the 1967 centennial as well as Rod McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s redesign. The panel discussion was part of Sheridan’s Creative Campus Series. [URL]...|$|E

5000|$|As {{a cutting}} edge device of their time, Flexowriters, {{especially}} some of the specialized types like typesetters, were quite costly. They were made for extreme durability. There were porous bronze bearings, many hardened steel parts, very strong springs, and a substantial AC motor to move all the parts. Most parts are made of heavy gauge steel. The housing and most removable covers were die castings. While the final Singer models did make some use of plastics, even they are quite heavy compared to other electric typewriters of their time. As a result, the platen carriage is very heavy, and when the [...] "Carriage return" [...] key is pressed, the carriage moves with about 20 pounds of force and enough momentum to injure a careless operator.

For example, the ααβ robot fires laser beams, while αβα attacks with a sword. The robot can take damage from enemies and if it sustains too much, it will eventually be destroyed. If the player already has a robotic companion and picks up a new combination of letters, the new robot will replace the previous one. However, if the player picks up the same combination twice in a row while still maintaining the robot, the player character will combine with the robot and will have more powerful attacks for a limited period before reverting to his standard form.|$|R

Finding a story-book, my cousin sat down on the window seat behind the curtain and became absorbed--so much absorbed that she failed to notice the entrance of my father; failed to hear his--"Ha! a <b>letter</b> from <b>Punch</b> at last!"--and was only roused to outward events by the crash which ensued when my father smote the table with his fist and exclaimed, [...] "im-possible!"

40|$|THE INFLUENCE OF GREEK AND LATIN ACCENTUATION ON LITHU­ANIAN ACCENT NOTATION Summary The accent {{signs of}} most {{alphabetic}} languages ultimately derive from Greek signs devised in the 3 rd century BC. This 'Alexandrine' system of accent notation {{was transformed into}} the now current ‘Byzantine’ system for Greek around 400 AD. The Greek circumflex, originally written {{in the form of}} an arc like an inverted breve, was graphically transformed into its present wavy shape (identical to the Latin tilde) some time in the Middle Ages. In 16 th century Europe (not in the 17 th century, as was earlier believed) an artificial, so-called ‘Henninian’, accentuation system of Greek arose. In consequence, Greek accent signs were often treated as meaningless diacritics, useful only for the distinction of otherwise homonymous word forms. A similar use of distinctive (phonetically meaningless) accents was created in the Latin script, where it was current from the late 16 th to the late 18 th century. The Lithuanian accentuation of Daniel Klein follows closely this humanist Graeco-Latin usage of distinctive diacritics. The same tendency is observed in other Lithuanian writings of the time as well. The genitive singular endings -ôs / -ês and genitive plural ending -û were therefore more or less regularly marked with a circumflex sign, which had, at least in printed texts, the Latin angled (not the Greek tilde-like) shape. Thus the written circumflex sign, be it by incidence or, as Kurschat suggests, as a result of the intuitive insight of old Lithuanian grammarians, coincided with the actual Lithuanian circumflex intonation; accordingly the acute sign came to denote the Lithuanian acute intonation. The actual Lithuanian accents were, however, greatly distorted in writing by formally applying Greek accentuation rules. The accent notation of the 1737 grammar Universitas Lingvarum Litvaniae, known for its exact adherence to the actual Lithuanian syllable intonations rather than to formally applied Greek rules, is nevertheless consistent with this Graeco-Latin tradition in its choice of the circumflex sign to mark the Lithuanian circumflex accent. In the printed 1737 book the accent notation appears, however, somewhat awkward – an accentless letter of a different typeface is substituted for a letter with the acute – but we argue that this oddity was not the original author’s intention but was due to the lack of accented <b>letter</b> <b>punches</b> at the Vilnius University printing house. The alternative tradition of Lithuanian accent notation, started by Simonas Stanevičius, adopted by Kazimieras Jaunius, and rejected by Kazimieras Būga, is also discussed. While different from the traditional system, it was nevertheless based on the comparison of Lithuanian syllable intonations with those of Greek. The Lithuanian accent notation was given its final form by Friedrich Kurschat, who also gave the Lithuanian circumflex sign its present wavy shape, directly and consciously, as he himself admits, derived from Greek (especially from the Greek typefaces current in Germany and France; in Anglophone countries the Greek circumflex often still has the old arc-shaped form). The factor of the common Indo-European heritage in the actual coincidence of Greek and Lithuanian syllable intonations in the end syllables (acute in the nominative, circumflex in the genitive), put forward by Adalbert Bezzenberger, has suffered numerous attacks, notably from Jerzy Kurylowicz; but it has never been convincingly disproved. It still seems that what once was an intuitive – or even incidental – choice of Greek accent signs to mark corresponding Lithuanian accents, indeed reveals a much older and deeper affinity. </p...|$|R

Beppe's animosity towards Grant, in particular, increases when he becomes close to Grant's abused wife, Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon). It isn't long before Beppe falls in love with Tiffany and urges her to leave Grant. Beppe confronts Grant in The Queen Victoria public house over his cruelty towards Tiffany and the pair brawl. Tiffany decides to leave Grant after she finds him in bed with her mother Louise (Carol Harrison) and she packs her bags ready to leave with her and Grant's daughter, Courtney. However, just as Tiffany is about to leave, she falls down the stairs, making everyone suspect that Grant pushed her. Beppe is furious and arrests Grant for attempted murder. He also coerces Tiffany to pretend Grant had pushed her in order to keep him locked up. Tiffany does but her conscience gets the better of her and she later writes a letter exonerating Grant of any wrongdoing and instructs her best friend, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), to give it to the police after she leaves. However, she is killed in a car accident, whilst trying to reclaim Courtney from Grant, who has been released on bail. As Tiffany was about to elope with Beppe, he never forgives Grant and when he finds the letter that exonerates him, Beppe burns it. Beppe is subsequently sacked from the police force for withholding evidence and misconduct. When Grant finds out about the <b>letter,</b> he <b>punches</b> Beppe.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931 IBM began {{introducing}} multiple <b>punches</b> for upper-case <b>letters</b> {{and special}} characters. A <b>letter</b> has two <b>punches</b> (zone 12,11,0 + digit 1-9); most special characters {{have two or}} three punches (zone none + digit 2-7 + 8); a few special characters were exceptions (in EBCDIC [...] "&" [...] is 12 only, [...] "-" [...] is 11 only, and [...] "/" [...] is 0 + 1). With these changes, the information represented in a column by a combination of zones 11 and digits 1-9 is dependent on the use of that column. For example, the combination [...] "12-1" [...] is the letter [...] "A" [...] in an alphabetic column, a plus signed digit [...] "1" [...] in a signed numeric column, or an unsigned digit [...] "1" [...] in a column where the [...] "12" [...] have some other use. The introduction of EBCDIC in 1964 allowed columns with as many as six punches (zones 12,11,0,8,9 + digit 1-7). IBM and other manufacturers used many different 80-column card character encodings. A 1969 American National Standard defined the punches for 128 characters and was named the Hollerith Punched Card Code (often referred to simply as Hollerith Card Code), honoring Hollerith.|$|R

Shortly after Kneass' death in 1840, Gobrecht was appointed Chief Engraver of the U.S. Mint on December 21, 1840. During his tenure as Chief Engraver of the Mint, Gobrecht produced perhaps what he is mainly known for, the Seated Liberty dollar, based on sketches by Thomas Sully, and Titian Peale.

6000|$|Thackeray's {{connection}} with Punch began in 1843, and, {{as far as}} I can learn, Miss Tickletoby's Lectures on English History was his first contribution. They, however, have not been found worthy of {{a place in the}} collected edition. His short pieces during a long period of his life were so numerous that to have brought them all together would have weighted his more important works with too great an amount of extraneous matter. The same lady, Miss Tickletoby, gave a series of lectures. There was The History of the next French Revolution, and The Wanderings of our Fat Contributor,--the first of which is, and the latter is not, perpetuated in his works. Our old friend Jeames Yellowplush, or De la Pluche,--for we cannot for a moment doubt that he is the same Jeames,--is very prolific, and as excellent in his orthography, his sense, and satire, as ever. These papers began with The Lucky Speculator. He lives in The Albany; he hires a brougham; and is devoted to Miss Emily Flimsey, the daughter of Sir George, who had been his master,--to the great injury of poor Maryanne, the fellow-servant who had loved him in his kitchen days. Then there follows that wonderful ballad, Jeames of Backley Square. Upon this he writes an angry <b>letter</b> to <b>Punch,</b> dated from his chambers in The Albany; [...] "Has a reglar suscriber to your amusing paper, I beg leaf to state that I should never have done so had I supposed that it was your 'abbit to igspose the mistaries of privit life, and to hinger the delligit feelings of umble individyouls like myself." [...] He writes in his own defence, both as to Maryanne and to the share-dealing by which he had made his fortune; and he ends with declaring his right to the position which he holds. [...] "You are corrict in stating that I am of hancient Normin fam'ly. This is more than Peal can say, to whomb I applied for a barnetcy; but the primmier being of low igstraction, natrally stikles for his horder." [...] And the letter is signed [...] "Fitzjames De la Pluche." [...] Then follows his diary, beginning with a description {{of the way in which}} he rushed into Punch's office, declaring his misfortunes, when losses had come upon him. [...] "I wish to be paid for my contribewtions to your paper. Suckmstances is altered with me." [...] Whereupon he gets a cheque upon Messrs. Pump and Aldgate, and has himself carried away to new speculations. He leaves his diary behind him, and Punch surreptitiously publishes it. There is much in the diary which comes from Thackeray's very heart. Who does not remember his indignation against Lord Bareacres? [...] "I gave the old humbug a few shares out of my own pocket. 'There, old Pride,' says I, 'I like to see you down on your knees to a footman. There, old Pomposity! Take fifty pounds. I like to see you come cringing and begging for it!' Whenever I see him in a very public place, I take my change for my money. I digg him in the ribbs, or clap his padded old shoulders. I call him 'Bareacres, my old brick,' and I see him wince. It does my 'art good." [...] It does Thackeray's heart good to pour himself out in indignation against some imaginary Bareacres. He blows off his steam with such an eagerness that he forgets for a time, or nearly forgets, his cacography. Then there are [...] "Jeames on Time Bargings," [...] "Jeames on the Gauge Question," [...] "Mr. Jeames again." [...] Of all our author's heroes Jeames is perhaps the most amusing. There is not much in that joke of bad spelling, and we should have been inclined to say beforehand, that Mrs. Malaprop had done it so well and so sufficiently, that no repetition of it would be received with great favour. Like other dishes, it depends upon the cooking. Jeames, with his [...] "suckmstances," [...] high or low, will be immortal.|$|R
