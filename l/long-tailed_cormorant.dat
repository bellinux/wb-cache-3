25|$|A scapula {{from the}} Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, about 70 mya (million years ago), {{was found in}} the Nemegt Formation in Mongolia; it is now in the PIN collection. It is from a bird roughly the size of a spectacled cormorant, and quite similar to the {{corresponding}} bone in Phalacrocorax. A Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, c. 66 mya) right femur, AMNH FR 25272 from the Lance Formation near Lance Creek, Wyoming, is sometimes suggested to be the second-oldest record of the Phalacrocoracidae; this was from a rather smaller bird, {{about the size of a}} <b>long-tailed</b> <b>cormorant.</b>|$|E

50|$|The reed {{cormorant}} (Microcarbo africanus), {{also known as}} the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>cormorant,</b> is a bird in the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. It breeds in much of Africa south of the Sahara, and Madagascar. It is resident but undertakes some seasonal movements.|$|E
50|$|The Tanji Bird Reserve has had around 300 {{species of}} birds {{recorded}} within it, including 82 species of Palearctic migrants. The reserve has been declared as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Species seen regularly on the reserve's lagoons include Black-headed heron, white-fronted plover, Caspian tern, spur-winged plover, sanderling, Western reef heron, royal tern and lesser black-backed gull. While the Bijol Islands are an important feeding and roosting area for substantial numbers of shorebirds, seabirds, ospreys, and other birds, including Gambia's only breeding seabirds, including colonies of grey-headed gulls, slender-billed gulls, royal terns, Caspian terns, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>cormorants</b> and Western reef herons.|$|R

Some Late Cretaceous fossils have been proposed to belong with the Phalacrocoracidae:A scapula from the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, about 70 mya (million years ago), was found in the Nemegt Formation in Mongolia; it is now in the PIN collection.

5000|$|Extinct [...] "darters" [...] from Mauritius and Australia {{known only}} from bones were {{described}} as Anhinga nana ("Mauritian darter") and Anhinga parva. But these are actually misidentified bones of the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Microcarbo/Phalacrocorax africanus) and the little pied cormorant (M./P. melanoleucos), respectively. In the former case, however, the remains are larger {{than those of the}} geographically closest extant population of long-tailed cormorants on Madagascar: they thus might belong to an extinct subspecies (Mauritian cormorant), which would have to be called Microcarbo africanus nanus (or Phalacrocorax a. nanus) - quite ironically, as the Latin term nanus means [...] "dwarf". The Late Pleistocene [...] "Anhinga laticeps" [...] is not specifically distinct from the Australasian darter; {{it might have been a}} large paleosubspecies of the last ice age.|$|E
5000|$|The little pied {{cormorant}} {{was originally}} described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817. Its specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Ancient Greek words melano- [...] "black", and leukos [...] "white". In 1931, American ornithologist James Lee Peters was the first to consider this in a separate genus along with the pygmy cormorant (M. pygmaeus), little cormorant (M. niger), and the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>cormorant</b> (M. africanus). Since then, molecular work by Sibley and Ahlquist showed the little pied and long-tailed cormorants formed a group which had diverged early on from other cormorants. This group of [...] "micro-cormorants" [...] assumed the genus name Microcarbo, initially described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. The generic name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek mikros [...] "small", and Latin carbo [...] "black". However, most older authorities refer to this species as Phalacrocorax melanoleucus.|$|E
