2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds.

The measurements were conducted using a slotted-line technique at 1. 2 GHz and at atmospheric pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{colloidal}} silica fillers on the cross-linking {{behavior of a}} model UV-curable polymer system (thiol-ene) is studied using in situ rheology and real-time FTIR spectroscopy. The validity of the Winter-Chambon criterion (convergence of the <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> at the gel point) is examined for the cross-linking of these filled polymers, {{some of which are}} strongly flocculated dispersions (physical gels) prior to chemical cross-linking. Two different types of colloidal silica particles are studied: one with octyl chains tethered to the surface and the other with methyl surface groups. The Winter-Chambon criterion is satisfied for all samples containing the methyl-terminated silica. However, the criterion breaks down for samples containing the octyl-modified silica, with the <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> not converging at any single point. This suggests the absence of a self-similar critical gel at the gel point in the latter case. Neither type of silica particles alters the mechanism of the cross-linking reaction, as revealed by FTIR spectroscopy, but they do retard the cross-linking kinetics. An alternate method is suggested for determining the chemical gel point of filled systems that fail to obey the Winter-Chambon criterion. This method involves monitoring the critical strain (limit of the linear viscoelastic region) at various UV exposure times. A dramatic increase is observed in the critical strain at the gel point, indicating a transition from weak, physical bonds to strong, covalent cross-links...|$|R

30|$|In this work, {{the high}} Îµâ² and Îµâ³ values should be {{ascribed}} to the good conductivity of CoFe@C composites. According to Caoâs electron-hopping model, the well-conductivity CoFe@C allows electrons to migrate and hop, and thus can greatly consume the electromagnetic energy, leading to enhanced dielectric loss [48 â 51]. Moreover, two peaks at f[*]=[*]~[*] 5.2 and ~[*] 11.1 Â GHz (AdditionalÂ fileÂ  1 : Figure S 2) from the Cole-Cole plots indicate the existence of dual relaxation behaviors in CoFe@C samples. These relaxations are probably derived from the surface functions, defects, and interfacial polarizations in CoFe@C composites. In addition, the magnetic loss also contributes to the electromagnetic wave attenuation of CoFe@C composites. Eddy current effects, natural resonance, and exchange resonance are three key wave loss sources in the microwave region. As shown in AdditionalÂ fileÂ  1 : Figure S 3, the Î¼â³(Î¼â²)â 2 fâ[*] 1 for CoFe@C is not a constant value, suggesting eddy current is not the dominating magnetic loss mechanism.

We also calculated the dielectric <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> (tan Î´E[*]=[*]Îµâ³/Îµâ²) and magnetic <b>loss</b> <b>tangents</b> (tan Î´M[*]=[*]Î¼â³/Î¼â²) of CoFe@C and CoFe 2 O 4, in which the maximum values of tan Î´E and tan Î´M are 0.706 and 1.370, respectively (AdditionalÂ fileÂ  1 : Figure S 4).
