5|$|I do {{not know}} what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> playing on the sea-shore, and {{diverting}} myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use of {{corporal}} punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{intersex}} surgery offered in childhood was amputation of the clitoris and widening of the vaginal opening {{to make a}} virilized girl with CAH appear less <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> However, by the late 1950s surgical techniques for transforming an adult man into a woman were being developed in response to requests for such surgery from transsexuals.|$|E
25|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{was devoted}} to his {{daughter}} and tried to raise Christina <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> At the age of two, she clapped her hands and laughed with joy when the great cannons of Kalmar Castle boomed out the royal salute. Afterwards, Gustavus Adolphus often took his daughter with him to military reviews. Maria Eleonora showed little affection for her daughter and was not allowed any influence in Christina's upbringing. The princess {{was placed in the}} care of Gustavus Adolphus' half-sister Catherine and the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.|$|E
25|$|Virilization {{of genetically}} female (XX) infants usually {{produces}} obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal {{and since they}} have not been exposed to testicular antimullerian hormone (MIF), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other mullerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens {{at the base of the}} phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugated as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.|$|E

25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance {{hurt her}} chances for promotion. In {{an era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache she looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> of sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid}} the colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E

500|$|Hoshino based Allen on Robin, {{the protagonist}} of her {{one-shot}} comic Zone. Comparing the two, she called Allen a [...] "different kind of boy". Hoshino drew Allen with longer hair, and {{found it difficult to}} decide on a hairstyle. In the end, she parted his hair in the center to emphasize his facial expressions. According to Hoshino's first editor, Allen was originally going to be a modified Akuma who looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> She was advised by her editor to make Allen cry to make him seem more vulnerable.|$|E
60|$|Her {{head turned}} slowly, her face, puzzled, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy's</b> face, expressionless {{because she was}} trying to think, looked towards his face. She did not see him, because she was pre-occupied. She did not quite know {{what she was going to}} say.|$|R

500|$|The {{youngest}} of ten children, Domínguez {{was born in}} Mexico City, Mexico, {{and grew up in}} the rural suburb of Chalco. [...] Despite the perception of sport by her father, she played when young football with her three brothers, though her father did not approve: [...] "My father was very old-fashioned, and he didn't like soccer. He didn't even like that my brothers played soccer. When he went to work, I would sneak out of the house to go and practice in the street." [...] Domínguez did not find a girls' team to play on until she was a teenager. Domínguez fooled the boys in the neighborhood she grew up in into playing with her by keeping her hair short <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> They called her Mario and only found out that she was a girl when her picture appeared in the newspaper after she made it on the sub-national women's team.|$|E
500|$|Yoshino {{prefers to}} dress and act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> but usually abstains from {{anything}} which would draw attention, such as {{going to school}} in a male uniform after entering junior high. However, Yoshino does on occasion dress in a male school uniform and go to neighboring cities while dressed as a boy; during one such time, Yoshino enjoys being hit on by an older woman. Yoshino wants to look [...] "cool" [...] and wears clothes which are not girlish. When teased by others, Yoshino is prone to getting emotional and is known to get violent on occasion. Yoshino takes up an interest in basketball after entering junior high school and joins the female basketball team with Chizuru Sarashina. In junior high, Yoshino decides not to get a haircut after a comment by Saori, but later cuts it back to a short, boyish style. Yoshino's family consists of a father, mother, older brother, and older sister.|$|E
500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap what could you have been thinking of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Helen thrilled {{at sight}} of a tall, superbly built cowboy reluctantly {{detaching}} himself from the group. He had a red-bronze face, young <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy's.</b> Helen recognized it, and the flowing red scarf, and the swinging gun, and the slow, spur-clinking gait. No other than Bo's Las Vegas cowboy admirer! ...|$|R

A smile {{made his}} face <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy's.</b> Helen felt her body all rigid, yet slightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation held her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of admiration and gratitude.|$|R
500|$|The Hummel and Hudson {{households}} combine {{subsequent to}} the marriage. After Kurt and his friend Blaine (Darren Criss) attend a party where Blaine gets drunk, Kurt drives them to his own house, and the two sleep, fully clothed, in Kurt's bed. Burt discovers Blaine there in the morning, and later tells Kurt that this was inappropriate behavior. Kurt apologizes, but asks Burt to learn about homosexual relationships so if Kurt has questions, he can ask Burt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> would normally ask his father. As it turns out, Kurt is quite ignorant about sexual matters and refuses to educate himself; this so alarms Blaine that he asks Burt to consider broaching the subject with Kurt, citing safety concerns. Burt subsequently gives Kurt [...] "the talk" [...] about sex. He later reluctantly agrees to Kurt's return to McKinley High, and recommends that Kurt dress less flamboyantly for the McKinley junior prom, a suggestion endorsed by Kurt's new boyfriend and date, Blaine. Their advice is rejected, and at the prom Kurt is appalled to discover {{that he has been}} named prom queen.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her first}} year in Pittsburgh, Cather also wrote a number of short stories, {{including}} [...] "Tommy, the Unsentimental," [...] about a Nebraskan girl with a boy's name, who looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> and saves her father's bank business. Janis P. Stout calls this story one of several Cather works that [...] "demonstrate the speciousness of rigid gender roles and give favorable treatment to characters who undermine conventions." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 May 1910, Prince George became king, and Henry {{became the}} third in line to the throne. The King was persuaded by Hansell {{that it would be}} good for Henry's {{character}} to attend school, where he could interact with boys his age. The King, having previously rejected this proposition for his two elder sons, agreed on the basis that it would help him [...] "behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> and not like a little child".|$|E

[...] The crowd was quiet while Weber {{translated}} and repeated the president's German line; Kennedy was obviously relieved at the crowd's positive response and thanked Weber for his translation. Weber translated this compliment also. According to Daum, after this first successful delivery, [...] "Kennedy, who fiddles a bit with his suit jacket, is grinning <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> who has just pulled off a coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1950 or 1951 (sources contradict) Kathryn 'Kay' Johnston -Massar {{became the}} first girl to play Little League baseball. Her mother cut her braids and she dressed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> Not knowing what to call herself, she adopted the {{nickname}} [...] "Tubby" [...] because of her love of Little Lulu comic books, and joined the Kings Dairy Little League team in Corning, N.Y., posing as a boy. After earning her way onto the team and being assigned first base, she told her coach she was a girl, but he said [...] "That's O.K., you're a darned good player." [...] Kay, aka 'Tubby' (which all her teammates continued to call her even after they knew the truth), played first base for the season, but was forced to quit after just one season because a new rule, known as the Tubby Rule, was created. It declared, [...] "Rule III (f) Girls are not eligible under any circumstances."; that rule was in force until 1974.|$|E
2500|$|The artwork also {{differs from}} all three versions, as the {{character}} designs were each created by different artists. [...] There are similarities, however, as Shibamoto {{is responsible for the}} novel illustrations, while Kiyo Kujō based his work in the manga on Shibamoto's original designs. In the anime series, Dietrich von Lohengrin's cold, evil nature is reflected in his appearance, while in the manga he has a softer, bishōnen design that is incongruous with his actual nature. Similarly, Endre is described as looking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> of around 10–12 years old, while in the anime he is given an adult appearance. In additions to variants in appearances, there are differences in personalities relationships between the versions, and there are some characters that are unique to each adaptation. [...] Sister Noelle, whose death devastates Abel in the anime series and in the novels, does not exist in the manga series. Alternatively, the anime does not mention Tres' two [...] "brothers".|$|E
