5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

In April 1900, Wong travelled 13 days up the Rajang River before he decided to choose Sibu as the new settlement for his Foochow clansmen, because the area near Rajang delta would be suitable for growing crops. An agreement was signed on 9 July 1900 between Wong Nai Siong and the Brooke government in Kuching to allow Chinese settlers into the area.|$|E

Before {{the start of the}} 1993–94 season, the team's manager, Ayoub Odisho, resigned which made the board <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new manager to settle quickly which ended in assigning Saeed as the interim manager of the club. He coached the team through {{the first half of the}} league of 25 matches before re-signing Odisho. Saeed's last match as the manager ended in a 4–0 loss to the league leaders, Al-Zawra'a. He also led Al-Talaba to achieve the 1993 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, which was held in September 1993, after defeating Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya in the final 2–1, achieving his first and only trophy as a manager.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, Up For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM went to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day.|$|E

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> way of having her executed.|$|E

Having stopped and lowered all her boats, Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06:55. The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U-9 to broach the surface and Hogues gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again.

After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects.

5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left Hollywood to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> stage project, and {{signed on to}} star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E

After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season.

5|$|Henry did {{not give}} up on his hopes for a crusade, but became {{increasingly}} absorbed {{in a bid to}} acquire the wealthy Kingdom of Sicily for his son Edmund. Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy. Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick's son Manfred, offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.|$|E

This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter.
