Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing on both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the thorax and, like all insects, have three pairs of legs.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking the}} 51st House {{district}} state house seat, representing Loveland, Marostica first faced a challenge from Kevan McNaught in the Republican primary. McNaught {{was endorsed by}} the Colorado Club for Growth, who criticized Marostica for his support of higher taxes and his use of eminent domain {{when he was a}} member the Loveland city council. Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a loosening of state spending restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had accomplished this task by deft political maneuvering between both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to achieve what no other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance {{while at the same}} time maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E

5|$|Finally, in May 1957, bids {{opened for}} the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The {{rebuilding}} of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally {{raise the issue of}} the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being the least expensive alternative.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} nine major and minor halls, structured in a similar scheme to the Maha Monthien Halls from north to south, however the two building groups contrasts greatly in styles. This group of palaces is situated at the centre, between the Maha Montein and Maha Prasat groups. The whole of the Chakri Maha Prasat group {{was the work of}} King Rama V and foreign architects in the 19th century. During the reign of King Rama I the area was once an expansive garden, later named Suan Sai (สวนซ้าย) or 'Left Garden', the twin of Suan Khwa (สวนขวา) or right garden, now the Siwalai Gardens. The two gardens were named according to their location on the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the Maha Monthien buildings. During the reign of King Rama III a new residential pavilion called Phra Tamnak Tuek (พระตำหนักตึก) was constructed for his mother, Princess Mother Sri Sulalai. The new residence was composed of several low-lying buildings and pavilions. King Rama IV expanded the residence and gave it to his consort Queen Debsirindra. Within these buildings King Rama V was born (in 1853) and lived as a child.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of the altar, and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of the altar and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E

25|$|In primates, {{the pelvis}} {{consists}} of four parts - the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hip bones which meet in the mid-line ventrally and are fixed to the sacrum dorsally and the coccyx.

In humans, the ventral joint of the pubic bones is closed.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party. All major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the pursuit of happiness, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, opposition to aristocracy, and fear of corruption, coupled with equal rights. Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the <b>Left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Right</b> led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.|$|E

25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction is {{a transformation of}} some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation {{is referred to as}} a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of {{chemical reaction}}s a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{party was}} founded as an Irish republican party on 23 March 1926 by Éamon de Valera and his {{supporters}} after they split from Sinn Féin {{on the issue of}} abstentionism, {{in the aftermath of the}} Irish Civil War. Fianna Fáil has since 1927 been one of Ireland's two major parties, along with Fine Gael; both are seen as being centre-right parties, and as being to the right of the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. The party dominated Irish political life for most of the 20th Century, and since its foundation either it or Fine Gael has led every government. Between 1989 and 2011, it led coalition governments with parties of both the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
