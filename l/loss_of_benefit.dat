40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> irrigation <b>benefits</b> in reallocating water from irrigation to meet requirements for environmental flows (e-flows) in the Upper Ganga Basin (UGB) in northern India. The minimum requirement for e-flows in the UGB is 32 billion cubic meters (BCM), or 42 % {{of the mean}} annual runoff. The current runoff during the low-flow months falls below the minimum requirement for e-flows by 5. 1 BCM. Depending on irrigation efficiency, reallocation of 41 - 51 % of the water from canal irrigation withdrawals can meet this deficit in minimum e-flows. The marginal productivity of canal irrigation consumptive water use (CWU), estimated from a panel regression with data from 32 districts from 1991 to 2004, assesses the potential <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in diverting water away from crop production. In the UGB, canal irrigation contributes to only 8 % of the total CWU of 56 BCM, and the marginal productivity of canal irrigation CWU across districts is also very low, with a median of 0. 03 USD/m 3. Therefore, at present, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> is only 1. 2 - 1. 6 % of the gross value of crop production. This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> can be overcome {{with an increase in}} irrigation efficiency or marginal productivity...|$|R

This could, in theory, lead to a narrower earnings gap (or even a negative gap) between the ceased and continued individuals. However, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> in this case would result in less work. Thus, our estimate of the earnings and employment levels of ceased beneficiaries would still be an upper bound, but the difference between the ceased and continued individuals would be biased. Because work by non-ceased individuals in our target population is uncommon, we do not think this substantially alters our hypotheses.|$|R

This issue has rarely been {{taken into account in}} the field of auctions, where the goal is to obtain optimal solutions (i. e., maximize the auctioneer’s benefit). In this paper we define a notion of robustness for auctions where some resources may become unavailable once the auction has already been cleared. This notion of robustness balances the number of changes needed for repairing the solution and the possible <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> for the auctioneer. In order to obtain robust solutions for auctions, we define a mechanism based on transporting the concept of supermodel to the setting of weighted Max-SAT. We show that finding a supermodel of a weighted Max-SAT formula amounts to find a model of an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) formula. ...|$|E

40|$|End-user {{privacy in}} smart meter {{measurements}} {{is a well-known}} challenge in the smart grid. The solutions offered thus far have been tied to specific technologies such as batteries or assumptions on data usage. Existing solutions have also not quantified the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> (utility) that results from any such privacy-preserving approach. Using tools from information theory, a new framework is presented that abstracts both the privacy and the utility requirements of smart meter data. This leads to a novel privacy-utility tradeoff problem with minimal assumptions that is tractable. Specifically for a stationary Gaussian Markov model of the electricity load, it is shown that the optimal utility-and-privacy preserving solution requires filtering out frequency components that are low in power, and this approach appears to encompass most of the proposed privacy approaches.
