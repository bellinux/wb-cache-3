Linen and linsey-woolsey {{manufacture}} was a predominant local occupation, with flax brought by pack horse from Kingston upon Hull, during the 18th century. <b>Linen</b> <b>yarn</b> at the time was spun at Helmsley, by hand; spinning was mechanised by the early 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|And Solomon had horses {{brought out}} of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants {{received}} the <b>linen</b> <b>yarn</b> at a price. 17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse {{for a hundred}} and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.|$|E

60|$|The only {{manufactured}} wares we {{are allowed}} to export, are linen cloth and <b>linen</b> <b>yarn,</b> which are marketable only in England; {{the rest of our}} commodities are wool, restrained to England, and raw hides, skins, tallow, beef, and butter. Now, these are things for which the northern nations have no occasion; we are therefore obliged, instead of carrying woollen goods to their markets, and bringing home money, to purchase their commodities.|$|E
60|$|In what manner {{the finer}} {{articles}} of manufacture, {{consumed by the}} rich, might most advantageously be taxed, I must leave {{to be decided by}} those who have the requisite practical knowledge. The difficulty would be, to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production. In countries which, like the United States, import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume, there is little difficulty in the matter; and, even where nothing is imported but the raw material, that may be taxed, especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers. Thus, in England a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle; and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or <b>linen</b> <b>yarn,</b> whether spun in the country itself or imported.|$|E

60|$|We are, however, {{to suppose}} a state, not of {{artificial}} regulation, but of freedom. In that state, and assuming no charge {{to be made}} for coinage, the value of money will conform to the value of the bullion of which it is made. A pound-weight of gold or silver in coin, and the same weight in an ingot, will precisely exchange for one another. On the supposition of freedom, the metal can not be worth more in the state of bullion than of coin; for as it can be melted without any loss of time, and with hardly any expense, this would of course be done until the quantity in circulation was so much diminished as to equalize its value with that of the same weight in bullion. It may be thought, however, that the coin, though it can not be of less, may be, and being a manufactured article will naturally be, of greater value than the bullion contained in it, on the same principle on which linen cloth is of more value than an equal weight of <b>linen</b> <b>yarn.</b> This would be true, were it not that Government, in this country and in some others, coins money gratis for any one who furnishes the metal. If Government, however, throws the expense of coinage, as is reasonable, upon the holder, by making a charge to cover the expense (which is done by giving back rather less in coin than has been received in bullion, and is called levying a seigniorage), the coin will rise, to the extent of the seigniorage, above the value of the bullion. If the mint kept back one per cent, to pay the expense of coinage, it would be against the interest of the holders of bullion to have it coined, until the coin was more valuable than the bullion by at least that fraction. The coin, therefore, would be kept one per cent higher in value, which could only be by keeping it one per cent less in quantity, than if its coinage were gratuitous.|$|E

50|$|One type {{of stuff}} was {{a type of}} coarse thickly woven cloth {{manufactured}} in various places, formerly including Kidderminster. Originally it was probably entirely of wool, but later a 'woolsey-linsey' cloth, made with a warp of <b>linen,</b> <b>yarn</b> and a worsted weft.|$|E

50|$|About {{the time}} of the Act of Union, trade in linen cloth was {{introduced}} to Beith, which became so considerable, that the Beith markets were frequented by merchants from the neighbouring towns every week. By the 1730s, the declining linen cloth business was being succeeded by considerable trade in <b>linen</b> <b>yarn.</b> Crawford Brothers, flax spinners and makers of linen thread and shoe thread opened in Crummock in 1775 and moved to a factory at Barr Farm, Barrmill in 1836. The factory changed hands, continuing in production as the English Sewing Company until 1946. Beith merchants purchased the yarn made in the local area, and sold it to Paisley and Glasgow manufacturers. The demand for the commodity encouraged local farmers to raise great quantities of flax, and the <b>linen</b> <b>yarn</b> trade peaked around 1760. The manufacture of silk gauze superseded both trades and, from 1777 to 1789, the amount of looms in the town producing the gauze peaked at approximately 170.|$|E
50|$|Around 1890, unlined {{fire hoses}} made of {{circular}} woven <b>linen</b> <b>yarns</b> began to replace leather hoses. They were certainly much lighter. As the hose fibers, made of flax, became wet, they swelled up and tightened the weave, causing the hose to become watertight. Unlined hoses, {{because of their}} lack of durability, were rapidly replaced with rubber hoses in municipal fire service use. They continued {{to be used for}} use on interior hose lines and hose racks until the 1960s, and are still used in some areas for forestry applications.|$|R
40|$|Three {{fragments}} of yellowed woven wool fabric sewn together. Fragment A has a purple tapestry band 3. 8 cm wide. The purple weft is discontinuous with points which end in dovetailing and slits. There {{is a very}} small amount of purple weft at one end of fragment B, also. There are very small remnants of <b>linen</b> <b>yarns</b> (weft-wrapping?) in each of the purple sections. Fragment C has yellow warp and weft and was sewn on at right angles to the other two fragments.; Dirty, with some encrusted mud on fragment B. Very worn.

40|$|Impact {{behaviour}} {{is a major}} {{target in}} designing advanced composite materials because composites are often used in applications which imply dynamic loads. Composite materials reinforced with 3 D knitted fabrics present a large range of applications in the technical field. Their main advantages refer to excellent formability, controlled anisotropy and good mass/strength ratio. The paper considers advanced composite materials reinforced with sandwich fabrics with various cell sizes, made of Kevlar, Twaron and <b>linen</b> <b>yarns,</b> and thermoset matrix. Low velocity impact behaviour of composite materials reinforced with 3 D weft knitted fabrics is modelled using the Taguchi method based on orthogonal arrays, {{in order to maximize}} the composite characteristics significant for this type of impact. The results obtained through Taguchi analysis are validated by experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with a {{tapestry}} section. The tapestry area appears brownish but the yarn is {{a blend of}} pale red and a dull brown which could be a discolored dyed fiber, also. The solid tapestry area is 5. 5 cm wide with somewhat oval extensions along both edges with yellow weft between. These shapes extend 1. 2 cm to either side. The outer warps at both edges of the leaf shapes are paired. There are remnants of linen weft wrapping in the central rectangle. There are also remnants of linen slit tapestry elements along the weft-wise edges of the pale red and brown tapestry area.; Dirty, with some encrusted mud, and worn. There are a few edge tears.

5000|$|A {{characteristic}} {{often associated}} with <b>linen</b> <b>yarn</b> {{is the presence of}} [...] "slubs", or small knots which occur randomly along its length. In the past, slubs were traditionally considered to be defects, and were associated with low quality linen. However, in the case of many present-day linen fabrics, particularly in the decorative furnishing industry, slubs are considered as part of the aesthetic appeal of an expensive natural product. In addition, slubs do not compromise the integrity of the fabric, and therefore they are not viewed as a defect. However, the very finest linen has very consistent diameter threads, with no slubs at all.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1928, the Irish Linen Guild is {{a promotional}} {{organization}} of the Irish Linen industry. The Guild's main role is to promote Irish linen in national and international markets, through its website. The guild's brand's trademark {{is the focus of}} all promotional activities. This mark is often colloquially referred to as the, 'carpet beater symbol'. It can only be used to mark genuine Irish linen products such as <b>linen</b> <b>yarn</b> spun in Ireland and linen fabrics woven in Ireland by members of the Guild.

50|$|Stratford traded {{first in}} Cheshire cheese and woollen hose from the country, but then {{switched}} to rough flax, <b>linen</b> <b>yarn,</b> wheat, and rye, bought from Baltic merchants {{in exchange for}} English broadcloth. He entered into partnership with John Hopkins, a fellow apprentice, who also married one of Robinson's daughters. When, through a second marriage, Hopkins became a kinsman of one Vickares, a woollen draper, Hopkins took over the broadcloth trade and Stratford concentrated on the flax trade, in partnership with three others, his half-brother Ralph, Thomas Lane, married to a third daughter of Robinson, and Humphrey Thornbury. They prospered and employed many poor in and near London to dress flax, until the Dutch brought in dressed flax and business diminished.|$|E
