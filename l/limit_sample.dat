We show that overbroadening errors can be largely eliminated, that higher-moment spectral sum rules are satisfied to a good accuracy, and that positions, heights and widths of spectral features are well reproduced; the NRG approximates very well the spectral-weight distribution. We find, however, that the discretization of the conduction-band continuum nevertheless introduces artefacts.

40|$|Abstract. Filtering of a continuous-time {{stochastic}} process which is observed at discrete obser-vation times is considered. A generalized ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is introduced which extends the classical EnKF algorithm from Gaussian state-space models to non-Gaussian state-space models with Gaussian observations. The latter arises {{for example in}} {{the case that the}} hidden continuous-time {{stochastic process}} has a nonlinear drift and is observed discretely in time. A recursion for the density of the mean-field limit of this EnKF algorithm is derived. A method is proposed in which an accurate numerical approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation is used to obtain the predicting density. A quadrature rule is then used to to approximate either (a) the true filtering density arising from Bayesian analysis, (b) the mean-field EnKF density, or (c) a Gaussian approximation. The local error of the EnKF is bounded by the sum of two components: (i) the error between the finite approximation and the mean-field <b>limit</b> (<b>sample</b> or discretization error), and (ii) the error between the mean-field limit and the true filtering distribution (linear update error). In its simplest form pre-sented here we show that under suitable assumptions the error (i) has a smaller asymptotic bound using this new approach as compared to standard EnKF for sufficiently low model dimensions, and therefore either of (a,b,c) outperform standard EnKF as long as (i) is the dominant source of er...|$|E

Deep sequencing will accurately detect and genotype the most rare variants per individual, but may <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> size. Low pass sequencing will miss some variants in each individual but has been shown to provide a cost-effective alternative for studies of common variants. Here, we investigate the impact of sequencing depth on studies of rare variants, focusing on singletons-the variants that are sampled in a single individual and are hardest to detect at low sequencing depths. We first estimate the sensitivity to detect singleton variants in both simulated data and in down-sampled deep genome and exome sequence data. We then explore the power of association studies comparing burden of singleton variants in cases and controls under a variety of conditions. We show that the power to detect singletons increases with coverage, typically plateauing for coverage > ~ 25 x. Next, we show that, when total sequencing capacity is fixed, the power of association studies focused on singletons is typically maximized for coverage of 15 - 20 x, independent of relative risk, disease prevalence, singleton burden, and case-control ratio. Our results suggest sequencing depth of 15 - 20 x as an appropriate compromise of singleton detection power and sample size for studies of rare variants in complex disease...|$|E

It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecology particularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral studies where ethics or other concerns may <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> sizes, ad hoc monitoring data, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at a single site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate the debate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A survey of ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues are used to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists’ solutions, reviewers’ attitudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a range of ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplication and build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefully defining hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits of statistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and random effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their work published if accusations of pseudoreplication are made – even if the problem has been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, and this occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. The concept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leads to rejection during review. There is insufficient consideration of the associated philosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publication of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological research and limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, and valuable data available to form evidence-based solutions.

40|$|Clinical {{trials for}} {{treatment}} of acute ischaemic stroke require large numbers of patients and are expensive to conduct. Treatment is typically administered within the first hours or days after stroke onset. Outcome is usually assessed by a single measure, the most common being the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at day 90. Any strategy that can reduce cost or deliver more reliable answers on safety and efficacy of the investigational treatment would be welcome for future exploratory testing of novel treatments. This thesis focused {{on the impact of}} applying different methods of design, inclusion and outcome measurement to <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> size and strengthen analysis in clinical trials in acute stroke. Firstly, inclusion criteria were investigated to assess the impact on functional outcome. By assessing how the effect of thrombolysis changes over onset time to treatment (OTT) the relationship between OTT and age could be investigated. By looking across the entire range of OTT and assessing the interaction between the two covariates this provided complementary data to a previous VISTA analysis conducted by Mishra et al. It was found that across the full range of OTT, up to 3. 5 h, the treatment effect of thrombolysis in very elderly stroke patients (> 80 years old) was comparable to that of their younger counterparts. The association of AF and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90 was then assessed. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) showed that history of AF had no independent impact on stroke outcome. Deferred selection of subjects for neurorestorative therapies from hyperacute (< 6 h) to 24 h was then explored using a simulation approach.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this two-part paper {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of the direct use of data from a high resolution (25 km) Regional Climate Model (RCM) to provide inputs for a rainfall-runoff model, in order to obtain estimates of flood frequency. This paper uses data from a climate change experiment with the same RCM (HadRM 3 H) to provide estimates of change in flood frequency between the 1970 s and 2080 s, for 15 catchments across Great Britain. This experiment is a rerun, at twice the horizontal resolution, of one of those used by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) in the construction of its UKCIP 02 climate change scenarios for the UK. It thus allows an exploration of the implication of these scenarios using a resolution more suited to the detailed hydrological application addressed in this paper. Despite decreases in annual average rainfall in all but one catchment, eight show an increase in flood frequency at most return periods whereas two show substantial decreases. As part I of this paper showed a distinct positive correlation between errors in annual rainfall and errors in flood frequency, the fact that flood frequency can increase despite an overall decrease in rainfall implies a marked change in the distribution of rainfall, either in terms of the probability of rainfall events and/or its seasonal cycle. Decreases in flood peaks are shown for a number of the catchments in the south and east of England, despite an increase in winter mean and extreme rainfall. Increased summer and autumn soil moisture deficits are thought to be the reason for this. Other catchments, further north or west, show an increase in flood peaks, in some cases of over 50 % at the 50 -year return period. Care needs to be taken when interpreting these results, as they are based on a single RCM experiment (using driving data from one GCM under a single emissions scenario). Other RCM experiments may give quite different results, and ensemble runs would ideally be required to <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> erro...|$|E

The carbon stable isotope ratio (δ 13 C) {{is widely used}} in food web studies, {{but it must be}} corrected to remove variability associated with varying lipid content in the tissue. A lipid correction has not been determined for any deep-sea fish. These fishes are ideal for studying lipid correction because lipid content varies widely among species. Our objective was to evaluate an application of a mass balance δ 13 C correction to a taxonomically diverse group of deep-sea fishes by determining the effect of lipid extraction on the stable isotope ratios, examining the quality of the model parameters derived for the mass balance correction, and comparing the correction to published results. We measured the lipid extraction effect on the nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ 15 N) and δ 13 C of muscle tissue from 30 North Atlantic species. Lipid extraction significantly increased tissue δ 15 N (+ 0. 66 ‰) and δ 13 C values, but the treatment effect on δ 13 C was dependent on C:N, a proxy for lipid content. We compared the lipid-extracted δ 13 C to the δ 13 C predicted by the mass balance correction using model variables estimated from either all individuals (pooled) or species-by-species or using published values from other species. The correction using the species-by-species approach performed best; however, all three approaches produced corrected values that were generally within 0. 5 ‰ of the measured lipid-free δ 13 C and that had a small over-all bias (3 ̆c 0. 5 ‰). We conclude that a generalized mass balance correction works well for correcting δ 13 C in deep-sea fishes, is similar to that developed for other fishes, and recommend caution when applying a generalized correction to fish with high lipid content (C:N 3 ̆e 8) ...|$|E

Documentation of dental and post-cranial morphological time series is necessary to understand how these early horses evolved in response to changing environmental conditions during the early Eocene. A new, nearly complete skeleton of Hyracotherium grangeri (UM 115547), including a well-preserved vertebral column, provides a foundation for understanding the post-cranial evolution of early horses. The posterior thorax and lumbus of UM 115547 are divided into facultatively and obligately dorsostable regions, allowing for dynamic positioning {{of the center of}} mass during acceleration and maximizing energetic efficiency of vertebral stabilization during locomotion, respectively. The wide range of movement allowed at the hip and shoulder joints contrasts with the restricted parasagittal movement at distal limb articulations, representing an evolutionary compromise between energetic efficiency and maneuverability in the complicated terrain of Hyracotherium’s habitat. Dental wear can potentially obscure evolutionary patterns in dental morphology and <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> sizes available for tests of evolutionary dynamics. Simulated morphological time series, in which teeth with various amounts of dental wear were sampled, show that dental wear imposes a time-independent source of variation that asymmetrically hinders the ability to detect directional trends. To mitigate this asymmetric bias, continuous, quantitative indices of dental wear were used to predict unworn dental morphologies to mitigate this asymmetric bias. Time series of Hyracotherium dental morphology over a ~ 1. 5 million year interval exhibit heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics in size (i. e. noncontemporary directional change and stasis) in contrast to homogeneous evolutionary stasis in dental shape. Lower third molar (m 3) lingual shape represents an exception in which a shift in optimal morphology occurs between two segments of evolutionary stasis. Coordinated shifts in evolutionary dynamics indicate three intervals of changing selective pressures requiring further investigation. An adaptive hypothesis involving decreasing atmospheric pCO 2 and changing proportions of fruit and foliage in the diet of Hyracotherium is discussed to explain correlations between stable carbon isotope records and dental time series...|$|E

The demand for a non-destructive method has encouraged the use of micro-CT in studies of enamel de-remineralization. Our contribution to this development were presented in this work by evaluating {{the limitations of the}} method concerning energy {{and the size of the}} samples, by correlating the micro-CT results of mineral loss and lesion depth with a gold standard (TMR), and by suggesting a three-dimensional model for the study of dentin caries excavation methods. After a literature review, which is the content of the first and second chapter of this work, we evaluated a second generation fan-beam commercial micro-CT (μCT 20, SCANCO Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) for mineral content quantification. According to our results, the machine that works at 50 kVp and 160 μA is not feasible to quantify the mineral content of whole tooth. Thus, we strongly recommended to consider the limited acceleration voltage of the μCT 20 system and to <b>limit</b> <b>sample</b> evaluation to 6 -mm thickness which is already an advantage over other analytic approaches which require the preparation of very thin, micrometric-sized samples. The correlation of micro-CT and TMR was evaluated in our second experiment, written in chapter 5. After exposing 70 - 90 μm slices with natural carious lesion in enamel by a TMR equipment, micro-CT measurements (μCT 40; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland) were made inserting these samples inside a whole tooth which was especially prepared in order to simulate a non-destructive evaluation. Also the effect of edge artefact was evaluated by using different threshold for the start of the lesion. Our observation showed the high Pearson correlation between both methods for evaluation of mineral loss and lesion depth and that the variation of the lesion parameter as 20 v% for the beginning of the lesion is a rational procedure. Above this value seems to be not necessary and 0 v% can lead to a higher variation of the values due to operator uncertainties within an artefact area. With respect to the use of micro-CT in dentin excavation research, it was a valuable tool to distinguish between the three mineralization phase in the carious process; a very high demineralised dentin, a layer of increasing mineralization and a sound dentin layer. In this chapter we have compared a new enzyme solution (SFC-V, 3 M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany) for dentin caries treatment in comparison with a well established method (Carisolv™ Gel Multimix; MediTeam Dental AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). The use of the threshold technique for the evaluation of the removed and remaining dentin after excavation seems to be worthwhile. The mathematical model could very well compare both solution and the remaining thickness of demineralised dentin with additional insight into its three-dimensional perspective. In this work we tried to demonstrate the current possibilities of micro-CT imaging and quantification for the use in caries research. The system presents its limitation with respect to energy selection, scans artefacts, calibration and costs. However, our caries research domain demands a method which enables non-destructive analyses due to the dynamic characteristic of caries itself. The high correlation existed between the micro-CT system and the most reliable method of caries analyses stimulates the interest to persist the effort for the validation of the system. New research should be encouraged to evaluate the equipment for the studies of enamel abrasion and artificial caries in enamel and dentin. Moreover, real time experiments and three-dimensional analysis of mineral loss could be done as also morphological insight of the development of caries. Longer term experiments could be also stimulated using the most tempting advantage of the method, which is the possibility of conducting longitudinal studies without destroying the samples...|$|E

Glass vacuum tubes are used for extraction of gas from cavities such as the intestine, pterigoyd air sacs, pneumothorax or subcapsular emphysema {{as well as for}} storage of the gas sample at room temperature and pressure. Insulin syringes are used for extraction of bubbles found in veins, then immediately injecting its content into the vacuum tubes for storage. Finally an aspirometer is used to extract and separate the gas mixed with blood inside the heart. We have found that these are reliable tools for in situ gas sampling, storage and transportation without appreciable loss of gas and without compromising the accuracy of the analysis. Gas analysis is conducted by gas chromatography in the laboratory. ### Introduction Gas-bubble lesions have been described in cetaceans stranded in spatio-temporal concordance with military maneuvers (1, 2). These authors suggested decompression like sickness as an explanation for the observed lesions. Decompression sickness is the disease caused by bubble formation due to gas phase separation in the body. Gas phase may arise from supersaturated gas tissues after decompression when the sum of the dissolved gas tensions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium) and water vapor exceeds the local absolute pressure (3, 4). According to Bert (1878), the main gas “which would threaten life on being liberated would be exclusively the one the proportion of which was considerably increased in the blood”: nitrogen (5). Gas chromatography has been demonstrated as a valid method to discriminate putrefaction gases from air embolism (6, 7), and {{has been used as a}} forensic tool in humans for this purpose (8). Indeed putrefaction gas is one of the problems that we might face when dealing with stranded marine mammals. We describe the step by step protocol that has been experimentally tested and verified for the reliable and consistent collection, storage and analysis of gas from different body compartments in stranded cetaceans. Furthermore, we have demonstrated by using this protocol that gases in acute and chronic gas embolism-affected cetaceans that were minimally decomposed had high or very high nitrogen contents in bubbles (9). ### Equipment 1. 5 -mL additive-free vacutainer (BD Vacutainer® Z. ref: 367624), vacutainer holders and double-pointed needle with a rubber barrier on the tube puncture side (ref: 360214) - Disposable insulin syringes (BD Plastipak U- 100 insulin) - Aspirometer (U 201100896), tygon 2375 tubes, and an aspirator bottle with tubulation, 18 gauge needles. - Gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian CP 7430 column and two detectors disposed after each other: a thermal-conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame-ionization detector (FID). **Equipment set up** **Aspirometer set up**: A tygon tube of approximately 1 meter long must connect the aspirometer and the aspirator bottle. Another tygon tube of 50 cm should connect the aspirometer with the needle. At the top of the burette another needle must be placed. All joints have to be silicon and parafilm sealed. The whole system is filled with distilled water (Figure 1). **Gas chromatograph set up**: TCD temperature at 80 °C, filament temperature at 160 °C. The temperature for the FID is fixed at 230 °C. Samples are run for 25 minutes with an isothermal temperature of 45 °C and an electronically controlled flux with a fixed pressure of 13. 1 psi on the head column. Helium is used as the carrier gas. ### Procedure **Dissection** 1. Carefully remove the skin and blubber minimizing damage to the major subcutaneous veins. - Examine the visible and larger subcutaneous veins for bubbles. - Take photos of veins with bubbles. - Sample bubbles* 1. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If pneumothorax is suspected, gas sampling could be done by using the vacutainer®, inserting the double pointed needle in between the ribs* 2. Do not open thoracic cavity! - Open first the abdominal cavity carefully (try not to cut medium to large size vessels). - Examine the mesenteric and renal veins as well as the lumbo-caudal venous plexus for bubbles. - Take photos of bubbles within vessels. - Sample bubble’s content “_in situ_” using the insulin syringes* 1. - Look for subcapsular emphysema. - Sample the subcapsular (gas) emphysema in situ using the vacutainer®* 2. - Sample intestinal gases using the vacutainer* 2. Preferably take at least three samples from different locations. - Open thoracic cavity. If desired, ribs could be disarticulated except the first 3 or 4 cranial ones. These ribs should be cut at 1 / 3 from the vertebral articulation. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid cutting large vessels - Cut the pericardial sac dorsolaterally (making a “window”) to have access to the pericardial veins, keeping the sac for filling up with water after first examination. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid making the pericardial sac window too large. - Examine the coronary vessels through the window. - Take photos of vessels and bubbles. - Sample bubbles* 1. - Fill the pericardial sac with distilled water. - **CRITICAL STEP**: distilled water is used to prevent atmospheric air contamination. - Sample the gas from the heart (right and left ventricles) using the aspirometer* 3. - Sample the gas from the Aorta and the pulmonary trunk* 3. - Follow up with routine necropsy protocol. - **CRITICAL STEP**: do not cut any systemic vein or sample organs until this step is reached. - Separate the head from the body. - You might disarticulate the mandible to have a better access to the pteryoid sacs. - Sample pterygoid sacs using the vacutainer®* 2. - **CRITICAL STEP**: do not open the sinuses before gas sampling. **^ 1 Gas sampling from bubbles in veins** **CRITICAL STEP**: place the vein under water whenever possible to avoid atmospheric air contamination. 1. Sample each bubble with a new dispensable insulin syringe (BD Plastipak U- 100 insulin) - Inject the content immediately into a new vacutainer® each time. - Label the vacutainer® with volume recovered and location of the bubble. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Use one new syringe and one new vacutainer for each bubble. **^ 2 Gas sampling from cavities (intestine, pterigoyd air sacs) and gas associated lesions (pneumothorax and subcapsular emphysema) ** 1. Couple the vatuainer® plastic holder to the double pointed needle - Insert the needle into the cavity - Push the vacutainer® against the other end of the needle - Leave for a few seconds - Remove the vacutainer® - Remove the needle - **CRITICAL STEP**: If any of theses steps is not done following this sequence, atmospheric air contamination will occur. **^ 3 Gas sampling from the heart cavities using the aspirometer** 1. Fill up all the aspirometer system with distilled water, including the needle on the top of the burette. - Remove any bubbles found in the system. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If the system is not completely filled with distilled water or if there are bubbles, this air will contaminate your sample - Move up the aspirator bottle to a higher height than the aspirometer level and let water run out from the sampling needle (Figure 2). - Insert the sampling needle into the heart cavity. - Move down the aspirator bottle to a lower height than the aspirometer level. - Wait for blood alone or blood mixed with gas to be suctioned (Figure 3). - Once no more gas is suctioned, clamp the sampling tube. - Move the aspirator bottle to the same level as the aspirometer. (Gas will separate from the liquid and accumulate in the top of the burette) - To collect the gas, insert a vacutainer® in the needle at the top of the burette. - Open the stopcock. - Recover your sample. - Close the stopcock. - Remove the vacutainer®. - Repeat steps 10 - 13 as many times as necessary to collect all the gas. - Measure water temperature in the aspirator bottle. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If steps from 3 - 13 are not done carefully following this sequence, air contamination will occur. **Storage and transport** 1. Store the samples at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. - Store blank tubes with the samples; one blank per sample or a minimum of 3 blanks per animal. - If samples need to be transported in a plane, they should travel within the passenger cabin to prevent dramatic changes in atmospheric pressure that might alter the vacuum tubes. **Gas analyses and calculations** 1. Analyze a minimum of three blanks per animal. - Calculate the detection limit for your gases based on the blanks as follows: ![Equation]([URL] "Equation"), where S*min* is the minimum detectable signal, S*blank*, is the average signal for a given gas in the blanks, and S^ 2 *blank* is the associated standard deviation. - Correct for deviations if the aspirometer is used. ### Timing Time to collect samples varies depending on the presence or absence of bubbles, amount of bubbles and studied species. For a dolphin, maximum estimated sampling time is 30 minutes if the aspirometer is used. If it is not used, sampling should take less time. ### Troubleshooting The evacuated tubes contain some atmospheric air, which we correct from our samples using the detection limit. We strongly recommend the use of BD 5 ml additive-free vacutainer, because they contain low levels of atmospheric air and are made of break-resistant glass. If you don’t have this tube available, use the smallest glass evacuated tube you can find, and take many blanks with your samples to correct for the standard deviation. Evacuated tubes do not resist too changes in pressure very well. If tubes need to be transported in a plane they should go into the passenger cabin. If you need to ship them, you should use a pressure resistant housing. Very small bubbles, won’t give you signals higher than the detection <b>limit.</b> <b>Sample</b> the largest bubbles you find. Usually, bubbles larger than 0. 5 mL give goods results. ### Anticipated Results Gas embolism found in fresh animals might be composed of high or very high nitrogen, while gases produced by putrefaction might be composed of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide^ 9. ### References 1.
