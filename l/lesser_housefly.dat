50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>housefly</b> Fannia canicularis is a {{worldwide}} synanthropic species.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} indoor flies include housefly, the <b>lesser</b> <b>housefly,</b> the stable fly, the blue bottle fly, the green bottles and the flesh flies. The common outdoor flies include the black flies, the deer flies, the horse flies, the hover flies, the crane flies and some muscoids. There {{are also some}} 113 species of mosquitos {{discovered}} in Bangladesh, the most common genera are Anopheles, Culex, Aedes, Mansonia, Psorophora and Haemagogus.|$|E
50|$|Fannia canicularis {{is spread}} worldwide. They {{have a life}} {{expectancy}} of two to three weeks. In Central Europe, about seven generations can develop per year. They are often found on excrement and on vertebrate animals. Because of their oscillating between excrement and human food, they are considered possible disease carriers. From May to October, the <b>lesser</b> <b>housefly</b> comes frequently into buildings and is noticeable by its peculiar, silent flight in the room center, where it circles down-hanging articles, particularly lamps. It changes the flight direction jerkily. This is a patrol flight, in which the males supervise, if necessary, their district and attack intruders. During short breaks and in the night hours, the flies sit on lamps or on walls and leave their small excrement marks. In the wild, tree branches serve the flies for their swarm dances.|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is a gram positive, spore forming, toxin producing, {{anaerobic}} {{bacteria and}} an opportunistic pathogen for Man and many animal species, causing diarrhea in young piglets. Piglets probably become colonized from the environment. To investigate the possible spread and transmission of C. difficile by vermin, vermin {{samples were collected}} on a pig farm in the Netherlands and investigated {{for the presence of}} C. difficile. Samples of house mice (n= 53), drain flies (n= 39), <b>lesser</b> <b>houseflies</b> (n= 95), and yellow mealworms (n= 11) were found positive for C. difficile in 66 %, 97 %, 56 % and 100 % of cases respectively. C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 was found in all categories of vermin and ribotype 045 was found in two samples from the skeletal muscle of mice. House sparrows found dead on the premises (n= 35) and bird droppings (n= 26) were also investigated and carried C. difficile in 66 % and 4 % of cases respectively. PCR ribotype 078 was identified in bird and droppings samples but ribotype 045 was not. We conclude that vermin can {{play a role in the}} spread and transmission of C. difficile types 078 and 045 within pig farms and to other locations...|$|R
