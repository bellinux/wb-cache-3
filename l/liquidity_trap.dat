25|$|Most {{mainstream}} economists favor a low, {{steady rate}} of inflation.

25|$|Krugman {{has since}} drawn {{parallels}} between Japan's 'lost decade' {{and the late}} 2000s recession, arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap.</b> In response to economists who {{point out that the}} Japanese economy recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.|$|E
25|$|Two caveats {{are added}} to this criticism. Firstly, if savings are held as cash, rather than being loaned out (directly by savers, or indirectly, as via bank deposits), then loanable funds do not increase, and thus a {{recession}} may be caused – but {{this is due to}} holding cash, not to saving per se. Secondly, banks themselves may hold cash, rather than loaning it out, which results in the growth of excess reserves – funds on deposit but not loaned out. This is argued to occur in <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> situations, when interest rates are at a zero lower bound (or near it) and savings still exceed investment demand. Within Keynesian economics, the desire to hold currency rather than loan it out is discussed under liquidity preference.|$|E

40|$|A key {{result of}} a recent {{literature}} {{that focuses on the}} global consequences of Taylor-type interest rate feedback rules is that such rules in combination with the zero bound on nominal interest rates can lead to unintended <b>liquidity</b> <b>traps.</b> An immediate question posed by this result is whether the government could avoid <b>liquidity</b> <b>traps</b> by ignoring the zero bound, that is, by threatening to set the nominal interest rate at a negative value should the inflation rate fall below a certain threshold. This paper shows that even if the government could credibly commit to setting the interest rate at a negative value, self-fulfilling <b>liquidity</b> <b>traps</b> can still emerge. That is, deflationary equilibria originating arbitrarily near the intended equilibrium and leading to low (possibly zero) interest rates and low (and possibly negative) rates of inflation cannot be ruled out by lifting the zero bound on the monetary policy rule.

2500|$|Krugman {{had argued}} in The Return of Depression Economics that Japan {{was in a}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> in the late 1990s, since the central bank could not drop {{interest}} rates any lower to escape economic stagnation. The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> was inflation targeting, which, he argued [...] "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources." [...] The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site.

2500|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift has {{been related to}} the debt {{deflation}} theory of economic crises, being called [...] "the paradox of debt" [...] – people save not to increase savings, but rather to pay down debt.

5000|$|When the Japanese economy {{fell into}} a period of {{prolonged}} stagnation despite near-zero interest rates, {{the concept of a}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> returned to prominence. However, while Keynes's formulation of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> refers to the existence of a horizontal demand curve for money at some positive level of interest rates, the <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> invoked in the 1990s referred merely to the presence of zero interest rates (ZIRP), the assertion being that since interest rates could not fall below zero because no one will lend 100 dollars unless they get at least 100 dollars back - this is no longer true (2016) as BoJ and some Western European countries have implemented [...] "negative interest rates" [...] for accounts held at central banks-, monetary policy would prove impotent in those conditions, just as it was asserted to be in a proper exposition of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap.</b> Given that {{there is no evidence of}} the existence of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> for an interest rate greater than zero, in modern macroeconomics <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> refers to a situation in which the nominal interest rate is zero.

50|$|In its {{original}} conception, a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap</b> {{refers to the}} phenomenon when increased money supply fails to lower interest rates. Usually central banks try to lower interest rates by buying bonds with newly created cash. In a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap,</b> bonds pay little or no interest, which makes them nearly equivalent to cash. Under the narrow version of Keynesian theory in which this arises, it is specified that monetary policy affects the economy only through its effect on interest rates. Thus, if an economy enters a <b>liquidity</b> <b>trap,</b> further increases in the money stock will fail to further lower interest rates and, therefore, fail to stimulate.|$|E
