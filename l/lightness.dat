5|$|Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, {{the second}} impromptu {{maintains}} an airy tarantella rhythm. It is scored less richly {{than the first}} of the set, giving it a <b>lightness</b> of texture.|$|E
5|$|Since the Hindenburg {{disaster}} in 1937, helium has replaced hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons {{due to its}} <b>lightness</b> and incombustibility, despite an 8.6% decrease in buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|In film {{there has}} been an {{adaptation}} of The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> of Being, and also the movie Pelíšky from director Jan Hřebejk and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský, which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies. The Czech musical film, Rebelové from Filip Renč, also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} the first large building in which Raymond managed to use his principles of simplicity, economy of materials, elegance and <b>lightness</b> learned from his residential works. Raymond cited {{the design of the}} Hiroshima Peace Museum by Kenzo Tange as being an external imitation of the Reader's Digest Building.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lightness</b> and {{rigidity}} of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater <b>lightness.</b> While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative <b>lightness,</b> high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E
5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of <b>lightness,</b> strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of <b>lightness</b> but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and have served as a source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E
5|$|The {{new church}} {{is not a}} typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall {{clerestory}} present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches. As this building was {{to serve as a}} monastic church, it was built to a cruciform plan, which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time. The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue, who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel, at Westminster Abbey. The building has 52 windows, occupying about 80% of the wall space, giving the interior an impression of <b>lightness,</b> and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The text classifies {{three levels}} of breath regulation, namely Puraka (पूरक, satisfying), Kumbhaka (कुम्भक, prominent) and Rechaka (रेचक, purging). The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, asserting that, when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, asserting that the best exercises are those that make one feel <b>lightness</b> in the body and relaxation in the mind.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual <b>lightness</b> of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently {{on the rise in}} Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp <b>lightness</b> that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} {{buildings of the}} early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and <b>lightness</b> of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often in a setting of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the <b>lightness</b> of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
25|$|A {{color is}} fully {{specified}} by listing the three numbers for hue, value, and chroma in that order. For instance, a purple of medium <b>lightness</b> and fairly saturated would be 5P 5/10 with 5P meaning the {{color in the}} middle of the purple hue band, 5/ meaning medium value (<b>lightness),</b> and a chroma of 10 (see swatch).|$|E
25|$|Brightness and colorfulness are {{absolute}} measures, {{which usually}} describe the spectral distribution of light entering the eye, while <b>lightness</b> and chroma are measured relative to some white point, {{and are thus}} often used for descriptions of surface colors, remaining roughly constant even as brightness and colorfulness change with different illumination. Saturation {{can be defined as}} either the ratio of colorfulness to brightness or of chroma to <b>lightness.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lightness</b> of Being, 6/9/08 – 19/12/08. The fifth {{exhibition}} {{presented a}} selection of recent works in neon and fluorescent light. The artists in <b>Lightness</b> of Being work across media. In this exhibition one aspect of their practice was highlighted to demonstrate the unique potential that the medium of charged particles in light has when manipulated by the creative mind. Some artists included were Jason Rhoades, Tracey Emin, Olafur Eliasson and John M. Armleder.|$|E
25|$|Train speeds may however be {{restricted}} by light track. It {{tends to be}} the case that the <b>lightness</b> of the track will be uniform throughout an operating district.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intended}} as a diptych, FlatSpin served as the contrast to the much darker GamePlan. As such, it {{had some of the}} <b>lightness</b> associated with Ayckbourn's early comedies.|$|E
25|$|HSL (Hue, Saturation, <b>Lightness)</b> and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are two {{alternative}} {{representations of}} the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top. The HSV representation models the way paints of different colors mix together, with the saturation dimension resembling various shades of brightly colored paint, and the value dimension resembling the mixture of those paints with varying amounts of black or white paint. The HSL model attempts to resemble more perceptual color models such as NCS or Munsell, placing fully saturated colors around a circle at a <b>lightness</b> value of 1/2, where a <b>lightness</b> value of 0 or 1 is fully black or white, respectively.|$|E
25|$|All four {{of these}} leave the neutral axis alone. That is, for colors with , {{any of the four}} {{formulations}} yields a <b>lightness</b> equal to the value of R, G, or B.|$|E
25|$|Early promotional {{material}} {{made much of}} the <b>lightness</b> of the vehicle, showing four soldiers travelling in the Moke off-road, then picking it up by its tubular bumpers and carrying it when (inevitably) its low ground-clearance proved inadequate.|$|E
25|$|The corner {{house is}} {{remarkable}} by the ornamental painting between {{the windows of}} {{the first floor of the}} elevation on Dworcowa street. The edifice is massive, but the richness of its ornaments and motifs help it having a certain <b>lightness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} enhance {{this feeling of}} <b>lightness,</b> Gropius and Meyer used a series of optical {{refinements}} like greater horizontal than vertical elements on the windows, longer windows on the corners and taller windows on the last floor.|$|E
25|$|More generally, if the <b>lightness</b> {{is allowed}} to vary, then we find the {{tolerance}} set to be ellipsoidal. Increasing the weighting factor in the aforementioned distance expressions {{has the effect of}} increasing the size of the ellipsoid along the respective axis.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{pigments}} reflect {{light in}} a very specific way that cannot be precisely duplicated by the discrete light emitters in a computer display. However, by making careful measurements of pigments, close approximations can be made. The Munsell Color System provides a good conceptual explanation of what is missing. Munsell devised a system that provides an objective measure of color in three dimensions: hue, value (or <b>lightness),</b> and chroma. Computer displays in general are unable to show the true chroma of many pigments, but the hue and <b>lightness</b> can be reproduced with relative accuracy. However, when the gamma of a computer display deviates from the reference value, the hue is also systematically biased.|$|E
25|$|During the expedition, he {{made major}} and crucial {{innovations}} to the expedition's professionally designed oxygen sets, radically improving their functionality, <b>lightness,</b> and strength. He also maintained the expedition's cameras, camp beds, primus stoves {{and many other}} devices. He was universally popular, and respected by his older colleagues for his ingenuity, companionability and unstinting hard work.|$|E
25|$|In the CIE 1931 color space, for example, the {{tolerance}} contours {{are defined by}} the MacAdam ellipse, which holds L* (<b>lightness)</b> fixed. As can be observed on the diagram on the right, the ellipses denoting {{the tolerance}} contours vary in size. It is partly this non-uniformity {{that led to the}} creation of CIELUV and CIELAB.|$|E
25|$|Kundera's best-known work is The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> of Being. Prior to the Velvet Revolution of 1989 the Communist régime in Czechoslovakia banned his books. He lives {{virtually}} incognito {{and rarely}} {{speaks to the}} media. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he {{is believed to have}} been nominated on several occasions.|$|E
25|$|First {{published}} in 1905, the Munsell color system became {{the foundation for}} a series of color models, providing objective methods for the measurement of color. The Munsell system describes a color in three dimensions, hue, value (<b>lightness),</b> and chroma (color purity), where chroma is the difference from gray at a given hue and value.|$|E
25|$|Kundera's {{most famous}} work, The Unbearable <b>Lightness</b> of Being, was {{published}} in 1984. The book chronicles the fragile nature of an individual's fate, theorizing that a single lifetime is insignificant in the scope of Nietzsche's concept of eternal return. In an infinite universe, everything is guaranteed to recur infinitely. In 1988, American director Philip Kaufman released a film adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Video editors {{also use}} these models. For example, both Avid and Final Cut Pro include color tools based on HSL {{or a similar}} {{geometry}} for use adjusting the color in video. With the Avid tool, users pick a vector by clicking a point within the hue/saturation circle to shift all the colors at some <b>lightness</b> level (shadows, mid-tones, highlights) by that vector.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth <b>lightness</b> and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
25|$|After 1550 the Flemish and Dutch {{painters}} {{begin to}} show more interest in nature and in beauty an sich, leading to a style that incorporates Renaissance elements, but remains very far from the elegant <b>lightness</b> of Italian Renaissance art, and directly leads to the themes of the great Flemish and Dutch Baroque painters: landscapes, still lifes and genre painting - scenes from everyday life.|$|E
