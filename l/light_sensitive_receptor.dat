40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} photoreceptor development, some inner retina cell types, and specific neurotransmitters in the zebrafish retina. However, only minor {{attention has been}} paid to the morphology of the synaptic connection between photoreceptors and second order neurons even though it represents the transition from the <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> to the neuronal network of the visual system. Here, we describe the appearance and differentiation of pre- and postsynaptic elements at cone synapses in the developing zebrafish retina together with the maturation of the directly connecting second order neurons and a dopaminergic third order feedback-neuron from the inner retina. Zebrafish larvae were examined at developmental stages from 2 to 7 dpf (days postfertilization) and in the adult. Synaptic maturation at the photoreceptor terminals was examined with antibodies against synapse associated proteins. The appearance of synaptic plasticity at the so-called spinule-type synapses between cones and horizontal cells was assessed by electron microscopy, and the maturation of photoreceptor downstream connection was identified by immunocytochemistry for GluR 4 (AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit), protein kinase beta(1) (mixed rod-cone bipolar cells), and tyrosine hydroxylase (dopaminergic interplexiform cells). We found that developing zebrafish retinas possess first synaptic structures at the cone terminal as early as 3. 5 dpf. Morphological maturation of these synapses at 3. 5 - 4 dpf, together with the presence of synapse associated proteins at 2. 5 dpf and the maturation of second order neurons by 5 dpf, indicate functional synaptic connectivity and plasticity between the cones and their second order neurons already at 5 dpf. However, the mere number of spinules and ribbons at 7 dpf still remains below the adult values, indicating that synaptic functionality of the zebrafish retina is not entirely completed at this stage of development...|$|E

The project?s hypothesis stated {{that there would be}} a discrepancy between the number of facilities provided by each collector making for an overwhelming amount of state coding problems. The California Air Resources Board developed land use policy guidelines that are designed to lower the cumulative health impacts by reducing air pollution exposure for new <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> facilities. This policy recommends minimum distances to separate <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> facilities from air quality hazards to minimize air pollution cumulative impacts. These guidelines currently relate to the citing of new <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> facilities however, the health impacts are the same for existing <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors</b> within these threshold distance buffers. To accurately represent {{the location of}} both hazardous and <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> facilities, relevant facilities were defined and geocoded for mapping in ArcGIS, allowing for comparative analysis of information from regulatory agencies with community resident collected data. This allows for the discrepancies to be exposed so that a communal resolution to data compilation can be agreed upon. After research, it was found that this was correct however, the discrepancies were much larger than predicted...|$|R

30|$|Ecotoxicity {{assessments}} {{performed in}} this Step {{differ from the}} human health assessments in two ways. First, as discussed above, when setting up groups based on MoA, assessors {{need to address the}} issue of response addition for chemicals that have different MoAs. Second, if the ecological risk assessment is at an ecosystem level (i.e., using RVs such as PNEC or EQS values) consideration should be given to refining the assessment by performing assessments on specific receptors (e.g. algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish). As discussed above, the RVs for ecological effects are usually based on the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> which varies across different chemicals. As Backhaus and Faust indicated, it is a crude simplification to add the impact of a chemical where the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> is fish to one where the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptor</b> is an invertebrate (25). However, the decision to refinement should also consider the potential for indirect effects on ecological systems.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{comprehend}} the strategy of odor encoding by odorant receptors, we isolated 2740 mouse receptor neurons from four olfactory epithelial zones and classified {{them in terms of}} their sensitivities and tuning specificities to a chiral pair of odorants, S(+) -carvone (caraway-like odor) and R(–) -carvone (spearmint-like odor). Our approach revealed that the majority of receptors at the lowest effective stimulus concentration represented the principal odor qualities characteristic of each enantiomer by means of the principal odor qualities of the odorants for which the <b>receptors</b> were most <b>sensitive.</b> The chiral-non-discriminating <b>receptors</b> became 3. 7 times of R(–) -carvone-sensitive receptors in the subpopulations when the stimulus concentration was increased 10 -fold. More than 80 % of the responsive receptors (an estimated 70 ± α types) exhibited overlapping sensitivities between the enantiomers. The signals from the non-discriminating receptors may be reduced to decode the characteristic odor identity for R(–) -carvone in the brain over an adequate range of stimulus strengths. The information processing of odors appears to involve the selective weighting of the signals from the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors.</b> An analysis of the overall receptor codes to carvones indicated that the system employs hierarchical receptor codes: principal odor qualities are encoded by the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors</b> and lower-ranked odor qualities by less <b>sensitive</b> <b>receptors.</b> Key words: calcium imaging, odorant, odor discrimination, odor quality, olfactory receptor neuron, sensory information processin...|$|R
