25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital <b>local</b> <b>switching</b> system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E

40|$|A {{wireline}} outage lasting {{over one}} week is analyzed from three perspectives. The carrier perspective is presented using the ANSI Outage-Index, while the FCC perspective is examined from lost Line-Hour and reporting threshold viewpoints.

Various contradictions are presented regarding FCC reportable thresholds, in light of the magnitude and duration of this outage. The purpose of this contribution is to highlight the difficulties in adequately characterizing true outage impact. In particular, the Outage-Index is insensitive to large changes in outage duration, and gives too much weight to magnitude.

50|$|In {{addition}} to dialing instructions, the system {{also included a}} number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the frequency of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone on-hook (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the remote switch also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the remote switch to go on-hook, but critically, the <b>local</b> <b>switch</b> knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their <b>local</b> <b>switch</b> ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the remote switch.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reliability analysis of Local Exchange Carrier telecommunication switches in the United States, based upon empirical data. Telecommunication switch outage statistics are analyzed for a multiyear period, allowing examination into switch failure frequency, causes, and trends. Failure categories {{are created by}} reported outage cause codes, including human error, design error, hardware failure, and external factor causality categories. During this study period, the number of <b>local</b> exchange <b>switches</b> remained fairly constant in the public switched telephone network. The major result {{of this study is}} that, as a total population, <b>local</b> telecommunication <b>switches</b> exhibited reliability growth during this period, and failure event arrivals may be classified as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Another result is that procedural, software design, and hardware design errors account for 40 % of all <b>local</b> telecommunication <b>switch</b> failures...|$|R
5000|$|The public {{switched}} telephone network, {{the network}} of switching centers, trunk lines, amplifiers and switches which transmits telephone calls from one phone to another, is designed to carry voice frequency signals, and is therefore limited to a bandwidth of 3.4 kHz. Before DSL, voice-band modems transmitted information through the telephone network with audio frequencies within that bandwidth, which limited them to a data rate of about 56 kbit/s. However, the copper wires that connect telephones with the <b>local</b> <b>switching</b> center (telephone exchange), called the subscriber loop, are actually able to carry a much wider band of frequencies, up to several megahertz. [...] This capacity is unused in normal phone service. DSL uses these higher frequencies to send digital data between the DSL modem and the <b>local</b> <b>switching</b> center, without interfering with normal telephone service. At the <b>local</b> <b>switching</b> center the data is transferred directly between the customer's phone line and internet lines, so DSL signals do not travel through the telephone network itself. It {{is not necessary to}} dial a telephone number to initiate a connection; the DSL connection is [...] "on" [...] whenever the modem is on.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{replacement}} of electromechanical exchanges by modern digital ones, the function of a Class-5 switch in rural areas is often performed by a remote switch or Remote Digital Terminal installed at the original switch site to handle <b>local</b> <b>switching</b> or concentration, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} reliability and survivability of US <b>local</b> telecommunication <b>switches</b> over a 14 -year study period (from 1996 to 2009). Using <b>local</b> <b>switch</b> outage empirical data, the causes, failure trends and impacts have been identified, analyzed and assessed. A total of 12, 860 switch outages were investigated for which very significant reliability growth was identified over the study period. Outages were also studied temporally, from time of day, day of week, and month of year perspectives. Additionally, 2, 623 of the outages were found to come from only 156 unique switches, each of which experienced eight or more outages over the study period. The data were separated into two categories, for comparison: more frequently failing switches and less frequently failing switches. Major findings are that scheduled maintenance activities and hardware failures are the major causes of outages in local telecommunication switches; there are significant causality differences between more frequently and less frequently failing switches; and there are considerable differences in switch characteristics between the more and less frequently failing switches. Additionally, the manufacturers of the more frequently out switches are identified.

40|$|Speaker {{independent}} phonetic Iranscription of fluent {{speech is}} performed using an ergodic continuously variable duration hidden Markov model (CVDHMM) to represent the acoustic, phonetic and phonotactic structure of speech. An important property of the model is that each of its fifty-one states is uniquely identified with a single phonetic unit. Thus, for any spoken utterance, a phonetic transcription is obtained from a dynamic programming (DP) procedure for finding the state sequence of maximum likelihood. A model has been constructed based on 4020 sentences from the TIMIT database. When tested on 180 different sentences from this database, phonetic accuracy was observed to be 56 % with 9 % insertions. A speaker dependent version of the model was also constructed. The transcription algorithm was then combined with lexical access and parsing routines to form a complete recognition system. When tested on sentences from the DARPA resource management task spoken over the <b>local</b> <b>switched</b> telephone network, phonetic accuracy of 64 % with 8 % insertions and word accuracy of 87 % with 3 % insertions was measured.
