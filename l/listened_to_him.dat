5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us care so much and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} Judah's sons' death, {{reported in}} [...] {{as the result}} of Judah's failure to follow through in saving Joseph. Reading [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart," [...] a Midrash interpreted [...] "heart" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] to symbolize {{the beginning and end of}} fulfilling a precept and thus read [...] as an exhortation to complete a good deed once started. Thus Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught that if one begins a precept and does not complete it, the result will be that he will bury his wife and children. The Midrash cited as support for this proposition the experience of Judah, who began a precept and did not complete it. When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as Joseph's brothers said in [...] "Come now therefore, and let us slay him," [...] Judah did not let them, saying in [...] "What profit is it if we slay our brother?" [...] and they <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> for he was their leader. And had Judah called for Joseph's brothers to restore Joseph to their father, they would have <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> then, as well. Thus because Judah began a precept (the good deed toward Joseph) and did not complete it, he buried his wife and two sons, as [...] reports, [...] "Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died," [...] and [...] further reports, [...] "Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Quintilian {{was born}} c. 35 in Calagurris (Calahorra, La Rioja) in Hispania. His father, a well-educated man, {{sent him to}} Rome to study rhetoric early in the reign of Nero. While there, he {{cultivated}} a relationship with Domitius Afer, who died in 59. [...] "It {{had always been the}} custom … for young men with ambitions in public life to fix upon some older model of their ambition … and regard him as a mentor" [...] Quintilian evidently adopted Afer as his model and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> speak and plead cases in the law courts. Afer has been characterized as a more austere, classical, Ciceronian speaker than those common at the time of Seneca the Younger, and he may have inspired Quintilian’s love of Cicero.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{have been}} mixed in their {{evaluations}} of Charles and his reign. [...] One {{of the most critical}} has been Helmut Rumpler, the head of the Habsburg commission of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who has described Charles as [...] "a dilettante, far too weak for the challenges facing him, out of his depth, and not really a politician." [...] However, others have seen Charles as a brave and honourable figure who tried, as Emperor-King, to halt World War I. An English writer, Herbert Vivian, wrote: [...] "Karl was a great leader, a Prince of peace, who wanted to save the world from a year of war; a statesman with ideas to save his people from the complicated problems of his Empire; a King who loved his people, a fearless man, a noble soul, distinguished, a saint from whose grave blessings come." [...] Furthermore, Anatole France, the French novelist, stated: [...] "Emperor Karl is the only decent man {{to come out of the}} war in a leadership position, no one <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He sincerely wanted peace, and therefore was despised by the whole world. It was a wonderful chance that was lost." ...|$|E
