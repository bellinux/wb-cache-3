500|$|The 6-storey {{steel-framed}} {{office building}} in purplish brick {{on the south side}} of the park at Rungestraße 3–6 and 7, opposite the Bärenzwinger, was designed by Albert Gottheiner (his last work before he was forced to leave Berlin) and built in 193132 as the headquarters of the Berlin affiliate of the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse (AOK) insurance group. The façade is [...] "an outstanding example of late Expressionist architecture", featuring decorative brickwork and pillars, of which the six on the flanking staircase sections are emphasised by terracotta statues. Under the German Democratic Republic, the building housed the Party Academy of the governing Socialist Unity Party from 1955 onwards; a modern extension was built in the mid-1970s, designed by an architectural team led by Friedrich Kalusche. During this period the building was renamed the Haus am Köllnischen Park. In summer 1990, after German reunification, the institution closed and the building reverted to the possession of the AOK. , it houses their <b>legal</b> <b>division.</b> It is a registered city landmark.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Reisner, {{who headed}} the International <b>Legal</b> <b>Division</b> of the Israeli Military Advocate General's Office from 1994 to 2005, has stated that {{although}} targeted killing is illegal under previous understanding of international law, [...] "If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it. The whole of international law is now based {{on the notion that}} an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries." [...] Reisner continues, [...] "International law progresses through violations. We invented the targeted assassination thesis and we had to push it. At first there were protrusions that made it hard to insert easily into the legal moulds. Eight years later it is {{in the center of the}} bounds of legitimacy." [...] This view is disputed by George Bisharat of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, who contends that assassination is not widely regarded as legal.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the <b>legal</b> <b>division</b> of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. I {{think that one of the}} most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and it will be a very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E
