40|$|In 1989, Boeing {{announced}} the fabrication of a tandem gallium concentrator solar cell with an {{energy conversion efficiency}} of 30 percent. This research breakthrough has now led to panels which are significantly smaller, lighter, more radiation resistant, and potentially less expensive than the traditional silicon flat plate electric power supply. The new Boeing tandem concentrator (BTC) module uses an array of lightweight silicone Fresnel lenses mounted on the front side of a light weight aluminum honeycomb structure to focus sunlight onto small area solar cells mounted on a thin back plane. This module design is shown schematically. The tandem solar cell in this new module consists of a gallium arsenide <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cell</b> with a 24 percent energy conversion efficiency stacked {{on top of a}} gallium antimonide infrared sensitive cell with a conversion efficiency of 6 percent. This gives a total efficiency 30 percent for the cell-stack. The lens optical efficiency is typically 85 percent. Discounting for efficiency losses associated with lens packing, cell wiring, and cell operating temperature still allows for a module efficiency of 22 percent which leads to a module power density of 300 Watts/sq. m. This performance provides more than twice the power density available from a single crystal silicon flat plate module and at least four times the power density available from amorphous silicon modules. The fact that the lenses are only 0. 010 ft. thick and the aluminum foil back plane is only 0. 003 ft. thick leads to a very lightweight module. Although the cells are an easy to handle thickness of 0. 020 ft., {{the fact that they are}} small, occupying one-twenty-fifth of the module area, means that they add little to the module weight. After summing all the module weights and given the high module power, we find that we are able to fabricate BTC modules with specific power of 100 watts/kg...|$|E
50|$|It is {{designed}} to produce a blinding flash of light and loud noise without causing permanent injury. The flash produced momentarily activates all <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> in the eye, making vision impossible for approximately five seconds, until the eye restores itself to its normal, unstimulated state. The loud blast causes temporary loss of hearing, and also disturbs the fluid in the ear, causing loss of balance.|$|R
50|$|When {{bright light}} is shone on the eye, <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> in the retina, {{including}} rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells, will send {{signals to the}} oculomotor nerve, specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces {{the size of the}} pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex, which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the past}} {{it has not}} been {{possible}} to measure optically the membrane potential of cells and collections of cells that are either naturally photosensitive or that can be activated by photolyzable caged transmitter molecules. This paper reports on a unique application of nonlinear optics that can monitor the potential of cellular membranes with a near-infrared source. Among many other singular advantages, this nonlinear optical approach to measuring membrane potential does not activate <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> or cell suspensions and cellular networks surrounded with photolyzable molecules. To demonstrate this capabilityweshow that the technique can be applied to living photoreceptor cells that are very <b>sensitive</b> to visible <b>light.</b> These cells are ideal for characterizing such a new technique, not only because of their unmatched sensitivity to light, but also because their electrical responses have been extensively characterized (Minke and Selinger, 1992) ...|$|R
50|$|This species {{possesses}} {{good night}} or scotopic vision. Its eye includes two {{different kinds of}} ommatidium; each contains nine <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells,</b> of which seven contain a pigment whose absorption spectrum peaks in the green part of the spectrum, but in one type the remaining two receptors have peak absorption in the blue {{and in the other}} type they have peak reception in the ultra violet. The moth therefore has the cellular prerequisites for trichromatic colour vision. Adults {{have been shown to be}} capable of making colour discriminations at night-time levels of illumination, and they sustain these discriminations despite changes in the spectral content of the incident light; that is, they show colour constancy.|$|R

25|$|Arachnids {{have two}} kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from {{compound}} eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the ectoderm. The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent vitreous body, and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina probably {{does not have enough}} <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> to allow the eyes to form a proper image.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{function}} of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, {{the most important of}} which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by <b>light.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>sensitive</b> nerve <b>cells</b> in the retina detect light and send this signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing the SCN to the day-night cycle.

40|$|Seeing black, {{white and}} gray surfaces, called {{lightness}} perception, might seem simple because white surfaces reflect 90 % {{of the light}} they receive while black surfaces reflect only 3 %, and the human retina is composed of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells.</b> The problem is that, because illumination varies {{from time to time}} and from place to place, any amount of light can be reflected from any shade of gray. Thus the amount of light reflected by an object, called luminance, says nothing about its lightness. Experts agree that the lightness of a surface can be computed only by using the surrounding context, but they disagree about how the context is used. We have tested an image in which two major classes of theory, contrast theories and frame-of-reference theories, make very different predictions regarding what gray shades will be seen by human observers. We show that when frame-of-reference is varied while contrast is held constant, lightness varies strongly. But when contrast is varied but frame-of-reference is held constant, little or no variation is seen. These results suggest that efforts to discover the exact algorithm by which the human visual system segments the image received by the retina into frames of reference should be given high priority...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is a disease}} associated with aging that gradually destroys sharp, central vision. Central vision is needed for seeing objects clearly and for common daily tasks such as reading and driving. AMD affects the macula, {{the part of the}} eye that alows seeing of fine details. AMD occurs in two form: dry and wet. In dry AMD, the <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> in the macula slowly break down. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them, such as faces or words in book. Dry AMD often occurs in just one eye at first. Later the other eye can be affected. The most common early sign is blurred vision. The dry form is much more common. More than 85 % of all people have thy dry form. Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent vision loss. The National Eye Institute's Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduces the risk of advanced AMD and it's associated vision loss. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels behind the retina start to grow under the macula. Damage to the macula occurs rapidly. With wet AMD, loss of central vision can occur quickly. The classic early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The {{compound}} {{eye and the}} ocelli supply insect vision. The compound eye {{consists of}} individual light receptive units called ommatidia. Some ants may have only one or two, however dragonflies may have over 10,000. The more ommatidia the greater the visual acuity. These units have a clear lens system and <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> retina <b>cells.</b> By day, the image flying insects receive {{is made up of}} a mosaic of specks of differing light intensity from all the different ommatidia. At night or dusk, visual acuity is sacrificed for light sensitivity. The ocelli are unable to form focused images but are sensitive mainly, to differences in light intensity. Colour vision occurs in all orders of insects. Generally insects see better at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red end. In some orders sensitivity ranges can include ultraviolet.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} showed that an {{electronic}} chip implanted under the human retina restored some extent of vision to a blind patient. Because the device was implanted where the <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells,</b> the photoreceptors, should have been, this study demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to take advantage of the internal circuitry of the retina even in the absence of photoreceptors and in the presence of extensive glial and neuronal reorganization. This result strongly supports the development of cell replacement therapies for the cure of photoreceptor degeneration, provided that the cells are implanted in the same anatomical location. Similarly to other sensory neurons but differently from neurons lost in most degenerative diseases, photoreceptors are the first neurons of the circuit and only have to make efferent connections. Secondly, photoreceptors are histologically located in a restricted region of the organ. These features make them the most immediately transplantable type of neuron and interesting candidates for clinical trials involving cell transplantation. In cell replacement therapies the identification of the source of cells able to integrate and connect to the host tissue needs to be defined. For the retina, cells showing the best survival and integration rates are post-mitotic rod precursors, rather than immature retinal progenitors. Given the difficulty of obtaining human fetal cells, many studies are undergoing to differentiate cells with such features starting from stem cells. Three main classes of stem cells are under investigation to be sources for in vitro photoreceptor generation. They are embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and adult retinal stem cells. This chapter will describe the current preclincal studies for in vitro generation and subsequent transplantation of photoreceptor precursors...|$|R
30|$|We use our {{numerical}} model to simulate light scattering in the ONL. This layer {{has a special}} relevance among the retina’s layers as it consistently presents the characteristics of diabetic macular edema [2, 3]. The ONL is mostly populated by the <b>cells</b> bodies of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> photoreceptor <b>cells</b> (rods and cons). Thus, we postulate that the main contribution to light scattering in this layer comes from the nucleus [15], {{as it is the}} biggest organelle in the soma and presents a high refractive index difference to the surrounding medium. As such, the ONL can be modelled as a population of spherical nuclei in an homogenous medium. As a proof of concept we present a simple simulation in a two dimensional square domain which contains circles that aims to represent, respectively, a single nucleus and three nuclei in the ONL. The permittivity inside the circles and in the background domain has different values.|$|R
40|$|Photoreceptor {{degeneration}} due to {{retinitis pigmentosa}} (RP) {{is a primary}} cause of inherited retinal blindness. Photoreceptor cell-replacement therapies may hold the potential for repair in a degenerate retina, by reinstating <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> to project and form connections with downstream retinal cells and finally the visual cortex. Patient-specific {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSc) could provide an autologous source of cells to replace lost tissue. However, the use of patient-derived iPSc would require that the disease-causing gene mutation be corrected in cells before transplantation. Ex vivo gene therapy of mouse photoreceptor precursor (PhRP) cells and subretinal transplantation of treated cells are here studied in a disease-specific animal model of RP; rhodopsin was ectopically expressed ex vivo in rod precursor cells, sourced from a transgenic model lacking the rhodopsin gene. Treated rod precursors were here transplanted in mice of the same disease model and are shown to gain expression of rhodopsin and mature to regenerate the absent outer nuclear layer (ONL) of degenerate mice. Visual function, assayed in the same animals before and after transplantation, was restored in animals which had no rod function at baseline. Delivery of the rhodopsin gene by both an adeno associated viral (AAV) vector and a non-viral minicircle DNA vector developed here for ex vivo gene delivery to rod photoreceptor precursors showed comparable efficiency and sustained expression. The non-viral minicircle method provides a novel system for efficient photoreceptor therapy and may offer a platform of genetic treatment of photoreceptor degenerations in which the gene in focus exceeds the size limit for packaging in AAV. Human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and human iPSC-derived PhRPs were also transplanted in mice with complete ONL degeneration and were able to reform the lost photoreceptor layer and mature in the host retina. Human cells developed light-sensitive outer segments, and reconnect with host neurons downstream to improve vision in previously blind mice. Efficient transplantation of ex vivo genetically treated rod precursors and human stem cell-derived PhRPs in animal models of progressive RP may provide a clinically-relevant model for the investigation of cell-replacement therapy for photoreceptor regeneration in retinal disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Photoreceptors are the <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> in the retina. They {{project to}} {{horizontal}} cells and bipolar cells via a glutamatergic feed forward pathway. Horizontal cells are strongly electrically coupled and integrate {{in that way}} the input from the photoreceptors. Horizontal cells feedback to cones negatively. The combined signal from the photoreceptors and the horizontal cells {{is sent to the}} bipolar cells. The feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones is thought to form the basis for the center/surround organization of bipolar cells. The nature of the feedback pathway is an issue of intense debate. It was thought {{for a long time that}} this feedback pathway was GABAergic, because cones have GABA-receptors and horizontal cells release GABA via a GABA-transporter working in the reversed direction. However, recently we showed in goldfish that horizontal cells feed back to cones via an alternative mechanism. In goldfish, negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones shifts the calcium current of the cone to more negative potentials. This feedback pathway is independent of GABA, since feedback cannot be blocked by either saturating concentrations of PTX, the GABA-transporter blocker SKF 89976 A, or application of GABA. The mechanism of negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones involves hemichannels located at the tips of the invaginating horizontal cells, just opposite to the calcium channels of the cones. Current flowing through these hemichannels changes the extracellular potential deep in the synaptic cleft and in that way modulates the calcium current of the cones. Such a modulation of the extracellular potential is called ephaptic. If negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones is indeed ephaptic, other channels present in the synapse should also be able to act as a current source, i. e., should also be able to change the output of the cone. We showed that glutamate-gated channels present at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites can also mediate feedback responses. Surprisingly, although the glutamate-gated conductance of the horizontal cells is eight times the hemichannel conductance, glutamate-gated channels are not the major current source in negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones. In this chapter we present evidence that this is due to the more focal localization of the hemichannels, compared to a diffuse and extrasynaptic localization of the glutamate-gated channel...|$|R
40|$|Tidal flat {{morphology}} is continuously {{shaped by}} hydrodynamic forces, {{resulting in a}} highly dynamic bed surface. The knowledge of short-term bed-level changes is important both for assessing sediment transport processes {{as well as for}} understanding critical ecological processes, such as vegetation recruitment on tidal flats. High frequency bed-level measurements with a high vertical resolution are generally needed for hypothesis testing and numerical model validation. However, conventional manual bed-elevation measurements tend to have a coarse temporal resolution (weeks to months) due to the labor involved. Existing automated methods for continuous monitoring of bed-level changes either lack a high vertical resolution or are very expensive and therefore limited in spatial application. In light of this, we developed a novel instrument called SED (Surface Elevation Dynamics) sensor for continuous monitoring with a high vertical resolution (2 mm). This sensor makes use of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>cells</b> (i. e. phototransistors) and operates stand-alone. The unit cost and the labor in deployments are reduced, facilitating spatial application with a number of units. In this study, a group of SED-sensors is tested on a tidal flat in the Westerschelde Estuary, The Netherlands. The obtained bed-level changes are compared with the data obtained with precise manual measurements using traditional Sedimentation Erosion Bars (SEBs). An excellent agreement between the two methods was obtained, confirming the accuracy and precision of the SED-sensors. Furthermore, to demonstrate how the SED-sensors can be used for measuring short-term bed-level dynamics, two SED-sensors were deployed at two sites with contrasting wave exposure. Daily bed-level changes were obtained including a severe storm event. The difference in observed bed-level dynamics at both sites was statistically explained by their different hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, the stand-alone SED-sensor can be applied to monitor sediment surface dynamics with high vertical and temporal resolution, which provides opportunities to pinpoint morphological responses to various forces in intertidal environment. We expect that this sensor can also be applied in other morphological environments, such as rivers, salt-marsh, beaches and dunes, but the actual applicability remains to be tested. Furthermore, the SED-sensors may also offer opportunities for ground-truthing remote sensing techniques aimed at describing morphological changes. Finally, further improvements in future SED-sensors are discussed, including an inclination and compass sensor, wireless data retrieving function and additional IR-light bar for measurements with poor light availabilities...|$|R

40|$|Background: Highlighted {{text in the}} Internet (i. e., hypertext) is {{predominantly}} blue and underlined. The perceptibility of these hypertext characteristics was heavily questioned by applied research and empirical tests resulted in inconclusive results. The ability to recognize blue text in foveal and parafoveal vision was identified as potentially constrained by the low number of foveally centered blue <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> retinal <b>cells.</b> The present study investigates if foveal and parafoveal perceptibility of blue hypertext is reduced in comparison to normal black text during reading. Methods: A silent-sentence reading study with simultaneous eye movement recordings and the invisible boundary paradigm, which allows the investigation of foveal and parafoveal perceptibility, separately, was realized (comparing fixation times after degraded vs. un-degraded parafoveal previews). Target words in sentences were presented in either black or blue and either underlined or normal. Results: No effect of color and underlining, but a preview benefit could be detected for first pass reading measures. Fixation time measures that included re-reading, e. g., total viewing times, showed, {{in addition to a}} preview effect, a reduced fixation time for not highlighted (black not underlined) in contrast to highlighted target words (either blue or underlined or both). Discussion: The present pattern reflects no detectable perceptual disadvantage of hyperlink stimuli but increased attraction of attention resources, after first pass reading, through highlighting. Blue or underlined text allows readers to easily perceive hypertext {{and at the same time}} readers re-visited highlighted words longer. On the basis of the present evidence, blue hypertext can be safely recommended to web designers for future use...|$|R

Short-term plasticity at glutamatergic RHT–SCN synapses was studied using stimulus frequencies that simulated the firing of <b>light</b> <b>sensitive</b> retinal ganglion <b>cells.</b> The evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) was recorded from SCN neurons located in hypothalamic brain slices. The eEPSC amplitude was stable during 0. 08 Hz stimulation and exhibited frequency-dependent short-term synaptic depression (SD) during 0. 5 to 100 Hz stimulus trains in 95 of 99 (96 %) recorded neurons. During SD the steady-state eEPSC amplitude decreased, whereas the cumulative charge transfer increased in a frequency-dependent manner and saturated at 20 Hz. SD was similar during subjective day and night and decreased with increasing temperature. Paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) and voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel (VDCC) blockers were used to characterize a presynaptic release mechanism. Facilitation was present in 30 % and depression in 70 % of studied neurons during PPS. Synaptic transmission was reduced by blocking both N- and P/Q-type presynaptic VDCCs, but only the N-type channel blocker significantly relieved SD. Aniracetam inhibited AMPA receptor desensitization but did not alter SD. Thus we concluded that SD is the principal form of short-term plasticity at RHT synapses, which presynaptically and frequency-dependently attenuates light-induced glutamatergic RHT synaptic transmission protecting SCN neurons against excessive excitation...|$|R
