30|$|This study investigates how {{in-service}} teachers’ {{learning of}} a functional linguistic approach for instructional design contributes to <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> knowledge acquisition, skill development, and classroom practice for their students’ development in content/discipline specific literacy. Twenty-three K- 12 teachers with teaching experience ranging from 1 to 12  years, from one urban and three rural school districts, {{took part in}} this study. The mixed-method approach includes interviews, baseline and post intervention measures related to instructional planning, and classroom practice observations. The professional development intervention resulted in statistically significant changes in means on all measures. Thematic analysis of interview data showed {{an increase in the}} teachers’ knowledge of <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for linguistically and culturally responsive instruction. Implications for the findings include a need for increased <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> among teachers through teacher preparation programs at colleges, or in professional development for advanced teachers.|$|E

30|$|Research {{shows that}} the {{simultaneous}} learning of language and content requires teachers’ (a) understanding of how language works in content, (b) planning for it across a unit, and (c) supporting students’ linguistic engagement in classroom activities (Schleppegrell and O’Hallaron 2011). Our study, drawing upon different sources of data, has managed to demonstrate how a systemic functional approach to PD can engage teachers in growth in all three aspects. The majority of teachers in the pre-coursework survey had stated that they considered vocabulary key to the content. They {{seemed to have been}} heavily influenced by the “keyword” approach (Atkinson 1975) that has been promoted by the school districts over the years. It may have been that they had a broad understanding of the word and {{it was the only way}} they could describe the language and ways of talking about the content of their discipline, however, this unexamined and fuzzy knowledge changed to a more nuanced and complex way of thinking. This more concrete knowledge about language can be seen in the quotations from Collette and Janet. An increase in <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in turn led to an increase in recognition for the different language levels as defined by WIDA, and the essential need for culturally responsive instruction (Cartledge and Kourea 2008; Garcia and Ortiz 2006). Ultimately, the teachers’ increased <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was reflected in their design of a teaching unit and actual instructional practice that supported students’ linguistic engagement in the process of content learning.|$|E

30|$|While an {{increase}} in teachers’ <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in both planning and instruction is evident, findings also reveal areas for more questions and further research. For example, even if the teachers have become capable of framing very explicit language objectives at vocabulary, sentence, or discourse levels, the rubrics that teachers tended to use for the written samples were extremely broad for use of linguistic resources so that if students had missed the instruction on the target language for the assignment, they would have difficulty recovering the intended outcome whether on the vocabulary, sentence, or discourse level. How to help the teachers better connect the assessment tool, particularly rubrics, to established learner outcomes for student language use remains a challenge for both teachers and researchers.|$|E

The author, a bilingual researcher, offers reflection on her experience of doing grounded theory research, assuming a dual role of a theorist and a translator. The reflection is based on self-observations. Grounding the translation is shown to be acheived through the strategy of intertwining the activities of translation and conceptual analysis, performed by one person. The two activities are inseparable in time and take place along with constant comparison across language boundaries. Intertwining requires that theoretical sensitivity of the researcher be enriched with the sensitivity to linguistic and cultural meanings. Intertwining, through revealing differences between linguistic meanings or language structures, facilitates the emergence of concepts and theoretical categories from the very act of translation. Combining the functions of translation and analysis and using the strategy of intertwining worked effectively for this researcher...|$|E

40|$|In the United States, {{the current}} sociopolitical {{environment}} {{has produced a}} barrage of policies aimed at curbing the use of languages other than English. From a language ideologies perspective (Schieffelin et al. 1998), this discussion outlines the political architecture of anti-immigrant policies as they are realized in public classrooms. Schools are readily accessible to policymakers and effectively used {{in the process of}} instilling socially desired qualities while simultaneously filtering out unwelcome characteristics. As the largest minority group in the United States, the children of Latino immigrants have been especially affected by educational language policies. By tracing out the underlying impetus behind federal and state language policies, I demonstrate how immigration, language, and ethnicity are conflated {{in the process of developing}} policies that aim to homogenize and repress cultural diversity. Focusing on language policies across multiple levels of government demonstrates the complexity involved the development and implementation of programs that service immigrant and language-minority communities. It is argued that the fundamental lack of cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that spans English-only policies constitutes a coherent effort to interrupt the processes of heritage-culture transmission to language-minority students. In this context, the adverse effects of subtractive language policies targeted at minority communities become apparent as they extend from the classroom to a variety of other social contexts...|$|E
30|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of data}} collected {{at different stages of}} the program looks into the development of teachers’ <b>linguistic</b> awareness and <b>sensitivity,</b> and their ability to integrate subject matter instruction with language development activities at the levels of both instructional planning and instructional practice as a result of such a development. Examining data from teachers teaching different content areas at different grade levels could be challenging. However, {{the purpose of the study}} was to examine the change of teachers and their teaching practice in their own content areas. Though the curriculum content to be taught is different, the need for teachers to make the connections explicit for students, between meaning construction and language use, is the same. Thus, all the analytical tools for data analysis were designed to be inclusive of content and grade diversity. During data analysis focusing on teachers’ attention to content specific language/literacy skills, the researchers, with diverse experience and expertise in content specific literacy, made the decision on teachers’ sensitivity for and ability to incorporate appropriate language requirements.|$|R

40|$|This article {{takes the}} TV-hoax ‘Bye bye Belgium’ as a {{starting}} point to deal with the special <b>linguistic</b> and cultural <b>sensitivities</b> in bilingual Belgium. In the intricate bi- or multilingual context of Belgian politics, ideologically inspired topics are {{not just a matter of}} political conviction. They are also very much a matter of linguistic affiliation and of the way the topics are presented and translated for the audience. Developments in Belgian politics over the last decades have been characterised by the existence of large-scale political agreements and compromises between the members of the two main language communities. These agreements seem to be the only way to solve nationalistically based differences of opinion and to bridge the cultural and political gap between the two communities. Sometimes, compromises can only be reached through an extremely well-balanced formulation containing varying points of emphasis in each language. Thus, the framework of the discussion is very different in the northern and the southern parts of the country, as the TV-programme illustrates. Modern media coverage stimulates the use of conflict frames and as such works counterproductive to the fragile political compromise model in Belgium. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Environmental justice {{research}} shows how socially disadvantaged groups are more exposed and {{more vulnerable to}} environmental pollution. At the same time, these groups are less represented and, thus, less visible in biomedical studies. This socioeconomic participation bias {{is a form of}} environmental injustice within research practice itself. Methods: We designed, implemented and evaluated a targeted recruitment strategy to enhance the participation of socially disadvantaged pregnant women in a human biomonitoring study in Belgium. We focused on women of Turkish and Moroccan descent and developed a setup using personal buddies that enabled information transfer about study conditions in the pre-parturition period as well as support and follow-up with questionnaires in the post-parturition period. Results: We identified four barriers to the participation of women with a vulnerable social and ethnic background which were related to psychosocial and situational factors. Lack of trust in researchers and no perceived study benefits were important personal barriers; the complex study design and difficult self-administered questionnaires were equally significant barriers. Conclusion: By investing in direct, person-to-person contact with trusted buddies and supported by practical advice about cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> it was possible to increase study participation of socially disadvantaged people. Above all, this required openness and flexibility in the mind-set of researchers so that study design and procedures could be better grounded in the experiences and circumstances of underprivileged groups...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the past}} decade, new diagnoses of HIV have {{increased}} eightfold among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) of other or of mixed ethnicity in the UK. Yet there is little intervention research on HIV among black and minority ethnic (BME) MSM. This article aimed to identify effective HIV and sexual health prevention strategies for BME MSM. Methods We searched three databases PubMed, Scopus and PsychInfo using a combination of search terms: MSM or {{men who have sex}} with men and women (MSMW); Black and Minority Ethnic; HIV or sexual health; and evaluation, intervention, program* or implementation. We identified a total of 19 studies to include in the review including those which used randomised control, pre/post-test and cross-sectional design; in addition, we included intervention development studies. Results A total of 12 studies reported statistically significant results in at least one of the behavioural outcomes assessed; one study reported significant increases in HIV knowledge and changes in safer sex practices. In 10 studies, reductions were reported in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), number of sexual partners, or in both of these measures. Six out of the 13 studies reported reductions in UAI; while seven reported reductions in number of sexual partners. Seven were intervention development studies. Conclusions Research into the mechanisms and underpinnings of future sexual health interventions is urgently needed in order to reduce HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) among UK BME MSM. The design of interventions should be informed by the members of these groups for whom they are targeted to ensure the cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the tools and approaches generated...|$|E
40|$|As English {{has been}} rapidly {{expanding}} its function and scope beyond geographical, social and racial boundaries, {{it is thus}} perceived as a bridge that connects multilingual and multicultural groups of people and serves their needs on both national and international levels. Consequently, {{the number of people}} (especially from the Outer and the Expanding Circle countries) who prefer to learn and teach English is steadily increasing every year. In English language teaching (ELT), however, non-native English speaking teachers (NNESTs) are frequently challenged, questioned, discriminated against, and endure prejudice from some educational stakeholders, even if they are qualified to teach English. The concept of the ideal English as a second or foreign language teacher and whether they should be a native or non-native English-speaker has been discussed intensively in ELT environments, including Thailand where this study was conducted. In order to gain a deeper understanding of this issue, the main aims of this study are to investigate the perceptions of Thai University students, native English speaking teachers (NESTs), non-NESTs, and English program administrators (EPAs) towards the construction of nativeness and its relationship to the teaching effectiveness of English teachers. To provide a clearer picture, characteristics of effective English teachers and perceptions of educational stakeholders towards differences between NESTs and NNESTs are also examined. Within this study, 301 students answered the questionnaire,while 35 participants participated in the semi-structured individual interviews (16 students, 7 NESTs, 8 NNESTs, and 4 EPAs). Mixed-research methods (quantitative and qualitative) were used to elicit the data from the participants. To achieve the aims of the study, the students’ questionnaires and semi-structured individual interviews were employed as research instruments. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to analyze the data collected from the questionnaire, whereas content analysis was employed to analyze the data collected from the interviews. The findings from the study illustrate a challenge to the cultural stereotype towards the Inner Circle country groups of people who employ English as their mother tongue and who are perceived by the majority of the outsiders (the Outer and Expanding Circle people) as an ideal or model of English teaching. In this study, the majority of the participants perceive that English no longer belongs to any particular country, nationality or external appearance. They illustrate that every English user has the right to claim ownership of English and to utilize it in the way they prefer without looking back or considering the native speaker norms. Additionally, the findings indicate that there is no relationship between the native backgrounds of the teachers and their teaching effectiveness or ineffectiveness. In other words, factors, such as, NESTs and NNESTs' birthplaces, their nationalities, the first languages they speak or their external appearance are no indication of whether they are qualified or unqualified English teachers. From the perspectives of the participants, whether a person is an effective or ineffective English teacher should be evaluated individually by looking at their Personal characteristics, Pedagogical characteristics, Cultural <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>Linguistic</b> characteristics and Professional characteristics, as the main evaluation criteria. However, the findings also reveal that NESTs and NNESTs are constructed differently by the participants according to five aspects; Cultural <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>Linguistic</b> characteristics, Pedagogical characteristics, Personal characteristics and Hiring practices, although there is no implication that one is superior to the other. Furthermore, discriminatory hiring practices, which favour NESTs, are still reported due to external pressures...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Accurate emotion {{processing}} {{is critical}} to understanding the social world. Despite growing evidence of facial emotion processing impairments in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), comprehensive investigations of emotional prosodic processing is limited. The existing (albeit sparse) literature is inconsistent at best, and confounded by failures to control {{for the effects of}} gender or low level sensory-perceptual impairments. The present study sought to address this paucity of research by utilizing a novel behavioural battery to comprehensively investigate the auditory-prosodic profile of BD. Methods: Fifty BD patients and 52 healthy controls completed tasks assessing emotional and <b>linguistic</b> prosody, and <b>sensitivity</b> for discriminating tones that deviate in amplitude, duration and pitch. Results: BD patients were less sensitive than their control counterparts in discriminating amplitude and durational cues but not pitch cues or linguistic prosody. They also demonstrated impaired ability to recognize happy intonations; although this was specific to male's with the disorder. The recognition of happy in the patient group was correlated with pitch and amplitude sensitivity in female patients only. Limitations: The small sample size of patients after stratification by current mood state prevented us from conducting subgroup comparisons between symptomatic, euthymic and control participants to explicitly examine the effects of mood. Conclusions: Our findings indicate the existence of a female advantage for the processing of emotional prosody in BD, specifically for the processing of happy. Although male BD patients were impaired in their ability to recognize happy prosody, this was unrelated to reduced tone discrimination sensitivity. This study indicates the importance of examining both gender and low order sensory perceptual capacity when examining emotional prosody...|$|R

Moreover, a book genres influence the <b>linguistic</b> awareness, aesthetic <b>sensitivity,</b> develops the imagination {{and the ability to}} speak properly. Developing reading habits and close contact with art positively affects the child. So the aim of the article is to show the importance of supporting the child in creative tasks using the fiction texts. Much attention is given to the fact that literature for children in pre-school, school and home education influences the expansion of a child’s vocabulary and imagination. Constant complementation of teachers’ and parents’ activities in shaping reading interests of children influences their versatile development. Books evoke emotions, they teach how to behave in a proper way and they enrich the awareness of the surrounding world. Both teachers and parents should choose the right texts for a young reader taking into consideration his/her perceptive skills. Ever present humour in belles-lettres for children (vocabulary, situational humour or the protagonists in the books) definitely provides children with joy and positive emotions. The contact with belles-lettres texts allows to develop interests of children connected with stage, theatre or music which is frequently a meaningful element of plays based on books for young children. It is also reported that both poetry and prose texts should be included into young readers’ collection. But the text should be adapted to the child’s perceptual abilities, in terms of form, content, and language. Family reading is important for developing the child’s reading interests, becoming one of the participants influencing the cultural environment of the family. The author concludes that supporting children in creative tasks using fiction texts and their forms such as theater, press, radio, television develops imagination, influences vocabulary enrichment, and the ability to use language material correctly. Regardless of the developmental condition of the child, reading contact with literary text positively influences his /her emotions. Encouraging reading, both parents and teachers play a huge role in the aesthetic and mental education of a child...|$|R
40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{begins by}} providing {{a critique of the}} modelling of industrial networks in terms of culture. It then goes on to suggest a methodological way out of the theoretical impasse that has been created by the limited ways in which culture has been addressed in network studies. We argue that networks are a promising metaphor to explore marketing practice, especially in international trading contexts. Building on the work of Capra, this promise is due to the consonance of networks as 2 ̆ 7 pattern 2 ̆ 7 (involving the qualitative configuration of relationships of ideas) with conceptions of culture that emphasise process rather than structure. Our proposition, however, is that until now the context-specific, ideational elements of culture have been overlooked in industrial network analysis. We exemplify our arguments chiefly with reference to one school of network theory: the IMP Group. Despite the considerable contribution of IMP scholars to the literature, we show that a degree of analytical reductionism has resulted from the dominant modernist, logocentric view of networks found in the management science literature. As such, we propose that integrating the study of networks with 2 ̆ 7 culture as process 2 ̆ 7 (rather than merely as a structural variable) has considerable potential. The paper concludes by outlining the research implications of our interpretivist research agenda. This contains a plea for greater <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the adoption of a social constructionist conceptualisation of culture in the study of industrial networks. In order to address this agenda, discourse analysis is put forward as a methodological approach that might be considered by IMP researchers...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that the cultural competence training students receive during medical school might not adequately address the issues that arise when caring for patients of different cultures. Because of their unique communication, linguistic, and cultural issues, incorporating deaf people who use sign language into cultural competence education at medical schools might help to bridge this gap in cross-cultural education. The Deaf Strong Hospital (DSH) program at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, started in 1998, exposes first-year medical students to {{the issues that are}} relevant to providing effective patient care and to establishing multicultural sensitivity early in their medical education. Because medical students better acquire cross-cultural competence through hands-on experience rather than through lectures, the DSH program, which includes a role-reversal exercise in which medical students play the role of the patients, provides such a model for other medical schools and health care training centers to use in teaching future health care providers how to address the relevant cultural, linguistic, and communication needs of both their deaf patients and their non-English-speaking patients. This article describes the DSH program curriculum, shares findings from both medical students' short-term and long-term postprogram evaluations, and provides a framework for the implementation of a broader cultural and <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity</b> training program specific to working with and improving the quality of health care among deaf people. 1 K 01 HL 103173 - 01 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States 2 T 32 HL 793711 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK 01 HL 103173 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesT 32 HL 007937 /HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesU 48 DP 001910 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 2013 - 11 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23018327 PMC 370416...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} Italy's {{stuttering}} progress towards regional autonomy. At the unification of Italy in 1860, a centralised administrative structure was adopted, as prescribed by the Piedmontese Constitution of 1848. Centralisation of political power reached its apogee during the Fascist period. Regionalist sentiment resurfaced strongly after the last war and gained formal expression in the 1948 Republican Constitution, which provided {{for the creation of}} five 'special' and fourteen (later fifteen) 'ordinary' regions. The special regions [...] regions of special <b>linguistic</b> or political <b>sensitivity</b> (Valle d'Aosta, Trentino - Alto Adige, Friuli - Venezia Giulia, Sicily and Sardinia) [...] were established between 1948 and 1963, but delays orchestrated by the Christian Democrat-dominated central government, reluctant to relinquish its power, postponed the establishment of the ordinary regions until the 1970 s, when pressure from the Socialist Party prevailed. The legislative powers of the regions are of three forms: exclusive (available only to the special regions), complementary, and integrative, the order representing progressively diminishing elements of decisionmaking autonomy. Several regions in central Italy have elected Communist regional governments. However, hopes that the regional governments would be instrumental in ending corrupt and inept government and eradicating regional disequilibria, have mostly been misplaced, although some progress has been made, especially in the northern regions, in the fields of administrative reform, social service organisation, and regional economic planning. The principal reason for lack of progress is the continuing central government control over regional government funds. In many regions considerable amounts of unspent funds have accumulated owing to a combination of political stalemate at the regional level and central government veto. Special attention is given in this paper to the relationship between regional autonomy and (1) local government, and (2) regional planning. To conclude, the present state of play represents an uneasy compromise between the two contradictory historical forces of centralism and regionalism, present since unification. Although there has been a significant departure from the rigid centralisation of the past, the retention of most of the important powers by the central government frustrates the ambitions of the regions to really organise their own affairs. ...|$|R

Instead, results from lexical decision experiments (LDT) pointed to an effect of onset sonority for both groups regardless of whether the onsets occurred in word or syllable initial position (Experiments 1, 2, 5, 6). This was interpreted as a phonological effect, particularly since it disappeared under concurrent articulation (Experiment 4). When a naming task was used (Experiment 3), results consistent with those of the lexical decision task were found only for nonword items, suggesting that sonority effects emerge at a sublexical level. Subsequent experiments focused on disyllabic word processing and found consistent language group differences. Lexical decision (7, 8, 9, 12, 15) and naming (10, 13) experiments found that a "maximal onset principle" of syllabification was more prominent in the Filipino and English reading strategies of Filipino speakers compared to a "maximal coda principle", though this preference was modulated by syllable stress (Experiments 7 - 10, 12, 13). Such effects disappeared when concurrent articulation was present (Experiments 11, 14), suggesting a phonological basis. Native English speakers consistently favoured a maximal coda analysis in their processing of English words (Experiments 8, 12, 15). No effects of syllable stress were found in LDT. They did emerge, however, in the naming task (Experiment 13), suggesting that native English speakers exploit phonological syllable units when overt pronunciation is required. Experiments 15, 16, and 17 investigated the sensitivity of Filipino speakers to variations in vowel quality, a feature that is found in English but not Filipino. It was concluded that the extent to which Filipino speakers are sensitive to a phonological property is largely determined by whether it features in their native language...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{philosophy of}} language, ethics, and metaethics can mutually inform one another. Chapter 1 develops what I call condition semantics for normative language. I argue that, just as ordinary factual sentences distinguish among possible worlds (or test whether a possible world meets a certain condition), so do normative sentences distinguish among normative standards (or test whether a normative standard meets a certain condition). Normative sentences place conditions on normative standards, conditions those standards must satisfy {{in order for}} them to be characterized by those sentences. The framework of condition semantics offers a perspicuous way of posing classic ethical and metaethical questions — e. g., concerning expressivism, cognitivism, relativism, realism, and judgment internalism. This can encourage clearer, better motivated answers and suggest new ways the dialectic may proceed. Chapter 2 develops an account of the distinction between weak necessity modals (‘ought’, ‘should’) and strong necessity modals (‘must’, ‘have to’). I argue that what makes weak necessity modals “weak” is that they express a kind of conditional necessity, necessity on the supposition that the “applicability conditions” of certain premises are satisfied. The resulting analysis generalizes across readings of modals, elucidates a special role that ‘ought’ claims play in conversation, and captures a wide range of seemingly disparate <b>linguistic</b> phenomena. Greater <b>sensitivity</b> to differences among necessity modals can also improve theorizing on broader philosophical issues. I consider three: moral dilemmas, supererogation, and judgment internalism. It is common in ethics to distinguish what we objectively ought to do from what we subjectively ought to do — i. e., what we ought to do given all the facts about the world, known and unknown, from what we ought to do given our evidence, limited as it invariably is. But at first glance it appears that the standard analysis for modals from Angelika Kratzer implicitly assumes that we always ought to do what we objectively ought to do. I argue in Chapter 3 that, contrary to the standard semantics, relative deontic value between possibilities sometimes depends on which possibilities are live. I then develop an ordering semantics for modals and conditionals that captures this point...|$|R
40|$|Nobody would {{dream of}} disputing that the ancient Rabbis spoke Hebrew, nor {{that they did}} so very well. They had a {{comprehensive}} knowledge of the Hebrew Bible and were perfectly capable of quoting it word for word at will. They used Hebrew to write extensive biblical essays, which, while seemingly extravagant by modern philological standards, show tremendous <b>linguistic</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> It was they who passed {{on many of the}} traditions of Halakhah in Hebrew, a tongue that they also used for prayer. Hebrew was so essential to their religious identity, and they were so comfortable with its use, that it is easy to forget that it was not their mother tongue but a second language that they acquired through a great deal of hard work, a sacred language that was not part of everyday life. So, how did they learn Hebrew? Given that Aramaic was their mother tongue, {{it is highly unlikely that}} the Rabbis were educated in Hebrew in the period in question. Simply stating that they learned a great many Hebrew texts by heart and thus somehow came to absorb the language is not a completely satisfactory explanation either. Likewise, suggestions that they achieved such a high level of active knowledge of Hebrew as a second language by using it in day-to-day life can be ruled out, as they probably did not use it amongst themselves for everyday matters. Even if they had done so, the Hebrew in which they wrote their literary works is clearly not a colloquial, everyday form of the language. The Rabbis proved to be actively proficient in the highest literary registers of Hebrew. They could not have achieved that proficiency via osmosis as a result of the repetition of texts, nor through the use of the colloquial variant of the language spoken in marketplaces. Some kind of constant, systematic language study was necessary. As so many of them attained such proficiency, the path that they followed to that end must have been well trodden. Is it possible to trace their steps along that path? Despite their vast knowledge of Hebrew, there is no clear evidence of the Rabbis ever having studied the languages grammar in any depth. We do not even know if there were resources that would have enabled them to learn Hebrew, such as the grammar guides, dictionaries and other similar works we take for granted when studying a foreign language today. Hebrew was learned through the Jewish education system, the raison dêtre of which was to teach the language. Everything suggests that there were a great many schools in Palestines Jewish towns in the latter days of the Second Temple period and the subsequent Talmudic era. The Bet Sefer syllabus was exclusively geared to teaching children to read the Hebrew Bible. Schools were thus entirely religious and did not teach practical skills that could be used for trade purposes. Those looking to learn a trade or a craft were generally taught it by their father, another relative or a friend of the family. When they began studying, pupils were encouraged to copy Hebrew letters onto tablets to aid the development of their reading skills, although there is nothing to suggest that calligraphy was part of the curriculum in its own right. The art of the scribe was a trade, which, like any other, was learned outside the primary school system. In Jewish society in rabbinic times, literacy basically involved knowing how to read, not knowing how to write. How did teachers go about their work? The first stage must have consisted of memorising fragments of the Scripture. The second stage, part of which may have taken place at the same time as the first, consisted of memorising the translation of the Hebrew Bible into the tongue spoken by the pupils (Aramaic, in the case of Palestinian schools). The translation in question was crucial in terms of learning Hebrew. It had to be performed very carefully, so as to correlate each word with its original counterpart to the greatest extent possible. Rabbinic sources appear to reflect differences of opinion with regard to how the biblical text ought to be read. There was a school of thought that a verse should not be split up but read in full, as a whole. That meant that the Aramaic translation of each verse also had to be recited as a whole. The Targum was certainly read in that manner in synagogues, with each full verse of the Bible corresponding to a full verse in Aramaic. Some people advocated following that practice at Bet Sefer establishments too. It is important to know how the Rabbis studied Hebrew. The best answer to the question posed above seems to be that they learned Hebrew in much the same way as their non-Jewish contemporaries learned other foreign literary languages, namely through memorisation and literal translation. In this respect, as in so many others, the Rabbis practice dovetailed perfectly with those of Late Antiquity...|$|E
40|$|Scholars of {{literary}} dialect have often found themselves defending {{the focus of}} their study against allegations of exaggeration and stereotyping, particularly in areas like Ireland, where a legacy of colonialism and of derogatory representations of those who speak the non-fictional dialect in question have led to <b>linguistic</b> insecurity and <b>sensitivity</b> towards fictional dialect representations. As a result, literary dialect studies have traditionally focused on accuracy-based comparisons between literary and non-fictional linguistic varieties. Recently, some scholars have begun to grant literary dialect more attention, often employing quantitative linguistic methodologies in order to perform more scientific analyses {{of literary}} dialect. This dissertation aims {{to look beyond the}} question of authenticity in an investigation of Irish English literary dialect of the twentieth-century Abbey Theatre catalogue. This study treats the literary dialect involved as a discrete linguistic variety, related to real-life Irish English but deserving of a comprehensive analysis that does not rely on that relationship, and that does not have an accuracy judgement as its goal. 	To that end, the Corpus of Hiberno-English Literary Dialects (CHELD) was created, containing over 600, 000 words of dialect from fifty texts by seventeen authors whose work, these texts included, has been produced by the Abbey Theatre, Ireland 2 ̆ 7 s national theatre. In this dissertation, the construction of this corpus is detailed, from the digitization and annotation of texts to the analytical process. The corpus is then explored along a number of linguistic and sociolinguistic variables in order to approach a more complete picture of the linguistic characteristics of twentieth-century Irish English theatrical dialect of the Abbey. In addition, more specific studies are carried out; in the first, the language of the Abbey 2 ̆ 7 s founders is explored in order to investigate how these authors 2 ̆ 7 language use can be linked to their political and literary aims. The second examines the language of Lennox Robinson and Sean O 2 ̆ 7 Casey for evidence of an attempt to differentiate their work from that of the Literary Revival. The final study focuses on an analysis of the CHELD texts by premiere site in order to explore the possibility of an 2 ̆ 7 Abbey linguistic style 2 ̆ 7 specific to plays written originally for an Abbey audience. The thesis concludes by looking to establish a broad picture of the characteristics of Literary Hiberno-English...|$|R
40|$|Today, ’design’ is a {{ubiquitous}} concept, dispersed throughout {{disciplines and}} fields of professions. In this situation, {{what does it}} mean ‘to design’? Is it a problem solving activity still aiming at Vitruvian durability, functionality, and pleasure? Is it an enhancing activity, a matter of transforming raw matter into conspicuous forms? Or is design a matter of signification and meaning in a broader sense? Irrespective of how we choose to respond, the questioning as such reveals a widened scope for design, which stretches beyond problem solving and formal enhancement. In this respect, the notion of design might have regained some of its initial meaning expressed by the Latin designare, to signify. Fundamentally communicative, design is an intermediating kind of action, indispensable in order {{to bridge the gap between}} humans as well as between humans and a complex, surrounding world. As for the practices of landscape architecture and planning, this entails a significant shift. Rather than descriptive or representative, ‘design’ unfolds as an imperative. Not only connoting the accommodation of a physical structure to a given ideal or vision, design presents itself as the challenging as-if-space where visions and ideals are constantly being negotiated and reproduced. Accordingly, it is possible to assume a shift also in the professional or expert role of the landscape architect or planner, an equivalent widening of the scope of action to include not only bio-morphological or infrastructural interaction but furthermore interaction of a more linguistic kind. In an attempt to meet the need to explore this new designer’s role, we have at the Dept. of Landscape Architecture Alnarp during a number of years offered the seminar course, “Design as Action”. In this course, the students are offered the possibility to develop a self-reflective, dialogic and exploratory design practice. Pedagogically, this is achieved through the establishing of what could be described as a rhetorical awareness, an awareness of the intimate relationship between the professional language practice and the design action. We identify two levels of rhetorical interference or language games, where the design action unfolds either through communicative ‘props’ or as meta-communicative ‘stagings’, explored through different forms of rhetorical and spatial activities, such as conceptual modelling, language games, role plays, and storytelling. The main argument developed in this paper is that a playful and spatially conscious, professional language development is one of the most important success criteria in landscape architecture education. Furthermore, already acquainted with the composite notion of ‘landscape’, landscape architecture students have special opportunities to develop a combined <b>linguistic</b> and spatial <b>sensitivity</b> with great relevance for a complex and potentially conflictive future...|$|R
