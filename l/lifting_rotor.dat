2500|$|The Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 (or S-46) was a {{single-engine}} helicopter {{designed by}} Igor Sikorsky. It {{had a single}} three-blade rotor originally powered by a 75 horsepower (56kW) engine. The first [...] "free" [...] flight of the VS-300 was on 13 May 1940. The VS-300 was the first successful single <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> helicopter in the United States and the first successful helicopter to use a single vertical-plane tail rotor configuration for antitorque. With floats attached, it became the first practical amphibious helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne was an {{experimental}} British rotorcraft that used single <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> and a tractor propeller {{mounted on the}} tip of the starboard stub wing to provide both propulsion and anti-torque reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{convertiplane}} has {{a conventional}} wing for lift in forward flight and a rotary wing which {{acts as a}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> for vertical flight and then tilts forward {{to act as a}} propeller in forward flight. In the tiltwing variant the whole wing-rotor assembly tilts while in the tiltrotor the wing remains fixed and only the engine-rotor assembly tilts. The requirements for a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> and a propulsive propeller differ, and the rotors for a convertiplane must be a compromise between the two. Some designs used what were effectively propellers rather than rotors, having a smaller diameter and being optimised for forward flight, while others chose a larger size to give better lifting power at the expense of forward speed. No convertiplane entered production during the post-war years, however the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor would eventually fly in 1989, finally entering service 18 years after that.|$|E
40|$|The {{constant}} <b>lift</b> <b>rotor</b> (CLR) {{employs a}} control input of pitch moment to several airfoil sections which {{are free to}} pivot on a continuous spar, allowing them to change their pitch to obtain the desired lift. A flap-lag-torsion flutter analysis of a constant <b>lift</b> <b>rotor</b> blade in hover was developed. The blade model assumes rigid body flap and lead-lag motions at the root hinge and each strip undergoes an independent torsional motion. The results are presented in terms of root locus plots of complex eigenvalues {{as a function of}} thrust. The effects of several parameters (including structural damping, center of gravity and elastic axis offset from aerodynamic center, compressibility pitch-lag and pitch-flap coupling) on the blade dynamics are examined. With a suitable combination of lag damper and pitch-flap coupling, it is possible to design a constant <b>lift</b> <b>rotor</b> blade free from flutter instability...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} and control characteristics of an airship equipped with <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> {{to provide a}} modest VTOL capability are discussed. The rotors are used for control and maneuvering in near-hovering flight. Configurations with two, three, and four <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> are examined and compared with respect to control capabilities and dynamic response characteristics. Linearized models of the dynamics are employed for this study. A new approach {{to the prediction of}} rotor derivatives for operation near zero thrust in hover is presented. It is found that all three configurations have similar control and response characteristics. The responses are characterized by long time constants and low levels of angular damping...|$|R
50|$|Helicopters with {{a single}} shaft-driven main <b>lift</b> <b>rotor</b> require some sort of antitorque device such as a tail rotor, fantail, or NOTAR, except some rare {{examples}} of helicopters using tip jet propulsion, which generates almost no torque.|$|R
50|$|A rotor wing is a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> or wing which spins {{to provide}} {{aerodynamic}} lift. In general, a rotor may spin about an axis which is aligned substantially vertically, fore-and aft, or {{side to side}} (spanwise). All three classes have been studied for use as lifting rotors, although only vertical-axis rotorcraft such as the helicopter have come into common use.|$|E
50|$|The {{cross-flow}} fan comprises a radial arrangement of blades around a central axis, which {{is placed in}} a shaped duct. Rotating the fan causes air to be drawn in {{at one end of}} the duct, passed through the fan and expelled at the other end. The FanWing is a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> which uses this principle to augment lift, even at very low airspeeds, by drawing air downwards. A prototype UAV was flown in 2007.|$|E

50|$|The {{coleopter}} type has an annular wing {{forming a}} duct around a <b>lift</b> <b>rotor.</b> The transition to forward flight {{has never been}} achieved, although the SNECMA Coléoptère took off, hovered and landed vertically, solely on pure jet thrust.|$|R
40|$|Equations and {{procedures}} are presented for numerically determining the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors.</b> The equations are general and {{can account for}} stall and compressibility effects, as well as variations in hub and blade configurations, that are normally omitted from conventional analytical rotor treatments. The application of the method to solution by automatic computing machines is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The W.11 was a {{development}} of the Weir W.6 dual transverse rotor helicopter. It is the only helicopter of its type ever built and included three <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> all turning in the same direction. The adoption of three rotors was due to concerns over the capability of a single large rotor to generate the required lift.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve this, he {{utilised}} {{the ability of a}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> to autorotate, whereby at a suitable pitch setting, a rotor will continue to rotate without mechanical drive, sustained by the torque equilibrium of the lift and drag forces acting on the blades. This phenomenon was already known, and was available as a safety feature to allow controlled descent of a helicopter in the event of engine failure. With De la Cierva's autogyro, the rotor was drawn through the air by means of a conventional propeller, with the result that the rotor generated sufficient lift to sustain level flight, climb and descent.|$|E
5000|$|Amphibious {{aircraft}} are heavier and slower, {{more complex and}} more expensive to purchase and operate than comparable landplanes but are also more versatile. Even if they cannot hover or land vertically, for some jobs they compete favorably with helicopters and do so at a significantly lower cost. Amphibious aircraft can be much faster and have longer range than comparable helicopters, and can achieve nearly the range of land based aircraft, as an airplane's wing is more efficient than a helicopter's <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor.</b> This makes an amphibious aircraft, such as the Grumman Albatross and the Shin Meiwa US-2, useful for long-range air-sea rescue tasks. In addition, amphibious {{aircraft are}} particularly useful as [...] "Bushplanes" [...] engaging in light transport in remote areas, where {{they are required to}} operate not only from airstrips, but also from lakes and rivers.|$|E

50|$|Torque balance was {{provided}} by slightly inclining each rotor axis to generate horizontal thrust components to provide anti-torque moments. The three rotor configuration was foreseen by Belgian helicopter experimenter Nicolas Florine in his patent of 1926 which presented the aforementioned means for balancing the reaction on the fuselage {{of two or more}} torque driven <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> turning in the same direction.|$|R
50|$|Autogyros have {{unpowered}} rotors, with {{a separate}} power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the <b>rotor,</b> to provide <b>lift.</b> <b>Rotor</b> kites are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.|$|R

The {{present state of}} random process theory, applicable to <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> problems is sketched. Possible theories of random blade flapping and random blade flap-bending are outlined and their limitations discussed. A plan for preliminary experiments to study random flapping motions of a see-saw rotor is developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{transonic}} {{aspect of}} helicopter flow analysis is addressed. The {{equations of motion}} and their implementations are examined, and the computation of real rotor flows is considered. Nonlifting rotor flows, high-speed hover, high advance ratio <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> flows, and strong blade/vortex interaction computations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|An inviscid, nonconservative, {{three-dimensional}} {{potential flow}} code {{has been developed}} for computing the quasi-steady flow about an isolated <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> blade. Calculations from the code were compared with chordwise pressure measurements obtained in a wind tunnel on a nonlifting rotor at transonic tip speeds at advance ratios from 0. 40 to 0. 55. The overall agreement between theoretical calculations and experiment was good. To illustrate the early capability of the program, the flow about a hypothetical <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> blade having twist, airfoil thickness taper, and a 20 deg sweptback tip was analyzed at azimuthal positions of 60, 90, and 120 deg for an advance ratio of 0. 342. A typical run on a CDC 7600 computer required about 5 min for one rotor position at transonic tip speeds...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cyclic control}} {{was found to}} be {{difficult}} to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> to either side aft of the tailboom. By varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. [...] Roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. [...] In this configuration, {{it was found that the}} VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed to solve a three-dimensional conservative formulation of the full-potential equation. Its ability to solve transonic, unsteady rotor flows is demonstrated by comparison to forward flight non-lifting pressure data at low to moderate advance ratios. A 'split potential' formulation {{has been added to}} the code which incorporates known vorticity fields into the full-potential calculation. Using this methodology, rotor wake contributions have been incorporated into the computer code. Pressure results are presented for <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> in hover. These results are compared to experimental data as well as to other predictions...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the more}} {{important}} methods are discussed that have been used or proposed for aircraft parameter identification. The methods are classified into two groups: Equation error or regression estimates and Bayesian estimates and their derivatives that are based on probabilistic concepts. In both of these two groups the cost function can be optimized either globally over the entire time span of the transient, or sequentially, leading to the formulation of optimum filters. Identifiability problems and the validation of the estimates are briefly outlined, and applications to <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} and analytical studies on an isolated <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> {{in ground effect}} at low advance ratios are discussed. The experiments show that the favorable effect of ground proximity in hover disappears rapidly with small increases in advance ratio. Two flow regimes occur, a recirculation of the rotor wake is present {{at the low end}} of the advance ratio range investigated and a ground vortex is formed as advance ratio increases, causing irregular changes in the hub moments with advance ratio. Experimental results also show that translational acceleration has a significant effect on the ground effect of a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor.</b> Hot wire measurements of the flow field under the ratio in ground effect are also presented. The experimental data are analyzed to determine effective values of the inflow in ground effect...|$|E

The Centers were asked to {{participate}} in this meeting in accordance with their interest, activities, and requirements in the subject area. Primary emphasis was directed toward parachutes, parachute-rocket systems, paragliders, and <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> concepts applicable to bothe booster and spacecraft landing and recovery...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} code was developed at Princeton University {{to calculate the}} velocity components in the flow field near a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor.</b> The induced velocity components in the rotor flow field predicted by this theory are compared with experiment. It appears that on balance, this relatively simple theory gives a reasonable prediction of the average induced velocities in a rotor flow and is quite suitable for such applications as estimating {{the influence of the}} rotor wake on the tail surfaces of rotorcraft. The theory predicts that significant induced velocity components are present in all three flow directions in the wake at a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor.</b> It should be noted, however, that there are a few experimental measurements of the longitudinal and lateral induced velocity components in the rotor wake. This theory, known as the flat wake theory, is essentially the rotary wing analog of Prandtl's lifting line theory. The theory is described in this report. Calculations based on the theory are presented and compared with a modern free wake theory...|$|E
5000|$|The rotor now has {{substantial}} {{rotational energy}} {{due to the}} tip weights (usable temporary power equivalent to [...] ), and the rotor blades are pitched to push air down and lift the aircraft in a jump takeoff.While altitude is reached, the aircraft transitions into forward flight using the pusher propeller, and the rotor shifts to autorotation (windmilling) with air flowing up through the rotor.As speed increases, the air flow increases rotor RPM like other autogyros. Once sufficient airspeed is reached (around 70 - 85 mph) for the small wings to provide <b>lift,</b> <b>rotor</b> blades are feathered to reduce rotor speed to 100 RPM and minimize drag, and lift is provided mostly by the wings when speed reaches 150 mph. <b>Rotor</b> <b>lift</b> is reduced to 10%, and flight efficiency is somewhat below that of a commercial jet plane.|$|R
2500|$|The Mi-26 was {{the first}} factory-equipped {{helicopter}} with a single, eight-blade main <b>lift</b> <b>rotor.</b> It is capable of flight {{in the event of}} power loss by one engine (depending on aircraft mission weight) thanks to an engine load sharing system. While its empty weight is only slightly higher than the Mi-6's, the Mi-26 has a payload of up to [...] It is the second largest and heaviest helicopter ever constructed, after the experimental Mil V-12. The tail rotor has about the same diameter and thrust as the four-bladed main rotor fitted to the MD Helicopters MD 500.|$|R
40|$|Weight {{and cost}} {{estimating}} relationships, including additional parameters {{that influence the}} cost and performance of heavy-lift airships (HLA), are discussed. Inputs to a closed loop computer program, consisting of useful load, forward speed, lift module positive or negative thrust, and rotors and propellers, are examined. Detail {{is given to the}} HLA cost and weight program (HLACW), which computes component weights, vehicle size, buoyancy <b>lift,</b> <b>rotor</b> and propellar thrust, and engine horse power. This program solves the problem of interrelating the different aerostat, rotors, engines and propeller sizes. Six sets of 'default parameters' are left for the operator to change during each computer run enabling slight data manipulation without altering the program...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> blade torsion, blade flap bending {{flexibility}} and rotor support flexibility on rotor stability and random response are described.

The response of linear periodically time varying systems to random excitation is examined...|$|E
40|$|The current {{paper has}} been written {{in order to find}} the best {{solutions}} to replace the antitorque rotor of single-rotor helicopters, with removal of its disadvantages through the Coandă Effect. This would significantly increase the flight performance. The research mainly aims at obtaining a controlled lateral force due to Coandă flows through the tail boom, a force which would be useful for the stabilization needed because of the <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> during the flight of single-rotor helicopters...|$|E
40|$|May, i 95 o ';[: ii i ~ I Summary. [...] A short {{account and}} the results of a {{theoretical}} investigation (cf. Ref. 1 and 2) of the velocity field induced by a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor</b> is given. The computation is based on the assumptions that the rotor is lightly loaded and that it has an infinite number of blades. This is applied to calculate the induced velocity distribution for disc incidences of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 90 deg. For the downwash at the rotor itself (the normal component of the induced velocity) the Fourier coefficients are given, as they are needed for the calculation of the blade motion. 1. Introduction. [...] The velocity field, which is induced by a <b>lifting</b> <b>rotor,</b> is of interest in connection with its effect on the blade motion and on a neighbouring rotor or other body. In its general form the calculation of this velocity field is extremely complicated, and it would be impracticable to derive useful results without introducing a number of simplifying assumptions. Since hitherto nothing better was available, it has been assumed by most authors, followin...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{rotorcraft}} dynamics requires {{solution of}} the rotor induced flow field. Often, the appropriate model {{to be used for}} induced flow is nonlinear potential flow theory (which is the basis of vortex-lattice methods). These nonlinear potential flow equations sometimes must be solved in real time––such as for real-time flight simulation, when observers are needed for controllers, or in preliminary design computations. In this paper, the major effects of nonlinearities on induced flow are studied for <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> in low-speed flight and hover. The approach is to use a nonlinear state-space model of the induced flow based on a Galerkin treatment of the potential flow equations...|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Martin Hollmann after a back injury (sustained in {{the crash of the}} ADI Condor) prevented him from flying his previous design (the ADI Sportster) on account {{of not being able to}} <b>lift</b> the <b>rotor</b> assembly.|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} formula derived for {{the calculation}} of the noise of moving bodies is applied to aerodynamic problems. The acoustic formulation is a time domain result suitable for slender wings and bodies moving at subsonic speeds. A singular integral equation is derived {{in terms of the}} surface pressure which must then be solved numerically for aerodynamic purposes. However, as the 'observer' is moved onto the body surface, the divergent integrals in the acoustic formulation are semiconvergent. The procedure for regularization (or taking principal values of divergent integrals) is explained, and some numerical examples for ellipsoids, wings, and <b>lifting</b> <b>rotors</b> are presented. The numerical results show good agreement with available measured surface pressure data...|$|R
