25|$|Power MOSFETs with lateral {{structure}} {{are mainly}} used in high-end audio amplifiers and high-power PA systems.

Vertical MOSFETs are designed for switching applications.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their <b>linear</b> <b>region,</b> MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E
40|$|Granular {{potato starch}} and {{amylopectin}} potato starch were methylated in aqueous suspension to molar substitutions (MS) up to 0. 29. A method {{was developed to}} determine the MS of both branched and <b>linear</b> <b>regions.</b> After exhaustive digestion of the methylated starches with alpha-amylase, the highly branched fraction {{with a degree of}} polymerisation (DP) > 8 was separated from the linear oligomers by selective precipitation of the former in methanol. The substitution levels of branched and <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> were determined. It was found that methylation takes place preferably at the branched regions of amylopectin and that amylose is higher substituted than <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> of amylopectin. The distribution of methyl substituents in trimers and tetramers was determined by FABMS and compared to the outcome of a statistically random distribution.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Tafel {{polarisation}} {{method is}} widely used in corrosion studies but relies heavily on the accurate extrapolation of the <b>linear</b> <b>regions.</b> To eliminate the ambiguity in the linear extrapolation, the present study develops a quantitative method based on piecewise linear regression analysis. In this method, the entire polarisation data is divided into small sub-intervals and variation in the regression coefficient and linearity coefficient values are observed. Consistency in these values serves as a quantitative indicator of the <b>linear</b> Tafel <b>regions.</b> The method described is then demonstrated in potentiodynamic polarisation measurement of Al/NaCl (0. 5 M) and Zn/KOH (1. 0 M) systems. The piecewise linear regression analysis positively identified the <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> from the polarisation branches and thus provided more accurate corrosion parameters of the systems...|$|R

2500|$|If drain-to-source voltage is increased, {{this creates}} a {{significant}} asymmetrical change {{in the shape of}} the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain. The shape of the inversion region becomes [...] "pinched-off" [...] near the drain end of the channel. If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in saturation mode; although some authors refer to it as active mode, for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions. The saturation mode, or the region between ohmic and saturation, is used when amplification is needed.

This observation stands in sharp distinction {{to the behavior}} of other branched polymers. The highly ordered nature of the starch granule results from the non-random nature of the branching and the non-random distribution of the <b>linear</b> <b>regions.</b> Stable double helices of two <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> of glucan chains are {{the basis for the}} regular packing in a crystalline array.

Results show that the temperature dependence of the strain relaxations can be separated into three <b>linear</b> <b>regions.</b> After passivation, an additional in-plane tensile strain is observed.

The <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> in the temperature dependence of strain vary after the passive layer deposited on the heterostructure.

40|$|Instruction {{scheduling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important phases of compilation for high-performance processors. A compiler typically divides a program into multiple regions of code and then schedules each region. Many past e orts have focused on <b>linear</b> <b>regions</b> such as traces and superblocks. The linearity of these regions can limit speculation, leading to underutilization of processor resources, especially on wideissue machines. A type of non-linear region called a treegion is presented in this paper. The formation and scheduling of treegions takes into account multiple execution paths, and the larger scope of treegions allows more speculation, leading to higher utilization and better performance. Multiple scheduling heuristics for treegions are compared against scheduling for several types of <b>linear</b> <b>regions.</b> Empirical results illustrate that instruction scheduling using treegions | treegion scheduling | holds promise.

5000|$|Every {{electrode}} has a {{range of}} scan rates called the <b>linear</b> <b>region.</b> The response to a reversible redox couple in the <b>linear</b> <b>region</b> is a [...] "diffusion controlled peak" [...] which can be modeled with the Cottrell equation. The upper limit of the useful <b>linear</b> <b>region</b> is bound by an excess of charging current combined with distortions created from large peak currents and associated resistance. The charging current scales linearly with scan rate while the peak current, which contains the useful information, scales with the square root of scan rate. As scan rates increase, the relative peak response diminishes. Some of the charge current can be mitigated with RC compensation and/or mathematically removed after the experiment. However, the distortions resulting from increased current and the associated resistance cannot be subtracted. These distortions ultimately limit the scan rate for which an electrode is useful. For example, a working electrode with a radius of 1.0 mm is not useful for experiments much greater than 500 mV/s.|$|E
