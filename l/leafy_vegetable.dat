5|$|Parts of Varanasi are {{contaminated}} with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal. Studies of wastewater from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation {{as a way}} that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is palak, a popular <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetable</b> which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which people then eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make polluted water attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to the farms as wastewater.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetable,</b> lettuce has {{had a number of}} uses in ancient (and even some more modern) times as a medicinal herb and religious symbol. For example, ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women. The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency. In contrast, the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency, and served it during funerals (probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis' death), and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility. Lettuce has mild narcotic properties; it was called [...] "sleepwort" [...] by the Anglo-Saxons because of this attribute, although the cultivated L. sativa has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins. This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones which are found in the white liquid (latex) in the stems of lettuce, called lactucarium or [...] "lettuce opium".|$|E

The objectives of this research were a) to identify and document the traditional <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> and spices of Ebonyi State, and b) to assess their nutritional values with a view of enhancing their selection as components of cooked food. Market and field surveys were carried out for traditional <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> and spices in three major clans in Ebonyi North senatorial zone, Ebonyi State: Izzi, Izhia and Ngbo clans.

40|$|Sun-drying {{of green}} <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> is popularly practised in many homes in Nigeria, {{as a way}} of {{preserving}} green <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> for future use. This project sought to investigate the effect of this method of preservation of vegetables on the antioxidant phytoconstituent (Vitamin C and Total phenol) and activity (reducing property and free radical scavenging ability) of some commonly consumed green <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> in Nigeria namely Structium sparejanophora (Ewuro-odo), Amarantus cruentus (Atetedaye), Telfairia occidentalis (Ugu), Baselia allia (Amunu tutu), Solanum macrocarpon (lgbagba), Corchorus olitorius (Ewedu), Vernonia amygdalina (Ewuro) and Occimum graticimum (Efinrin). The edible portions of the green <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> were sun-dried for seven days before determining the Vitamin C and total phenol content, as well as the reducing property and free radical scavenging ability.

40|$|The {{value of}} wild edible {{vegetables}} in food security {{has not been}} given sufficient attention in South Africa. Consequently, there are no formal interventions that seek {{to encourage people to}} use traditional vegetables as sources of essential nutrients.

40|$|Abstract. Once <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> are picked, {{metabolism}} and inoculating microbes affect {{the quality of}} the products badly. This paper included a brief introduction on the various factors affecting the freshness and shelf-life of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables,</b> with 3 types of treatments: antimicrobial gas or washing solutions (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacetic acid, chlorine, electrolyzed oxidizing water, and silver solution), that are broadly applied on post-harvest <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> that help to reduce both spoilage microorganisms and pathogens. <b>Leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> {{are an important part of}} a daily diet which provide various vitamins and minerals essential for growth and health, such as vitamin A and iron. However, after harvesting them, the most spoilage of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables</b> are caused by microbial activity. Thus, there is a need for a freshness-keeping technology that can be applied during storage and transport. Various methods have been developed to preserve the freshness of <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Most freshness preserving methods focus on reducing or inhibiting microbial population, growth and activity, with more attention being placed in reducing and inhibiting food-borne pathogens such as Eschericia coli, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Ozone (O 3) O 3 can be used as a relatively safe fruit and vegetable sanitizer as O 3 spontaneously decompose into nontoxic compounds, such as oxygen. By attacking cell envelopes, leakage of cell contents resulted in cell lysis; by attacking enzymes, O 3 interrupts the enzyme activity of microorganisms; while attacking the nucleic materials, O 3 interferes with the transcription activity of microorganisms [1] O 3 can be used to inhibit pathogens on <b>leafy</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Sing...|$|R
