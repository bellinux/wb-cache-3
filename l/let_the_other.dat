5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith refused to <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} now of the original three who had signed with Mercury). On top of that in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were stolen. The theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May entirely with borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up to the audience.|$|E
5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring {{from the top of the}} cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In August 1946, Torsten Nilsson {{suggested}} merging Aerotransport and SILA, {{but this}} had been rejected by both companies. A meeting was held on 28 May 1947 with the main owners of SILA, where Nilsson proposed a 50–50 state–private ownership in a merged company. While both parties saw the advantage of merging to rationalize operations, neither party was willing to <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> receive the chair. At the time, Aerotransport had just ordered ten DC-6 and was planning to start intercontinental flights to Africa and Asia. The minister appointed Torsten Nothin to lead a board to make a recommendation, and then negotiate with SILA's owners for a merger. One issue was that the Swedes perceived that the privately owned DDL and DNL would not agree with a nationalization of SILA. The Swedish government chose not to contact the two other social democratic Scandinavian governments about partially nationalizing their own flag carriers.|$|E

After Evan Lewis' death, Kimberly Corman visits Clear inside Stonybrook Mental Institution and asks for her help {{concerning}} the safety of the Route 23 pileup survivors: Officer Thomas Burke, Kat Jennings, Rory Peters, Eugene Dix as well as Nora Carpenter and her son Tim. While she does inform Kimberly of what she knows about Death, she's still too distraught over Alex's death and induces Kimberly to <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> survivors perish and save only herself. Nevertheless, after Tim dies, she changes her mind and accompanies Kimberly with Thomas to Bludworth, who informs them the equilibrium of Death and [...] "new life", implying their salvation upon the unborn son of survivor Isabella Hudson. The three of them gather the remaining survivors to Thomas' apartment but despite Clear's and Kat's attempts to save her, Nora gets decapitated by an elevator.|$|E

500|$|Davis's {{reputation}} among ex-Confederates {{was restored}} {{by the book}} and by his warm reception on his tour of the region in 1886 and 1887. In numerous stops, he attended Lost Cause ceremonies, where large crowds showered him with affection and local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. Such events helped the South {{come to terms with}} its defeat and continued for decades after the war. The Meriden Daily Journal stated that Davis, at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, urged southerners to be loyal to the nation. He said, [...] "United you are now, and if the Union is ever to be broken, <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side break it." [...] Davis stated that men in the Confederacy had successfully fought for their own rights with inferior numbers during the Civil War and that the northern historians ignored this view. Davis firmly believed that Confederate secession was constitutional. The former Confederate president was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.|$|E
500|$|Stage 19 was {{the first}} of two {{consecutive}} summit finishes. The stage was won by Aru, who attacked early in the final climb. Contador was content to <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> riders dictate the pace in the chasing group, which finished over a minute behind Aru. Landa finished in the same group; Aru therefore moved back ahead of him into second place overall. Aru won again on stage 20, the final difficult stage of the Giro. Contador was isolated from his teammates early in the first of the day's two climbs. The roads towards the top of the climb – the [...] – were gravel. Landa attacked around this point and Contador was unable to follow. With Contador struggling, the other riders in the group attacked. Contador was a minute behind them at the summit, with Landa further ahead. At the foot of the final climb, Landa was ordered by his team to wait for Aru with the hope that, by working together, the two riders could put enough time into Contador to win the Giro. Aru attacked in the final kilometres of the final climb to Sestriere and won the stage. Landa was 24 seconds behind. Despite losing over two minutes, Contador retained his race lead.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{joined a}} squad which {{featured}} Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West, along with backup center Mel Counts, forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented 5'11" [...] guard Johnny Egan. The {{lack of a}} second guard next to West (and thus, the lack of speed and quickness) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft, he said: [...] "Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [...] size...but if I don't play him, we look {{like a bunch of}} trucks." [...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> guy one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever". Laker Keith Erickson observed that [...] "Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry...and that is not {{a good way to get}} on Wilt's side...that relationship was doomed from the start." ...|$|E

A Clique usually consists of a Vortrab [...] (vanguard), the Pfeifer (pipers), the Tambourmajor (drum major) and the Tambouren (drummers). Except on Cortège, the Cliques do not follow fixed routes, and it is thus very common for different Cliques to cross paths. In that case, one Clique will stop and <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Clique pass. Spectators, on the other hand, will be politely guided off the route by the Vortrab.|$|E
2500|$|The Etruscan-Roman {{adaptation}} of the Greek temple model to place the main emphasis on the front façade and <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> sides of the building harmonize with it {{only as much as}} circumstances and budget allow has generally been adopted in Neoclassical architecture, and other classically derived styles. [...] In these temple fronts with columns and a pediment are very common for the main entrance of grand buildings, but often flanked by large wings or set in courtyards. [...] This flexibility has allowed the Roman temple front to be used in buildings made {{for a wide variety of}} purposes. [...] The colonnade may no longer be pushed forward with a pronaus porch, and it may not be raised above the ground, but the essential shape remains the same. Among thousands of examples are the White House, Buckingham Palace, and St Peters, Rome; in recent years the temple front has become fashionable in China.|$|E
