5|$|Below is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{managers}} Linfield have appointed {{during the}} club's history. In {{the early years}} after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. Since then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed in the 40 years since Billy Campbell's departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds {{the record for the}} longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, each having led the club to 31 trophies – a combined 62 major honours between them.

5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> official New Zealand geographical names.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> things he wants to do before death.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrender}} of Isle de France marked the final British {{operation of the}} campaign and the capture of the last French territory east of Africa. The island was restored to its pre-1715 name of Mauritius and the towns renamed under Decaen (such as Port Napoleon) were restored to their pre-Revolutionary names. Governor Robert Townsend Farquhar of Île Bourbon was placed in administrative control of the island, Île Bourbon taken over by Keating. Although the French garrison was repatriated, the invaders captured six French frigates (Manche, Astrée, Bellone and Minerve, Iphigénie and Néréide) and several smaller warships (the corvette Victor, the brig Entreprenant, the aviso Lutin and schooner-aviso Mouche n°23) in the various harbours of Isle de France, as well as 24 merchant ships. Lloyd's List published a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> vessels captured, military and civilian, on 15 February 1811. The British also seized 209 heavy cannon.|$|E

Though India were eliminated early, they set the ODI record for the highest victory margin in their 257 run win over Bermuda. In their match against Netherlands, Herschelle Gibbs (South Africa) created ODI and International cricket record when he hit sixes off all six deliveries in Daan van Bunge's over. In the Super 8 stage games, Lasith Malinga (Sri Lanka) created ODI record when he took four wickets in four consecutive deliveries in a losing effort against South Africa.

Glenn McGrath established a new Cricket World Cup record for the most number of wickets (26) and also finished his ODI career with the most number of wickets in World Cup history (71). The number of sixes in the overall tournament (373) was 40% higher than the previous record holder, the 2003 Cricket World Cup (266). The tournament also saw 32 century partnerships (previous record of 28 during the 1996 Cricket World Cup) and 10 batsmen over 400 runs (previous record of 4 during the 2003 Cricket World Cup).|$|E
