5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

She was aware of being a good deal less accessible than the previous spring, for Mesdames de Brecourt and de Cliche--the former indeed more than the latter--occupied many of her hours. In spite of her having held off, to Gaston, from a premature intimacy with his sisters, she spent whole days in their company--they had so much to tell her of how her new life would shape, and it seemed mostly very pleasant--and she thought nothing could be nicer than that in these intervals he should give himself to her father, and even to Delia, as had been his wont.|$|E
