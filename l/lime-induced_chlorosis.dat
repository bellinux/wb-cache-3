In horticulture, iron chelate {{is often referred to as}} 'sequestered iron' and is used as a plant tonic, often mixed with other nutrients and plant foods (e.g. seaweed). It is recommended in ornamental horticulture for feeding ericaceous plants like Rhododendrons if they are growing in calcareous soils. The Sequestered iron is available to the ericaceous plants, without adjusting the soil's pH, and thus <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis</b> is prevented.|$|E
40|$|Several {{plant species}} grown in {{calcareous}} soils in arid and semiarid regions are iron-deficient, a condition known as <b>lime-induced</b> iron <b>chlorosis,</b> or simply as iron chlorosis. The nutritional status of perennial plants is commonly evaluated by leaf analysis. However, {{there is often}} no correlation between iron in leaves and degree of chlorosis, and therefore leaf analysis presents serious limitations as a technique to evaluate <b>lime-induced</b> iron <b>chlorosis.</b> Recently, a technique for the early prognosis of iron chlorosis based on floral analysis was developed for fruit trees to help prevent the development of iron deficiency and avoid losses in yield and quality. Correction of iron chlorosis is commonly carried out by massive applications of synthetic iron chelates to soils. Since iron is rapidly immobilised in the soil, this treatment has to be repeated each year, representing {{a major part of}} fertilizer costs. Environmental impacts of chelates in soils have not been properly investigated, but it is known that they also result in enhanced plant uptake of metals such as copper and nickel. Alternative, more environment-friendly treatments are being evaluated. In this article we concentrate on reviewing current methods to detect and correct iron chlorosis in fruit trees...|$|R

'Valencia late' grafted on Citrange Troyer] established on a calcareous soil {{in the south of}} Portugal, to investigate if flower analysis could be used to diagnose <b>lime-induced</b> iron <b>chlorosis.</b> In April, during full bloom, flowers and leaves were collected from 20 trees. Leaf samples were again collected from the same trees in May, June, July and August. Total chlorophyll was estimated in all the leaves sampled for foliar analysis, using a SPAD- 502 apparatus. Leaves and flowers were analysed for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu. Principal Component Analysis was used to evaluate the variation of nutrient concentrations in flowers, and linear regressions were established between these and the chlorophyll content of leaves 90 days after full bloom. Evaluation of the best-fit equation was carried out using separate data obtained from other groves. Variation in the pattern of floral mineral composition in the flowers showed contrasts between the increase in N, P and K and that of Ca, Fe and Zn, while the concentration of Mg, Mn and Ca varied synchronously. The ratio of Mg: Zn in flowers explained about half of the variation of chlorophyll in leaves later in the season. A ratio below 100 indicated that trees would develop iron chlorosis, while with a ratio above 200 leaves would remain green. An early prognosis of iron chlorosis based on floral analysis can benefit growers, since it allows them to apply treatments in time to prevent loss of fruit yield and quality due to iron chlorosis...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [54]- 57) Pin oaks (Quercus palustris Muench.) {{suffering from}} <b>lime-induced</b> interveinal <b>chlorosis</b> have been successfullytreated through soil acidification. However, soil acidification produces soluble salts which can have detrimental effects on trees. The {{intent of the}} research was to determine 1) if soil acidification lowered soil pH and produced soluble salts; 2) which of the soil acidification treatment patterns and seasons of application was most significant at re-greening chlorotic pin oaks; and 3) which spil acidification method and season produced the least detrimental impact {{on the health of}} the leaves. The study was conducted at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, on interveinally chlorotic pin oaks. The trees were divided into six groups and assigned a treatment based on acidification pattern type and season. Subsoil acidification consisted of the addition of 57 liters of sulfuric acid amended with 3 00 grams of manganese sulfate to either the two-inch or six-holes drilled eighteen inches deep. Surface treatments consisted of granular sulfur and aluminum sulfate applied at 4. 5 Kg per 30. 5 square meters. Spring treatments were implemented as: 1) several two-inch holes placed in two concentric ring^ around the tree with surface treatment; 2) control = no treatment; 3) four sixinch holes with surface treatment; 4) four six-inch holes without surface treatment; and 5) pressure-injected holes placed six inches below ground in two concentric rings around the tree with surface treatment. Summer treatments consisted of the four six-inch hole design without surface application. One half of the trees were irrigated for three days after the acidification treatment to induce leaching conditions. The effect of treatment type on leaf health was assessed through a comparison of means on a self-constructed index. Soil pHs and electrolytic conductivities were measured from soil cores extracted one week prior to and five weeks after treatment. The results show that l) soil acidification significantly lowers the soil pH and significantly increases soluble salts; 2) the response of the trees to a spring treatment of four six-inch holes with surface treatment differed significantly from the controls, but no other pairs of treatments differed; 3) the spring two-inch hole treatment was least damaging to leaf health; and 4) the summer treatment of four six-inch holes was the most damaging to leaf health.

Organic-matter amendments can prevent or correct Fe chlorosis in plants but the effect of endogenous soil organic matter (SOM) on this disorder is not known. The main subject of this work was to investigate the consequence of two contrasting levels of soil fertility on the nutritional status of an orange grove [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. cv. Valencia Late]. The field experiment was conducted in a commercial citrus grove using mature trees distributed in two plots with different values of SOM, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), but with the same level of active lime. The concentration of nitrogen (N), P, K, magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), Fe, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) in young and mature leaves and flowers was evaluated. The level of Mg and the Mg/Zn ratio in flowers from both plots, although significantly different, only indicated moderate Fe chlorosis, as predicted by a previously developed model, and was consistent with the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaves. However, nutrient partitioning between leaves of contrasting age was very different. Mature leaves from trees grown in the high-fertility plot (HF) had larger concentrations of N, P, and K but lower concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Mn than did those from the low-fertility plot (LF). Young leaves from the LF had more N, P, Mg, Cu, and Mn and less Ca and Fe than did those from the HF.

No relationship of prevalence or intensity of this chlorosis was linked to any one soil series. Field beans growing in the greenhouse in potted soil from sites of these chlorotic areas failed to become chlorotic. Field soil applications of large amounts of phosphorus failed to induce a chlorosis or have any significant effect on the yield of dry beans. Similar phosphorus treatments in the greenhouse failed to induce a chlorosis on soils where <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis</b> was found in the field. These phosphorus treatments in addition to iron soil treatments were evaluated in their effect on phosphorus-iron relationships in field beans separated into old leaves, new leaves, and stems and petioles. Patterns of precipitation of phosphorus in the below-ground area were caused by iron treatments. Phosphorus soil applications increased iron uptake with a possibility of iron-phosphorus precipitation in the above-ground parts. The soil management practice of heavy applications of phosphorus to the sugar beet crop preceding the bean crop is unlikely to cause chlorosis of beans through iron or phosphorus nutrition relationship.

This leads to the theory that iron is inactivated in both the soil and plant. Although no single factor has been found to adequately explain this physiological disease, many factors have been associated with it. Thorne, Wann, and Robinson (1950) observed that calcareous soils characterized by fine texture, high moisture content, poor aeration, and cool temperatures intensify the development of chlorosis in plants.

There are many factors associated with and influencing this form of iron chlorosis {{and because of this}} it has been very difficult to determine the relationship between the factors and chlorosis. There are high concentrations of bicarbonate in calcareous soils. Because of this high concentration, it was believed that the presence of the bicarbonate ion was causing chlorosis.

At this pH the solubility of iron is very low, and it was believed that chlorosis was a result of iron being insoluble at a high pH. Iron chlorosis has been induced in plants by increasing the phosphorus concentration in the growth medium. Iron phosphates have a low solubility and it was believed that the available iron was precipitated by the phosphates. The interference of metals such as calcium, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and copper appears to be a factor affecting the absorption of iron by plants.

Therefore active iron concentration and ferric-reducing capacity were investigated and determined on three clones chosen for their different tolerance showed in the trial. The screening revealed a different behaviour of the selections respect to Mr. S. 2 / 5. So morphological as physiological markers Showed that some myrobalan rootstocks (Mr. S. 1 / 3, 1 / 6 and 2 / 8) presented a lightly minor tolerance than Mr. S. 2 / 5. Weight increment and chlorophyll concentration were higher in Mr. S. 1 / 6, 2 / 5 and particularly in Mr. S. 2 / 8. On the contrary Mr. S. 1 / 6 and 2 / 3 showed low chlorophyll concentration and low RCEC in every stress condition. Active iron and ferric-reducing capacity were higher in Mr. S. 2 / 5 and 2 / 8 than in Mr. S. 2 / 3.

40|$|Chlorosis {{in plants}} has been {{recognized}} as a devastating disease for over one-hundred and fifty years. It is easily recognized by a yellowing of the plant foilage and {{is associated with a}} reduced chlorophyll synthesis. Chlorosis is found so frequently on calcareous soils that its cause is attributed at least in part to this soil factor. It is therefore referred to as <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis.</b> This type of chlorosis has become a serious problem, especially in many of the fruit-growing regions of Europe and the Western United States where the soils are calcareous. In Utah the disease is more destructive than any other nutritional disease that affect horticultural crops. The exact cause of <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis</b> is not known, nor has a satisfactory control been developed as yet. Many conditions found in high-lime soils have been studied with regard to chlorosis, yet the problem is not so simple as it may appear. Green and chlorotic plants are frequently found growing in the same field, and yet a chemical analysis of the two soils fails to indicate a significant difference between them. It is common in chlorotic orchards to see trees where some of the major branches produce chlorotic foilage while the remainder of the tree is healthy and green. The severity of chlorosis varies from tree to tree as well as from season to season. It has been found that the heavier textured soils which are poorly drained are more conductive to chlorosis than are the lighter textured soils. If the soil moisture is held near field capacity, chlorosis is much more severe than if the soil is allowed to approach the wilting point before irrigation. Recent studies have also shown that the bicarbonate ion in solution cultures can induce chlorosis and retard the uptake of iron by plants. Since these factors [...] high moisture, soil aeration, and bicarbonate ion concentration [...] are all interrelated, it seems that their relationship to chlorosis should be investigated more thoroughly. Workers in the past have failed to show a consistent correlation between either the oxygen or the carbon dioxide can be measured at the soil-root interface. this is after all {{the only place in the}} soil that is of great importance as far as the living plant is concerned. Since the severity of chlorosis increases under poorly aerated conditions on calcareous soils, this hypothesis has been advanced: The respired carbon dioxide is given off at the plant root as carbonic acid which in a calcareous soil reacts with calcium and magnesium carbonate to give an increased bicarbonate ion concentration in the root environment. The resulting increased concentration of bicarbonate may reduce the effective oxygen at the root and thereby disturb the normal respiration and active-ion absorption of the roots or the increased concentration of bicarbonate may affect the roots absorption and plant metabolism in some other manner. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of the bicarbonate ion and different aeration mixtures on chlorosis. A preliminary study was made to relate the composition of the soil solution taken from the field with different conditions associated with chlorosis...|$|E

In {{the last few}} years, the in vitro culture technique {{has been applied to}} test rootstocks for susceptibility to iron chlorosis and to study biochemical and molecular aspects of the syndrome. In this study in vitro shoot cultivation of quince rootstocks MA, BA 29 and pear cv. ‘Conference’ was used to unravel the relationship between iron deficiency, presence of bicarbonate, and growth development and chloroplast pigment behaviour. Stresses were obtained by using MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of FeNa- EDTA and/or KHCO 3. Substrate pH, shoot growth and development parameters, total leaf iron and photosynthetic pigment contents of plantlets were independently determined after 24 days of culture. The medium was acidified by the species under all stress conditions. Iron deficiency and bicarbonate condition led to different growth patterns and modular development among the genotypes. This reflects a different sensitivity and plastic adaptation to the elements of this stress. Iron concentration in leaves and the shoot apex of plantlets decreased in all genotypes. However, chloroplast pigments only decreased in quince plantlets under iron deficiency and bicarbonate condition while they did not change in pear plantlets. Our results demonstrate firstly that a plantlet without a root system, which is cultivated in vitro, is able to sense iron deficiency and bicarbonate enriched conditions and, consequently, activates biochemical and physiological responses. Secondly, acidification appears to be related to iron concentration in tissues of quince rootstocks and pear cultivar. Finally, chloroplast biochemical elements are strongly and differently regulated under both stress conditions and between genotypes...|$|E
40|$|Yield, tree growth, {{and fruit}} quality were {{measured}} for 'Fuerte ' and 'Ettinger ' cultivars of avocado on 'West Indian', 'Duke', 'Topa-Topa', and 'Mexicola ' rootstocks. From 1981, when cultivars were 10 {{years old to}} 1990, the highest cumulative yield per tree of 'Fuerte ' was recorded on 'Mexicola ' rootstock and the lowest on 'Duke'; whereas for 'Ettinger', the highest cumulative yield was recorded on 'West Indian ' rootstock and the lowest on 'Duke'. The individual fruits of 'Ettinger ' were significantly heavier than those of 'Fuerte ' on all rootstocks, but in neither cultivar did the rootstock affect mean fruit weight significantly. Although there were some small differences {{in the percentage of}} stone and oil content of fruit, these differences were not large enough to likely affect the market value of the fruit. The 'Fuerte ' trees were spreading in habit on all rootstocks, whereas 'Ettinger ' had an upright growth habit. Trees of both cultivars were most tolerant to <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis</b> when grown on 'West Indian ' rootstock. The avocado, Persea americana Miller, is a relatively new crop {{in many areas of the}} world outside its native range in the American subtropics, but it has frequently proved to be a very profitable commercial crop for both local consumption and export. It was brought to Cyprus in 1970 for trials at the southwest coastal part of the island where soil, water, and climatic conditions appeared to be favorable for growing avocado. The first planting was successful and the enterprise started to expand. The area of avocado in 1990 was 134 hectares and avocado production in the same year reached 800 t. The performance of two cultivars on four rootstocks for ten years as measured by growth, yield, and quality are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Chlorosis {{of plants}} {{from a lack}} of {{available}} iron {{is one of the most}} common plant nutrient problems of the calcareous soils of the west. The disease is characterized by a yellowing of the plant leaves and is accompanied, in severe cases, by a partial root death and premature defoliation (3). In addition to reducing growth, the disease greatly reduces the quality and yield of plants. Many types of plants are affected by iron chlorosis. In Hawaii and Porto Rico rice, sugar cane and pineapple are susceptible, while in California and Arizona, citrus trees are seriously affected. In Utah apples, peaches, plums, prunes, apricots, pears, grapes, raspberries and many ornamental plants are affected (27). The problem of iron chlorosis, therefore, is of great importance to agriculture in the west. Chlorosis has been studied for more than one hundred and fifty years, but until recently, little progress has been made toward finding the solution to the problem. Although these past studies have not solved the problem of iron chlorosis, they have shown many factors to be closely related to the occurrence of the disease. These factors include an unbalanced ratio of available manganese to iron in the growth medium (9, 23, 29); chlorotic leaves are high in potassium, nitrogen in the form of ammonia (21), and in ferric iron and are low in total calcium and ferrous iron in comparison with green leaves (12, 13, 14, 17, 25, 26). The climatic factors of light, soil temperature and soil moisture also appear to be of fundamental importance in chlorosis. It is a common observation that fruit trees are more chlorotic during the early spring when the temperature of the soil is low and the moisture level high. Many investigators have noted that chlorosis tends to be most severe in the poorly drained portions of fruit orchards when water tends to accumulate. However, the work on the affect of climatic conditions on chlorosis has been limited largely to observations. The purpose of this investigation was to study, under controlled conditions, the effect of light, soil temperature and soil moisture on a <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Quince is {{the most}} used {{rootstock}} in Italian pear orchards, but due to the its high susceptibility to calcareous soils it induces widespread chlorosis problems on the grafted pear cultivars. Until recently, the common breeding techniques have not allowed the simple production of tolerant quince selections. Thus, somaclonal variation, and the large genetic variability brought about during the in vitro processes, might be a suitable tool to obtain genotypes with better agronomic characteristics. The aim of the present research was to induce in vitro regeneration of quince shoots under Fe-limiting conditions from leaves (of quince clone ‘BA 29 ’), and subsequently to evaluate their tolerance to <b>lime-induced</b> <b>chlorosis.</b> Leaves of explants were placed onto MS medium supplemented with TDZ and NAA, and the selective pressure conditions were obtained by reducing the normal MS iron content and/or by adding different concentrations of potassium bicarbonate (KHCO 3). Selective conditions decreased both the percentage of shoot-forming leaves and {{the mean number of}} shoots per organogenetic leaf, as the iron content was reduced and/or the KHCO 3 content was increased. A discrete number of putative somaclones, showing a range of severe chlorosis symptoms compared to a wild type clone, were chosen by visual assessments, and further tests were conducted under reduced amounts of Fe and the presence of 1. 0 mM of KHCO 3 conditions. DB- 34 somaclone seemed to be the most promising one, because its chlorophyll content did not reduce as happened in the other somaclones and with the wild type clone. Stress conditions affected only the Fe 2 + content of the DB- 43 somaclone, even if under normal conditions the Fe 2 + content was much higher than with all the other accessions. On the contrary, the medium acidification capacity of all somaclones was influenced similarly by treatments. A preliminary in vivo test confirmed these results. Moreover, preliminary RAPDs analyses disclosed polymorphism within the somaclones and among them and the wt clone. The sequence of chloroplastic protein D 1, codified by the psbA gene, was determined in quince ‘BA 29 ’ and pear ‘Conference’ to predict its hypothetical functions. Sequences showed differences in length and in amino acidic composition. In quince, the main modification is located in the ‘ 191 ’ position where tyrosine substitutes histidine, causing a loss of one of the iron-binding sites...|$|E
