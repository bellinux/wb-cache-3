5000|$|With the River Lea {{flowing through}} the centre of Ware, {{transport}} by water was for many years a significant industry.

From the intuitive concept of impulse-sensitivity function, a phase-domain macromodel is deduced which is able to capture high-order synchronization effects. Novel closed-form expressions for the synchronization regions are thus presented. The proposed phase-domain macromodel and the expressions derived for synchronization-regions are very general since they apply to any oscillator topology...|$|R

50|$|Lock 8 {{near the}} south end of the Welland Canal at Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada is a guard <b>lock.</b> <b>Due</b> to the large expanse of shallow water in Lake Erie, changes in wind {{direction}} and force create water level changes as great as 11 feet (3.4 m) at Port Colborne.

40|$|Abstract: We {{experimentally}} demonstrate thermo-optic locking of a {{semiconductor laser}} to an integrated toroidal optical microcavity. The lock is maintained for time periods exceeding twelve hours, without requiring any electronic control systems. Fast control {{is achieved by}} optical feedback induced by scattering centers within the microcavity, with thermal <b>locking</b> <b>due</b> to optical heating maintaining constructive interference between the cavity and the laser. Furthermore, the optical feedback acts to narrow the laser linewidth, with ultra high quality microtoroid resonances offering the potential for ultralow linewidth on-chip lasers...|$|R

That means, the lock masonry is built of rubble and inferior undressed stone. Since that makes a rough surface which damages the boats, the locks were originally lined with wood to protect the boats. This wood sheathing had to be replaced. In time, some of the composite locks were lined with concrete, since the wood kept rotting.|$|R

40|$|The {{surface state}} of {{three-dimensional}} topological insulators represents a new quantum state characterized by topologically protected metallic state. In the surface state of topological insulators, {{it is expected}} that the spin direction of the carriers is perpendicularly locked to the carrier momentum (spin-momentum <b>locking).</b> <b>Due</b> to the spin-momentum locking, a charge current naturally induces spin polarization. Recently, we reported successful detection of the local magnetoresistance due to the spin-momentum locking by using a ferromagnetic Ni[80]Fe[20](Py) film/a bulk-insulating TI, Bi[1. 5]Sb[0. 5]Te[1. 7]Se[1. 3] (BSTS) interface.

25|$|Following {{a review}} of our {{guidelines}} for the longest dreadlock, we have taken expert advice and {{made the decision to}} rest this category.

Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately.

40|$|An adaptively {{stabilized}} monolithic {{finite element}} model is proposed to simulate the fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical behavior of porous media undergoing large deformation. We first formulate a finite-deformation thermo-hydro-mechanics field theory for non-isothermal porous media.

To avoid volumetric <b>locking</b> <b>due</b> to the incompressibility of solid skeleton, we introduce a modified assumed deformation gradient in the formulation for non-isothermal porous solids.
