In addition, ABox reasoning in description <b>logics</b> is not covered by the results from modal <b>logics.</b> In this paper, we extend the decidability transfer results from normal modal <b>logics</b> to a large class of description <b>logics.</b> To cover di erent description <b>logics</b> in a uniform way, we introduce abstract description systems, which {{can be seen as a}} common generalization of description and modal <b>logics,</b> and show the transfer results in this general setting...|$|R
40|$|Simple type {{theory is}} suited as {{framework}} for combining classical and non-classical <b>logics.</b> This claim {{is based on}} the observation that various prominent <b>logics,</b> including (quantified) multimodal <b>logics</b> and intuitionistic <b>logics,</b> can be elegantly embedded in simple type theory. Furthermore, simple type theory is sufficiently expressive to model combinations of embedded <b>logics</b> and it has a well understood semantics.

25|$|Inclusion/exclusion <b>logic</b> has {{the same}} {{expressive}} power as independence <b>logic,</b> already {{on the level of}} open formulas. Inclusion <b>logic</b> and exclusion <b>logic</b> are obtained by adding only inclusion atoms or exclusion atoms to first-order <b>logic,</b> respectively. Inclusion <b>logic</b> sentences correspond in expressive power to greatest fixed-point <b>logic</b> sentences; hence inclusion <b>logic</b> captures (least) fixed-point <b>logic</b> on finite models, and PTIME over finite ordered models.

40|$|The {{general idea}} of {{combining}} <b>logics</b> also involves {{the concept of}} break-ing <b>logics</b> into families of <b>logics</b> with lower semantical complexity. The possible-translations semantics (PTS’s) are a particularly apt tool for analyzing and providing semantical meaning and algebraic contents to certain complex <b>logics</b> as paraconsistent <b>logics.</b> This paper characterizes PTS’s {{and the concept of}} algebraizability via PTS’s in categorial terms, extending the concept of finitely-algebraizable (or Blok-Pigozzi algebraiz-able) <b>logics...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss ground <b>logics,</b> a family of nonmonotonic modal <b>logics,</b> {{with the goal of}} using them in {{knowledge}} representation. Ground <b>logics</b> are based on the idea of minimizing the knowledge expressed by non-modal formulae. The nonmonotonic character of the <b>logics</b> can be described either by a fix-point equation or by means of a preference relation on possible-worlds models. We address both the epistemological and the computational properties of ground <b>logics.</b> We discuss their representational features and provide a thorough comparison with McDermott and Doyle <b>logics.</b> Then, we show that reasoning in ground <b>logics</b> is Π p 3 -hard, and prove that Π p 3 is also an upper bound for reasoning in the major ground <b>logics.</b> Moreover, we identify some special cases where the complexity of reasoning in ground <b>logics</b> is lower than in the general case.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} presenting non-classical <b>logics</b> in a modular and uniform way as labelled natural deduction systems. The use of algebras of truth-values as the labelling algebras of our deduction systems allows us to give generalized systems for multiple-valued <b>logics.</b> More specifically, our framework generalizes previous work on labelled deduction systems where labels represent worlds in the underlying Kripke structure: since we can take multiple-valued <b>logics</b> as meaning not only finitely or infinitely many-valued <b>logics</b> but also power-set <b>logics,</b> our framework allows us to present also <b>logics</b> such as modal, intuitionistic and relevance <b>logics,</b> thus providing a first step towards bring these <b>logics</b> with many-valued ones...|$|R

25|$|Lorenzo Peña (Spain, b. 1944). Has {{developed}} an original line of paraconsistent <b>logic,</b> gradualistic <b>logic</b> (also known as transitive <b>logic,</b> TL), akin to Fuzzy <b>Logic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike first-order <b>logic,</b> {{for which}} only one {{semantics}} is studied, {{there are several}} possible semantics for second-order <b>logic.</b> The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order <b>logic</b> is known as full semantics. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order <b>logic</b> stronger than first-order <b>logic.</b> In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order <b>logic</b> is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order <b>logic</b> that is sound and complete under full semantics.|$|E
50|$|T-norm fuzzy <b>logics</b> {{belong in}} broader classes of fuzzy <b>logics</b> and many-valued <b>logics.</b> In order to {{generate}} a well-behaved implication, the t-norms are usually required to be left-continuous; <b>logics</b> of left-continuous t-norms further belong {{in the class of}} substructural <b>logics,</b> among which they are marked with the validity of the law of prelinearity, (A &rarr; B) &or; (B &rarr; A). Both propositional and first-order (or higher-order) t-norm fuzzy <b>logics,</b> as well as their expansions by modal and other operators, are studied. <b>Logics</b> that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued Łukasiewicz <b>logics)</b> are usually included in the class as well.|$|R

As such, paradefinite <b>logics</b> should be both paraconsistent and paracomplete.

40|$|The {{major concern}} {{in the study of}} {{categories}} of <b>logics</b> is to describe condition for preservation, under the a method of combination of <b>logics,</b> of meta-logical properties. Our complementary approach to this field is study the "global" aspects of categories of <b>logics</b> in the vein of the categories,, _s studied in AFLM 3. All these categories have good properties however the category of <b>logics</b> does not allow a good treatment of the "identity problem" for <b>logics</b> (Bez) : for instance, the presentations of "classical logics" (e. g., in the signature {, ∨} and {',→'}) are not -isomorphic. In this work, we sketch a possible way to overcome this "defect" (and anothers) by a mathematical device: a representation theory of <b>logics</b> obtained from category theoretic aspects on (Blok-Pigozzi) algebraizable <b>logics.</b> In this setting we propose the study of (left and right) "Morita equivalence" of <b>logics</b> and variants. We introduce the concepts of <b>logics</b> (left/right) -(stably) -Morita-equivalent and show that the presentations of classical <b>logics</b> are stably Morita equivalent but classical <b>logics</b> and intuitionist <b>logics</b> are not stably-Morita-equivalent: they are only stably-Morita-adjointly related.

25|$|The {{concept of}} logical form {{is central to}} <b>logic.</b> The {{validity}} of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional Aristotelian syllogistic <b>logic</b> and modern symbolic <b>logic</b> are examples of formal <b>logic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The syllogistic <b>logic</b> {{developed}} by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19thcentury, when {{interest in the}} foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic <b>logic</b> (now called mathematical <b>logic).</b> In 1854, George Boole published An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of <b>Logic</b> and Probabilities, introducing symbolic <b>logic</b> and the principles {{of what is now}} known as Boolean <b>logic.</b> In 1879, Gottlob Frege published Begriffsschrift, which inaugurated modern <b>logic</b> with the invention of quantifier notation. From 1910 to 1913, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell published Principia Mathematica on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic <b>logic.</b> In 1931, Gödel raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and <b>logic</b> ceased to focus on such issues.|$|E
25|$|There are systems {{weaker than}} full first-order <b>logic</b> {{for which the}} logical {{consequence}} relation is decidable.

Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the guarded fragment of first-order <b>logic,</b> as well as two-variable <b>logic.</b> The Bernays–Schönfinkel class of first-order formulas is also decidable.

40|$|Abstract. The DL-Lite {{family of}} {{tractable}} description <b>logics</b> lies between the semantic web languages RDFS and OWL Lite. In this paper, {{we present a}} probabilistic generalization of the DL-Lite description <b>logics,</b> {{which is based on}} Bayesian networks. As an important feature, the new probabilistic description <b>logics</b> allow for flexibly combining terminological and assertional pieces of probabilistic knowledge. We show that the new probabilistic description <b>logics</b> are rich enough to properly extend both the DL-Lite description <b>logics</b> as well as Bayesian networks. We also show that satisfiability checking and query processing in the new probabilistic description <b>logics</b> is reducible to satisfiability checking and query processing in the DL-Lite family. Furthermore, we show that satisfiability checking and answering unions of conjunctive queries in the new <b>logics</b> can be done in LogSpace in the data complexity. For this reason, the new probabilistic description <b>logics</b> are very promising formalisms for data-intensive applications in the Semantic Web involving probabilistic uncertainty.
