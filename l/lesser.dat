5|$|A pure browser, the <b>lesser</b> kudu {{feeds on}} foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The <b>lesser</b> kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The <b>lesser</b> kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The <b>lesser</b> kudu inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, {{the genus}} Ammelaphus was {{established}} {{for just the}} <b>lesser</b> kudu by American zoologist Edmund Heller, the type species being A. strepsiceros. However, today the <b>lesser</b> kudu is placed in Tragelaphus instead of Ammelaphus.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called <b>lesser</b> functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These <b>lesser</b> functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; <b>lesser</b> functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the <b>lesser</b> functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local <b>lesser</b> functionaries.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> kudu browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The <b>lesser</b> kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the <b>lesser</b> kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The <b>lesser</b> kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the <b>lesser</b> kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the <b>lesser</b> kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the <b>lesser</b> kudu.|$|E

5|$|Gustav {{initially}} {{appeared as}} a significant threat to the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles, which was devastated by Hurricane Hugo about a year prior. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued on August 27, but all were discontinued later that day as Gustav turned northward. The only effects reported on the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles were large swells, light winds, and light rains. Following the passage of Gustav, no damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The {{results showed that the}} tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the <b>lesser</b> kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the <b>lesser</b> kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that <b>lesser</b> kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It {{is larger than}} the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lesser</b> Hampden is a {{football}} stadium located immediately beside {{the western end}} of Hampden Park. The ground was constructed in the early 1920s after additional ground was purchased to expand the main stadium. Queen's Park proposed in 1990 to sell off <b>Lesser</b> Hampden to fund redevelopment works on the main stadium, but this was rejected by planners. It is used by Queen's Park for training, reserve team matches and youth football. <b>Lesser</b> Hampden was refurbished for use as a warm-up area during the 2014 Commonwealth Games.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw or Guadeloupe macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the <b>Lesser</b> Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the <b>Lesser</b> Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E

5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} developed on December7 about 705mi (1735km) east-northeast of the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles as a tropical depression. It tracked generally westward, briefly intensifying into a tropical storm on December8. The next day it dissipated about 270mi (435km) north of the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} a {{significant}} breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of <b>lesser</b> black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), 400 pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus), 2pairs of great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) and varying numbers of common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopodidae). The feeding habits of <b>lesser</b> black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> {{coat of arms}} of Sweden (lilla riksvapnet) is emblazoned: Azure, {{with three}} coronets Or, ordered two above one; Crowned with a royal crown. This is the emblem used by the {{government}} of Sweden and its agencies; it is, for example, embroidered on all Swedish police uniforms. Any representation consisting of three crowns ordered two above one is considered to be the <b>lesser</b> coat of arms, and its usage is therefore restricted by Swedish Law, Act 1970:498.|$|E

5|$|The <b>lesser</b> kudu is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} {{leader or}} any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the <b>lesser</b> kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. <b>Lesser</b> kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture flies solitarily, {{with wings}} {{held in a}} {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The <b>lesser</b> yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles {{encompasses}} the music of this chain of small islands making up the eastern and southern portion of the West Indies. <b>Lesser</b> Antillean music {{is part of the}} broader category of Caribbean music; much of the folk and popular music is also a part of the Afro-American musical complex, being a mixture of African, European and indigenous American elements. The <b>Lesser</b> Antilles' musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India. In many ways, the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles can be musically divided based on which nation colonized them.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Dorothy {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August13. It tracked generally westward, developing into a tropical depression on August17 about 1375mi (2210km) east of Tobago in the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles. Two days later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy, while located about 500mi (800km) east of the <b>Lesser</b> Antilles, with its intensity confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} species are {{classified}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. The populations {{of all three}} are large, {{with that of the}} magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and <b>lesser</b> frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and <b>lesser</b> frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct.|$|E
