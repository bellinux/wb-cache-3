5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1842, the {{existing}} route became impassable, and Clifton undertook {{the creation of the}} proposed coastal route. He sent his company's men to clear the path and make a road. The first report of the new road was on 19 October, praising the new route but deriding the almost impassable obstacles presented by the large rivers en route. The Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November, and the speed of the new route allowed almost daily communication. It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. The ferry was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> the ferry. The government later appropriated the ferry on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock. Ten years later, the ferry service was made available to the public free of charge.|$|E

25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{worked so}} well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was owned by a railroad, {{with only a few}} exceptions. Trailer Train became TTX Company in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> other railroad rolling stock. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.|$|E

25|$|Back in Aphrodito, Dioscorus married, had children, {{and pursued}} a career similar to his father's: acquiring, <b>leasing</b> <b>out,</b> and {{managing}} property, and helping {{in the administration}} of the village. His first dated appearance in the papyrus is 543. Dioscorus had the assistant of the defensor civitatis of Antaeopolis examine the damage done by a shepherd and his flock to a field of crops, which was owned by the Monastery of Apa Sourous but managed by Dioscorus.|$|E
25|$|Chung Keng Quee {{apart from}} being a man of vision was also a great risk-taker. Sir Hugh Low in his own notes {{describing}} negotiations over the <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> of the Perak revenue farms compares Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thian Teik. Chung Keng Quee {{had told him that}} he needed five thousand more coolies to make the venture successful while Khoo Thian Teik had talked of two or three hundred more. Not only did he get his coolies from China, Ah Quee also employed coolies from India.|$|E
25|$|The company {{struggled}} after World War I: {{the loss}} of military contracts sharply reduced demand for luminescent paint and dials, and in 1922, high-grade ore was discovered in Katanga, driving all U.S. suppliers out of business except U.S. Radium and the Standard Chemical Company. U.S. Radium consolidated its operations in Manhattan in 1927, <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> the Orange plant and selling off other property. But demand for luminescent products surged again during World War II; by 1942, it employed as many as 1000 workers, and in 1944 {{was reported to have}} radium mining, processing, and application facilities in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Whippany, New Jersey; and North Hollywood, California as well as New York City.|$|E

25|$|As {{the western}} reaches of Virginia were {{developed}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, the vast differences in the agricultural basis, cultural, and transportation needs of the area became a major issue for the Virginia General Assembly. In the older, eastern portion, slavery contributed to the economy. While planters were moving away from labor-intensive tobacco to mixed crops, they still held numerous slaves and their <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> or sales was also part of their economic prospect. Slavery had become an economic institution upon which planters depended. Watersheds on most of this area eventually drained to the Atlantic Ocean. In the western reaches, families farmed smaller homesteads, mostly without enslaved or hired labor. Settlers were expanding the exploitation of resources: mining of minerals and harvesting of timber. The land drained into the Ohio River Valley, and trade followed the rivers.|$|E
25|$|The canons {{were much}} {{employed}} {{in managing the}} abbey's substantial estates, which {{seem to have been}} worked mainly by indentured servants and later by wage labour. A fairly high proportion of the abbey's land was kept in demesne, cultivated from granges. The Lilleshall estate alone had four of these and there was a ring of further granges in Shropshire and Staffordshire, with two outlying at Blackfordby and Grindlow. The grange at Blackfordby seems to have absorbed {{a good deal of time}} and labour, with canons often staying there. There was even a chapel on site, with mass said three times a week. This was strictly irregular, as it was considered perilous to the soul for a canon to reside anywhere alone, and there were complaints about it from the Bishop of Lichfield. However, the nature of the abbey's estates meant that canons would often require leave to travel. Both this and the increasingly unfavourable agrarian conditions and labour market of the 14th century meant that direct exploitation of demesnes was gradually reduced in favour of <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> land.|$|E
25|$|Schrader {{made his}} NASCAR debut in 1984 in the Cup Series, <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> the No. 64 Ford {{normally}} owned and driven by Elmo Langley. He ran his first race at Nashville, qualifying 27th and finishing 19th in a 30-car field. He ran four more races {{out of the}} 64 that season, his best finish a seventeenth at North Wilkesboro Speedway. In 1985, he signed to drive the No. 90 Ultra Seal-sponsored Ford for Junie Donlavey full-time. He had three 10th-place finishes and finished 16th in points, winning {{rookie of the year}} honors. In 1986, Red Baron Frozen Pizza became the team's new primary sponsor, and Schrader had four top 10s, including a best finish of seventh twice, and finished 16th in the standings in points for the second consecutive season. In 1987, Schrader won his first career pole, at the TranSouth 500, where he led 19 laps and finished fifth, his first top five. He had nine other top 10s and finished 10th in the final standings. He also made his Busch Series debut, at North Carolina Speedway, finishing fifth in his own No. 45 Red Baron-sponsored Ford at North Carolina Speedway.|$|E

The church posted an $8 million financial loss in fiscal 2003, and in 2004 cut 125 jobs, a quarter of the staff, at the Christian Science Monitor. Conversely, Davis noted that [...] "the financial situation right now is excellent" [...] and stated that the church was not facing financial problems.|$|E
2500|$|On Wayandas {{return from}} Alaska, Captain White {{recommended}} {{the establishment of}} a federal reserve on the main Pribilof islands of St. George and St. Paul, to protect both the seals and the Aleut population. The government took his advice in 1870, <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> hunting on the islands to one firm, the Alaska Commercial Company. Though the Revenue Service did a [...] "creditable job" [...] of trying to protect the seals, the federal reserve area was not large enough to provide adequate protection. White's report on the problems caused by alcohol in the region may also have influenced the government's decision to ban the importation of alcohol into Alaska the same year.|$|E
2500|$|Through his will, Știrbei {{had made}} his Junimist friend Ghermani a {{caretaker}} of his younger children, with Triandafil as their recommended adviser. Most of his estate was eventually inherited by Barbu Alexandru, who spelled his name as [...] "Știrbey" [...] and was known locally as the [...] "White Prince". He greatly increased the family's wealth with his intensive animal farming, his investment in cash crops, and his takeover of banking concerns, also <b>leasing</b> <b>out</b> the family's Teleorman estates. He enjoyed political influence over the new establishment, campaigning with the Conservatives alongside his brother George (who served {{for a while in}} the Assembly for Dolj), but later switching sides. Eliza also divorced Marghiloman and, in 1907, married the National Liberal leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Their sisters also married into the elite: Zoe to George Cretzianu, Maria (Marieta) to Gheorghe Balș, Adina to General George Moruzi. Zoe died young, in 1896, leaving twins Alexandru and George G.
