25|$|The form of home {{automation}} called assistive domotics focuses on {{making it possible}} for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as {{home automation}} for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once in Rome, Vanunu and Bentov took {{a taxi to}} an {{apartment}} in the old quarter of the city, where three waiting Mossad operatives overpowered Vanunu and injected him with a paralyzing drug. Later that night, a white van hired by the Israeli embassy arrived, and Vanunu was carried to it on a stretcher. The van drove to La Spezia, where the agents took Vanunu to a dock, bound him to a stretcher, and put him on a waiting speedboat, which then rendezvoused with the waiting Noga anchored off the coast. The crew of the Noga were told to assemble in the ship's common room and <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> as Vanunu and the Mossad agents were taken aboard. The ship then departed for Israel.|$|E

25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, they also need to pick up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> forcing an evacuation.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are simple, written as an {{invitation}} to dance with the singer. Despite the simple lyrics, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. Similar to Madonna's previous single [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984), a lyrical hook is also present in [...] "Into the Groove", directed at shy girls. The line [...] "At night I <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> so no-one else can see" [...] implied that Madonna was not as brazen as her provocative image suggested. According to Barker, the nostalgic people would instantly recognize the song's lyrics at night clubs. He added that the line, [...] "Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free," [...] expresses the freedom that a dance floor brings about, with the dancers happy to find freedom in the music. A neume is visible in the line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me", which Barker believed, blurred the boundaries of reality and brought one closer {{to the world of}} fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Merriam, scorned by the crew, {{finds that}} {{he can no longer}} <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to his cabin. Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam {{to try to get the}} support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) {{receives}} a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. [...] The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will send a message to the company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film.|$|E

500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
500|$|In Kingdom Hearts, Sora, Riku and Kairi plan {{to leave}} their home on the Destiny Islands to explore new worlds. However, they are {{separated}} when the island is attacked by the Heartless, leaving Sora alone with a key-shaped weapon called the Keyblade. Sora arrives at Traverse Town, where he discovers himself to be chosen by the Keyblade to eliminate the Heartless. Soon after, Sora meets Donald Duck and Goofy, who join forces with him under instruction from their missing king, Mickey Mouse, to follow the [...] "key". The three travel across worlds in their Gummi Ship in search of their missing friends, sealing the worlds' [...] "Keyholes" [...] {{along the way to}} protect them from being consumed by the Heartless. They are opposed by an alliance of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who seeks out the seven Princesses of Heart to unlock the Keyhole that leads to [...] "Kingdom Hearts", a repository of knowledge and power, and the source of all hearts. Riku, who has come under Maleficent's watch, fights with Sora on several occasions under the belief that Sora has replaced him with new friends. As the group travels to Hollow Bastion and defeat Maleficent, Sora finds Riku being possessed by Ansem, who reveals that Kairi's heart is in Sora's body. To save Kairi, Sora impales himself with Ansem's Keyblade, briefly transforming him into a Heartless before Kairi restores Sora to human form. After taking Kairi to safety, Sora, Donald and Goofy defeat Ansem at the now open door to Kingdom Hearts. Beyond the door, Mickey and Riku help Sora and his friends close it to prevent the Heartless within from escaping, with Mickey and Sora using their Keyblades to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Separated from their friends again, Sora, Donald and Goofy continue their quest to reunite with Riku and Mickey.|$|E

In a June 2009 issue of Rolling Stone, Oberst announced that he wanted to [...] "retire" [...] the Bright Eyes moniker, and would be making one final album with the band: [...] "It does feel like it needs to stop at some point. I'd like to clean it up, <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> say goodbye." ...|$|E

2500|$|Excessive {{alcohol intake}} is {{associated}} with impaired prospective memory. This impaired cognitive ability leads to increased failure to carry out an intended task at a later date, for example, forgetting to <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> or to post a letter on time. The higher the volume of alcohol consumed and the longer consumed, the more severe the impairments. One of the organs most sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption is the brain. In the United States approximately 20% of admissions to mental health facilities are related to alcohol-related cognitive impairment, most notably alcohol-related dementia. Chronic excessive alcohol intake is also associated with serious cognitive decline {{and a range of}} neuropsychiatric complications. The elderly are the most sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain. There is some inconclusive evidence that small amounts of alcohol taken in earlier adult life is protective in later life against cognitive decline and dementia. However, a study concluded, [...] "Our findings suggest that, despite previous suggestions, moderate alcohol consumption does not protect older people from cognitive decline." ...|$|E
