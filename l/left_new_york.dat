Encamped at Roach's Mills, Virginia, the 68th participated in the defense of Washington, losing three men in their first combat, a minor skirmish with a Confederate patrol.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he interrupted the filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E
5|$|Putting {{in at the}} Atlantic Basin Iron Works {{again in}} June, the ship was renamed USAHS Shamrock in August 1943. With the {{conversion}} complete, the new hospital ship <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in September for Gibraltar and the Mediterranean where she operated locally, calling often at Oran, Palermo, the southern beaches of France, Bizerte, and Naples. By mid-February 1944, Shamrock had transported 11,989 patients before departing Gibraltar for Charleston (via Bermuda), where she arrived in early March. After undergoing some repairs and alterations at Charleston, Shamrock sailed again for Gibraltar for another {{tour of duty in}} the Mediterranean area from May to September. After transporting over 6,000 patients during this mission, she returned via Horta, Azores, to Charleston in late September.|$|E
5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E

5|$|British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003. G-BOAG <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> to a fanfare {{similar to}} that given for Air France's F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, {{carrying}} VIP guests including former Concorde pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister. The final flight of a Concorde in the US occurred on 5 November 2003 when G-BOAG flew from New York's JFK Airport to Seattle's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight's permanent collection. The plane was piloted by Mike Bannister and Les Broadie, who claimed a flight time of three hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds, a record between the two cities. The museum had been pursuing a Concorde for their collection since 1984. The final flight of a Concorde worldwide took place on 26 November 2003 with a landing at Filton, Bristol, UK.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{to produce}} a {{complete}} feature film were pursued in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract. In August, Disney asked Stokowski's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film, which was initially titled The Concert Feature. The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic, and agreed he would be most suitable for the role. Disney did contact Taylor about the project, but by then work on Pinocchio, Bambi, and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy {{to work on the}} new feature. In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, leave to come to the studios as soon as possible. He <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a month's visit.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> for the final time, he told May that he was going to say goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E

5|$|Savage {{was born}} in Utica, New York, the son of Jane Moorhead Ewart and Richard Savage (1817–1903), a lawyer and {{manufacturer}} whose family {{had lived in the}} Utica area for years. The 1848 finding of gold in California, prompted Savage's father to join the California Gold Rush in 1850. Savage {{and the rest of his}} family <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in 1851 to join his father. They arrived in San Francisco in February 1852. Savage was among the first boys to attend public school in the new city, along with future poet Charles Warren Stoddard and the brothers Gus, Charles and Harry de Young who would found the San Francisco Chronicle. While the younger Savage was in school, his father helped discover the rich silver deposits of the Comstock Lode.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Yankees {{reached that}} year's World Series, but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves. Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City for California, leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team. Despite {{their status as}} the sole New York City-based franchise, the Yankees' 1958 {{attendance}} decreased from previous seasons as the team could not attract bereft Giants and Dodgers fans. In the 1958 World Series, the Yankees {{had an opportunity to}} avenge their defeat to the Braves. The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship. The Yankees were unable to defend their AL and World Series championships in 1959, as they ended up with a 79–75 record, their worst record since 1925, good for third place.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which <b>left</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of the Yankees and Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike.|$|E
