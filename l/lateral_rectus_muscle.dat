2500|$|Duane {{syndrome}} is most probably a miswiring {{of the eye}} muscles, causing some eye muscles to contract when they shouldn't and other eye muscles not to contract when they should. Alexandrakis and Saunders found that {{in most cases the}} abducens nucleus and nerve are absent or hypoplastic, and the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> is innervated by a branch of the oculomotor nerve. This view is supported by the earlier work of Hotchkiss et al. who reported on the autopsy findings of two patients with Duane's syndrome. In both cases the sixth cranial nerve nucleus and nerve was absent, and the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> was innervated by the inferior division of the third or oculomotor nerve. This misdirection of nerve fibres results in opposing muscles being innervated by the same nerve. Thus, on attempted abduction, stimulation of the lateral rectus via the oculomotor nerve will be accompanied by stimulation of the opposing medial rectus via the same nerve; a muscle which works to adduct the eye. Thus, co-contraction of the muscles takes place, limiting the amount of movement achievable and also resulting in retraction of the eye into the socket. They also noticed mechanical factors and considered them secondary to loss of innervation: During corrective surgery fibrous attachments have been found connecting the horizontal recti and the orbital walls and fibrosis of the lateral rectus has been confirmed by biopsy. This fibrosis can result in the lateral rectus being 'tight' and acting as a tether or leash. [...] Co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti allows the globe to slip up or down under the tight lateral rectus producing the up and down shoots characteristic of the condition.|$|E
40|$|Innervation to monkey {{and human}} <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> is {{segregated}} into well-defined superior and inferior zones, {{so that the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> may function as two parallel muscles under separate control.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{surgical}} outcomes between bilateral <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> (BLR) re‐recession and bilateral medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> (BMR) resection in recurrent exotropia. Methods: The medical records {{of patients with}} recurrent exotropia who underwent surgery for intermittent exotropia during the 6 years from January 2001 to December 2006 and followed up for more than 6 months were reviewed retrospectively. Results: In group A, BLR recessions was performed at the first surgery and BLR re‐recession was performed at the second surgery. In group B, BLR recession was performed at the first surgery and BMR resection at the second surgery. Success rates at the last follow‐up after the second operation were 81. 9 % in Group A and 83. 3 % in Group B, showing no statical {{difference between the two}} groups. In group A, no significant underaction of the BLR was noted. Success rates were not statistically different between the 2 mm re‐ recessed subgroup and 3 mm re‐recessed subgroup. Conclusions: The results support the notion that BLR re‐recession successfully corrects recurrent exotropia without producing significant limitation of abduction.

50|$|Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) {{can also}} result in diplopia. This {{is due to}} {{impairment}} in the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> which is innervated by the abducens nerve.|$|E
50|$|Damage to the abducens nucleus {{does not}} produce an {{isolated}} sixth nerve palsy, but rather a horizontal gaze palsy that affects both eyes simultaneously. The abducens nucleus contains two types of cells: motor neurons that control the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> on the same side, and interneurons that cross the midline and connect to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (which controls the medial rectus muscle of the opposite eye). In normal vision, lateral movement of one eye (<b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle)</b> is precisely coupled to medial movement of the other eye (medial rectus muscle), so that both eyes remain fixed on the same object.|$|E
50|$|The extraocular {{muscles are}} {{supplied}} mainly by {{branches of the}} ophthalmic artery. This is done either directly or indirectly, as in the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> via the lacrimal artery, a main branch of the ophthalmic artery. Additional branches of the ophthalmic artery include the ciliary arteries, which branch into the anterior ciliary arteries. Each rectus muscle receives blood from two anterior ciliary arteries, except for the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle,</b> which receives blood from only one. The exact number and arrangement of these cilary arteries may vary. Branches of the infraorbital artery supply the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles.|$|E
50|$|Convergence is {{the ability}} of the eye to {{simultaneously}} demonstrate inward movement of both eyes toward each other. This is helpful in effort to make focus on near objects clearer. Three reactions occur simultaneously; the eyes adduct, the ciliary muscles contract, and the pupils become smaller. This action involves the contraction of the medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> of the two eyes and relaxation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> The medial <b>rectus</b> attaches to the medial aspect of the eye and its contraction adducts the eye. The medial rectus is innervated by motor neurons in the oculomotor nucleus and nerve.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} implicated exotropia as {{a risk factor}} for schizophrenia. We {{determined}} whether schizophrenia biomarkers have abnormal levels of expression in extraocular muscles from patients with strabismus and explored whether differences in gene expression between medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> may explain the specific association of schizophrenia with exotropia but not esotropia. Samples from horizontal extraocular muscles were obtained during strabismus surgery and compared with age- and muscle type-matched normal muscles from organ donors. We used PCR arrays to identify differences in gene expression among 417 signaling molecules. We then focused on established schizophrenia-related growth factors, cytokines, and regulators of the extracellular matrix. Among 36 genes with significantly altered gene expression in dysfunctional horizontal <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> over one third were schizophrenia-related: CTGF, CXCR 4, IL 1 B, IL 10 RA, MIF, MMP 2, NPY 1 R, NRG 1, NTRK 2, SERPINA 3, TIMP 1, TIMP 2, and TNF (adjusted p value ≤  0. 016667). By PCR array, expression of three of these genes was significantly different in medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles,</b> while eleven were significantly altered in <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> Comparing baseline levels between muscle types, three schizophrenia-related genes (NPY 1 R, NTRK 2, TIMP 2) had lower levels of expression in medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles.</b> Despite the surprisingly large number of schizophrenia-related genes with altered gene expression levels in dysfunctional muscles, the lack of specificity for medial <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> undermines a model of shared, region-specific gene expression abnormalities between exotropia and schizophrenia, but rather suggests consideration of the alternative model: that exotropia-induced aberrant early visual experiences may enable and/or contribute as a causative factor to the development of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the change in}} ocular motility and muscle thickness measured with ultrasonography after intramuscular injection of bupivacaine and botulinum toxin A. METHODS: Eight patients (five female) were enrolled to measure ocular motility prior and 1, 7, 30 and 180 days after one injection of 2 ml of 1. 5 % bupivacaine and 2. 5 U of botulinum toxin A in agonist and antagonist muscles, respectively, of eight amblyopic eyes. Muscle thickness was measured prior and on days 1, 7 and 30 after injection using 10 -MHz ultrasonography (eyelid technique). RESULTS: Mean change in alignment was 10 prism diopters after 180 days (n= 6). An average increase of 1. 01 mm in muscle thickness was observed after 30 days of bupivacaine injection and 0. 28 mm increase was observed after botulinum toxin A injection, as measured by ultrasonography. <b>Lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> injected with bupivacaine had a mean increase of 1. 5 mm in muscle thickness. CONCLUSION: In this study, a change in ocular motility was observed after 180 days of intramuscular injection of bupivacaine and botulinum toxin in horizontal extraocular muscles. Overall, {{there was an increase}} of muscle thickness in both botulinum toxinum A and bupivacaine injected muscles after 30 days of injection when measured by ultrasonography. This change was more pronounced on <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> after bupivacaine injection...|$|R

50|$|The abducens nerve or {{abducent nerve}} (the sixth cranial nerve, {{also called the}} sixth nerve or simply CNVI) is a somatic efferent nerve that, in humans, {{controls}} the movement of a single muscle, the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the eye.|$|E

50|$|The abducens nerve {{controls}} {{the movement of}} a single muscle, the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> of the eye.

50|$|The brain exerts {{ultimate}} {{control over}} both voluntary and involuntary eye movements. Three cranial nerves carry {{signals from the}} brain to control the extraocular muscles.

50|$|The {{depressing}} {{action of}} superior oblique (making the eye look down towards the mouth) {{is most effective}} when the eye is in an adducted position. This is because as the eye is abducted (looks laterally), the contribution made by superior oblique to depression of the eye decreases, as the inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscle</b> causes this movement more directly and powerfully. The main muscle for abduction is the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus,</b> so although superior oblique contributes to a downwards and lateral eye movement, testing this motion would not be specific enough as inferior and <b>lateral</b> <b>recti</b> <b>muscles</b> would also be tested. Therefore, during neurological examinations, the superior oblique is tested by having the patient look inwards and downwards, testing only the depressing action of the muscle. This {{is a source of}} confusion on the subject as although clinical testing asks the patient to adduct and depress the eye, anatomically the muscle depresses and abducts it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{qualitative and quantitative}} investigation into {{the location of the}} motoneurons innervating the extra-ocular muscles of the rat. Injections of horseradish peroxidase, bisbenzimide, propidium iodide and DAPI-primuline were made either in one or simultaneously in two muscles. Unlike those of the cat, rabbit and monkey, the motoneurons which make up the oculomotor nucleus of the rat are not arranged in spatially separate subgroups belonging each to its corresponding extra-ocular muscle, but instead allow a high degree of superposition among the motor pools which they compose. The motoneurons innervating the <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> and inferior oblique muscles are all homolateral; those of the medial and inferior <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> are mainly homolateral with a few contralateral exceptions; and those of the superior rectus, levator palpebrae and superior oblique muscles are mainly contralateral with a small minority of homolateral exceptions. As well as from the main motor pools with which they are associated, the medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus, levator palpebrae, superior oblique and <b>lateral</b> <b>rectus</b> <b>muscles</b> all receive innervation from motoneurons lying among the fibres of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis. All these observations are supported by quantitative data...|$|R
