She had sometimes wondered what he wore at one end of that cross-pattern chain, for rock cutters do not usually adorn themselves with such trinkets, but, remembering Bransome's comments, she now understood what had happened just before the explosion. Geoffrey's quick eyes had noticed something unusual in her air, and his old reckless spirit, breaking through all restraint, prompted him to say: ...|$|R

50|$|To {{allow the}} Jubilee line to be {{extended}} to Stratford a new fleet of trains was ordered in 1992 to replace the 1983 Stock running on the line, {{as the cost of}} a new fleet was calculated to be the same as refurbishing the older trains to run with the newer trains. The resulting 1996 Stock, and the first train was delivered in 1996. The Northern line stock also needed replacement and the 1995 Stock replaced the mixture of 1959, 1962 and 1972 Mk I Stock trains that were used on the line, the first trains arriving in 1998. These trains are similar, composed of 17.7 m long cars with externally <b>hung</b> <b>doors,</b> but with differing traction equipment. OPO operation was introduced on the Northern line with the new trains and the last service with a guard operated on the London Underground in January 2000. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to trains in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013.|$|R

50|$|Chunlian is a couplet, {{typically}} seven characters, on {{two sides}} of the door frame, whose content is related to spring. Lexical and tonal rules are always adhered, though not strictly, as Chunlian is transformed from metrical poems.

Its content is mostly about the beauty of nature, patriotism of China and their earnestness of a splendid future. Except from being <b>hung</b> on <b>door</b> frames, Chunlian is a necessary item that is unfurled in the end of a dragon dance, an exultant performance in celebration.|$|R
