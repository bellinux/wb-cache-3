5|$|They began a {{rivalry with}} the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick that lasted over three months, until the Judgment Day {{pay-per-view}} on May 21, 2006, where MNM lost the tag team title to London and Kendrick. Nitro and Melina suddenly turned on Mercury, attacking him and breaking up the group. Later that night Nitro and Melina were fired from the SmackDown' brand in storyline, to facilitate their move to Raw, where they reappeared the following week. The <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> for the team's sudden split was later revealed to be Mercury failing a WWE Wellness Policy drug test and being forced to serve a 30-day suspension.|$|E
5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he had the impression they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> justifying these people’s detention.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud with the Spirit Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against Flair, and he proved himself by {{defeating}} Flair that night in a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. Flair, however, continued to feud with the Spirit Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match. Flair and DX won, and DX packed them all in a crate (excluding Dykstra) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling. It was announced that Flair would face Dykstra at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

This means others who lack <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> may then {{have the opportunity to}} behave uncooperatively, i. e. free-ride, and be indistinguishable from those with <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons.</b> Free-riders have a degree of anonymity. In the context of a public good game we consider the e¤ect of free-rider anonymity on the ability of voluntary punishment to sustain cooperative social norms.

5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men as a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> {{to have an}} affair with a married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason.</b> All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.|$|E
25|$|Noted American {{folk music}} {{archivist}} and collector Alan Lomax first {{attracted the attention}} of the Security Service when it was noted that he had made contact with the Romanian press attaché in London while he was working on a series of folk music broadcasts for the BBC in 1952. Correspondence ensued with the American authorities as to Lomax' suspected membership of the Communist Party, though no positive proof is found on this file. The Service took the view that Lomax' work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> to contact the attaché, and that while his views (as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers) were undoubtedly left wing, {{there was no need for}} any specific action against him.|$|E

25|$|Again, {{although}} these critics meant their identifications of Mahler and Schoenberg as Jewish in an offensive way, this context provides a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> to claim them as Jewish composers today, though {{now in a}} neutral or positive sense. Despite the three above examples, however, a majority of Jewish artists and intellectuals in Austria, Germany and France during the 19th century and early 20th century assimilated culturally either by keeping the Jewish religion but living a mainstream European lifestyle (as Moses Mendelssohn had wished in earlier decades) or renouncing religion in favor of secularism, but retained at least the identification of Jewishness. It is the dual existence of people who disassociated themselves with Judaism yet remained affiliated with the Jewish people, and those who wished to retain the Jewish religion but eliminate any distinct Jewish culture by blending into Gentile society in this region and period (as opposed to Eastern Europe at the same time, where both the Jewish peoplehood and religion were preserved) that show the complexities of both Judaism and secular Jewish culture.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} regarding the overall package. Timothy J. Seppala from Engadget considered it [...] "a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> {{to buy an}} Xbox One", and Loveridge and Gies thought that Remedy had set a foundation for future storytelling by blending the two mediums together, making this game a unique title. Reeves thought that the game had the best gameplay and storytelling of all other Remedy games. Totilo added that the game innovates with the TV show, and that it makes the title something [...] "extraordinary". Martin Robinson from Eurogamer concluded that the game has more style than substance, but recognized the title's uniqueness. Both Houghton and Gerstmann agreed {{that it is an}} ambitious project, However, Gerstmann was disappointed that the elements did not connect well enough and Houghton felt that the complicated format dragged down the game as they were never combined together cohesively.|$|E

[...] Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title. Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled Blade Runner: A Story of the Future by Les Martin was released in 1982.

500|$|By 1994, Pearl Jam was [...] "fighting on all fronts", as its manager {{described}} the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke {{a series of}} stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam's customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of charity benefit shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas [...] in order to perform. Pearl Jam’s efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded {{that it was hard}} to imagine a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> for Ticketmaster’s exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, “The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act.” ...|$|E
500|$|Moon became {{involved}} in solo work {{when he moved to}} Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. In 1974, Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single covering the Beach Boys' [...] "Don't Worry, Baby" [...] and [...] "Teenage Idol." [...] The next year he released his only solo album, entitled Two Sides of the Moon. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. NME's Roy Carr wrote, [...] "Moonie, if you didn't have talent, I wouldn't care; but you have, which is why I'm not about to accept Two Sides of the Moon." [...] Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, wrote: [...] "There isn't any <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> for this album's existence." [...] During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC's Wide World), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member {{what would happen to the}} kit, he joked that [...] "even the best drummers get hungry." [...] His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.|$|E
500|$|To {{determine}} {{the status of}} Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: {{the nature of the}} copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work. Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file [...] "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 bytes. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs." [...] This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal. The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that [...] "where disassembly {{is the only way to}} gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a <b>legitimate</b> <b>reason</b> for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{criticism}} of tax concessions has {{lost sight of}} the <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for many of them. Overview While action is needed to correct structural budget deficits, the criticism of tax concessions has {{lost sight of the}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for many of them, and often overestimates the revenue gain. On the whole, the so-called concessions for capital gains tax, negative gearing, superannuation, dividend imputation, and the goods and services tax are not really concessions at all but legitimate structural features of the tax system, and in some cases are essential to prevent distortions arising from taxation of savings and investment. Tinkering with tax concessions to raise more revenue on its own does not constitute beneficial tax reform. Concessions should only be reconsidered {{in the context of a}} broader restructuring of the tax system as a whole...|$|R
