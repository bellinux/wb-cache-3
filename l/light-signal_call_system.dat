40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, {{to compare the}} attendance rate following a <b>call</b> <b>system</b> for cervical cancer screening organized by general practitioners, with the attendance rate resulting from the Dutch national <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> Women are invited for screening on a three yearly basis and in 1990 1616 women were identified by nine practices as being in the appropriate age group (35 to 54 years) to attend for cervical cancer screening while 10, 387 women were identified by the national <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> The attendance rate among the 1101 women in the rural general practices was 58 %, compared with 49 % of 4154 women in the matched group receiving an invitation from the national <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> The attendance rate among the 515 women in the urban general practices was 55 %, compared with 41 % of 6233 women in the matched group receiving an invitation from the national <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> Invitations from general practitioners resulted in similar percentages of women in all age groups attending for screening. Four general practices sent a reminder letter or made a telephone call to non-attenders. A reminder increased the attendance rate from 58 % to 70 %. It is concluded that a general practice based <b>call</b> <b>system</b> for cervical screening produces a higher attendance rate than the national <b>call</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

Our analysis acknowledges that High Reliability Organization (HRO) principles are transferable to a hospital organization. Based on our data, we propose improvements for design that hopefully can help reduce disruptive interruptions, ensure quick responses to patients, and further improve quality of care and patient safety.

One of the ways of solving this issue is by using portable nurse <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> With this system, patients will be able to call for help wherever they want. These certainly shorten response time for hospital’s stuffs to reach patients. In this project, a new prototype of portable nurse <b>call</b> <b>system</b> that uses Wifi internet network is developed to improve the system mobility. A cheaper and easy programmed system development board (Arduino) was chosen. A Wifi module - Xbee module was added to the development board in order to connect to Wifi internet network.

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, eleven sets of <b>CALL</b> <b>systems</b> {{were developed to}} help Japanese college learners from elementary through advanced level to improve their English communication skills. Though the systems were effectively used by learners, the lack of material bridging the elementary level to the intermediate level was recognized.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to develop a pre-intermediate level <b>CALL</b> <b>system</b> that appealed to the interests of college English learners in Japan. Video clips containing naturally spoken English taped in Manhattan, New York were used as material. The video was converted into digital files and carefully edited by eliminating portions which were considered to exceed the level of the target learners from the point of view of topics, vocabulary, accents and articulation, all the while maintaining the integrity and authenticity of the spoken discourse. The Three-Step Auditory Comprehension Approach was adopted as the basic theory in the development of the courseware with minor modifications. The courseware was then converted into computer software and a total of 40 college students experimentally used the developed <b>CALL</b> <b>system.</b> The questionnaire analysis revealed that the developed <b>CALL</b> <b>system</b> can be effectively used as a preparatory learning material for learners who wished to proceed to the intermediate level.

40|$|Research Summary: Our paper {{explores the}} impact of {{implementing}} a nonemergency 3 - 1 - 1 <b>call</b> <b>system</b> in Baltimore, Maryland. We found a large (34. 2 %) reduction in 9 - 1 - 1 calls following {{the introduction of the}} 3 - 1 - 1 nonemergency <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> Many, but not all, of these calls simply migrated over to the 3 - 1 - 1 <b>call</b> <b>system.</b> Overall, we identified a 7. 7 % reduction in recorded citizen calls to the police post 3 - 1 - 1 intervention. This recorded reduction in citizen calls was confounded by an increase in high priority calls to the 9 - 1 - 1 system (27. 5 %), a large overall reduction in low priority calls (54. 3 %), and an estimated increase (perhaps 8 %) in unrecorded calls to the police. We also note a small increase in response times to high priority 9 - 1 - 1 calls following the implementation of the 3 - 1 - 1 <b>call</b> <b>system</b> and virtually no change in the amount of officer time available for community policing or problem-oriented policing activities. Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that nonemergency <b>call</b> <b>systems,</b> such as 3 - 1 - 1, can greatly facilitate police efforts to better handle citizen calls for police service. However, the intrinsic value of nonemergency <b>call</b> <b>systems</b> is tightly woven with a police department's willingness to change dispatch policies (especially for those calls received via the 3 - 1 - 1 system), reallocate patrol resources, and adopt organizational reforms to support alternative methods (apart from dispatch) for handling nonemergency calls for service.

To highlight the issues of stressors in the work life of nurses, we include an analysis which will describe some of the possible causes of stress and how the <b>call</b> <b>system</b> can be related to this issue. Based on our empirical data and analysis we obtain a general idea of nurses’ desires concerning improvements of nurse <b>call</b> <b>systems,</b> but also what the analysis presents to be the best solution.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the English and Japanese <b>CALL</b> <b>systems</b> which have been developed at Kyoto University. Both systems incorporate automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to detect pronunciation errors. In order to cope with non-native speech, error prediction mechanisms are prepared based on linguistic knowledge and corpus-based decision tree learning. Several choices of acoustic modeling for non-native speech including erroneous pronunciations are also investigated. The English <b>CALL</b> <b>system</b> is designed for Japanese college students so that they can introduce Japanese cultures to foreign people, thus the acoustic model and error prediction are tuned to the specific native language (L 1 =Japanese). On the other hand, the Japanese <b>CALL</b> <b>system</b> is for foreign visitors of any L 1, and focuses on basic-level sentence production and adopts GUI for easy practice. I...|$|R
