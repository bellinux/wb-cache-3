50|$|The short {{opens with}} Masked Man M taking on an {{extremely}} obese female wrestler in the ring. She traps {{him in her}} skin folds, but Masked Man M manages to escape. The obese wrestler taps out to <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> who kicks Masked Man M in the chest - a move he appears to greatly enjoy. This prompts him to accidentally swap out with his partner Chicken, who tries and fails to attack <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> She proceeds to beat him while an envious Masked Man M watches, begging for Chicken to swap out with him. Chicken succeeds, {{but at this point}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> also swaps out with the obese wrestler, to his dismay. Masked Man M manages to beat the obese wrestler, which angers The Boss. He storms down to the dressing room to confront Masked Man M and Chicken, as <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> was supposed to win the match. The Boss just barely misses the two as they flee the arena, Masked Man M carrying a box of <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> dolls he stole.|$|R

5000|$|Later {{that night}} Romeo {{receives}} {{a call from}} The Boss, who tells him that <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> has specifically asked to fight him. The winner will receive $50,000 in prize money. Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute. He holds her down and almost wins, but, at the last minute, is signaled to throw the match, which he does. After the match Masked Man M's popularity takes off and Romeo returns to the orphanage where he realizes that Sister Juliet is <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> as she has used the money to fix the place up.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} Spade − the System S {{declarative}} stream processing engine. System S is a large-scale, distributed data stream processing middleware under development at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. As a front-end for {{rapid application development}} for System <b>S,</b> <b>Spade</b> provides (1) an intermediate language for flexible composition of parallel and distributed data-flow graphs, (2) a toolkit of type-generic, built-in stream processing operators, that support scalar as well as vectorized processing and can seamlessly inter-operate with user-defined operators, and (3) a rich set of stream adapters to ingest/publish data from/to outside sources. More importantly, Spade automatically brings performance optimization and scalability to System S applications. To that end, Spade employs a code generation framework to create highly-optimized applications that run natively on the Stream Processing Core (SPC), the execution and communication substrate of System S, and {{take full advantage of}} other System <b>S</b> services. <b>Spade</b> allows developers to construct their applications with fine granular stream operators without worrying about the performance implications that might exist, even in a distributed system. Spade’s optimizing compiler automatically maps applications into appropriately sized execution units in order to minimize communication overhead, {{while at the same time}} exploiting available parallelism. By virtue of the scalability of the System <b>S</b> runtime and <b>Spade’s</b> effective code generation and optimization, we can scale applications to a large number of nodes. Currently, we can run Spade jobs on ≈ 500 processors within more than 100 physical nodes in a tightly connected cluster environment. Spade has been in use at IBM Research to create real-world streaming appli...|$|R

And so if she puts a constraint on herself for my sake, I can only say, in requital, God bless her.|$|R
