In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E

5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} the <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices {{and lead to}} an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also {{lead to an increase}} in poaching.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

40|$|MUTUAL INFLUENCING OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS AND INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS IN DISABILITY CARE Gerrie Schmitz Studentnummer 851 052 065 Open Universiteit Nederland Faculteit : Managementwetenschappen Opleiding : Master of Science in Management Begeleider/examinator : Drs. Diana Veneklaas Slots Medebeoordelaar : Dr. Pieter Kamminga Maart, 2015 ABSTRACT Due {{to social}} {{reforms in the}} care sector in the Netherlands more and more care {{organizations}} apply performance management systems to satisfy financial and economical requirements. Care for clients although is traditionally the leading goal in this sector. Research {{on the relationship between}} performance management systems and <b>the</b> institutional value <b>of</b> care is needed to understand the way performance measurement systems can be used for care organizations under reforming circumstances now and in the future. This research has been based upon the ‘New Institutional Perspective’ (Thornton, Ocasio, Lounsbury, 2012) in line with the New Institutional Sociology. <b>The</b> institutional value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> care organization appeared to be based upon <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization. By studying the organization through the institutional analysis model <b>of</b> Thornton <b>the</b> performance actions derived from <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization can be identified. Furthermore performance management systems are also based upon institutional logics (Ezzamel, Robson, Stapleton, 2012). These logics don’t have to be adjusted to <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization per se. By studying the reason a performance management system has been introduced, <b>the</b> embedding <b>of</b> practice values and <b>the</b> ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, the performance actions based upon the performance management system can be identified. By means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance actions through <b>the</b> analysis model <b>of</b> Ostrom (2011) <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> organization and the performance management system can be labeled. The research has been set up as theoretical replication. Two case studies has been completed in two different organizations in disability care in The Netherlands. One organization has been participating in an governmental experience for diminishing regulation pressures and one organization acts under regular regulation. It is presumptive there is more mutual influencing between the performance management system and <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization under diminishing regulation than under regular regulation. The case studies have been executed by interviewing directors, controllers, managers and care workers in both organizations. The research results show that <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizations in both cases are based upon professional <b>logics.</b> <b>The</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance management system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization under diminishing regulation is also based upon professional <b>logics,</b> <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization under regular regulation is based upon governance logics and is turning into business logics. The difference in logics under regular regulation leads to a loose coupling in the Pagina 2 van 2 organization with a weak mutual influencing as a consequence. The adjusted logics in the organization under diminishing regulation leads to a strong mutual influencing. From the case studies can be concluded that strong external regulation leads to loose couplings in organizations when <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization and the performance management system are not adjusted. In contrary weak regulation leads to strong mutual influencing when the institutional logics are adjusted. Furthermore a strong vision on client values and care methods, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> soft controls, integral responsibilities in the primary process with a small span of control and facilitating a broad organizational social interaction contribute to mutual influencing. From the case studies it is clear that all this factors lead to better financial results. Due to theoretical replication the conclusions can be generalized to <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> organizations. <b>The</b> construct validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research is strong because of various measures. Triangulation is poor because <b>the</b> notification <b>of</b> confidence for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizations and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> external information about both the organizations. For future research it is interesting to explore the mutual influencing under development and change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizations. Furthermore extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research in other care sectors is important to broaden <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> this research. Finally it is interesting to study the relationship between adjusted institutional logics and the financial results. For care organizations {{it is important to be}} critical to external regulation and only apply this rules to the performance management system if <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulation match to <b>the</b> institutional <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization.
