2500|$|U-brakes {{were used}} on {{mountain}} bikes {{through the early}} 1990s, particularly under the chainstays, a rear brake mounting location that was then popular. [...] This location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness, an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase <b>lever</b> <b>travel</b> and reduce effective braking force. [...] Unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud, which meant that U-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes.|$|E
50|$|Gearbox changes {{included}} higher second, {{third and}} top gear ratios, and a reduced angle of gear lever movement {{to make for}} shorter <b>lever</b> <b>travel</b> and snappier changes. New front disc brakes significantly improved the Rapier's braking capability and widened its front track to give greater stability and improved road-holding.|$|E

50|$|The flaperons {{stretch for}} 11.0 meters {{of the full}} {{wingspan}} and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8°, to +4° for thermalling, to 0°, -4°, and S -8° reflex positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. There is a fixed main wheel behind the pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control <b>lever</b> aft <b>travel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vijay and {{his friend}} Linghaiyya (Johnny <b>Lever)</b> <b>travel</b> to save Sonia. Everybody who sees him is stunned and calls him Arjun. He finally remembers his past life and reunites with Durga where he gets to know about his brother Karan who is now Ajay. Vijay saves Ajay and {{explains}} the whole situation. Ajay refuses to believe, but when Durjan's brothers-in-law attack Durga, he remembers his previous life. Durjan hears about Karan and Arjun's return but refuses to believe it so his brothers-in-law attempt to bring them before him. In the process, they are killed by Ajay and Vijay {{in a similar way}} as they killed Karan and Arjun and Durga places the garlands over their dead bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Launched in 1971 the 5-speed, [...] double {{overhead}} cam twin cylinder Triumph Bandit delivered [...] and could reach 110 mph. Essentially the same motorcycle as the BSA Fury, the Bandit represented the factory's last attempt {{to compete against}} Japanese imports.The only contemporary road test was by American magazine Cycle Guide in their March 1971 issue upon {{a visit to the}} Triumph and BSA factories at Meriden and Small Heath, respectively. The Bandit's petrol tank colour scheme was Cypress Green (although Cycle World identified it as Jealous Green [...] ) with white-lined black scallops above and below a metal Triumph badge with a chrome styling strip running down the top of the tank. The same paint scheme applied to the mudguards with a white-lined black stripe running down through their centre. The side panels were silver painted with black 'tombstone' style lettering stating the model name and engine size: 'Bandit 350'. The engine was all-alloy as opposed to Triumph's other twins that relied upon an iron barrel and considered by Cycle Guide to be 'beautifully finished' and 'a real thing of beauty'. Cycle Guide criticised the retention of a traditionally Triumph vertically split crankcase halves rather than adopting the Japanese practice of horizontally splitting them. Despite this, it was noted that the engine was oil tight. The small diameter instruments and foot pegs thought mounted too far forward came in for criticism as did the poor conical hub rear brake performance, unlike the 'great' front brake. <b>Lever</b> <b>travel</b> between gears was felt to be too long although the clutch operation was 'silky smooth'. The electrical system was twin coil and 12 volt and an electric starter was offered as an option. Carburetion was by two Amal 27mm carburetors. Cycle Guide were disappointed that the engine could not be expanded beyond 350cc but praised the engine's and exhausts' quietness. Two exhaust systems, a low level ('T35R') and high level (the 'T35SS' Street Scrambler version), were offered, the former offering more top speed. The low level exhaust system was finished in bright chrome, the high level system in matt black with a stainless steel heat shield. The T35SS version also came with what the brochure described as 'detachable electrics'. Tyres for both versions were the same, Dunlop K70; 3.25 x 18 inches for the front and 3.50 x 18 inches for the rear. Compression ratio was also the same for both : 9.5:1.|$|E
40|$|This work proposes and {{experimentally}} validates an handheld {{distance measurement}} system powered by energy harvesting through the ElectroMagnetic (EM) effect. The system is entirely battery-less and powered on-demand {{by the user}} force exerted on the lever of an hand-crack EM converter. With a single excitation force of about 19. 6 N over a <b>lever</b> <b>travel</b> of 2 cm, the proposed system is able to perform a distance measurement between a target object and the embedded ultrasonic sensor, show the reading on a LCD display, and transmit the data through a 433 -MHz wireless-UART link to an host PC...|$|E
50|$|The {{sailplane}} is {{trimmed in}} pitch via an innovative variable-position horizontal stabilizer. The stabilizer position {{is governed by}} the flaperon setting. The five settings of the flaperons control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed {{in relation to the}} flaperons requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing trim drag. There is a fixed or retractable main wheel behind the pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control <b>lever</b> aft <b>travel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main and}} nose {{undercarriage}}s were housed entirely within the fuselage. The nose undercarriage rotated 90° to lie flat under the forward engine, and the twin wheeled main undercarriage legs, with long <b>travel</b> <b>levered</b> suspension, retracted into the centre fuselage above the forward jet pipe and astride {{the fuel tank}} and intake trunking for the rear engine.|$|R
5000|$|From 1919, Gourley {{worked for}} <b>Lever</b> Brothers, <b>travelling</b> widely {{to open up}} new {{business}} for the company. On his retirement {{a director of the}} company spoke of [...] "...his quiet, gentle courteousness and his readiness to do all he could for other people. In fact he was a jolly good man to have beside you when you were in trouble". In 1925, he moved to Hill Close, School Lane, off Column Road, Grange, West Kirby; his house was later renamed Gourley Grange and the lane renamed Gourley's Lane in his honour. The gardens created by Gourley have now been redeveloped as a small housing estate.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that a human}} pilot uses {{the same set of}} generic skills to control a wide variety of aircraft. If this is true, then {{it should be possible to}} construct an electronic controller which embodies this generic skill set such that it can successfully control difference airplanes without being matched to a specific airplane. In an attempt to create such a system, a fuzzy logic controller was devised to control throttle position and another to control elevator position. These two controllers were used to control flight path angle and airspeed for both a piston powered single engine airplane simulation and a business jet simulation. Overspeed protection and stall protection were incorporated in the form of expert systems supervisors. It was found that by using the artificial intelligence techniques of fuzzy logic and expert systems, a generic longitudinal controller could be successfully used on two general aviation aircraft types that have very difference characteristics. These controllers worked for both airplanes over their entire flight envelopes including configuration changes. The controllers for both airplanes were identical except for airplane specific limits (maximum allowable airspeed, throttle <b>lever</b> <b>travel,</b> etc.). The controllers also handled configuration changes without mode switching or knowledge of the current configuration. This research validated the fact that the same fuzzy logic based controller can control two very different general aviation airplanes. It also developed the basic controller architecture and specific control parameters required for such a general controller...|$|E
50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of <b>travel.</b> Pushing the <b>levers</b> forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the <b>lever</b> to <b>travel</b> further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
5000|$|In {{her early}} career, Porchon {{worked in the}} fashion industry. She found success in her {{modelling}} and gained many modelling titles, including [...] "Best Legs in Europe". For {{a period of time}} she was signed under the <b>Lever</b> Brothers. She <b>travelled</b> around the globe as a model, enjoying stints in places like Paris, among others. During the second World War, Porchon moved to London and became a cabaret performer under the mentorship of Noël Coward. Notable journalist Quentin Reynolds took note of Porchon, writing that she made a [...] "dark London brighter".|$|R
25|$|The Morlocks {{open the}} Sphinx {{and use the}} time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not {{understanding}} that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the <b>levers</b> before he <b>travels</b> further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.|$|R
40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) allows {{investigation of}} the properties of surfaces and interfaces at atomic scale resolution. However, several different operational modes (imaging, force versus distance and lateral force), need to be deployed {{in order to gain}} insight into the structure, tribiological and mechanical properties. A new method, based on a variation of the force versus distance mode, has been developed. In essence, a coupling of the deformational modes of the probe is exploited whereby the tip is induced to undergo lateral travel in response to application of an out-of-plane force (and thus normal bending of the force-sensing <b>lever).</b> The lateral <b>travel</b> induces in-plane forces that are then measurable as a consequence of stimulation of the 'buckling' deformational mode of the lever. Outcomes will be demonstrated for atomically flat surfaces of WTe 2 and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
