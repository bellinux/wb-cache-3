50|$|A later {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1994 called Optoform invented by Ali Afshari, Patent number PCT/US1994/011472 filed on October 20, 2004. This design consisted of round mounting plates, and it allowed cost effective manufacturing by CNC lathes with <b>live</b> <b>tooling.</b> With a circular shape, Optoform was less labor-intensive to manufacture. (This is {{in contrast with the}} traditional square mounts of prior art, which require all four sides to be machined in order to achieve precise right angles at all corners.) While a square shape limits the angles at which the plates can be mounted together, the circular shape allows the plates to be mounted at many angles.|$|E
50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), milling machines evolved into machining centers (milling machines with automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC control, coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with <b>live</b> <b>tooling</b> for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|E

It is the users responsibility to determine, prior to sale, if particular features of a given machine will be used by BobCAD, and what additional effort {{may be required to}} do so. For example, it is possible to draw a turned part with tapped holes situated perpendicular to the main axis, however; what is meant by [...] "supported" [...] is subject to interpretation. While {{it may be possible to}} make some machine functions operable with some effort, such as <b>live</b> <b>tooling</b> on a lathe the degree of difficulty varies, and technically, <b>live</b> <b>tooling</b> support for lathe is not provided. Industrial robots can be used for non-conventional milling for example. [...] BobCAD-CAM software is modular.

The 3 Axis CNC Software has a Standard and Professional version. There are also Standard and PRO versions for 4 Axis CNC Milling as well as the 5 Axis CNC Milling CAD/CAM. The 2013 Multi-axis CAD/CAM Software offers the first High-Speed Adaptive Roughing tool path strategy in the world for simultaneous 5 Axis CNC Milling. SWARF Milling along with 7 Surface-Based cutting toolpath machining strategies have also been developed into the Multi-axis CAD/CAM Software. The latest release of the CAD-CAM modules uses CAM Wizards for each machining strategy which is a planned series of dialog pages that pertain directly to the machining strategy that the user selects. Recently Dynamic Machining Strategies™ were added. DMS™ functionality requires the user to use a single or multiple machining operations for a CAD Feature that was selected in the process. This basically allows multiple machining operations to be used based on a selected CAD feature. CNC Software modules are available for: ...|$|E
50|$|Additionally, as many Swiss lathes {{incorporate}} a secondary spindle, or 'sub-spindle', they also incorporate 'live tooling'. Live tools are rotary cutting tools that are {{powered by a}} small motor independently of the spindle motor(s). Live tools increase the intricacy of components that can be manufactured by the Swiss lathe. For instance, automatically producing a part with a hole drilled perpendicular to the main axis (the axis of rotation of the spindles) is very economical with <b>live</b> <b>tooling,</b> and similarly uneconomical if done as a secondary operation after machining by the Swiss lathe is complete. A 'secondary operation' is a machining operation requiring a partially completed part to be secured in a second machine to complete the manufacturing process. Generally, advanced CAD/CAM software uses live tools {{in addition to the}} main spindles so that most parts that can be drawn by a CAD system can actually be manufactured by the machines that the CAD/CAM software support.|$|E
40|$|The modern {{machine tool}} is {{virtually}} unrecognisable {{in terms of}} its physical appearance and technical capabilities compared to those which were in use only a few years ago. Developments such as high speed spindles, <b>live</b> <b>tooling</b> and multi-axis machining have been combined with advances in cutting tool design, materials and coatings plus enhancements in cutting fluid performance in order to achieve unprecedented improvements in productivity. However, the continual development of increasingly difficult-to-machine materials, combined with the ever present desire for further increases in productivity, continue to drive the evolution of machine tools and machining processes. This paper will consider two techniques which although they have been known about for some time, have recently matured {{to the point that they}} are demonstrating commercial potential for further improvements in conventional machining processes; cryogenic cooling and ultrasonic assisted machining. Cryogenic cooling of the cutting tool or the cutting zone has the potential to remove the heat generated during machining more efficiently that conventional cutting fluid and various researchers have investigated a range of techniques over the years. However, this presentation will describe research at WMG using a commercially available system and consider the advantages / viability of the process. Ultrasonic assisted machining is also a technique which has been known to have a positive effect on certain aspects of machining for some time with several laboratory scale set-ups being developed by researchers. However, the system which is being used at WMG is integral within a commercially available, fully functional, 5 -axis machine tool provided by DMG Mori Seiki. The application of this commercially available implementation of the technology will be reviewed along with some of the research work performed using this facility...|$|E

50|$|SFM is a {{combination}} of diameter and the velocity (RPM) of the material measured in feet-per-minute as the spindle of a milling machine or lathe. 1 SFM equals 0.00508 m/s (meter per second, the SI unit of speed). The faster the spindle turns, and/or the larger the diameter, the higher the SFM. The goal is to tool a job to run the SFM as high as possible to increase hourly part production. However some materials will run better at specific SFMs. When the SFM is known for a specific material (ex 303 annealed stainless steel = 120 SFM for high speed steel tooling), a formula can be used to determine spindle speed for <b>live</b> <b>tools</b> or spindle speeds for turning materials.|$|R

50|$|The first {{path was}} pioneered by {{brothers}} Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 {{a machine that}} we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort.

Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.|$|R
