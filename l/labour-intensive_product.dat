Still, our integration {{in the global economy}} through the strategic partnership with the European Union has been built mainly on the cheap labor and low and medium-technology exports. Severe social problems have been solved by creating new jobs. Yet, these exports are low value added and have a small contribution to raising the living standard through high and lasting economic growth rates. There is definitely no place for further illusions. We have basically two options left: - To compete globally with the Chinese dragon and the Indian elephant on the <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>product</b> markets, or - To build a sound policy for attracting foreign direct investments (FDI) that may turn Romania from a spectator into an active player on the high-technology based global market. Taking into account the perishable first option, we are left to play the second card. In other words, to achieve sustainable global competitiveness, Romania has no choice but {{to become a}} vibrant knowledge economy. The last few years witnessed constant economic growth and adjustment of the strategic investors’ perception of risks. But I believe that Romania is still un undervalued asset. The reasons are gathered on three late bloomer pillars: economics, property rights and geo-strategic advantage.

40|$|Three {{features}} of China?s trade patterns suggest that elements beyond factor abundance explain its export performance. The high penetration in world markets of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> {{has been accompanied}} by: (i) a high share in exports of productivity-advanced foreign-owned enterprises (FIEs), (ii) a high penetration of FIEs in labour-intensive sectors, and (iii) a relative high sophistication of China?s exports. We show that FDI liberalization endogenously introduces Ricardian features to an otherwise standard endowment-based trade model, strengthening China?s natural comparative advantage in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> We discuss how capital accumulation, productivity growth, rural-urban migration, incentives for foreign investment and distortions in financial markets affect this bias. We conclude that policies enhancing domestic firms? production, through productivity growth or capital market distortions, implicitly support the capital-intensive sector. In contrast, policies that encourage FDI, like greater access to China?s capital and labour market would shift China?s comparative advantage even further towards <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> comparative advantage, FDI liberalization, labour markets, China...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{business}} cycles in OECD countries exhibit a remarkable degree of synchronization. Much less known is that the peak of the OECD cycle is associated with high prices of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and low prices of capital-intensive ones.

Positive shocks in one or more countries raise the prices of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> and, as a result, the demand for labour throughout the industrialized world. This generates increases in wages, employment and output in all industrial countries. Through this channel, shocks are positively transmitted across countries, creating a force towards the synchronization of business cycles. ...|$|R

A strong financial sector can thus mitigate misallocation of resources arising from inefficient exporting patterns. financial development; resource misallocation; comparative advantage...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of foreign trade in China on the urban-rural income gap from certain angles including trade scale, trade structure and trade mode at the national and provincial levels. The empirical results indicate that, {{from the perspective of}} trade scale, the export and import in the eastern and national regions have an expansion effect on the urban-rural income gap, and, in the central regions, they have a reduction effect. Furthermore, export in the western regions has a reduction effect while import in these regions did not have a significant effect. From the perspective of trade structure, the trade of high-tech <b>products</b> and <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> in the national and eastern regions has an expansion effect, and the trade of the above-mentioned products in the central regions has a reduction effect. The trade of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> in the western regions has a reduction effect, and that of high-tech products an expansion effect. From the perspective of trade mode, processing trade and general trade in the national and eastern regions have an expansion effect, while in the central regions they have a reduction effect. General trade in the western regions would expand the urban-rural income gap, and processing trade does not have a significant effect.

However, the decline in heavy industry in Scotland has been supplanted with the rise in the manufacture of lighter, less <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> such as optoelectronics, software, chemical products and derivatives as well as life sciences. The engineering and defence sectors employ around 30,000 people in Scotland.

Contrary to common perceptions, traditional cash crops, which are the source of livelihood for millions of Africans, have many of the features of manufacturing exports: high labour-intensity; potential for quality improvements through technological transfer; and quality-sensitive markets in developed countries.

Multilateral trade liberalization has strongly improved market access conditions for manufactures and partly explains why manufactures have experienced particularly strong growth in exports. The increased importance of vertical international production sharing and the associated preferential trading arrangements between geographically close countries with significantly different wage rates have been a key determinant of differences in export-value growth across individual manufactured products, {{as well as of the}} distribution of market shares for some of these products among developing countries. Projections based on a standard trade model suggest that moving to full trade liberalization would lead to an increase in the share of agricultural products in total world trade by almost two percentage points and give greater weight to the textile, clothing and automotive sectors within manufactured exports...|$|R

This entirely new index is based in large measure on a little-researched annual personal income tax (décima) instituted in 1641. It covered all social classes, including nobility and clergy and every form of household earnings, and permits therefore a singularly accurate measure. It allows us to conclude that, in contrast with early modern Europe in general, Portugal experienced a notable decline in economic inequality. Several freshly minted quantitative indicators enable us to conclude that the burden of the explanation for this apparently ‘deviant’ behaviour can be ascribed to changes in the functional distribution of income. Significant transformations in Portuguese agriculture—towards <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> like maize and wine—permanently shifted the wage–rental ratio in favour of labour. The skill premium fell but its contribution was relatively modest. It was a time of sustained economic growth, but this was not associated with pronounced urbanization or industrialization...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} of raising rivals' costs may {{be adopted by}} firms in a market, a cartel or interest group or by political majorities in a federal state or international organisation. We provide a first survey and formal exposition of the theory and present examples {{for each of these}} applications. In an international cross-section analysis using unpublished data for the period 1980 - 98, we explain roll-call voting of government representatives in ILO committees drafting international labour standards. Using four different indices of regulation and country samples, we find that governments vote for tighter standards if labour regulation is high in their own country. Our evidence rejects the hypothesis of Brown, Deardorff and Stern that countries exporting low-skill <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> vote for ILO standards in order to restrict their own supply and increase their terms of trade. As expected, left-party governments vote more in line with labour unions than other governments do. Domestic regulation has a considerably larger effect on voting if the convention in question would raise labour costs in ILO member states. This indicates that highly regulated countries try to raise others' costs. Copyright 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

The analysis focuses on the three hypotheses related {{to the relationship between}} exporting and firm productivity that have received attention in the literature, namely: self-selection; learning-by-exporting; and core competence hypotheses. In this case study, evidence is found in support each of these hypotheses, which are often portrayed as competing with each other but are in fact complementary. It is found that comparative advantage, which in the case of Vietnam - a labour-abundant, low-wage country - is in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> is central to understanding each of the three hypotheses. The firms that have relatively high productivity (ex ante) and accordingly self-select to export are those that produce in line with Vietnam&# 039;s comparative advantage (i. e., firms that are relatively labour-intensive). Firms that experienced a relatively large increase in export intensity are found to have experienced higher total factor productivity, supporting the learning-by-exporting hypothesis, and a relatively large increase in labour intensity, supporting the core competence hypothesis and the central role of comparative advantage...|$|R

We analyse market share changes and highlight product groups that are directly or indirectly exposed to a competitive threat. We examine intra-regional trade and find that China and its neighbours are raising high technology exports in tandem: the nature of the international production systems involved lead to complementarity rather than confrontation. China is thus acting as an engine of export growth for its neighbours in terms of direct trade.

Both static and dynamic shift-share models are employed to the 2 -digit ISIC 3 of manufacturing section to investigate the changing patterns of export share that result from the shift effect, consisting industry-mix, export growth and interdependence. Findings from shift-share analysis shows China gained most of the US market share for exporting not only labour-intensive goods but also capital-intensive products {{at the expense of}} ASEAN. The static analysis suggests that China and Indonesia had difficulties in their industrial structures whereas Singapore and Malaysia experienced structural advantages. However, the dynamic analysis result shows that in 2001 the difficulties faced by China and Indonesia had disappeared, which indicated such an improvement in export structures had been made while Singapore and Malaysia, on contrary, lost their structural advantages. With respect to competitive effect, both static and dynamic analyses reveal that China’s competitive advantage was extremely strong compared to ASEAN.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the main agricultural impacts of China's WTO accession {{and the associated}} challenges. We elaborate on four issues - agricultural production and trade, food security and self-sufficiency, farmers' incomes, and rural land reform. After {{more than seven years}} of WTO accession, the value of China's agricultural production and trade has increased and China has turned into a net importer of agricultural products. Globally, China now ranks as the fifth largest agricultural exporter and fourth largest agricultural importer. Although considerable resource shifts have taken place from land-intensive towards <b>labour-intensive</b> agricultural <b>products</b> in both production and trade, this transfer remains well below the potential due to trade barriers facing China's exports of <b>labour-intensive</b> agricultural <b>products.</b> Farmers' incomes increased after WTO entry, with a growing off-farm portion linked closely with world economic cycles. Rural land reform to improve economies of scale will require complementary policy aimed at a fully integrated labour and housing market, as well as a unified education and social welfare system for all of China's society. We argue that WTO accession has impacted China's agriculture in a positive fashion and has improved the efficiency of the sector, but accession has also given rise to new agricultural policy challenges.

This paper {{is an attempt to}} address the ongoing debate. The study finds that post- 2001 China’s exports have diversified. The major finding is that, based on the competitiveness analysis, the share of hi-tech manufactures has increased, while the share of unskilled <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> has gone down during 2001 - 06. Post- 2001 hi-tech products command a share of 32 % in China’s total exports and 43 % in China’s total imports.

Concepts of product quality are first reviewed and the key characteristics of Chinas international trade in fresh produce are outlined based on a detailed analysis from the UN Comtrade international trade data at the 2, 4 digit and finally 6 digit levels. High quality fresh and chilled vegetables are identified through their average unit export values. In 2005, China was the 4 th largest exporter of vegetables in the world with a 9. 8 percent share of world trade, and almost a 6 percent share in fresh and chilled vegetables. The competitiveness of China in world trade in high value fresh produce is assessed through a trade-shares accounting and decomposition approach which enables both structural and performance effects on Chinas exports to be isolated, and the contributions its major trading partners have made to changes its share of world trade. Chinas aggregate market share rose by over 1. 5 percentage points over the period, and there is evidence of an emerging orientation in its trade shares from E Asia to SE Asia, and to further progress in the Russian Federation and US markets.

First, it explores Iran's First Development Plan directives from the economic, marketing, cultural, and financial perspectives by comparing data available from both local and international organisations. Second, it sets out to evaluate and determine the categories in which Iran has a comparative advantage. Third, it purports to analyse Iran's classification of competitors, and her exports potential to EU by considering similar and comparable economies. Fourth, it predicts Iran's marketing with EU during her Second Development Plan by forecasting both economic and non-economic factors. In this thesis, we first review and explore many factors that have been considered to be essential for Iran's export during her First Development Plan by using statistical methods such as the trend and time series analyses. Furthermore, the results of Iran's Reveal Comparative Advantage (RCA) for Non-Oil exports to EU indicate {{that it has a}} good potential for developing its exports in agriculture and <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> Moreover, by reviewing and analysing the trade performance of Iran and its competitors, we can determine the marketing and economic status of these countries in terms of export trends and Non-Oil Export Similarity Index(ESa) in selected categories.

First, the thesis evaluates the alternative indirect methods of measuring or identifying Iran's comparative advantage through revealed trade performance. Secondly, it seeks to identify Iran's export potential by considering similar and comparable economies. Thirdly, it explores the potential volume and direction of fran's trade flows by using a gravity model. The thesis primarily provides a review and {{an evaluation of the}} theory and empirical robustness of the law of comparative advantage. The application of indirect methods proves to be useful in identifying Iran's activities of comparative advantage. Alternative indices of revealed trade performance are used to measure Iran's revealed comparative advantage (RCA) for non-oil exports. The results based on these three measurements are found to be consistent, and also show that Iran has export characteristics which reflect the endowments of this natural-resourceabundant developing country. Iran's exports tend to lie in natural-resource-intensive goods, mostly agricultural <b>products,</b> and generally <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products.</b> Relatively weak export performance is identified in capital-intensive and humancapital- intensive products. Upon determining the commodities in which Iran has a revealed comparative advantage, the thesis investigates how Iran's export composition may be expected to evolve in future. Export similarity indices and the revealed export performance of comparator countries are used to identify the scope for intra- and inter-industry export diversification. Finally, a gravity model is estimated in order to compare the actual and potential volume and direction of Iran's trade. The results show that Iran's current actual trade is larger than that predicted by the model. The current 'over-trade' figures arise from fran's oil exports to a few industrial countries. Actual trade with the developing countries as a whole is by contrast lower than predicted...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe 2002 - 2003 {{edition of}} Latin America and the Caribbean {{in the world}} economy is divided into three parts. The first part, which {{concerns}} trade and regional integration in Latin America and the Caribbean (chapters I and II);, analyses the main features of the international situation and their impact on the countries' external trade in 2002 and 2003. It also examines developments in the regional integration process in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2002 - 2003 and the ambivalence demonstrated by some of the governments involved, which affirm their political will to continue to deepen regional integration but make no specific commitments in that regard. The second part is devoted to Latin American trade policy, particularly export promotion policy (chapters III and IV);. Chapter III deals basically with the export promotion policies of Mexico and the countries of Central America and the English-speaking Caribbean. Chapter IV looks at some aspects of an export promotion policy for services, as this area is largely undeveloped in the region. The third and last part (chapters V and VI); analyses two important elements of the international trading system. Chapter V examines the inclusion of the development dimension in multilateral negotiations, which is intended to address the differences in development levels between the members of the World Trade Organization (WTO); and to strengthen the impact of trade on development, and chapter VI describes, from the region's perspective, the changes brought about by China's accession to WTO. China's role is analysed from several different angles: as a strong competitor in world markets for <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products,</b> as a consumer market for commodities and manufactures and as an ally in defending the development process in international forums...|$|R
50|$|The {{international}} trade in table grapes has significantly benefitted from the increased availability of cold storage and refrigerated container technology. Table grapes are a <b>labour-intensive</b> agricultural <b>product</b> that require harvesting by hand at peak ripeness. In order to maintain product quality at point of sale, harvested grapes must be sorted, packaged and cooled to near 0 °C as quickly as possible. Transportation in ventilated and temperature controlled environments requires significant investment in processing facilities, shipping and logistics. As the production cycle for table grapes is relatively long compared with other fruit, with new plantations taking 2-3 years to become productive, export production and promotion is often concentrated {{in the hands of}} large vertically integrated commercial enterprises or producer-exporter associations such as the Fruit Exporters Association of Chile (ASOEX).|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{patterns}} of recent change in China's international export trade in high quality fresh-vegetables between 2002 and 2005 since its WTO membership and some of the underlying determinants that will determine its future export opportunities. Design/methodology/approach – A trade-shares accounting and decomposition approach is adopted which enables the sources of change in China's aggregate export market shares be identified in terms of both structural effects (SEs) through the share-shifts in world trade of its major trading partners and performance effects (PEs) of changes in China's penetration of individual markets. Findings – China's underlying comparative advantage in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>products</b> such as fresh vegetables is reflected in the positive PE of its increase in share of world trade since WTO membership. There has been an emerging re-orientation in its trade shares from E Asia to SE Asia, and to further penetration into the Russian Federation and US markets, but little overall evidence of significant enhanced penetration of developed country markets. Research limitations/implications – The methodology, whilst identifying the predominant sources of dynamic changes in trade shares, does not explain or model the causes of such developments. However, as such it is useful in focussing attention on where significant changes have taken place and hence where further research into modelling such bi-lateral or multilateral trade flows would be fruitful. Originality/value – Hitherto competitiveness studies have tended to focus either on aggregate trade flows, or at the broad sectoral level such as agriculture. Those in relation to China have also tended to be of a predictive nature in assessing the potential WTO impact on China's trade and agriculture. This study addresses China's actual trade performance at the product category and individual product level, and examines the strategic implications for China's fresh produce export sector. It also assesses whether the initial expectations of positive gains in exporting fresh vegetables have been realised thus far, and what adjustments in China's global trading patterns have emerged in this sector.
