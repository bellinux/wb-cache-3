5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E

50|$|Between 1993 and 1996, NSB {{rolled out}} the analog train radio system Scanet. Developed by Ascom Radiocom, {{it was only}} {{installed}} on <b>the</b> primary railway <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> system allows radio communication between a train dispatcher, and train drivers and other users involved in railway operations. Scanet was also connected to the automatic train control system. However, several <b>lines</b> lack <b>the</b> system, including <b>the</b> Arendal <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Flåm <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Meråker <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Nordland <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Rauma <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Røros <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Inner Østfold <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> northern part of <b>the</b> Gjøvik <b>Line,</b> and several tunnels along <b>the</b> Bergen <b>Line</b> and <b>the</b> Sørland <b>Line.</b> <b>The</b> Åsta accident in 2000 spurred the need to give {{all parts of the}} railway coverage with train radio.

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E

5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. <b>Lining</b> <b>the</b> west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the Finnish {{scientist}} Risto Tuomikoski {{observed that}} the well-known Stropharia aeruginosa had a lookalike species that was characterized by a brown spore print, an indistinct, temporary ring on the stipe, and chrysocystidia <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> gill edges. Tuomikoski called this lookalike Stropharia cyanea, a name he based on James Bolton's 1820 taxon Agaricus cyaneus. Later researchers confirmed the existence and widespread European distribution of this taxon. Tuomikoski's use of the name S.cyanea, however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species S.aeruginosa. Despite this, the misapplied name S.cyanea has persisted in some contemporary field guides.|$|E

5|$|Operation Badr was {{preceded by}} {{training}} exercises starting in 1968, operational planning from 1971 onwards and a deception operation. In the opening stages of the attack, known as The Crossing (العبور; al-'obour), combat engineers used water cannons to rapidly clear numerous passages through the sand wall <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the canal, laid bridges and operated ferries, allowing armor to cross. Egyptian infantry assaulted the Bar-Lev fortifications and were counterattacked by Israeli armor and infantry.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E

The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> inner walls of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E
