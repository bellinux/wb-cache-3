40|$|A new {{formulation}} {{to determine}} the unit impulse response (Green’s) functions of a loaded rotating tyre in the vehicle-fixed (Eulerian) reference frame for tyre/road noise predictions is presented. The proposed formulation makes use of the set of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes for the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> obtained from a finite element (FE) model of the tyre. A closed-form expression for the Green’s functions of a rotating tyre in the Eulerian reference system {{as a function of}} the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> is found. Non-linear effects during loading are accounted for in the FE model, while the frequency shift due to the rotational velocity is included in the calculation of the Green’s functions. In the literature on tyre/road noise these functions are generally used {{to determine the}} tyre response during tyre/road contact calculations. The presented formulation opens the possibility to solve the contact problem directly in the Eulerian reference frame and to include local tyre softening due to non-linear effects while keeping the computational advantage of describing the tyre dynamics as a set of impulse response functions. The advantage of obtaining the Green’s functions in the Eulerian reference system is that only the Green’s functions corresponding to the potential contact zone need to be determined, which significantly reduces the computational cost of solving the tyre/road contact and since the mesh is fixed in space, a finer mesh can be used for the potential contact zone, improving the accuracy of the contact force calculations. Although these effects might be less pronounced if a more accurate tyre model is used, it is found that using the Green’s functions of the <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> in a contact force calculation leads to smaller forces than in the unloaded case, lower frequencies are present in the response and they decrease faster as the rotational velocity increases...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improved {{quantification}} of {{the shape}} and distribution of actual tyre-pavement contact stresses resulted in enhanced definitions of 3 D-tyre-pavement contact stresses for the design and analysis of flexible pavements. It is now possible to describe the 3 D-load/stress regimes {{with a series of}} discrete load values that were measured using Stress-In-Motion (SIM) technology, as well as being predicted from trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This paper illustrates the importance of these new load/stress inputs in pavement design on pavements with relatively thin asphalt surfacings, typically used in southern Africa. This investigation concentrates on the quantification of several pavement response parameters as a result of non–uniform and non-circular shaped contact stresses at different asphalt moduli, compared to the traditional circular uniformly <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> patch. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the detailed analyses. In addition, the responses of an un-cracked and cracked pavement structure were also compared, under circular and rectangular loading shapes of varying levels of loads and contact stresses using a customised semi-analytical FEM code. The response data were benchmarked with multi-layered linear elastic theory, and also indicated the importance of both the load shape and level of contact stress on pavement performance. The importance of using and managing actual tyre-pavement contact stress data for more rational design and analysis of pavements incorporating thin asphalt layers is highlighted. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{various aspects of}} soil {{compaction}} due to agricultural field traffic, the draught force requirement of tillage implements and soil structures produced by tillage. Several field experiments were carried out to study the mechanical impact of agricultural machines. It was shown that the stress interaction from the different wheels in dual and tandem wheel configurations is small and these wheels can be considered separate wheels with regard to soil stress. Hence, soil stress {{is not related to}} either axle load or total vehicle load. At high wheel <b>load,</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure affected subsoil stresses. The maximum stress at the soil-tyre interface was greater than the tyre inflation pressure. Furthermore, the distribution of stress beneath tyres and rubber belts was highly non-uniform. This was shown to have a great influence on stress propagation in soil. Therefore, with regard to soil compaction modelling, a uniform stress distribution (as often used) is too poor an approximation of the real stress distribution and can result in underestimation of soil compaction. A model for predicting the distribution of stress below tyres using readilyavailable tyre parameters is proposed. With a more realistic approximation of the stress distribution at the soil surface, simulated stresses generally agreed well with measure...|$|R

40|$|Loading soil via {{pneumatic}} tyres {{is a major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The loads applied to the soil and the resulting pressure influences the degree of soil compaction. This study was conducted to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres. This was conducted initially on a non-deformable surface; a later study will consider pressures within the subsoil. From this the tyre carcass stiffness was determined and methods to predict carcass stiffness were evaluated. Tyre carcass stiffness is defined as an equivalent pressure resulting from the stiffness of the tyre carcass. In order to estimate the carcass stiffness of tyres a number of approaches were considered including: (i) footprint area, (ii) <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> – deflection, (iii) pressure mapping and (iv) tyre manufacturer's specification methods. Carcass stiffness values obtained from the footprint area method gave results significantly lower (30 – 40 %) than those obtained using the pressure mapping system. The method based on the <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> – deflection characteristics was found to give a better estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness of the smooth rather than the treaded tyre. The technique of using the tyre manufacturer's specification data, where the estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness was calculated using the theoretical <b>load</b> that the <b>tyre</b> could support at zero inflation pressure, produced estimates that were within ± 20 % of the mean carcass stiffness determined using the pressure mapping system...|$|R
40|$|Estimating vehicle {{sideslip}} {{is challenging}} {{as well as}} important for vehicle safety systems such as Electronic Stability Control. In this work, a Kalman filter is proposed to estimate vehicle sideslip using tyre force measurements.

Because of the tyre force model nonlinearities and uncertainties, the estimator accuracy depends highly on factors such as tyre-road friction, vertical <b>load,</b> temperature, <b>tyre</b> pressure, etc. Therefore availability of tyre force measurements offers benefits in vehicle sideslip estimation. The proposed estimator also has advantage over accelerometer based estimators as the later can have estimation errors from roll and pitch dynamics.

40|$|Compaction of {{farmland}} can {{in many cases}} be negative. A poorer water infiltration in the soil profile, bad conditions for root growth, slower decomposition rate of organic material, {{and an increase in}} traction power are some of the negative effects. The most serious compaction is the one appearing below the depth of tillage, as it will exist for many years. The factors having the greatest influence on the amount of soil compaction is the wheel <b>load,</b> the <b>tyre</b> equipment used, the tyre inflation pressure and the water content in the soil. Factors discussed in this report are wheel <b>load,</b> <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure, the stress in the soil, the stress distribution in the contact area and the impact of these parameters on the amount of compaction. Three different experiments were carried out on three sites in the autumn in 2002. The first experiment was carried out at Svenstorp farm in southern Sweden. During dry conditions the stress and the deformation in the soil was measured under a 3 -row, a 6 -row and a 9 -row sugar beet harvester that were driving with different loads. The 6 -row harvester was also driven with different tire inflation pressures. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, macroporosity and bulk density was measured in the topsoil after a single pass with the harvesters. The second experiment took place at Krenkerup farm in southern Denmark. Two different systems for sugar beet harvesting were evaluated. The first system contained one big harvester only that had a loading capacity of 28 tons and a total weight of 55 tons. Because of the great loading capacity, it was able to bring the sugar beets {{to the end of the}} field. The other system contained a smaller harvester, with a total weight of 27 tons and two field trailers that were supporting the harvester all the time. The measurements were concentrated on stress and deformation in the subsoil and also stress and stress distribution in the topsoil under the different tyres. The last experiment took place at Ultuna, Uppsala, Sweden. In this experiment the stress and the stress distribution in the topsoil was measured when driving with different wheel <b>loads</b> and <b>tyre</b> inflation pressures. The results from Svenstorp showed the positive effects of a reduced tyre inflation pressure on soil stress, saturated hydraulic conductivity and macro porosity in the topsoil. Traffic by the 6 -row harvester, driving with a high tyre inflation pressure, was resulting in the lowest rate of saturated hydraulic conductivity, independently of the load. Also the boogie wheels of the 3 - row harvester were resulting in low infiltration rates, independently of the load. The measurements at Krenkerup showed that one passage over the soil with the big harvester deformed the soil more at both 30 cm and 70 cm depth, than one passage with the small harvester followed by the field trailer. The highest stress both at 30 cm and 70 cm depth was measured under one of the three tyres of the big harvester. There was a very even stress distribution between the three axles of the field trailer. Measurements at Ultuna showed that a higher wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept constant. A lower tyre inflation pressure resulted in a more even stress distribution in the contact area. The main conclusions of this study are: 1) A reduced tyre inflation pressure will greatly reduce compaction of the topsoil. 2) The deformation in the soil was greater after passing once with a 55 ton harvester than after passing once with a 27 ton harvester plus a field trailer. 3) An increase in wheel load resulted in a higher stress in the topsoil, even though the tyre inflation pressure was kept the same...|$|R
40|$|In general, when a tyre {{is running}} on a {{deformable}} soil, the soil compaction will occur not only on surface layers, but also on soil profile, in deeper layers. This leads {{to a series of}} negative effects not only on physical and mechanical properties of soil, but also influences the crops growth and the crop yield. For these reasons, currently are needed solutions to reduce soil compaction, caused mainly by agricultural implements passing on the soil surface in order to aply the specific crop production technologies. From our simulation we can draw the following conclusions: the soil stresses decreased with depth; the soil displacements magnitude increased with soil water content due to lower friction forces between soil particles (water acts like a lubricant between soil particles); decreasing rate for soil displacement is influenced by <b>load</b> magnitude and <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure; the soil particles moved in vertical plain from the top to the bottom, but also in horizontal direction, from the center to the edge in cross section and in longitudinal direction; the dimensions of the geometric shape of the mentioned soil volume is influenced by <b>load</b> and <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure.

40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform {{contact pressure}} over a circular contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre contact pressure measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of contact pressure. This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre contact pressure. That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform contact pressure representation and the measured 3 -D contact pressure is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same contact pressure for different combinations of axle loading and inflation pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the contact pressure observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D contact pressure representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 inflation pressures and 3 <b>tyre</b> <b>loads.</b> The inflation pressures were for a recommended inflation pressure and then plus and minus 200 kPa. The <b>tyre</b> <b>loading</b> was for a maximum European axle loading and then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre contact pressure can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D contact pressure in comparison to uniform contact pressure for all combinations of inflation pressure and <b>tyre</b> <b>loading.</b> The difference between the two contact pressure representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D contact pressure has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D contact pressure must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform contact pressure generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of inflation pressure and <b>tyre</b> <b>loading.</b> If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform contact pressure representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R
