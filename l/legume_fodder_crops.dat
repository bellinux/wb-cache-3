40|$|An organic {{long-term}} {{field experiment}} with two factors {{has been carried}} out since 1998 at the experimental station Gladbacherhof, University of Gießen. The effects of different farm types (with and without lifestock raising) combined with tillage treatments on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on soil fertility and cash crop yields according to the farm system especially in the 2 nd and 3 rd rotation. All in all, the superiority of a management system with cattle over stockless organic farming is demonstrated. The mixed farm type led to higher amounts of humus in the soil and to higher yields. Long term reduction of humus in stockless farming is not acceptable. Therefore it is advisable that every crop rotation in organic farming should include a <b>legume</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crop</b> element as a main crop...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} {{management}} {{is a challenge}} especially in stockless organic farming systems, as shares of <b>fodder</b> <b>legumes</b> in <b>crop</b> rotations are often small to provide more cash crop area, and farmyard manure as the most valuable source for organic matter supply to soils is not available. However, {{there are many different}} options for stockless farms to tackle this challenge. In this article we discuss strategies for organic matter supply to soils based on scenarios for different soil-climate regions in Germany. We conclude that the integration of <b>fodder</b> <b>legumes</b> into <b>crop</b> rotations is the most valuable option, as these crops do not only provide carbon but are able to replace mineralized soil organic matter nitrogen that has been exported with the harvested biomass of the cash crops...|$|R
30|$|Medjerda {{river basin}} {{accounts}} for about 80  % of the total surface water resources (Bouraoui et al. 2005). It {{is used for the}} irrigation of cultivated land which covers an area of 33, 173  ha. These irrigated areas consist of nearly a quarter of the total irrigated areas of the country. Moreover, 80  % of the cultivated area is occupied by orchards, cereals, <b>legumes</b> and <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> while almost 19  % consist of market gardens. The most common irrigation method is surface irrigation, but its efficiency is low (50 – 70  %) in comparison to other efficient water systems such as spray (80 – 85  %) and drip (90 – 95  %) (Howell 2003; Rogers et al. 1997) which represent 38  % of the public irrigated areas.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganic {{agriculture}} {{could achieve}} {{the objectives of}} sustainable agriculture by banning the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. However, organic crops generally show lower performances than conventional ones. In France, organic winter wheat production is characterized by low grain protein content. There is a crucial need for better understanding the variability of grain protein content, because millers require batches with values over 10. 5 % of dry matter. Here, a regional agronomic diagnosis was carried out to identify the limiting factors and crop management practices explaining the variability of grain protein content. The studied field network was a set of 51 organic winter wheat plots in south-eastern France. The mixed-model method was used for identifying and ranking the limiting factors and the crop management practices responsible for variation in limiting factors. Our {{results show that the}} grain protein content variation was mostly explained by the baking quality grade of the cultivar, crop nitrogen status and weed density at flowering. There was a positive correlation between grain protein content and both crop nitrogen status and weed density. To a lesser extent, climatic factors also explained grain protein content variability. A lower water stress increased grain protein content, whereas an increase in the photothermal quotient and daily temperature over 25 °C reduced grain protein content. In south-eastern France, grain protein content of organic winter wheat could be increased by improving fertilization management, using an improved baking quality grade cultivar, choosing a <b>legume</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crop</b> as preceding crop, or by avoiding late sowing dates...|$|R
40|$|An {{adequate}} {{supply of}} organic matter to arable soils {{is essential for the}} maintenance of soil productivity. Still, management implications can cause a trade-off with economics, as measures for soil organic matter management may not directly induce ecosystem services that increase the profitability of the system. This is especially true with regard to stockless organic farming systems, where well-proven measures, as the integration of <b>fodder</b> <b>legumes</b> in <b>crop</b> rotations, may not seem attractive with regard to the revenue. In this article we evaluate strategies for soil organic matter management in stockless organic farming systems based on scenarios for different soil-climate conditions in Germany to deal with this challenge. Several options to make use of synergies between soil organic matter management and profitability could be identified. In particular, the integration of <b>fodder</b> <b>legumes,</b> even on the cost of cash crop shares in rotations, may cause a win-win situation, if the biomass of the legumes {{can be used in a}} profitable way that creates a mobile nutrient pool and allows for a return {{of organic matter}}, as e. g. biogas production...|$|R
40|$|In Sub-Saharan Saharan Africa, {{rangeland}} {{is increasingly}} converted to cropland, creating diverse crop-livestock livestock practices in different environments. As these practices lead to highly adapted livestock production systems using resources that vary locally and seasonally, not much {{is known about}} their similarities and differences. We assessed different crop-livestock crop systems through 60 semistructured interviews in lowlands ( 2400 m. a. s. l) l) around the Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Average livestock numbers per household were higher in lowlands (43) and highlands (18), where access to communal grazing lands was possible. Cattle dominated at all sites, draught oxen numbers increased with available cropping land per household. All sites used crop residues as supplemental feed. Dung was used as manure in most households, as fuel is used only in higher regions. Our study showed that crop-livestock livestock practices and livestock numbers {{can be explained by}} altitude titude but also by the availability of private and communally used land. Further practices should include growing <b>fodder</b> <b>legumes,</b> <b>crop</b> rotations, and intercropping, which might support a reduced reduced-tillage system and reduce numbers of environmentally costly draught raught oxen...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} in the Nakuru District of the Kenyan Highlands, the major milk sources for the Nairobi milk market, were to evaluate current dairy cattle rearing and feeding practices, and suggest efficient feeding management strategies on large and small-scale commercial dairy farms. 139 small-scale farms with 738 dairy cows were surveyed and 6 large-scale dairy farms with 4379 dairy cattle. On the small farms, high mortality rates, cost of AI, and disease were the major causes of poor reproduction leading {{to a lack of}} replacement stock. Feeding systems used were: 24 % free grazing system, 33 % semi-zero grazing, 40 % zero grazing, and 3 % rotational grazing, but limited feeds were available – crops and feed crop residues, cut grass on the roadside, neighbouring farms with some purchased hay and straws in the dry season. After weaning, feed supplements were rarely given to calves, priority being given to milking cows, explaining the few replacement stock kept and their high mortality. The six large scale farms were from 200 to 3500 acres with milk production, cereal <b>crops,</b> <b>fodder</b> <b>crops,</b> the scale of replacement dairy stock and hay to other dairy farms the main activities with land allocated 65 % to livestock, 20 % to cash crops (Barley and Wheat), 10 % to <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> and 5 % to other land-uses. Replacement heifers for sale were insufficient to meet demands from small-scale farms. Grazing systems were mainly extensive with supplements fed at milking.   All the farms depended on planted forage grasses, mainly: Rhodes grass, Star grass, Sudan grass and Kikuyu grass. Calf mortality rate (10 - 18 %) was high caused mostly by respiratory diseases and East Coast Fever. Extended age at first calving (> 31. 8 ± 4. 5 months), long calving intervals (> 406 days) and low average milk yields (6. 81 /day ± 3. 9) for all breeds, occurred. Production and reproductive performances needs to be addressed by proper nutrition. Suitable pasture grasses, <b>legumes</b> and <b>fodder</b> <b>crops</b> not currently being used have been identified as potential options to complement the existing pasture. Among these are: Guinea grass (panicum maximum), Cynodon dactylon, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Naivasha star grass (Cynodon plectostachyus) and Rhodesian star grass (Setaria sphacelata). Other studies examining supplementation of animals on low quality pastures with the above feeds resulted in increased body weights and milk yields. The greatest potential seems to be supplementing with home-grown proteinaceous feedstuffs such as Leucaena leucocephala, Calliandra, Sesbania or food crop residues like groundnut, cassava, sweet potato vines or pigeon-pea leaves and stems. Farmers could increase their pasture land productivity by establishing fodder grass, fodder shrubs and food crops as intercropping, hedgerows and along contour bands.
