40|$|PURPOSE: To report {{response}} rate, pelvic tumor control, survival, {{and late}} toxicity after treatment with combined radiotherapy and hyperthermia (RHT) {{for patients with}} locally advanced cervical carcinoma (LACC) and compare the results with other published series. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1996 to 2005, a total of 378 patients with LACC (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IB 2 -IVA) were treated with RHT. External beam radiotherapy (RT) was applied to 46 - 50. 4 Gy and combined with brachytherapy. The hyperthermia (HT) was prescribed once weekly. Primary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were complete response (CR) and <b>local</b> control. Secondary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were overall survival, disease-specific survival, and late toxicity. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics predictive for the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were identified in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Overall, a CR was achieved in 77 % of patients. At 5 years, local control, disease-specific survival, and incidence of late toxicity Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or higher were 53 %, 47 %, and 12 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, number of HT treatments emerged {{as a predictor of}} outcome in addition to commonly identified prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The CR, local control, and survival rates are similar to previously observed results of RHT in the randomized Dutch Deep Hyperthermia Trial. Reported treatment results for currently applied combined treatment modalities (i. e., RT with chemotherapy and/or HT) do not permit definite conclusions about which combination is superior. The present results confirm previously shown beneficial effects from adding HT to RT and justify the application of RHT as first-line treatment in patients with LACC as an alternative to chemoradiation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} results from a {{randomized}} trial comparing accelerated radiotherapy (AR) with accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen inhalation and nicotinamide (ARCON) in laryngeal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cT 2 - 4 squamous cell laryngeal cancer {{were randomly assigned to}} AR (68 Gy within 36 to 38 days) or ARCON. To limit the risk of laryngeal necrosis, ARCON patients received 64 Gy on the laryngeal cartilage. The primary <b>end</b> <b>point</b> was <b>local</b> control. Secondary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were regional control, larynx preservation, toxicity, disease-free survival, and overall survival. In a translational side study, the hypoxia marker pimonidazole was used to assess the oxygenation status in tumor biopsies. RESULTS: From April 2001 to February 2008, 345 patients were accrued. After a median follow-up of 44 months, local tumor control rate at 5 years was 78 % for AR versus 79 % for ARCON (P =. 80), with larynx preservation rates of 84 % and 87 %, respectively (P =. 48). The 5 -year regional control was significantly better with ARCON (93 %) compared with AR (86 %, P =. 04). The improvement in regional control was specifically observed in patients with hypoxic tumors and not in patients with well-oxygenated tumors (100 % v 55 %, respectively; P =. 01). AR and ARCON produced equal levels of toxicity. CONCLUSION: Despite lack of benefit in local tumor control for advanced laryngeal cancers, a significant gain in regional control rate, with equal levels of toxicity, was observed in favor of ARCON.

Forty-nine central tumors received 23 Gy in a single fraction and 54 peripheral tumors received a dose of 30 Gy in a single fraction. The primary <b>end</b> <b>point</b> was <b>local</b> control; secondary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were survival and toxicity. Median follow-up was 15 months (range, 3 - 45 months).

40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{increasing}} number of pharmacologic strategies available for treatment of heart failure (HF), {{the time has come to}} reassess the adequacy of <b>end</b> <b>points</b> used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Interest in the use of surrogate <b>end</b> <b>points</b> in clinical studies is increasing. A surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is defined as a measurement that can substitute for a true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> for the purpose of comparing specific interventions or treatments in a clinical trial. A true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is one that is of clinical importance to the patient (e. g., mortality or quality of life), whereas a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is one biologically closer to the disease process (e. g., ejection fraction or left ventricular volume in HF). The prime motivation for the use of a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> concerns the possible reduction in sample size or trial duration. Such reductions have important cost implications and in some cases may influence trial feasibility. Another, perhaps more important, aspect of measuring surrogate <b>end</b> <b>points</b> is that they increase our understanding of the mechanism of action of drugs and thus may help physicians to take a more enlightened approach in managing their patients. In this article we have analyzed the possible potentials of the surrogate <b>end</b> <b>points</b> in clinical studies of patients with chronic HF. Other uses of possible surrogates are discussed, and the limitations in finding true surrogates are mentioned. At this time we conclude there is no well established surrogate in HF...|$|R

40|$|A {{surrogate}} <b>end</b> <b>point</b> {{is often}} used to evaluate the effects of treatments or exposures on the true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> in medical researches. Various criteria for the statistical surrogate, principal surrogate and strong surrogate have been proposed. We first illustrate that, with a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point</b> that is defined by these criteria, it is possible that a treatment has a positive effect on the surrogate, which in turn has a positive effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> but the treatment has a negative effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> We define such a phenomenon as a surrogate paradox. The surrogate paradox also means that the sign of the treatment effect on the true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is unpredictable by the effect signs of both the treatment on the surrogate and the surrogate on the true <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> Then we propose two notions for a consistent surrogate and a strictly consistent surrogate to avoid the surrogate paradox.

For a continuous or ordinal discrete <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> the distributional causal effect (DCE) may be a more appropriate measure for a causal effect than the ACE. We discuss criteria for surrogate <b>end</b> <b>points</b> based on DCEs. We show that commonly used models, such as generalized linear models and Cox's proportional hazard models, can make the sign of the DCE of the treatment on the true <b>end</b> <b>point</b> determinable by the sign of the DCE of the treatment on the surrogate even if the models include unobserved confounders. Furthermore, for a general distribution without any assumption of parametric models, we give a sufficient condition for a distributionally consistent surrogate and prove that it is almost necessary.

Despite its rarityw 1, 000 patients have been randomised in placebo-controlled trials using novel therapies, including prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists and, most recently, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors.

Inclusion criteria were interventional study, chronic pain in adults, and pain measured within the primary <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> ResultsOf 1256 PubMed citations and 3006 clinical trial registry entries, 356 reported large clinical studies in pain populations (e. g., malignant, neuropathic, functional, and musculoskeletal). Studies were designed for superiority in 28 % of PubMed citations and 8 % of registry entries. The primary <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of most studies were single-dimension pain instruments, such as the numerical rating scale (n = 131) and the visual analogue scale (n = 69). In cases in which multidimensional pain <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were used, this was most commonly the Brief Pain Inventory (n = 37). Payer-relevant <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were typically limited to secondary <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> and were limited and/or reported inconsistently in published studies and ongoing/recently completed studies: preference-weighted quality of life (36 % and 42 %), resource use (2 % and 8 %), physical function (28 % and 39 %), and psychological function (25 % and 24 %). ConclusionsMost pain trials were not designed to show superiority to an active comparator, and they used single-dimension pain scales as their primary <b>end</b> <b>point</b> in combination with a broader selection of secondary <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> The inclusion of payer-relevant <b>end</b> <b>points</b> among clinical trials was inconsistent...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{currently}} established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> {{for clinical}} trials of progression of {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) are end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, which approximates a 57 % decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). There is increased interest in using alternative <b>end</b> <b>points</b> in clinical trials to shorten trial duration and reduce sample size. As part of an evaluation of using lesser declines in GFR as alternative <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> we examined the associations of various levels of eGFR decline with the subsequent development of established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> and assess the consistency of alternate levels of eGFR decline across varying clinical manifestations of kidney disease and interventions. Study Design: Observational analysis of randomized controlled trials. Setting & Participants: 9, 488 participants in 37 randomized controlled trials in CKD. Predictor: Alternative <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> defined as 30 % and 40 % declines in eGFR from baseline to month 12. Effect modification by baseline eGFR, proteinuria, cause of disease, and interventions. Outcomes: Established <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> defined as end-stage renal disease, eGFR = 30 % or >= 40 %, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 2. 0 (IQR, 1. 2 - 3. 1) years after the 12 -month baseline period, 2, 661 established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were observed. A strong linear association was observed between eGFR decline and subsequent established <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> HRs for the established <b>end</b> <b>point</b> for 30 % and 40 % decreases in eGFR compared to a 0 % decline were 9. 6 (95 % CI, 7. 3 - 12. 6) and 20. 3 (95 % CI, 14. 1 - 29. 3), respectively. The associations were consistent regardless of baseline eGFR, proteinuria, causes of disease, and interventions. Limitations: Observational study subject to residual confounding. Conclusions: The strong associations between lesser declines in eGFR and the subsequent development of established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were consistent across different clinical characteristics of kidney disease and interventions and support implementation of alternative <b>end</b> <b>points</b> in clinical trials of CKD progression.

40|$|Background: There is {{increased}} interest in using alternative <b>end</b> <b>points</b> for trials of kidney disease progression. The currently established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> of end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, equivalent to a 57 % decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), are late events in chronic kidney disease (CKD), requiring large clinical trials with long follow-up. As {{part of a comprehensive}} evaluation of lesser declines in eGFR as alternative <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> we describe the consistency of treatment effects of intervention on the alternative and established <b>end</b> <b>points</b> in past trials. Study Design: Diagnostic test study. Setting & Population: 9, 488 participants from 37 randomized controlled trials of CKD progression across 5 intervention types. Index Test: Alternative <b>end</b> <b>points</b> including percentage change in eGFR from baseline (20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 57 %) throughout study duration and to 12, 18, and 24 months. eGFR change confirmed versus nonconfirmed at the next visit. Reference Test: The historically established <b>end</b> <b>point</b> of time to composite of treated kidney failure (end-stage renal disease), untreated kidney failure (GFR < 15 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)), or doubling of serum creatinine level throughout study duration. Results: Over a median of 3. 62 years' follow-up, there were 3, 070 established <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> Compared to the established <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> the number of alternative <b>end</b> <b>points</b> was greater for smaller versus larger declines in eGFR and longer versus shorter follow-up intervals. There was a general trend toward attenuation of the treatment effect with <b>end</b> <b>points</b> defined by a lesser eGFR decline, with greater attenuation with nonconfirmed <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> except for the low-protein-diet intervention, for which a stronger treatment effect was observed. The ratio (95 % credible interval) of the HR for the alternative to established <b>end</b> <b>point</b> for the 5 intervention types ranged from 0. 91 (0. 64 - 1. 43) to 1. 12 (0. 89 - 1. 40) for 40 % decline and from 0. 88 (0. 63 - 1. 39) to 1. 15 (0. 88 - 1. 54) for 30 % decline for the overall study duration, indicating consistency of treatment effects. Limitations: Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many CKD clinical trials. Conclusions: These results provide some support for the use of lesser eGFR declines as a surrogate <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> with stronger support for the 40 % than 30 % decline.

40|$|Background: The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} <b>end</b> <b>point</b> in random-ized cancer screening trials is disease-specific mortality. The validity of this <b>end</b> <b>point,</b> however, rests {{on the assumption that}} cause of death can be determined accurately. An alter-native <b>end</b> <b>point</b> is all-cause mortality, which depends only on the accurate ascertainment of deaths and when they oc-cur. We compared disease-specific and all-cause mortality in published randomized cancer-screening trials to indirectly assess the validity of the disease-specific mortality <b>end</b> <b>point.</b> Methods:We examined all 12 published randomized trials of cancer screening for which both <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were available (seven of mammography, three of fecal occult blood detec-tion, and two of chest x-ray screening for lung cancer). For each randomized trial, we subtracted disease-specific mor-tality observed in the screened group from that observed i...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{heart failure}} syndromes (AHFS) remain {{a major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality, in part because the development of new therapies for these disorders has been marked by frequent failure and little success. The heterogeneity of current approaches to AHFS drug development, particularly with regard to <b>end</b> <b>points,</b> remains a major potential barrier to progress in the field. <b>End</b> <b>points</b> involving hemodynamic status, biomarkers, symptoms, hospital stay, end organ function, and mortality have all been employed either alone or in combination in recent randomized clinical trials in AHFS. In this review, we will discuss the various <b>end</b> <b>point</b> domains from both a clinical and a statistical perspective, summarize the wide variety of <b>end</b> <b>points</b> used in completed and ongoing AHFS studies, and suggest steps for greater standardization of <b>end</b> <b>points</b> across AHFS trials...|$|R
