40|$|The {{rise in the}} {{complexity}} and globalization of financial services has contributed to stronger interconnections or linkages. While more extensive linkages contribute to economic growth by smoothing credit allocation and allowing greater risk diversification, they also increase the potential for disruptions to spread swiftly across markets and borders. In addition, financial complexity has enabled risk transfers that were not fully recognized by financial regulators or by institutions themselves, complicating the assessment of counterparty risk, risk management, and policy responses. Thus the importance of assessing the systemic implications of financial linkages. The current crisis has highlighted how systemic linkages can arise not just from financial institutions’ solvency concerns but also from <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeezes</b> and other stress events.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{measures}} the systemic {{risk of a}} banking sector as a hypothetical distress insurance premium, identifies various sources of financial instability, and allocates systemic risk to individual financial institutions. The systemic risk measure, defined as the insurance cost to protect against distressed losses in a banking system, is a summary indicator of market perceived risk that reflects expected default risk of individual banks, risk premia as well as correlated defaults. An application of our methodology to a portfolio of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific illustrates {{the dynamics of the}} spillover effects of the global financial crisis to the region. The increase in the perceived systemic risk, particularly after the failure of Lehman Brothers, was mainly driven by the heightened risk aversion and the <b>squeezed</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Further analysis, which is based on our proposed approach to quantifying the marginal contribution of individual banks to the systemic risk, suggests that “too-big-to-fail ” is a valid concern from a macroprudential perspective of bank regulation...|$|R

The algorithm is used to study the relationship between liquidity, production, and inequality in income and in welfare, in economies where assets fetch different returns and agents have heterogeneous skills and preferences. One experiment shows a case of reversal of fortune. An economy endowed with a low-return asset takes over a similar economy endowed with a high-return asset because, in the former economy, a group of agents abandon a rent-seeking trading behavior and increase their income by trading and producing more intensively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} which studies the business-cycle implications of financial frictions and liquidity risk at the bank-level. Following Holmstr m and Tirole (1998), demand for liquidity reserves arises from the anticipation of idiosyncratic operating expenses during the execution phase of bank-financed investment projects. Banks react to adverse aggregate shocks by hoarding liquidity while being forced to decrease their leverage. Both effects amplify recessionary dynamics, since they crowd out funds available for investment financing. This mechanism is triggered by a market <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> modelled {{as a shock to}} the collateral value of banks assets. This novel type of aggregate risk induces a credit crunch scenario which shares key features with the Great Recession such as strong output decline, pro-cyclical leverage and counter-cyclical liquidity hoarding.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{economic}} crisis on EU labour markets: A comparative perspective Pasquale TRIDICO* Abstract. Using a “crisis management index ” to rank the combined GDP and labour market performances of the EU’s 27 Member States, the author consid-ers why some countries performed better than others in managing the economic crisis over the period 2007 – 11. Based on empirical correlations and regression analysis, he concludes that the best performers share a coordinated market econ-omy model: they feature a mix of economic policies and social institutions – in-cluding coordination mechanisms and tighter financial regulation – which helped to stabilize their levels of consumption and aggregate demand. Moreover, {{they do not have}} flexible labour markets and thus managed to maintain stable em-ployment levels. The crisis which started in the United States ’ financial sector in 2007 spread rapidly across the global economy, affecting almost all sectors and la-bour markets (Posner, 2009; United Nations, 2009; OECD, 2010) and caus-ing mass unemployment in the United States and in Europe (Krugman, 2008; Wolff, 2010). Many Member States of the European Union (EU) have yet to recover from the average GDP contraction of − 4. 2 per cent they suffered in 2009. Their GDP has since stagnated, yet their unemployment levels have not declined (Fitoussi and Stiglitz, 2009; Barba and Pivetti, 2009; Fitoussi and Saraceno, 2010).

30|$|Nevertheless, in {{the current}} case of China, there are clearly not enough reasons to fear the {{depreciation}} of RMB. First, the burden of external debt is relatively low in China. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies account for {{only a small portion}} of the total liabilities of financial institutions in China. In the corporate sector, the overall volume of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is still under control despite its rapid growth in recent years. Moreover, thanks to the deleveraging process since the expectation of RMB depreciation appeared last year, the scale of corporate sector external debts has dropped significantly. Second, although capital flight does have downward pressure on the economy in theory, there are reasons to believe it will not have too much impact on the Chinese economy under current circumstances, because the economy is short of investment demands rather than liquidity. Besides, the PBC still has sufficient policy space to offset the <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> created by the capital flight. Third, the problem of the Chinese economy is structural deflation but not inflation at present. In the short term, the depreciation of RMB not only will not cause inflation but also will help to mitigate the deflation. Forth, there is no basis for substantial depreciation of RMB, for China is in a healthy condition in terms of international payment, maintaining a moderate current account surplus for a long time. Last but not the least, the moderate depreciation of RMB could help to maintain employment in exporting enterprises through alleviating pressures on them.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{systems in}} Asian {{emerging}} market economies {{are in a}} state of transition. Through processes that began before the 1997 financial crisis in some Southeast Asian countries and gained momentum there and elsewhere after the crisis, countries in the region have opted for financial liberalisation to differing degrees. This state of transition has influenced assessments of the impact of the 2008 global crisis on the financial systems of these countries, especially the banking system in the region. If the focus is on the remnants of the pre-existing regulatory framework, the better performance of these banks during the crisis as opposed to those in other emerging markets can be attributed to the regulatory framework. If the focus is on the change that occurred after 1997, their resilience could be attributed to regulatory reform. One set of policies of relevance here is that relating to the presence of foreign banks in these markets, which is the concern of this paper. In assessments of alternative forms of financial regulation that the 2008 financial crisis has prompted, systems prevalent in Asian economies have often been referred to favourably (Reddy, 2011; Standard & Poor’s, 2008). The obvious reason is the relative resilience shown by these countries in the aftermath of the crisis. Initially, driven by the need to cover losses or meet commitments at home, foreign financial firms withdrew capital from Asian emerging markets, resulting in the threat of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> and/or a currency crisis.

40|$|The 2007 - 09 Global Financial Crisis {{has been}} {{described}} as the greatest crisis in the history of financial capitalism. The failure of the global financial system was triggered by the ‘Great American Real Estate Bubble,’ however it quickly developed into a global <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> that left financial markets at the brink of collapse. The thesis argues that the general culture of banking prevalent at the time both caused and exacerbated the crisis. The Business Strategies were excessively risky, focusing on short-term gains, at the expense of financial security. It is therefore purported that to mitigate the risks of any future global financial crisis a fundamental change in the culture of banking is needed. Behavioural expectations and norms must be redefined and more prudent strategies inculcated. The thesis will show {{that the only way to}} hope to achieve such a cultural shift is to employ a holistic approach, encompassing supervision, regulation and crucially corporate governance mechanisms. Previous debates within the UK have tended to focus on macro and micro regulatory reform. However, it is purported that it was in many cases, risk monitoring and management practices within financial institutions that dramatically failed. Whilst prudential regulation is important, the thesis will show that it alone is insufficient to change the culture within the financial system; a multi-faceted approach is needed. The central argument to the thesis will show that corporate governance mechanisms must play a central part in the legal and regulatory response to the Global Financial Crisis, as part of a cohesive package of measures necessary to effect cultural change; it will do this by conducting a case study into the collapse and subsequent nationalisation of Northern Rock Plc...|$|E
40|$|In 1817 {{the then}} fourteen-year old bank - Malmö diskont - was {{subjected}} to a bank run and the bank closed. At the time, Malmö diskont {{was one of three}} privately owned commercial banks. All three had to close as bank runs occurred on the other two banks as well. Thus, these banks, with their roots in the 18 th century disappeared with noticeable economic repercussions. Although Sweden had a large non-bank credit market, consisting of merchants and private bankers, {{it took a long time}} to restore confidence in privately owned commercial banks. The purpose of this Ph. D. thesis - Malmö diskont, an institutional analysis of a banking crisis - is to increase the knowledge about the banking crisis in Sweden in 1817. The research question is: “Why did Malmö diskont go under?” Institutional theory has been used as a tool to arrive at the answer. The basic assumption is that institutions both set the limits for individuals‟ actions and sometimes direct them towards actions. The results have been arrived at by mapping the existing institutional framework and analyze how it interacted with the Malmö diskont management. The conclusion is that the banking crisis evolved in two stages. The first stage was that the financial position of Malmö diskont became untenable in the interaction between institutions and actors. The thesis describes how the crisis developed. Malmö diskont was beyond hope of survival in 1817. It was not only a matter of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze.</b> New equity and a bail-out were needed for survival, as well as a restructuring of the institutional structure for survival. The second stage occurred when the financial position became clear for the government. The same support procedure was initially followed as in earlier liquidity crises for the discount banks. However, the institutional framework was over-ridden by an actor - the government, led by the crown prince – who did not pursue the rescue operation with the same determination as in earlier crises and Malmö diskont was allowed to fall.

40|$|The Asian {{currency}} crisis revealed the structural {{weaknesses of the}} banking systems in Asia, following the devaluation of Thai Baht on 2 July 1997. With freedom of movement of capital, economies in Thailand, Indonesia and Korea were affected adversely by the <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> when capital flowed out. Banks had {{to raise interest rates}} and nonperforming loans (NPLs) mounted, leading to severe stresses on banking systems. Post crisis, there were signs of limited recovery of the region in sight, but the region-wide reforms would take some time to complete. In the interim, Singapore could use the crisis to position the entire financial sector has to better respond to future challenges. The thesis would analyse the causes of the crisis as starting point to derive the directions the financial sector should take. Preserving the stability of the banking sector whilst engendering a more efficient use of capital remains a central issue in this thesis. The crisis has shown that an over-reliance on the debt capital model could lead to a systemic weakness in the economy, and this motivated the need to develop the financial market to ensure diversification. The thesis then evaluates the liberalisation measures adopted by the regulatory body (Monetary Authority of Singapore) in its bid to enhance the financial sector, and identifies some of the main opportunities and challenges ahead. Beyond leveraging on Singapore's time-tested regulatory, accounting and legal systems, financial institutions will need {{to take into account the}} impact of technology and financial innovation. Globalisation, electronic and online trading are potentially going to disrupt the traditional models of banking and exchanges. Consequently, both the banking and financial market industries need to respond to this new challenge, and the traditional advantages of geography were being eroded. To remain as a vibrant international financial market, banks and exchanges have to upgrade, creating new and more sophisticated value-added products and services through specialisation. by Ann Chai Wong.

40|$|The {{structure}} of fmancial {{markets in the}} USA, Euro-zone and Australia have undergone significant changes {{in response to the}} reduced need for their central banks to issue government securities. For example, the adoption of an Economic and Monetmy Union (EMU) has required a high degree of consistency in a number of policy areas including mles to restrict the size of budget deficits. ill the early 2000 's adjusting to reduced government securities was a key consideration in US fmance literature (Reinha 1 t and Sack, 2000; Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 2002, 2), but has become less important with the resurgence of large domestic deficit budgets in the US since 2002. The continued surplus budgets in Australia have meant that the implications of less government bonds outstanding on fmancial markets continues to be discussed. Most of the EMU countries have run moderate budget deficits (% GDP), so the absolute amount of euro-denominated government securities outstanding has fluctuated and tended to grow slowly. Therefore fear of a severe <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze</b> has not eventuated but some aspects of changed and restricted issuance have continued to be relevant. The Australian Treasurer adopted a medium term commitment to achieve and then maintain surplus budgets (from 1997), reducing the need for government bond issuance in the Australian fmancial market. In an Australian Government initiated Review on the Commonwealth Government Securities Market (Review) (2002), stakeholders views were sought {{on the extent to which}} government bonds offer unique financial market characteristics. The Review invited discussion of alternative · instruments to replace the dominant role of government securities. This research paper investigates developments in the Australian financial market since the Review (2002), and considers whether a rapid growth of corporate bonds has allowed adequate availability of low risk securities with benchmark status and liquidity, as existed in a government bond dominated fixed interest security market. The paper compares Australian experience with EMU markets, where growth of an interest rate swap market and credit derivatives have helped manage credit risk as well as supplement market liquidity. The research makes a preliminary assessment of how these financial markets have adapted to changed availability of government security issuance...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{persistence}} of relatively soft budget constraints and poor government credibility, the survival strategy of Romanian state-sector firms means eschewing profit maximization {{in the short run}} in favor of insider utility maximization. This takes the form of attempts at both reducing layoffs and minimizing real wage losses on the background of substantial adjustment in real output. Nominal adjustment (especially pricing and arrears) is favored over riskier and more costly real adjustment, since firms are risk-averse in the longer run. From an operational viewpoint, the representative firm's objective becomes that of maximizing liquidity flows subject to constraints regarding labor hoarding systemic limits to debt default and spontaneous restructuring. Empirical evidence supports the idea of an inflation-output tradeoff (in terms of variations around trends) where increases in expected inflation and/or expected gross nominal arrears have a significant negative impact on real industrial output, while unexpected inflation (and defaulted debt) exhibits positive but insignificant coefficients. The tradeoff persists even when controlling for demand-side factors. Monetary variables do not appear to cause this tradeoff, but rather seem to be mediating it. Persistence is also much more pronounced in inflation than it is in real output. Monetary policy measures then tend to have an asymmetric impact: they are likely to affect the nominal side more than the real one; monetary aggregates tend to have a sharp short-run impact compared to the stronger and longer-lasting effects induced with a lag by changes in interest rates; required reserves, because of their lesser political visibility, have for a long period been a more effective instrument of monetary policy management compared to refinancing rates, when the central bank's independence was ambiguous. Finally, {{in the context of a}} specific credit channel fueled both by commercial bank loans and by differential access to defaulted debt, short-term credit to the state sector exhibits adverse selection features compared to loans extended to private-sector firms, with the latter being in the position of net creditor due to the predominance of hard budget constraints. Firm immunity (given by size, political sensitiveness of the respective industry, importance as regional employer, etc.) to punitive interventions either on the part of government authorities or creditors seems to play a large role in the proliferation of financial indiscipline as a repeated game, with large, poorly efficient firms initiating arrears growth and other firms following either voluntarily (due to cost-of-credit differences) or involuntarily (because of a <b>liquidity</b> <b>squeeze).</b> Interestingly, arrears are not perfect substitutes for credit, while both M 2 and nongovernment credit appear to accommodate increases in gross arrears. The transmission of monetary policy via a credit channel is also interesting in the post- 1996 context of central bank deposit taking meant to sterilize excess liquidity due to relatively high capital inflows. The policy conclusions point to the limited effectiveness of monetary policy in macrostabilization of structuural reforms, privatization, financial discipline and improvements in corporate governance are absent or slow; the need for austere monetary policy in sustaining these measures; and the danger of expansionary policy aimed at growth and/or employment objectives. Institutional reforms at the central bank level (improvements in the independece of the monetary authority, stating price stability as the paramount objective of monetary policy, instituting multi-annual inflation targets in the context of a consistent macro policy mix, etc) are also examined. asymetric impact of monetary policy, inflation-output tradeoff, persistence, soft budget constraints, transition, transmission of channels...|$|E
