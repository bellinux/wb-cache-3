25|$|When it {{had been}} {{determined}} to transfer the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, several changes {{were made to the}} equipment. As subway cars, the Composite motor cars were simply too heavy to run on elevated structures. Therefore, they were lightened. The trucks were replaced with the lighter elevated type, and smaller, less powerful motors (120hp instead of 200hp) were installed. As mentioned above, by 1916, 208 of the motorized Composites had already been converted into trailers. When the IRT <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> and noted the reduction in power of motor cars associated with using the smaller motors, it decided to convert all Composite trailers to motors in 1916. While this modification added weight to the trailer cars, the load on each wheel was still within the acceptable range to run on elevated structure. Therefore, all Composites became motorized.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E
500|$|In {{his opening}} speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race {{may have played}} a part in the case, {{due to the fact that}} a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely {{involved}} in the case were black. He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, [...] "the implicit message is that it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. This is absolutely shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, [...] "for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: [...] "I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action", and, [...] "there are no cultures that condone child abuse. We are absolutely clear that social workers and social work departments have a responsibility to consider whether children are subjected to harm, and if they think they are, to take action".sic] correctness 'puts children at risk'"].
