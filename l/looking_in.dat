5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but on the outside <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation {{about the idea of}} re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as when an {{individual}} attempts to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Dot is told by {{the police}} that Nick has died of {{respiratory}} failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne {{to tell the truth}} and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E

5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. <b>Looking</b> <b>in</b> his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished on the outside <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|They {{lose the}} {{diamonds}} {{in the plane}} crash and {{spend much of their}} time on the island searching for them. Paulo suspects they are the only reason for their relationship, and thus does not tell Nikki when he finds them on their thirty-third day after the crash. One day while <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> the jungle, they come across the , a scientific research station built in the early 1980s. Nikki is uninterested, but Paulo later returns by himself on his forty-ninth day on the island, hiding the diamonds in the toilet. While in the washroom, Paulo overhears two of the mysterious and dangerous island inhabitants known as the Others speak of capturing some of Paulo's fellow survivors; however, he keeps this information to himself.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki walking into a small orange-lit room with a black object on a stall. After touching it, the entire room starts to light up, and the singer subsequently walks around singing to the song; scenes are digitally-altered and edited during the process. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is seen wearing a white outfit while a mysterious light shines around the room. The video subsequently ends with the singer sitting on a small chair, <b>looking</b> <b>in</b> the distance. The clip was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best (2016). The visual was additionally used as the theme song for Japanese cosmetics company Aube's launch of their lipstick range, which led to Hamasaki becoming their spokeswoman and appearing in a campaign video.|$|E
