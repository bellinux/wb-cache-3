50|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} on food rheology because the study of food rheology entails unique factors beyond an understanding of the basic rheological dynamics of the flow and deformation of matter. Food can be classified according to its rheological state, such as a solid, gel, <b>liquid,</b> <b>emulsion</b> with associated rheological behaviors, and its rheological properties can be measured. These properties will affect the design of food processing plants, as well as shelf life and other important factors, including sensory properties that appeal to consumers. Because foods are structurally complex, often a mixture of fluid and solids with varying properties within a single mass, the study of food rheology is more complicated than study in fields such as the rheology of polymers. However, food rheology is something we experience every day with our perception of food texture (see below) and basic concepts of food rheology well apply to polymers physics, oil flow etc. For this reason, examples of food rheology are didactically useful to explain the dynamics of other materials we are less familiar with.

The {{goal of this}} study was to determine the best formulation which will regenerate per-fectly, after water dilution of dry emulsions, the initial <b>liquid</b> <b>emulsion</b> with the same characteristics that before drying. The morphological state of SAC and dry emulsions were determined by scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM) analysis. Glass transition temperature, and melting (endo-thermic), decomposition (endothermic), oxidation (exo-thermic) peak temperatures and enthalpies were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The antioxidant activity of emulsions was evaluated through their ability to reduce 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazil (DPPH) free radical. SEM analysis showed that SD-prepared, SC-containing dry emulsions formed better spherical particles with smooth surface at about 5 lm diameter as compared to emulsion containing HPMC. These former emulsions also showed more thermal stability by DSC. The combined results of the three analytical techniques emphasized the importance of the dry emulsion process regarding the efficiency and the ther-mal stability of antioxidant substances. A specific physical and/or chemical combination (such as hydrogen bond) suf-ficiently stable, at about 150 C, could be suggested when the technique used for dry emulsion preparation was SD.

Iron sulfate and ascorbic acid were added to accelerate oxidation. The effect of variation in the system composition on oxidative behavior was investigated. Oxidation was influenced by the relative concentration of oil and emulsifier and their partition between different phases. When an excess of surfactant was present in the water phase, protection from oxidation was observed. Tween- 20 competed with linoleic acid for catalysts and oxygen, and also, when in sufficient amount, provided a more compact coating of the interface. This prevented the contact between catalysts and oil. In the presence of sucrose, the increase in viscosity was expected to reduce oxidation. Although some protection was noticed, it did not correlated with the increase in sugar concentration. A protective action of sucrose other than viscosity, such as scavenging radicals and hydroperoxydes and/or quenching metals, was probably prevalent in this case. ^ In the freeze-dried emulsions, maltodextrin and sucrose were added in equal amounts to provide a matrix.
