Several types of optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> which were proposed and demonstrated are briefly described including their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a novel multiple-pass cavity optical <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> (MPC-ODL) is proposed and analyzed. The proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> consists of four mirrors, one lens and one resonant scanner. In this proposed <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> the path <b>delay</b> is obtained by scanning a tilting mirror and magnified by the multiple-pass optical cavity. Thus, for a small scanning angle, a large path delay can be obtained. This <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is especially suitable for the OCT system that will generate the large dimension images at video rate with high resolution.

40|$|Abstract — Optical queues, usually {{constructed}} by optical Switches and fiber <b>Delay</b> <b>Lines</b> (SDL), {{are the key}} elements for conflict resolution in optical packet switching. It is recently shown in [3] that several optical queues {{constructed by}} SDL elements are indeed infinite dimensional switches in time {{and they can be}} constructed by many classical constructions in the switching theory. In particular, a (unicast) flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> in [3] is a discrete-time infinite-server queue that corresponds to the nonblocking switch in the switching theory, and it can be constructed either by the three-stage Clos network or the Cantor network. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> that use the unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> as the basic construction elements. The first one is constructed by using parallel unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> It is shown that a multicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d can be constructed by using O (√ d) unicast flexible <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with maximum <b>delay</b> d.
