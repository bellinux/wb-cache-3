60|$|On the twenty-third of August, Committee of Public Salvation, {{as usual}} through Barrere, had promulgated, in words not unworthy of remembering, their Report, which is soon {{made into a}} Law, of <b>Levy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Mass.</b> 'All France, and {{whatsoever}} it contains of men or resources, is put under requisition,' says Barrere; really in Tyrtaean words, the best we know of his. 'The Republic is one vast besieged city.' Two hundred and fifty Forges shall, in these days, be {{set up in the}} Luxembourg Garden, and round the outer wall of the Tuileries; to make gun-barrels; in sight of Earth and Heaven! From all hamlets, towards their Departmental Town; from all their Departmental Towns, towards the appointed Camp and seat of war, the Sons of Freedom shall march; their banner is to bear: 'Le Peuple Francais debout contres les Tyrans, The French People risen against Tyrants.' 'The young men shall go to the battle; it is their task to conquer: the married men shall forge arms, transport baggage and artillery; provide subsistence: the women shall work at soldiers' clothes, make tents; serve in the hospitals. The children shall scrape old-linen into surgeon's-lint: the aged men shall have themselves carried into public places; and there, by their words, excite the courage of the young; preach hatred to Kings and unity to the Republic.' (Debats, Seance du 23 Aout 1793.) Tyrtaean words, which tingle through all French hearts.|$|E

40|$|The Roman dictators regularily (invested {{with power}} by the Roman state in the 5 th – 3 rd bce с. in the {{situations}} of serious military treats to the Republic) had to accomplish three legally regulated public acts. They closed the courts, declare, if necessary, a <b>levy</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> (if the warriors already called up for military service by ordinary magistrates were not numerous enough for starting a campaign), and personally supervised recruitment and training of the troops. Their orders {{were published in the}} form of an edictum which, most probably, contained all these regulations. Regardless of the purpose of its declaration, the dictatorship transferred the civil life of the city in the state of militiae. The newly formed army swore fidelity (called sacramentum) to the commander and – from the time of the Second Punic war – made a formal declaration of loyalty, ius iurandum. Contrary to a widespread scholarly opinion the author argues that it is the applicable legal rules, rather then the sphere of their applicability that distinguishes the imperium of an ordinary magistrate from this of an extraordinary one. Therefore, talking (not quite correctly) about “military imperium” of an extraordinary magistrate, the historians of Roman law are in reality dealing with an application of his imperium in military sphere...|$|E
