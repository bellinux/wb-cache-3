50|$|Besides {{outright}} habitat destruction, {{the plant}} is affected by several processes of habitat degradation. Introduced weeds have invaded the habitat, including brome grasses (Bromus spp.), wild oats (Avena spp.), and ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne).</b> Off-road vehicles are used on some land that contains the plant, and trash dumping {{has been known to}} occur. The maintenance of rural roads that lead to utility outposts may affect the land. Many occurrences are near the international border, and Border Patrol activities affect the habitat there.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Bromus ramosus, Dactylis glomerata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca gigantea, Festuca pratensis, <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> Melica uniflora, Milium effusum, Poa humilis and Poa pratensis. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} long, narrow, white corridor, {{descending}} from close to the leaf tip to the leaf base or even the stem. The frass is deposited in an inconspicuous grey line. They are lemon yellow. Larvae can be found from late autumn to May.|$|E
50|$|Perennial {{ryegrass}} staggers is poisoning by peramine, lolitrem B, {{and other}} toxins that {{are contained in}} perennial ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne),</b> and produced by the endophyte fungus Neotyphodium lolii which can be present {{in all parts of}} the grass plant, but tends to be concentrated in the lower part of the leaf sheaths, the flower stalks and seeds. This condition can affect horses, cattle, sheep, farmed deer and llamas. It regularly occurs in New Zealand and is known spasmodically from Australia, North and South America, and Europe.|$|E

The meadow is also rich in various herbs including typical hayfield species pepper saxifrage (Silaum silaus), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), black knapweed (Centaurea nigra), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum), common meadowrue (Thalictrum flavum), and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). Other meadow flowers include for common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), cowslip (Primula veris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), and ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare).|$|E

The maritime grassland around St Helen's Porth, and on the south coast, has abundant thrift (Armeria maritima) and sea campion (Silene maritime), and near Clodgie Point orange bird’s-foot occurs. The dune grassland area behind East and West Porth {{is important for the}} very rare dwarf pansy (Viola kitaibeliana). The summit of Great Hill has a small area of lowland heath.|$|E
50|$|The annual {{bluegrass}} weevil, scientific name Listronotus maculicollis, is a turfgrass insect pest which feeds mainly on {{annual bluegrass}} (Poa annua). They prefer {{to feed on}} very low mown grass, and are thus found mostly on golf courses or grass tennis courts. ABWs, as they are often referred to, were only found in the Northeastern United States until the 2000s when sightings began to expand. In recent years they have been found {{as far north as}} Ontario and Quebec, as far west as Ohio, and as far south as North Carolina. Their choice of hosts has also expanded, and they have been reported feeding on perennial ryegrass (<b>lolium</b> <b>perenne)</b> and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera).|$|E
50|$|Lolium {{contains}} some species which are important grasses for lawns, and as pasture and for grazing and hay for livestock, being a highly nutritious stock feed. Ryegrasses {{are also used}} in soil erosion control programs. It is the principal grazing grass in New Zealand where some 10 million kilograms of certified seed are produced every year. There is a large range of cultivars. The primary species found worldwide and used for both lawns and as a forage crop is perennial ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne).</b> Like many cool-season grasses of the Poaceae, it harbors a symbiotic fungal endophyte, either Epichloë or its close relative Neotyphodium, {{both of which are}} members of the fungal family Clavicipitaceae.|$|E
5000|$|M. nivale can infect all cool-season {{turf grass}} species. [...] Annual {{bluegrass}} (Poa annua), perennial ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne)</b> and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) are more susceptible. In the fall, M.nivale infection begins as small, orange to red-brown spots, circular {{and only a}} few centimeters in diameter. During the winter and into the spring seasons, well-defined, clustered, circular patches 10-20 cm in diameter, of necrotic leaf tissues form on mown turf. Microdochium nivale is mostly seen on grasses mown at heights of three inches or greater. On taller grass, patches often lack a circular pattern that is seen in shorter mown grass, On taller grass patches often lack a circular pattern that is seen in shorter mown grass. Pink snow mold patches usually follow drainage patterns since conidia spores are readily dislodged and transported by rainfall and water flowage. [...] Under prolonged cool and wet conditions, white-pink mycelium can be observed along the circumference of diseased patches.|$|E
