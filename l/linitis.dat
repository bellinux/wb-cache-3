5000|$|Gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{a malignant}} epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are overwhelmingly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, {{there are two}} major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma ("back to back" [...] aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, <b>linitis</b> plastica or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically [...] "empty" [...] spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumour cell, it pushes the nucleus to the periphery: [...] "signet-ring cell".|$|E
40|$|Primary gastric {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common cause of <b>linitis</b> plastica. Less frequently, metastatic gastric cancer from the breast, omental metastases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the stomach have been reported to show similar radiographic findings as for <b>linitis</b> plastica. A metastatic gastric cancer from bladder cancer is extremely rare. We present an unusual case, the first to our knowledge, of gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica that resulted from a metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder...|$|E
40|$|Gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica is a diffuse type {{of cancer}} which is characterised by a {{thickening}} and rigidity {{of the stomach}} wall. It is notorious for its failure to cause early symptoms, and patients with symptoms generally have a more advanced form of the disease. We report our 18 -month-long experience of managing gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica at Barnsley District General Hospital, UK. In our series of 8 patients, only one patient was offered surgery; the rest were offered palliative or supportive treatment.

40|$|Aim: We {{report a}} rare case of gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica {{revealed}} by vertebral metastases without an-other digestive dissemination. Case presentation: The Benin native woman was hospitalized in rheumatology for inflammatory back pain without another signs. Rx ray showed vertebra metas-tasis. In the etiologic research, gastroscopy showed an infiltrating lesion of the antral area, indi-cating gastric <b>linitis</b> which {{was confirmed by}} biopsy. Short and medium-term evolution was fa-vourable, characterized by a complete disappearance of the pains and a good physical condition. Conclusion: Vertebral metastases can reveal digestive cancer, although human gut is not among the most bone metastatic cancers...|$|E
30|$|GI {{metastasis}} {{is typically}} found when patients complain of {{symptoms such as}} GI obstruction. At this stage, GI tract metastasis of ILC reportedly shows macroscopic findings of <b>linitis</b> plastic in some cases, rather than forming a large, localized, and elevated lesion [16 – 20].|$|E
30|$|Stratification of the bowel wall {{may also}} be caused by {{infiltration}} of the submucosa by tumour or fat. The rare infiltrating scirrhous carcinomas (<b>linitis</b> plastica) of the stomach or rectosigmoid may present with symmetric wall thickening, regular contours and stratification of the bowel wall [4, 11]. Narrowing of the intestinal lumen, regional adenopathy and distant metastasis point to the correct diagnosis [11].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Linitis</b> plastica is a {{gastric cancer}} of diffuse histotype that {{presents}} in the fundic gland area, and is char-acterized by thickening {{of the stomach}} wall and deformation of the stomach, resulting in a leather bottle-like appearance. A 66 -year-old female was admitted to Kagawa University Hospital (Kagawa, Japan) with epigastric pain. X-ray examination revealed reduced gastric distension and defor-mation of the stomach, which exhibited a leather bottle-like appearance. Endoscopy indicated a depressed lesion in the gastric antrum, and abnormal folds, which crossed to form a waffle‑like appearance in the upper gastric body. Analysis of biopsy specimens from the depressed lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Morphological changes in the gastric folds indicated that the tumor had invaded the upper gastric body, therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed. Subsequent pathological findings demonstrated that the tumor had spread from the primary lesion to the upper gastric body. Therefore, the present report recommends that the diagnosis of the spread of <b>linitis</b> plastica-type gastric cancer should include assessments of the primary lesion, as well as evaluation of morphological changes in the gastric folds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Metastases to the {{gastrointestinal}} tract rarely occur {{in breast cancer}} except in invasive lobular carcinoma. The present study reports a rare case of metastatic gastric cancer from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast mimicking primary gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica. A 51 -year-old premenopausal female, who {{had a history of}} partial mastectomy for right breast cancer at the age of 40, was referred to Toyama City Hospital (Toyoma, Japan) for an endoscopic diagnosis of gastric <b>linitis</b> plastica. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis, while peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites were not detected. Chest CT detected a left lung tumor, which had invaded the left upper bronchus. Biopsy specimens were obtained and the histopathological findings on both the gastric tumor and lung tumor demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, whereas the histology of the original breast cancer was IDC with a solid-tubular type. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the biopsied specimens of the gastric and lung tumors were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for human epithelial growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2). These molecular characteristics indicated the case was metastatic gastric carcinoma from the breast cancer with lung metastasis, since the statuses of ER, PgR and HER 2 were concordant with those of the original breast cancer. However, the possibility of primary gastric cancer could not be completely ruled out. Therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed for the purpose of both diagnosis and treatment. Pathological examination of the resected specimen provided a definite diagnosis of multiple metastatic gastric carcinomas from the breast. To the best of our knowledge, metastatic gastric cancer derived from the breast presenting as <b>linitis</b> plastica 11 years following the surgical removal of IDC has not been described previously...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dissemination {{of cancer}} {{cells in the}} {{abdominal}} cavity may lead to peritoneal carcinomatosis, a common event in the <b>linitis</b> plastica type of gastric carcinoma. Reverse trans-criptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive technique for detecting these cells. Methods: Peritoneal washings were obtained during laparotomy from 47 consecutive <b>linitis</b> plastica patients who preoperatively were considered candidates for curative resection. Together with conventional cytological examination using Papanicolaou staining, real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantitate prospectively carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA in these washings. Samples above a cutoff value for CEA mRNA were considered positive for molecular detection of disseminated cancer cells. Results: Conventional cytological examination was positive in 43 % (20 / 47). Positivity of CEA mRNA was much higher at 83 % (39 / 47) and peritoneal carcinomatosis actually was observed in 77 % (36 / 47), either at laparotomy or during postoperative follow-up. Although only two of eight patients who were negative for CEA mRNA suffered from peritoneal carcinomatosis, three more patients died of recurrences through other metastatic pathways. Multivariate analysis revealed that curability of the operation (knowledge of the CEA mRNA values excluded) and Tcategorie...|$|E
40|$|A case {{of primary}} <b>linitis</b> plastica {{of the colon}} is presented. This case is of {{interest}} for three reasons: the site of origin in the right colon (80 % of cases reported develop distally to the splenic flexure), a biopsy previously taken from the mucosa demonstrated {{the presence of a}} signet ring cell carcinoma (endoscopic biopsies do not provide a conclusive diagnosis in the majority of cases reported) and hyaline with sparse amyloid nodules were detected in the extensive, dense fibrous tissue intermingled with tumour cells...|$|E
40|$|The metastatic {{sites of}} infiltrating duct (IDC) and infiltrating lobular {{carcinoma}} (ILC) have been compared using both clinical and autopsy data.

Carcinomatous meningitis was associated almost exclusively with ILC. Peritoneal/retroperitoneal metastases of distinctive pattern occurred in ILC. There was often associated <b>linitis</b> plastica-like involvement of the stomach wall and diffuse infiltration of the uterus. Hydronephrosis was a common secondary phenomenon...|$|E

30|$|Signet ring {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} type of rectal carcinoma, {{similar to}} the mucinous type in having a mucinous component, but with more aggressive behaviour {{in the form of}} a more advanced stage of initial diagnosis, more lymphatic and local spread and poor response to surgery. The most common imaging features are long segment of concentric wall thickening and a target appearance similar to those of metastatic <b>linitis</b> plastica consisting of thickened inner (mucosa and submucosa) and outer (serosa) layers and a relatively thin hypoattenuated middle layer (muscularis propria), or bowel wall thickening with homogeneous attenuation [28 – 30].|$|E
40|$|A {{post mortem}} {{examination}} of a 70 year old man, who died {{three years after}} a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of prostate had been diagnosed, showed widespread signet-ring cell carcinoma, with an associated <b>linitis</b> plastica. The signet-ring cells stained positively with prostatic specific antigen and with prostatic specific acid phosphatase, but failed to react with mucopolysaccharide staining. The electron microscopic appearance of the signet-ring cell tumour {{was due to the}} presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles. This case emphasises the possibility that cases of metastatic signet-ring cell carcinoma may be prostatic in origin. This can be confirmed by specific immunohistochemical studies...|$|E
40|$|Metastatic {{breast cancer}} {{involving}} the hepatobiliary tract or ascites secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis {{has been well}} described.

40|$|<b>Linitis</b> plastica, as a diffuse sclerosing carcinoma, is a slowly progressive, {{malignant}} disease (Ewing, 1940). The usual primitive site is the stomach, as the term 'linitis ' indicates, but {{varying degrees of}} spread along the alimentary tract are encountered (Anderson, 1966). Invasion of the small and large intestine is rare {{and can lead to}} confusion with chronic colitis, non-specific enteritis, and especially with Crohn's disease. About 11 cases of intestinal involvement have been reported (Dixon and Stevens, 1936; Lumb, 1949; Wolf and Marshak, 1963; Fernet, Azar, and Stout, 1965).

40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal {{metastasis}} of lobular {{carcinoma of}} the breast is a diagnostic challenge. It may macroscopically simulate primary colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. In some cases, the interval between the primary breast cancer and metastatic colorectal lesions is so long that the critical records for diagnosis including history might be lost or missed. Case presentation Reported herein {{is a case of}} metastatic lobular {{carcinoma of the}} breast masquerading as a primary rectal cancer developed in a 62 -year-old Japanese woman. The case initially presented as a circumferential rectal lesion, and information on the patient’s history of breast cancer was not noted. As the result of endoscopic biopsy, diagnosis of poorly differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma was made. The lesion was surgically resected after chemo-radiotherapy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain revealed a single-file arrangement of the tumor cells, reminiscent of lobular carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an immunophenotype consistent with lobular carcinoma of the breast. Because further review of the patient’s history revealed an occurrence of ‘poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the breast’, which she had experienced 24 years earlier, the final diagnosis of the lesion was made as rectal metastasis from lobular breast carcinoma. Conclusions Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colorectum is rarer than that of the stomach. <b>Linitis</b> plastica-type cancer of the colorectum is also rarer than that of the stomach. A lesson from the present case is that before we conclude a <b>linitis</b> plastica-type cancer of poorly differentiated type as a primary colorectal cancer, it is critical to exclude a possibility of metastatic colorectal cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|A 68 -year-old Japanese {{man with}} a history of <b>linitis</b> plastica {{carcinoma}} of the stomach and subsequent gastrectomy 8 years previously presented with lower abdominal pain. Radiological and endoscopic examinations showed multiple submucosal nodular lesions similar to Crohn's disease in the ileocecal area. A firm diagnosis could not be made after initial multiple biopsies. Finally, a submucosal biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. The ileocecal lesion was diagnosed as a recurrence because of the histological findings, which included mucosal preservation, a similarity with the histologic type of stomach carcinoma, and atypical immunoreactivity for primary colon carcinoma; the lesion was negative for both cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20. In cases where metastatic carcinoma of the colon is suspected, we recommend early consideration of a submucosal biopsy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most {{gallbladder}} carcinomas are adenocarcinomas, {{of which}} mucinous carcinoma (MC) {{is a rare}} pathologic subtype. Signet ring cells are seldom found in MCs. We report an extremely rare case of gallbladder MC with signet ring cells. This is the first radiological case report about this rare type of histologic entity with detailed discussion of imaging findings in the English literature. In addition to the features of MC, <b>linitis</b> plastica-like invasion, which is the key feature of signet ring cells, was confirmed by both imaging and histopathologic analysis. Furthermore, radiologists should know how the imaging findings of MC {{differ from those of}} other major subtypes of adenocarcinoma, as there is a risk of delays in diagnosis and underestimation of tumor spread...|$|E
40|$|Definition. <b>Linitis</b> plastica {{is a term}} {{designating}} clinically a skiagraphic and, in the post-mortem room, a gross {{contraction of}} the stomach, caused most frequently by a fibrosing cancer, occasionally by syphilis, and, possibly, in rare cases, by a simple inflammatory process. The fibrosis involves chiefly the submucosa and {{to a less extent}} the other layers, sometimes extending to the connective tissue in the region bordering on the stomach. Synonyms. There are no fewer than forty-two names for this condition. Arranged in chronological order they a r e: hypertrophy of the mucous membrane (Andral 1829 (1)); hypertrophy with induration and hyper-trophic stenosis of the pylorus (Cruveilhier 1835 (24)); hypertrophy of the stomach (Hare 1853 (57)); fibroid induration (Jones 1855 (73)); sclerosis ventriculi (Snellen 1856 - 7 (124)); cirrhosis of stomach (Brinton 1857) ...|$|E
40|$|In a multicentric trial the {{postoperative}} {{mortality and}} the 5 -year survival of elective total gastrectomy (TG) was compared with subtotal gastrectomy (SG) for adenocarcinoma of the antrum operated on with intent of cure. Two hundred and one patients {{were included in}} the study; 32 were excluded after pathologic examination (<b>linitis</b> plastica, superficial cancer, lymphoma). One hundred sixty-nine patients remained for analysis, with 93 undergoing TG and 76 undergoing SG. Elective TG did not increase postoperative mortality (1. 3 %) compared with SG (3. 2 %). There was no difference in the 5 -year survival rate (48 %). Analysis of survival showed no difference in the two techniques when related to nodal involvement and serosal extension. It is concluded that both TG and SG can be performed safely in patients with adenocarcinoma of the antrum; however TG did not increase the survival rate...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} or and ldquo;linitis plastica and rdquo; {{is characterized}} by a thickened and rigid stomach wall due to the diffuse infiltration of signet ring cells into the lower parts of the mucosa and submucosa of the stomach. This type of cancer is known to commonly metastasize to the liver, lungs, and ovaries, and metastasis to the gallbladder is extremely rare. We now report a case of a 79 -year-old Caucasian female with diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma that metastasized to the gallbladder. The patient presented with symptoms mimicking acute cholecystitis. Histological analysis of the cholecystectomy specimen showed signet ring cells in the submucosa of the gallbladder wall.
