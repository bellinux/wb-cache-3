The work presents what View of the World might look <b>like</b> <b>if</b> one had relied upon the September 2012 version of Apple Maps to locate various landmarks.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look <b>like</b> <b>if</b> he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines what it would be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

25|$|Stephen King {{met with}} Goodwin {{while he was}} writing his novel 11/22/63, due to her being an {{assistant}} to Johnson, and King used some of her ideas in the novel on what a worst-case scenario would be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> history had changed.|$|E

25|$|For a {{settlement}} of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists' ideas how a new and modern city should look <b>like.</b> <b>If</b> it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader's feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.|$|E
25|$|In 1895 Wells was an {{established}} writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving {{with her to}} the town of Woking in Surrey. Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on what it might be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of these}} {{missions}} {{is not only}} to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, {{it would be possible to}} determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look <b>like</b> <b>if</b> viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, around half of {{the protein}} {{products}} of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway though {{it should be noted}} that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just <b>like</b> <b>if</b> you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.|$|E
25|$|In essence, Kant’s {{remarks in}} the preface prepare the reader for {{the thrust of the}} ideas he goes on to develop in the Groundwork. The purpose of the Groundwork is to prepare a {{foundation}} for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from a priori reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the Groundwork attempts to establish a pure (a priori) ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the Groundwork is to explain what the moral law would have to be <b>like</b> <b>if</b> it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.|$|E
