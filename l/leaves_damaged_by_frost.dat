50|$|This eremophila is a hardy shrub, {{suitable}} as a filler between others. It can be propagated by cuttings or by grafting {{and the latter}} method would prevent the plant's suckering habit. It will grow in most soils, including heavy clay and is only temporarily <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|R
50|$|This eremophila {{is new to}} {{horticulture}} and its {{requirements in}} the garden are not well known. It can be propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and mature plants require a well-drained soil in a sunny position.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Three {{hundred fifty}} {{families}} from 11 breeding zones in southwest Oregon were grown {{in a common}} garden in Corvallis, Oregon, and patterns of genetic variation for seed weight and six first-year seedling characteristics were described. For most characteristics, large differences among breeding zones were found along an east-west transect, with small differences associated with changes in latitude. Consistent trends with elevation were apparent only for date of budset, the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> and seed weight. Most patterns of variation for seedling characteristics appear {{to be associated with}} climatic variables of the source locations, particularly annual precipitation. Total height, epicotyl length, number of branches, date of budset (weeks after July 1), and the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> increased with an increase in moisture, i. e. were greatest in breeding zones near the coast and at higher latitudes. Seed weight and the frequency of second flushing decreased with increasing moisture availability; i. e., parent trees from dry, particularly low elevation, inland areas produced heavier seed and seedlings which second flushed more frequently. Date of budset and the proportion of seedlings <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> appear to be influenced by winter temperatures, as they were found to decrease with increasing elevation. The proportion of variation among the 350 families due to differences among families within zones was high for all seedling traits (mean 41. 1 percent) and generally of similar magnitude to variation observed among breeding units (mean 43. 8 percent). Variation among breeding zones (elevations) within breeding units was high only for date of budset (29. 1 percent) and frost damage (33. 0 percent) (mean 10. 8 percent for seedling traits) ...|$|R
50|$|It has 2-3 basal, narrow, ensiform (sword shaped), {{glaucous}} and evergreen leaves. They {{can grow}} up to 70 cm long, and between 2.5 - 4.8 cm wide. They are narrower than Iris mesopotamica lreaves. They are finely and irregularly ribbed. The leaves, soon die after flowering, then compared to Iris junonia, the leaves re-grow in autumn. They are larger enough, that during winter they can be <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frosts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although this shrub is drought resistant, if {{supplied}} with adequate water {{will produce a}} massed display of reddish-orange flowers. It attracts nectar-feeding birds and its red, four-winged fruit are an added attraction. It can be propagated from cuttings and the shrub grows well {{in a range of}} soil types in full sun or partial shade. It only needs an occasional watering during a long drought and usually is only slightly <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{variegated}} grasshopper Zonocerus variegatus is a polyphagous insect, feeding on numerous food and cash crops. The present study aimed {{to investigate the}} sexual variations in the destructive capability of the adult insects and the composition of <b>leaves</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> them, {{as well as in}} the levels of midgut microbial flora and digestive enzymes (cellulase, amylase and α-glucosidase). The results showed that females consumed and caused more <b>damage</b> to cassava <b>leaves</b> than their male congeners. The <b>leaves</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> males contained more nutrients than those <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> females. The gut microbial flora and enzyme assay showed that females had significantly larger colony forming units and a non-significant difference in enzyme activities. It can thus be concluded that adult females are more destructive than males...|$|R
50|$|D. macropodum, {{like other}} {{species in the}} genus, can be grown as an {{ornamental}} evergreen shrub or small tree, when its main attractions are its large leaves and pink-flushed new growth. A sheltered situation in moist but well-drained soil is recommended. The newly emerged shoots are easily <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost.</b> Although growing to become a small tree in its natural habitat, in gardens it is more often found as a well-branched shrub. Propagation is by heel cuttings or fresh seed.|$|R

50|$|Many {{deciduous}} plants flower {{during the}} period when they are leafless, as this increases the effectiveness of pollination. The absence of leaves improves wind transmission of pollen for wind-pollinated plants and increases the visibility of the flowers to insects in insect-pollinated plants. This strategy is not without risks, as the flowers can be <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost</b> or, in dry season regions, result in water stress on the plant. Nevertheless, there is much less branch and trunk breakage from glaze ice storms when leafless, and plants can reduce water loss due to the reduction in availability of liquid water during cold winter days.|$|R
50|$|Like most succulents, {{they require}} {{extremely}} well-drained soil, and are <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> repeated <b>frosts.</b> Their preferred mode of cultivation {{is a bright}} and sunny position with gritty free-draining soil.

The bulbs themselves are very hardy, but the shoots appear {{early in the season}} and may be <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost.</b> Plants can be raised from seed, and often flower in their second year. The main pest is the Scarlet Lily Beetle, the larvae of which may cause complete defoliation. Stems may require staking to support the large blooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{tree was}} {{introduced}} to the British Isles in 1849. Material with provenance from different places in its natural environment was tested in cultivation in Scotland. Trees cultivated from material collected from Ñuble, which is the provenance closest to the Equator, were the most <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frosts.</b> Unfortunately seeds of that provenance were supplied to many commercial growers in the 1970s in the United Kingdom. Seeds sourced from Neuquen in Argentina proved the hardiest. A selection from Malleco, Chile, which is the provenance of the first trees planted in the British Isles also gave good hardiness results. It has also been planted on the North Pacific Coast of the United States.|$|R

40|$|Components {{of search}} effort were {{determined}} for adult females of Orius tristicolor (White) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) on bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., leaves with either western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) or twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) as prey. In {{the absence of}} prey, females of O. tristicolor allocated significantly more search time to <b>leaves</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> western flower thrips than to <b>leaves</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> twospotted spider mites, artificially <b>damaged</b> <b>leaves</b> or undamaged leaves. In the presence of prey, search time increased with increasing amounts of leaf damage for both prey species, but was not affected by prey species. Amounts of leaf damage or type of prey did not affect giving-up-time. The proportion of predators that successfully located thrips increased with increasing amounts of thrips <b>damage</b> on <b>leaves.</b> Females of O. tristicolor appeared to follow some simple, behavioural rules-of-thumb for allocation of search effort.

50|$|The {{tree was}} first {{introduced}} to the West in the 1920s, {{with the arrival of}} a specimen at the Arnold Arboretum from Chamba, a hill station overlooking the north Indian plain. The tree soon proved eminently unsuited to the cold Boston winters and died, but not before a five-budded cutting could be sent to S. G. A. Doorenbos, Parks Director at The Hague, in 1929. Doorenbos was able to graft four of the buds, and the following year had a row of strongly growing plants. The trees were again badly <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>frost,</b> but in 1938 were used as a source of anti-fungal genes in the Dutch elm breeding programme and crossed with the English winter-hardy cultivar 'Exoniensis'.|$|R
