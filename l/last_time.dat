40|$|In {{order to}} {{research}} the influence of homogeneity on the rockburst tendency and on AE characteristics of coal-rock combination body, uniaxial compressive tests of inhomogeneous coal-rock combination bodies obeyed by the Weibull distribution were simulated using particle flow code (PFC 2 D). Macromechanical properties, energy evolution law, and AE characteristics were analyzed. The results show that (1) the elastic modulus homogeneity mE has an exponential relation with macroscopic modulus E, and the bonding strength homogeneity mσ has an exponential relation with uniaxial compressive strength σc; (2) the rockburst tendency of the coal-rock combination body will increase {{with the increase of}} mE or mσ, and mσ is the leading factor influencing this tendency; and (3) both the change law of AE hits and <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> in different periods of AE characteristics are influenced by mσ, but mE just influences the <b>lasting</b> <b>time.</b> The more inhomogeneous the coal-rock combination body is, the shorter the <b>lasting</b> <b>time</b> in booming period of AE characteristics will be. This phenomenon can be used to predict the rockburst tendency of the coal-rock combination body...|$|R
