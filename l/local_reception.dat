[...] In 1930, Scribner's accepted two of her stories, [...] "Cracker Chidlings" [...] and [...] "Jacob's Ladder", both about the poor, backcountry Florida residents who were quite similar to her neighbors at Cross Creek. <b>Local</b> <b>reception</b> to her stories was mixed between puzzlement concerning whom she was writing about, and rage, since one mother apparently recognized her son as a subject in a story and threatened to whip Rawlings until she was dead.|$|E

50|$|Another {{common mistake}} in rating is {{presenting}} an 'O' higher than any previously rated element. By definition, a station cannot present 'perfect' reception {{if there is}} any Noise or Interference or Fading present.

5000|$|The President of Estonia organises {{a festive}} Independence Day {{reception}} at which state decorations are awarded to recipients whose names are published in advance. Both the parade and the reception {{is held in}} different years in different cities; in 2014 they were held in Pärnu, and in 2015 in Narva, with that year's parade featuring contingents from fellow NATO member nations. The parade, the reception and a concert that precedes the reception are broadcast live on television. This coverage includes a speech by the President. The reception line, where the President and his wife shake hands with attendees is ironically called the [...] "Penguin Parade". As the President's reception is always organized on 24 February, similar <b>local</b> <b>receptions</b> are often held earlier on 23 February. Schools and other institutions sometimes hold events even earlier. In recent years, it is customary that the Prime Minister must call in Vanemuine at the Tartu reception.|$|R

5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981. It used analog oscillators and filters alongside the existing electromechanical elements. The overall effect {{was that of a}} Rhodes piano and a synthesizer being played simultaneously. The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused interference with <b>local</b> television <b>reception.</b> Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|R

5000|$|... 2JJ {{commenced}} broadcasting at 11:00 am, Sunday 19 January 1975, at 1540 kHz (call sign 1539kHz in 1978) on the AM band. The new Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) {{station was}} given the official call-sign 2JJ, but soon became commonly known as Double J. [...] The station was restricted largely to the greater Sydney region, and its <b>local</b> <b>reception</b> was hampered by inadequate transmitter facilities. However, its frequency was a clear channel nationally, so it was easily heard at night throughout south-eastern Australia. After midnight the station would often use ABC networks - during their off air time slot - to increase its broadcasting range.|$|E

5000|$|MX-80 {{relocated}} to San Francisco in 1978, a tumultuous {{year when the}} city reverberated from the Dan White shootings and subsequent riots (reflected in the track [...] "White Night") and the Peoples Temple mass suicide (the band performed at the nearby Temple Beautiful soon after the tragedy, overlooking a parking lot filled with the victim’s cars.) MX-80 also performed at prominent punk venues such as the Mabuhay Gardens, Deaf Club, and Savoy Tivoli but the <b>local</b> <b>reception</b> was not enthusiastic and the band was considered {{out of sync with}} the punk and new-wave sensibility of groups such as Germs, Dils, and Avengers. Disheartened by the reaction, drummer Jeff Armour soon departed, reducing the band to a quartet.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, attire for the {{occasion}} is generally formal. Boys will usually dress {{in a suit and}} tie. Girls traditionally wear formal gowns or dresses. In most cases a school formal is held at a <b>local</b> <b>reception</b> centre or ballroom. A multicourse meal is generally provided. After the meal students generally dance to popular music played by a hired DJ or sometimes a band. Many students group together to go to the formal in a limousine. While parents do not attend a formal, teachers may act as chaperones for the formal and security guards are sometimes hired. The use of chaperones is intended to prevent the occurrence of violence and alcohol or drug use. Generally after a formal, one or more after-parties are held.|$|E
5000|$|Founded to {{celebrate}} the end of Apartheid and the reopening {{of the country to}} the world after decades of boycott, the Johannesburg Biennale, despite its short life (only two editions in 1995 and 1997), {{is one of the best}} examples of the fundamental tension into which biennials are caught: to settle into the local and to gain renown on an international level. If for curator Hans Ulrich Obrist the 1997 Johannesburg Biennale was as important as the Venice Biennial or documenta X held the same year, and was amongst the most influential exhibitions of the 1990s,15 the <b>local</b> <b>reception</b> of the event was in general radically different. Its absence of engagement with the South African communities and the conceptual and elitist character of the exhibited artworks were harshly criticized in the local press. The biennial was thus seen as a grafted event, serving political interests rather than social and cultural ones, and favoring an international art discourse over a local one. In the case of the Johannesburg Biennale this criticism was one of the pretexts of the Greater Johannesburg City Council to withdraw its support and shut down the event prematurely. Even though the reasons of its cancellation are still not fully elucidated, the Johannesburg Biennale remains nonetheless a mythical biennial because, after decades of isolation due to international boycott, it shed light on the South African art scene and helped many South Africans artists to access the international arena where they are occupying a significant place nowadays.16 ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the responses attempted by the Radical Civic Union {{of the province}} of Tucumán (northwestern region of Argentina) against peronism in the period covered by the presidencies of Juan Perón and the "Revolución Libertadora" (1946 - 1958). To that end it proposes two patterns of analysis. On the one hand, it explores the conflicts raised by the leading members around {{the definition of a}} strategy to confront Peronism. On the other hand, it considers the <b>local</b> leaders' <b>reception</b> process of the directives issued by the authorities. By reducing the scale of observation the paper seeks to contribute to the knowledge of the provincial variations of the radicalism in the referred period. The research is based on party documentation, written press, legislative debates and oral interviews...|$|R
50|$|On {{numerous}} occasions throughout the 1970s, KVSC sought approval {{to increase its}} broadcast power, with the final approval coming in November 1981. KVSC officially moved down the dial to 88.1 MHz at 6 a.m. on February 8, 1983, and increased power to 5,200 watts. KVSC was amended to a radio class C2 operation, and licensed to operate 20 hours per day. Unfortunately, broadcast at this new level caused interference with <b>local</b> television <b>reception.</b> Experimentation with antennae filters and transmitter dampers did little to alleviate the interference problems. In early April 1983, just over {{one month after the}} long-awaited increase, St. Cloud State University voluntarily elected to reduce KVSC's output power to 1,300 watts until a more permanent solution to this interference could be found.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{recurring}} {{themes in the}} discussion of globalisation is mobility. Money moves, products move, people move. Signs, symbols and representations also move. With new communications technologies, images can be flashed around the globe instantaneously, but with diverse forms of <b>local</b> <b>reception.</b> It could be argued that practices move, too. As people move, they take with them their learned ways of doing things: their work habits, their manners, their deportment, their gestures. In new places, they also learn new ways of doing things. When people move, bodies move. Mobility is an embodied experience...|$|E
40|$|A small {{satellite}} mission, COCONUDS is an EC-DGXII supported Concerted Action (CA) {{to explore}} the feasibility of developing a CO-ordinated COnstellation of User Defined Satellites to take European environment monitoring forward into the information society. It addresses the problem {{that a large number}} of local decision-makers are insufficiently informed about their local environment. It presents the hypothesis that the need for timely, reliable and appropriate information to improve local environmental decision making could be satisfied through a co-ordinated constellation of low-cost satellites matched to low-cost <b>local</b> PC <b>reception.</b> This paper briefly summarises the results achieved in the COCONUDS project in the two years since it started, and shows how the conclusion is reached that COCONUDS must be realised in one form or another, if the needs of a large group of potential disenfranchised users are ever going to be met. 1...|$|R
40|$|SynopsisThis paper {{begins to}} chart {{the history of the}} understudied topic of Indonesian {{activism}} for the so called ‘comfort women’ of the Japanese military from World War Two. It asks how and why activists in the specific historical context of New Order Indonesia, the cultural context of Indonesia, the global rise in human rights claims and a new openness to war redress in Japan were variously constrained and enabled in their advocacy. Drawing on recent research into the history of emotions and social movements the paper analyses how and why Indonesian activists appealed to certain emotions to gain support within Indonesia and Japan for compensation. A focus on emotions and the political and cultural contexts surrounding early Indonesian activism allows us to better understand the <b>local</b> framing, <b>reception</b> and outcomes of this global protest movement in Indonesia...|$|R

[...] With such income uncertainty in mind as he grew older, Lynch bought a flower shop in North Hollywood a [...] "few years" [...] before the noted interview.
