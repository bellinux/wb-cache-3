25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, federal {{agricultural}} engineers {{worked in the}} Arizona Territory on an experimental farm in Sacaton. It was here that Pima Indians cultivated various cotton hybrids seeking ideal traits. By the early 1900s, the botanist Thomas Henry Kearney (1874–1956) created a <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> cotton which was named Pima after the Indians who grew it. In 1910, it was released into the marketplace. While in 1987, Arizona was producing 66% of the country’s Pima cotton, it has dropped to only 2% in recent years.|$|E
25|$|In practice, Muhammad Ali's {{land reform}} {{amounted}} to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> cotton, a new cash crop. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the corvée, or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.|$|E
25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre with a <b>long</b> <b>staple</b> length {{in it is}} called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} for short draw spinning is combing, as combing requires the <b>long</b> <b>stapled</b> fibers preferred {{for the short}} draw technique, and it also leaves the fibers parallel, which is a characteristic of short draw spun yarns. The combed fiber can then be drafted to form a sliver or roving (if the fibers are twisted slightly after drafting, it is called a roving—if not, it is a sliver), or spun directly.|$|R
5000|$|Short draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from combed roving, sliver or wool top - anything with the fibers all lined up parallel to the yarn. It is generally spun from <b>long</b> <b>stapled</b> fibers. Short draw spun yarns are smooth, strong, sturdy yarns, and dense. [...] Short draw spun yarns also tend to not be very elastic. These characteristics make them good for use in weaving.|$|R

Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about [...] Long-staple cottons have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and hosiery. The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country. Apart from use in textiles {{in the form of}} cotton lint, yarn, thread, cloth, and garments, its seeds are used for oil extraction.|$|E

Other contributions were by Douglas Blazek, Roger Margolis, Jack Micheline, Steve Richmond, Jerome Rothenberg and Thomas F. Sexton. The cover of the first edition featured a manifesto by Bukowski that railed against Poetry Magazine and [...] "the dull dumpling pattycake safe Creeleys, Olsons, Dickeys, Merwins, Nemerovs and Merediths."

[...] However, in 1913 it started spinning mediums, 34s to 78s from American, Brazilian and Egyptian. By 1916 it had dropped Brazilian and did 40s to 90s, it then in 1917 purchased combing equipment and produced up to 120s then by 1929 it purchased Egyptian solely and ran 140s.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a {{natural language processing}} (NLP) system called LINK. LINK is unification-based, and incorporates and extends many features which have been emerging from other NLP research in recent years. In particular, the notions of autonomous syntax and compositional semantics <b>long</b> <b>staples</b> of NLP systems, {{have been replaced by}} a grammar which is much more complex, semantics-oriented, and more reliant on idiomatic constructions; and a semantics which is noncompositional. Processing, also, has been changed from the traditional syntax-driven approach, to an approach which relies much more heavily on semantics and domain knowledge, presented in a semantic net. As a result, LINK is able to efficiently process ungrammatical sentences, as well as nonliteral constructions such as methphor and metonymy. These tasks have been difficult for more traditional NLP systems...|$|R
