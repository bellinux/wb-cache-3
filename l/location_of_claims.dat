In the present volume are found {{the records of}} the earliest organizations in the state and the legislation of the early mining. districts. In June, 1859, the Rocky Mountain News reported 2 ̆ 2 The first mass meeting ever held in the Rocky Mountains. 2 ̆ 2 It was at the 2 ̆ 2 Gregory Diggings 2 ̆ 2, attended by 2 ̆ 2 between two and three thousand miners 2 ̆ 2, and was addressed by Horace Greeley. A report on what they found at Gregory Diggings was prepared by a committee of three distinguished visitors, consisting of Horace Greeley, A. D. Richardson, and Henry Villard. At the mass meeting then held the miners designated boundaries of the district, prescribed rules as to the size and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> and created a miners 2 ̆ 7 court. At later meetings these laws were amplified. In the volume is found the legislation of some nineteen mining districts, enacted at similar public meetings of the entire population. This legislation deals chiefly with the mining industry, but criminal codes are also included. The Hawk Eye District enacted that 2 ̆ 2 Any person found guilty of wilful murder shall be hanged by the neck till dead and then given to his friends if called for and if not to be decently buried, and all other crimes not enumerated in these laws shall be punished as the Court or jury of men may direct. 2 ̆...|$|E

Node a stores the <b>location</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> node L {{to act as}} {{a witness}} node; in addition, node a {{forwards}} the location claim to its neighbors within a one-hop distance, which then act as auxiliary witness nodes in the same way. In other words, the verification surface is centered in the witness node on or nearest to the xα-axis or the yα-axis and includes the neighbor nodes within a one-hop distance. Next, all of the nodes in the verification surface compare the <b>location</b> <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> node L with other stored location claims. If nodes appear that claim the same ID but have different geographic location, then the occurrence of a node replication attack would be determined; the witness node reports the ID of the clone nodes directly to the base station and the base station broadcasts a bulletin of the invalid ID within the network. Otherwise, node a propagates the location claim along both the horizontal xα-axis and the vertical yα-axis using a geographic routing protocol [28] and the TTL is decreased by 1. The neighbors nearest to the xα-axis or the yα-axis are selected to forward the packet until replicas are detected or the packet is discarded when the TTL equals to zero.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the problem <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>claim</b> {{verification}} <b>of</b> a mobile node in a wireless network. Existing verification methods rely primarily on cooperative approaches, which require {{the cooperation of}} several detecting nodes for the verification <b>of</b> a <b>location</b> <b>claim</b> from a target node. These methods all suffer from {{one or both of}} the drawbacks: 1) not able to cope with a sparse network situation and 2) the design being based on a particular measurement technique. To remedy the drawbacks, we propose a general location verification scheme. It employs a node-to-node approach for location verification and could use different measurement techniques; moreover, it supports location verification in sparse networks. The proposed verification scheme has been shown to be able to achieve satisfactory performance via extensive real-world Global-Positioning-System-based wireless sensor network experiments.

30|$|A {{good example}} is Teonimanu (see Figure  6), the modern <b>location</b> <b>of</b> which is <b>claimed</b> by local people to be marked by Lark Shoal [44, 54, 55].

In some reports, Teonimanu was a high (bedrock) island, so 12  m represents a minimum figure for subsidence. But more importantly, none of the myths about the disappearance of Teonimanu mention subsidence, only the impact of successive large waves which are claimed in one account to have run across the island until it was “totally submerged” ([41]: 203).|$|R

40|$|The Flagstaff {{quadrangle}} {{in northern}} Arizona {{lies at the}} southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Portions of the Black Mesa Basin and Mogollon Rim lie within the quadrangle. Mesozoic rocks cover 90 % of {{the surface of the}} Black Mesa Basin, but Paleozoic rocks dominate the Mogollon Rim. Cenozoic instrusive and extrusive rocks of the San Francisco Volcanic Field and the Hopi Buttes are superimposed on the older sedimentary sequence. Magnetic data apparently show contributions from both deep and shallow sources. The San Francisco Volcanic Field is relatively well defined, but deeper-lying structural boundaries are largely masked by the younger igneous rocks in the area. The Flagstaff quadrangle has been relatively unproductive in terms of uranium mining. Some claims are present in the Black Mesa Basin, primarily in Triassic rocks. A total of 195 groups of sample responses in the uranium window qualify as anomalies as defined in Volume I. These anomalies primarily form two distinct groups, though others are scattered throughout the quadrangle. One group is associated with igneous rocks in the northern Hopi Buttes area, and the other, a larger and more indistinct group, is primarily associated with the Shinarump Member of the Triassic Chinle Formation in the northern Painted Desert area.

40|$|<b>Location</b> {{information}} is <b>of</b> essential importance in sensor networks deployed for generating location-specific event reports. When such networks operate in hostile environments, it becomes imperative {{to guarantee the}} correctness <b>of</b> event <b>location</b> <b>claims.</b> In this paper we address the problem <b>of</b> assessing <b>location</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> un-trusted (potentially compromised) nodes. The mechanisms introduced here prevent a compromised node from generating illicit event reports for locations other than its own. This is important because by compromising “easy target ” sensors (say, sensors on {{the perimeter of the}} field that’s easier to access), the adversary should not be able to impact data flows associated with other (“premium target”) regions of the network. To achieve this goal, in a process we call location certification, data routed through the network is “tagged ” by participating nodes with “belief ” ratings, collaboratively assessing the probability that the claimed source location is indeed correct. The effectiveness of our solution relies on the joint knowledge of participating nodes to assess the truthfulness <b>of</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>locations.</b> By collaboratively generating and propagating a set of “belief ” ratings with transmitted data and event reports, the network allows authorized parties (e. g. final data sinks) to evaluate a metric of trust for the <b>claimed</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> such reports. Belief ratings are derived from a data model of observed past routing activity. The solution is shown to feature a strong ability to detect false location claims and compromised nodes. For example, incorrect claims as small as 2 hops (from the actual location) are detected with over 90 % accuracy. Finally, these new location certification mechanisms can be deployed in tandem with traditional secure localization, yet does not require it, and, in a sense, can serve to minimize the need thereof...|$|R
