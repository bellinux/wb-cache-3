25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> the Oregon Supreme Court's {{judgment}} against the two employees {{and returned the}} case to the Oregon courts {{to determine whether or not}} sacramental use of illegal drugs violated Oregon's state drug laws (485 U.S. 660 (1988)). On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court concluded that while Oregon drug law prohibited the consumption of illegal drugs for sacramental religious uses, this prohibition violated the free exercise clause. The state asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review this second decision of the Oregon Supreme Court, and it agreed to do so. In earlier rulings, the Court had decided that the government could not condition access to unemployment insurance or other benefits on an individual's willingness to give up conduct required by their religion. However, the Supreme Court did not find that this principle also applied when the conduct in question is justifiably prohibited by law.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Mexico was {{dominated}} by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Discontent with this one-party system became prominent in the northern states of Mexico, including Sonora. As early as 1967, a competing party, the National Action Party (PAN), won control of the city government of Sonora's capital, Hermosillo. PAN won important municipal victories {{in the state in}} 1983, which President de la Madrid refused to officially recognize but was forced to <b>let</b> <b>stand.</b> PAN's growing strength by the 1980s forced the PRI to nominate candidates who were similar to PAN, successful business executives who favored economic liberalization over traditional Mexican statism, preferred in the north of the country. Institutional Revolutionary Party won the Sonoran gubernatorial race in 1985, but it was heavily contested with obvious problems of fraud. By the 1990s, PRI operatives caught manipulating election results were actually prosecuted by the Sonoran state attorney. This along with other events in the country eventually led {{to the end of the}} one-party system when Vicente Fox was elected president in 2000. PAN has since dominated most of the north of the country, but Sonora did not have its first PAN governor until 2009, with the election of Guillermo Padrés Elías.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> the District Court's sevenfold {{test for}} when a {{clearance}} agreement was a restraint of trade, as he agreed {{they had a}} legitimate purpose. Pooling agreements and joint ownership, he agreed, were [...] "bald efforts to substitute monopoly for competition ... Clearer restraints of trade are difficult to imagine." [...] He allowed, however, that courts could consider how an interest in an exhibitor was acquired and sent some other issues back to the District Court for further inquiry and resolution. He set aside the lower court findings on franchises {{so that they might}} be reconsidered from the perspective of allowing competitive bidding. On the block booking question, he rejected the studios' argument that it was necessary to profit from their copyrights: [...] "The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration". The prohibitions on discrimination he <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> entirely.|$|E

2500|$|Citrus {{juices and}} other acidic drinks leach lead from crystal as {{effectively}} as alcoholic beverages. Under conditions of repeated use of the decanter, the lead leaching steeply decreases with increasing use. This finding is [...] "consistent with ceramic chemistry theory, which predicts that leaching of lead from crystal is self-limiting exponentially {{as a function of}} increasing distance from the crystal-liquid interface." [...] Lead leaching still occurs, but the quantity that leaches into a glass of wine or other beverage <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> for a few hours is much smaller than the quantity of lead consumed daily in ordinary diet.|$|E

2500|$|Still Eisenhower faced {{criticism}} in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was [...] "under the aegis of" [...] the president, not [...] "directed by." [...] Press reports were creating {{a belief in the}} public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not <b>let</b> <b>stand.</b> Knowing that he was jeopardizing the Paris Peace Summit, Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. President. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: [...] "They had better look at their own [...] record." [...] As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the Paris Peace Summit.|$|E
2500|$|New Rochelle was {{the scene}} of the first court-ordered school {{desegregation}} case in [...] "the north", when the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 denied certiorari and so <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that the Lincoln School boundaries had been intentionally drawn to create segregated elementary school districts. Lincoln School was closed and demolished in 1965, with students of that district allowed to attend certain other city elementary schools. The school system successfully restructured following the tumultuous desegregation case in 1961, and again 20 years later, in response to declining enrollment. Throughout, the standards for educational excellence were achieved. The school district is known for its diversity, and the high school honors civil rights leader Whitney Young in the name of its auditorium and civil rights martyr Michael Schwerner in the name of its library. In May 1968, New Rochelle High School was damaged by an arson fire. Displaced students were accommodated at local junior high schools under a time-sharing arrangement while the high school was being rebuilt.|$|E
2500|$|Exxon appealed again. On May 23, 2007, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied ExxonMobil's {{request for}} a third hearing and <b>let</b> <b>stand</b> its ruling that Exxon owes $2.5billion in punitive damages. Exxon then appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. On February 27, 2008, the Supreme Court heard oral {{arguments}} for 90 minutes. Justice Samuel Alito, who at the time, owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in Exxon stock, recused himself from the case. In a decision issued June 25, 2008, Justice David Souter issued {{the judgment of the}} court, vacating the $2.5billion award and remanding the case back to the lower court, finding that the damages were excessive with respect to maritime common law. Exxon's actions were deemed [...] "worse than negligent but less than malicious." [...] The punitive damages were further reduced to an amount of [...] $507.5million. The Court's ruling was that maritime punitive damages should not exceed the compensatory damages, supported by a peculiar precedent dating back from 1818. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy has decried the ruling as [...] "another in a line of cases where this Supreme Court has misconstrued congressional intent to benefit large corporations." ...|$|E
