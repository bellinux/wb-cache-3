50|$|In {{this song}} {{composer}} expresses {{the emotions of}} a lady giving reasons her beloved to visit her mother's place. 'Bedu', the passion fruit, {{is one of the}} very abundant fruit available throughout four seasons, however the 'Kafal' (wild red color berry) is available only in the month of Chaitra. In general, passion fruit has only a limited value be it eating or other usages among hilly people, hence not considered as a fruit at all. However 'Kafal' not only tastes good but also it happens to ripen around the month when natural beauty touches its extreme. This entire natural beauty instigates childhood memories and fun days within her heart and she expresses her interest of going to her mother's place. Also to add to the meaning composer included places like Almora and Nainital in the songs and the famous things therein. In one of the <b>lines</b> <b>composer</b> provides us with the powerful bond of love and explains that if beloved is hurt it is the self who realizes and feels the pain more than anyone else around.|$|R

2500|$|As a composer, Goss wrote {{little for}} the orchestra, but {{was known for}} his vocal music, both {{religious}} and secular. Among his best-known compositions are his hymn tunes [...] "Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven" [...] and [...] "See, Amid the Winter's Snow". The music critic of The Times described him as the last of the <b>line</b> of English <b>composers</b> who confined themselves almost entirely to ecclesiastical music.|$|R
50|$|Edelstein {{is seen as}} {{emerging}} from three sources; {{the tradition of the}} contemporary music of Argentina, in the <b>line</b> of <b>composers</b> who he very much appreciates, such as Juan Carlos Paz, Francisco Kröpfl, Carmelo Saitta, Gerardo Gandini, Mariano Etkin and many others; the popular musicians like Isaco Abitbol, Raúl Barboza, Remo Pignoni, Dino Saluzzi and Cuchi Leguizamón, to name but a few that he listened to whilst growing up; and equally to the colleagues and the composers of his generation that contributed to making the group Otras Musicas, including Pablo Di Liscia, Gustavo Mirabile and Daniel Montes. However, now like Arnold Schönberg, Edelstein says, he learns most from his students, and the ENS (Ensamble Nacional del Sur) is an example of this.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} {{distinction}} between composers and other musicians varies, which affects {{issues such as}} copyright and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music. In the development of European classical music, the function of composing music initially {{did not have much}} greater importance than that of performing it. The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. jazz, experimental music) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the <b>line</b> between <b>composer</b> and performer, sound designer, arranger, producer, and other roles, can be quite blurred.|$|R
2500|$|In the Dictionary of National Biography in 1890, J A Fuller Maitland wrote, [...] "The best of Goss's {{works are}} {{distinguished}} by much grace and sweetness, underlying {{which is a}} solid foundation of theoretic and contrapuntal science.

5000|$|His many {{teaching}} obligations notwithstanding, Philipp Scharwenka {{stood in}} the front <b>line</b> as a <b>composer</b> and was recognised as such during his lifetime. His compositions include three Symphonies, Symphonic Poems, a Violin concerto, some Choral works (of which Sakuntala became very famous), the 4-act opera Roland, as well as numerous instrumental works such as Sonatas, Quartets, Caprices and Dances. Many of the major conductors of the period, including Arthur Nikisch, Anton Seidl and Hans Richter, performed his orchestral works. He is still known for his chamber works, including two piano trios, two trios for violin, viola, and piano, two violin sonatas, one viola sonata, one cello sonata, two string quartets, and one piano quintet.|$|R

5000|$|The opera was {{commissioned}} {{jointly by the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and the Barbican Centre, and was completed by the composer in eight months. Barry himself adapted the libretto from the original play, cutting the text substantially. However, Wilde's plot is retained completely, {{as well as many}} of his most famous <b>lines.</b> The <b>composer</b> has commented: [...] "The text was far too long, and I had to cut around two-thirds of it, but the structure is so strong that I think people will hardly notice. I got rid of all the social niceties, which gives a different tone—the butler is not so polite as he was!" [...] In describing his technique, the composer has further said in respect of act 3: Everyone's on stage, terrible scandals have been revealed about Miss Prism and the baby, and Canon Chasuble comes in and says [...] "Everything is ready for the christening." [...] Everyone just responds with weird vocal slides, there's no text at all. He responds by saying, [...] "Your mood seems peculiarly secular" [...] and they do it all again, as if they're animals in a menagerie. I was very pleased with that, I thought [...] "I've matched Wilde in madness" ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{its being}} unfinished, this waltz is still {{considered}} playable. It is usually performed in a version (S.216b) combining the completed fast outer sections, omitting the incomplete slow middle section. Howard made a performing version of this Waltz in 1978 which utilizes a middle section assembled from Liszt's manuscript sources, completed in <b>line</b> with the <b>composer's</b> late style and with a minimum number of added notes from Howard. A recording of this completion is available on Hyperion's [...] "Complete Piano Music of Liszt" [...] series, while the sheet music, dedicated to Alfred Brendel, has been published by Basil Ramsey, and once again in 1988 by Orpheus Publications.

50|$|Traditional Tamasha format {{consisted}} of dancing-boys known as Nachya, who also played women's roles, a poet-composer known as Shahir, {{who played the}} traditional role of Sutradhar or a jester known as Songadya, who compered the show. However, with time, women started taking part in Tamasha. Marathi theatre made its beginning in 1843, and in the following years, Tamasha which was primarily constituted of singing and dancing expanded its thematic repertoire and added small dramatic and humorous skits, known as vag, to it. These were either in prose or comprised long narrative poems performed by the Shahir along with his chorus, with actors improvising their <b>lines.</b> Popular Vag <b>composers</b> of the time were Patthe Bapurao and Dattoba Sali, and one of their noted vag, Gadhavache Lagna (Marriage of Donkey) was popularized by Tamasha artist, Dadu Idurikar. Soon, noted Marathi writers started written Vags for Tamasha troupes.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 5 stars stating [...] "Despite {{the fact that}} pianist and {{composer}} Paul Bley had been a renowned and innovative jazzman for nearly 20 years, 1973 saw the release of his most mature and visionary work, and one that to this day remains his opus. This {{is one of the}} most influential solo piano recordings in jazz history, and certainly one that defined the sound of the German label ECM... Ultimately, what Bley offers is jazz pianism as a new kind of aural poetics, one that treats the extension of the <b>composer's</b> <b>line</b> much as the poet treats the line as the extension of breath. Sheer brilliance". [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz said [...] "There is, perhaps, inevitably a hint of deja-vu here and there, but the territory is always much too interesting for that to become a problem".|$|R

[...] Kleban is best known as lyricist of the Broadway hit A Chorus <b>Line.</b> He and <b>composer</b> Marvin Hamlisch won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Original Score, and he shared the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1976 with Hamlisch and three other contributors to the musical. The one-woman Phyllis Newman show, The Madwoman of Central Park West (1979), featured a few tunes with his lyrics. For several years he worked at Columbia Records, where he produced albums by performers as diverse as Igor Stravinsky and Percy Faith and the album for the Off-Broadway musical Now Is The Time For All Good Men. He was a teacher for many years at the BMI (Broadcast Music Incorporated) Musical Theater Workshop.|$|R
50|$|The Baroque {{period in}} music is {{associated}} with the development around 1600 of the figured bass and the basso continuo system. The use of figured bass was a dramatic change in the way composers thought of musical pieces. Unlike a typical Renaissance piece, which was based around interweaving, independent melody <b>lines,</b> a Baroque <b>composer</b> using figured bass thought of a piece as a chord progression. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, lute) and a bass instrument (e.g., violone). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the monodies of the Florentine Camerata and the development of early opera. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a basso seguente, a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).|$|R
5000|$|The {{revised version}} of Absolute Jest has been more {{consistently}} praised by critics. Tom Huizenga of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "From its ominous opening strains to its ramshackle final bars, Absolute Jest, scored for the unlikely combination of string quartet and orchestra, is a funhouse stocked with flashes of Beethoven. Jolts from the Ninth and Fourth Symphonies pop up suddenly, {{and there is a}} particular fixation with the late string quartets. These musical 'tattoos,' as Adams calls them, get stretched, squashed and piled high." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent similarly opined, [...] "The orchestra's ostinatos initially seem to hinder the string quartet's nimble interplay, {{but by the end of}} the opening section, the quartet seems suddenly freed, dancing gaily into the subsequent Presto. It's this lightness of spirit with which Adams evokes the scherzo, establishing an ebullient charm which continues through to the concluding 'Prestissimo'." [...] The music was also praised by Eric C. Simpson of the New York Classical Review, who observed, [...] "At any rate, intended or not, Absolute Jest should be devastatingly funny to any listener who is well versed in Beethoven's oeuvre." [...] Lisa MacKinney of Limelight said, [...] "It's hugely playful, in the literal sense of scherzo as joke/jest, but it is by no means lightweight, flippant or ironic. Rather, it's a vivacious, lively homage, a recent example in a long <b>line</b> of <b>composers</b> (including Brahms and Stravinsky, to name but two) looking back and 'sampling' the work of their forebears in order to create new and exciting compositions." [...] In contrast to his original criticism of the piece, Joshua Kosman more favorably wrote, [...] "The harmonies and textures draw on Adams' post-minimalist vein, while the thematic materials are Beethoven's — except that very often the two blur so beguilingly that it's hard to tell where one stops and the other begins. Credit certainly goes to Adams, though, for the piece's witty and startlingly inventive ending." ...|$|R
40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 69 : 70 in lengthThis program contains musical works spanning four centuries, offering {{a wide variety}} of styles. The recital opens with a recitative and da capo aria which occur during Act I of Handel???s opera seria, Guilio Cesare. At this point in the opera, Achillas has just brought Pompey???s head to Caesar, then Sextus vows to avenge his father???s death in the aria Svegliatevi nel core. This vengeance aria conveys a variety of moods or affects, where each section is devoted to one emotion, ranging from rage to fear, reverence, and back to rage. Most of Handel???s operas, with the exception of his popular Giulio Cesare, are no longer performed as standard repertoire. The texts for the next set of songs, by Haydn, are written by an English poet, Anne Hunter. The first piece, The Mermaids song, opens with a 21 bar ritornello centered around a dance-like triplet rhythm. The seemingly simple text about a mermaid in the sea can be interpreted as the legendary seduction of a lonely sailor. According to H. C. Robbins Landon in his book Haydn-Chronicle and Works, the second song, entitled The Spirit???s song, is one of Haydn???s finest songs and also one of Hunter???s best poems. The introduction is a single-line melody played in octaves with a varied rhythmic sequence that sets the mood for the passionate pleas of the text. The concluding canzonetta, Fidelity, is reminiscent of the early Sturm and Drang movement in music, meaning ???storm and stress???. The rapid 32 nd notes which begin the piece are descriptive of a violent storm, possibly an emotional one, a very common strum and Drang theme. The harmonies then modulate between major and minor as the character in the poem struggles with feelings of love and acceptance of fate. The concluding set before intermission combines four different French composers, creating a diverse song set. Reynaldo Hahn, a well-known conductor who specialized in Mozart opera, but mainly remembered for his numerous songs, wrote the first song Si mes vers avaient des ailes. The single line arpeggios in the piano set the peaceful mood for this simple, strophic, Romance. The second song was written by a lesser known composer, Georges Hue. J???ai pleure en reve, contains markings such as avec desespoir, ???with despair???, which is indicative of the dramatic style of romanticism which explored the extremes of emotion. Cesar Franck originally wrote the hymn-like third piece, La procession, for voice and orchestra but it was later transcribed for piano. The concluding song, Dansons la Gigue, begins its quick tempo with marcato rhythms in the piano and a fast, sweeping melody in the vocal <b>line.</b> The <b>composer,</b> poldowski, is actually a pseudonym chosen for the female composer Irene Wieniawska, who was also known as Lady Dean Paul.

40|$|One of the {{groundbreaking}} {{developments in the}} history of technologically mediated music was the conception and construction of the delay line system. Although in the past and present, the concepts of the delay line system have been conceived, constructed, and marketed in a variety of fashions, from tape recorders to analog effect pedals to software algorithms, its purpose and utility remains the same. It consists of data or sound waveforms that are passed along a single loop across multiple "nodes" that read and then record new altered "data" back onto the loop as it completes a multitude of indefinite "cycles. " These cycles are repetitions of sound that build and fade based on the technical parameters of the nodes and nature of the cycle. This assemblage represents the culmination of an evolving technique to erect a musical practice that exudes ambience and coloration, rather than progressive melodies and harmonies. Originally built as an assemblage of several tape recorders looped together with a single sequential tape feed, the technological and artistic variations that this sound duplication system underwent in the past five decades represents great advancements in musical and technical thought. These experimental directions continue to give rise to unique processes and systems of music composition, as the use of the tape recorder delay line system has greatly surpassed its initial usage as a strict "electronic" instrument, blurring the line between the electronic and acoustic, the performer and the composer, and the engineer and the producer. As one such individual that straddles these roles, Brian Eno exhibits foresight and experimentation with delay line systems and represents the archetype for the compositional mindset in question- one profoundly engaged with the parameters of the creative process itself. Rather than endeavor to create traditionally structured music or music that is laden with intention or narrative, Eno and his contemporaries developed what may be thought of as the "process or system" approach to guide the development of their music. They develop a creative schema (often represented mechanically as a complexity of multiple tape recorders passing the same feed of tape between them through multiple "variables" that alter the content of the sound) either as harmonic equalization filters, filters that bend the phase of the waveform, or filters that adjust the speed and frequency of the sound. In Eno's pieces such as Discrete Music and Music for Airports, these strategies and systems may be heard- extremely pretty, ambient and repetitious. With this backdrop in mind, I intend to explore Eno and others' use of the delay line technique with the following questions in mind: 1.) What is it about delay line processes that produce ranges of emotions such as calm, longing, thoughtfulness, etc? Listeners generally associate the emotions of a musical work with the intentionality of the motives and gestures provided by the composer. When the delay line system delivers these emotions absent such musical factors, one becomes compelled to question why deep seated emotional reactions still take place in the listener. 2.) What is it about pre-conceived delay line processes that attracts Brian Eno, other musicians, and the listeners? The aesthetic experience of the "traditional" composer and the listener diverge as the composer toils through the parts of the piece, whereas the listener hears only the cohesive whole. The aesthetic experience of the "delay <b>line</b> system" <b>composer</b> {{in the absence of any}} direct encounter with pre-conceived parts of the music (as the delay line system lacks these partitions) likely evolves in a different manner. The composer sharing the anticipation of the listener compels an investigation into the origins of the fascination that both parties share when experiencing delay line pieces. 3.) When the composer assumes a passive role in the unfolding of a musical piece, how should listeners evaluate the role the composer? Instead of the composer as an intentional actor, the delay line systems commits the composer to the role of a creative, yet distant, engineer. The work of composers like Brian Eno, individuals that only provide a guiding hand in the actual construction of a piece, fundamentally questions the popular and academic view of the composer as an agent "directing musical traffic" and controlling all of the minute parts of the musical whole. 4.) Does the use the delay line system as a process or system of musical composition constitute improvisation? The delay line system's repetitious nature allows for the composer to capitalize on unanticipated musical moments, often interpreted as "mistakes" in a typical compositional framework. Using audio manipulation devices in the sequence of the delay <b>line</b> system, the <b>composer</b> is able to insert variables when these mistakes occur- often in the same manner as a jazz or blues musician that relies on the unpredictability of a piece to make a new musical statement. If the dynamic between the composer and the delay line system does amount to improvisation, what is the nature of this improvisation that makes it fascinating to the listener? 5.) What should a listener's conception of a "musical work" be when music is being produced with the delay line system? A musical work such as Beethoven's 9 th Symphony represents a traditional composition as it relies on the development of theme, tonal variations, and virtuostic ornamentation to generate a sense of grandeur or beauty. The presence of ambient and electroacoustic works developed by the assembly of delay line processes and systems, compositions that intrinsically lack these commonly anticipated traits of development and variation, demand a re-examination this notion of the "musical work. ...|$|R
