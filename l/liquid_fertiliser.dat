40|$|<b>Liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers</b> allow growers {{to abandon}} the use of {{conventional}} de novo (mined or synthesised) fertilisers {{without the need for}} major technological adaptions in the greenhouse. It was decided to run a cultivation experiment to find practical information for producers and growers when using <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers</b> in cultivation. The objective was to compare crop production between plants grown with <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers</b> and plants grown with conventional de novo fertilisers. Cucumbers were propagated in coir and peat and planted on slabs of respectively coir and peat. The plants on the two rooting media received either liquid organic or chemical fertilisers, resulting in four treatments in total.

To explain the results, the conversion of nitrogen was studied. Conversion of organic nitrogen into nitrate requires enzymatic hydrolysis to ammonium, followed by bacterial oxidation to nitrate. This microbiological process depends on two physiological groups of naturally occurring aerobic soil bacteria; ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). In conclusion nitrate concentration rather than the concentrations of organic nitrogen or ammonium, were growth rate determining.

To improve the formulation of a commercial <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> by increasing the nitrate concentration, a simple bench scale moving bed bioreactor of 20 L volume was constructed and used in continuous mode. The objective was to convert 80 % {{or more of the}} organic N present in the original <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertiliser</b> into nitrate. In the bioreactor we used naturally occurring aerobic nitrifying soil bacteria. Bacterial material from a soil sample was multiplied in vitro in selective media. The bioreactor was inoculated with ammonia and nitrite oxidising bacteria. Bacteria were maintained on a bio-carrier with a high specific surface area and a low specific mass. The bioreactor was aerated from below which allowed the bio-carrier to float and fertiliser solution could freely reach all bacterial mass. After initial inoculation, bacteria established themselves on the bio-carrier over a three week period after which accumulation of nitrite ended and stable production of nitrate as an only product of nitrification started. The nitrate production was monitored for several months during which it produced continuously. The bioreactor was supplied with fertiliser solution containing 6 mmol L- 1 (total N, no nitrate). Over 90 % of nitrogen supplied was converted to nitrate. Influent hydraulic retention time in the bioreactor was around 12. 5 h. In conclusion, in line continuous conversion of <b>liquid</b> organic-N <b>fertiliser</b> into nitrate can be achieved for over 90 % by a simple and reliable technique.

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of crop residue and animal manure from agricultural and livestock activities are annually produced worldwide. With proper management, these residues are potentially valuable sources of plant nutrients, mainly N. Recycling such subproducts in sustainably-based agricultural systems can minimise {{the use of}} mineral fertilisers, and hence reduce the potential risk of surface and groundwater pollution. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to obtain (small scale) two liquid labelled-organic fertilisers, an animal- and a vegetal-based organic (AO and VO, respectively) fertiliser, to be used as organic N sources in subsequent fertigation studies. Forage maize (Zea mays L.) grown under 15 N-labelled fertiliser supply was used as raw material for VO fertiliser production, and also as 15 N-labelled sheep feed to obtain 15 N-labelled manure. The labelled faeces fraction was used as raw material for the AO fertiliser. The VO fertiliser was obtained after an acidic and an enzyme-driven hydrolysis. The AO fertiliser was obtained after acidic hydrolysis. The VO <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> presented an N concentration of 330 mg·L- 1, 85 % of total N was organic, while ammonium and nitrate N accounted for 55 % and 45 % of the mineral nitrogen fraction, respectively. This fertiliser also exhibited high K, Ca and S concentrations and notable values for the remaining macro- and micronutrients. The AO <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> had a similar total N concentration (496 mg·L- 1, 82 % of total N in an organic form) to that of VO, but its mineral N fraction significantly differed, which came in a predominantly (95 %) ammonia form. It also had a high content of N, P, K and other macronutrients, and sufficient Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and B levels, which suggests its suitability as a potential fertiliser.

However, the advantage of liquid over granular P forms of fertiliser has not been fully investigated across the wide range of soils used for grain production in Australia. A glasshouse pot experiment tested if <b>liquid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> were more effective for growing spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) than granular P (monoammonium phosphate) in 28 soils from all over Australia with soil pH (H 2 O) ranging from 5. 2 to 8. 9. Application of liquid P resulted in greater shoot biomass, as measured after 4 weeks' growth (mid to late tillering, Feeks growth stage 2 - 3), than granular P in 3 of the acidic to neutral soils and in 3 alkaline soils. Shoot dry matter responses of spring wheat to applied liquid or granular P were related to soil properties to determine if any of the properties predicted superior yield responses to liquid P. The calcium carbonate content of soil was the only soil property that significantly contributed to predicting when liquid P was more effective than granular P. Five soil P test procedures (Bray, Colwell, resin, isotopically exchangeable P, and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)) were assessed to determine their ability to measure soil test P on subsamples of soil collected before the experiment started. These soil test values were then related to the dry matter shoot yields to assess their ability to predict wheat yield responses to P applied as liquid or granular P. All 5 soil test procedures provided a reasonable prediction of dry matter responses to applied P as either liquid or granular P, with the resin P test having a slightly greater predictive capacity on the range of soils tested. The findings of this investigation suggest that <b>liquid</b> P <b>fertilisers</b> do have some potential applications in non-calcareous soils and confirm current recommendations for use of <b>liquid</b> P <b>fertiliser</b> to grow cereal crops in highly calcareous soils.

40|$|Sugarcane {{grown in}} the Southern African region is reliant on large inputs of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen (up to 200 kg N /ha/crop) for producing optimum sucrose yields. Urea is the preferred N fertiliser, mainly due to a high N concentration [46 %] and a lower price per unit of N compared with its main competitors, limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN [28 %]) and ammonium sulphate (AS [21 %]). While LAN, AS and urea suffer similar field losses of NO 3 -N by leaching and denitrification, urea is subject to additional NH 3 -N losses by volatilisation from both acid and alkaline non-irrigated soils. A new laboratory method was developed to test grower soils for potential ammonia volatilisation from surface-applied urea. An empirical ammonia volatilisation model, based on soil buffer capacity, was developed from these new soil test data, requiring N-rate, soil pH, organic matter, and clay as inputs.

However, while it represents a good source of nutrients to support plant growth in a system called aquaponics, it appears that its use needs to be optimised {{to take full advantage of}} the potential benefits. Apart from mineral amendments, the use of beneficial microorganisms that can have a direct impact on plant growth and nutrient utilisation could be a promising option. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of rhizospheric bacteria, when introduced in association with the host plant at optimum density, can enhance plant growth and health. One well-known and versatile PGPR is Azospirillum brasilense that has numerous beneficial effects on plants. The production of phytohormones by the bacterium has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms responsible for the plant growth promoting effects observed in plants inoculated with Azospirillum. Hence, this PGPR could be a valuable input in vegetable production under an aquaponics system. In addition, despite the widespread studies conducted with this PGPR in various crops, there is no published report on vegetables fertilised with fish effluent or under an aquaponics system. This study focuses on evaluating the role of PGPR, particularly A. brasilense, on the growth and development of selected vegetable crops fertilised with fish effluent and using an aquaponics system.

40|$|To examine {{possible}} {{effects of}} global change on soil fauna abundance and diversity, two long-term field experiments in Norway spruce stands in Sweden were studied. Soil fauna (Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Collembola, predatory macroarthropods and Enchytraeidae) were sampled in plots experimentally simulating altered precipitation patterns and increased soil temperature. Six years of summer drought caused large decreases in abundance in all faunal groups {{and a reduction in}} species diversity of Oribatida and Collembola. Summer drought and irrigation caused shifts in the community composition of Oribatida and Collembola, but drought affected soil fauna more than irrigation. Increased soil temperature during 5 years resulted in positive responses in several Oribatida species and negative in some Collembola species. Three years after the summer drought treatment had ceased, the soil arthropod communities had still not returned to control conditions. Total abundances recovered quickly, but species richness, diversity indices and community composition recovered slower. Mobile arthropod groups seemed to recover faster than groups with more limited dispersal ability, and Oribatida had the slowest recovery rate. Microarthropod species with wide habitat niche width recovered faster than those with narrow niche width, and parthenogenetic Oribatida recovered faster than sexually reproducing ones. Overall, Collembola were less affected by drought, and recovered faster than Oribatida. Soil fauna decreased in plots receiving repeated additions of solid nitrogen fertiliser for 13 years, whereas slight increases were found in plots receiving <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> The fertilisation treatments caused shifts in the community composition of Oribatida and Collembola but did not cause changes in species richness. In conclusion, climate change resulting in frequent summer droughts will probably decrease abundance and diversity of forest soil fauna. Moister conditions may primarily result in shifts in community structure. Intensive forest fertilisation for biofuel production will probably affect the composition of soil fauna communities. Oribatida communities seem to be particularly vulnerable to disturbances. Post-disturbance recovery of soil fauna seems to be slow and disturbances on a large spatial scale may affect the resilience of soil ecosystems, as disturbances may cause permanent changes in community composition...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of bio-materials for energy purposes is generating large amounts of ash. In most cases, e. g. during incineration of straw and grain, bottom ash contains small amounts of heavy metals, but significant amounts of the plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Bottom ash also contains some micronutrients (e. g. copper and zinc) that are good for plants in small doses, together with generally small amounts of undesirable heavy metals, including cadmium. Biogas plants are becoming increasingly common in Sweden. They produce considerable amounts of digestate, a <b>liquid</b> <b>fertiliser</b> with a high content of nitrogen (N) comparable with that of pig slurry but lower contents of P and K. High quality biogas digestate may now be applied to arable land. This study investigated techniques and systems for blending and spreading liquid digestate with ash admixture. The physical and alkaline properties and solubility in water of some ash types were therefore studied at laboratory scale, as were the buffering properties of some digestates. The influence of ash admixture on digestate pH and ammonia emissions was also studied. At pilot scale, the properties of different ash/digestate mixtures were studied and a cell wheel for liquid manure was tested for adding the ash. Three types of ash (from oats, straw and wood pellets) and two types of digestate were studied. The ash produced so much dust that dust reduction measures and breathing masks proved necessary during handling. It also contained so much abrasive material {{that the risk of}} wear to pumps, pipes {{and other parts of the}} spreading equipment was rated high. It is therefore best if the ash can be added as late as possible to equipment for spreading on arable land, and also it can be prevented from passing through pumps and other moving parts. Only a minor proportion of the oat ash and straw ash was soluble in water. All three types of ash were alkaline and therefore increased the pH when mixed with water. However, the digestate had a high buffering capacity, so the overall effect on pH when moderate amounts of ash were included was slight. When oat ash was mixed into digestate, equilibrium concentrations of ammonia did not increase. There is thus no risk of increased ammonia emissions as long as the mixture does not contain more than 5 % ash. In fact, ammonia concentrations were lower when ash was added, possibly because of ammonia binding to some metal ions. In practice, the SNFS 1994 : 2 limit values for P and heavy metals mean that the test ash-digestate mixtures with 1 % by weight of ash can be applied to the same field at most twice in a three-year period. Mixtures with 3 % by weight of ash can be spread at most every third year and mixtures with 5 % by weight of ash at most every fifth year. Batch admixture of ash into liquid digestate is unsuitable, because the majority of the ash settles and forms sediment in the bottom of the tank, despite efficient stirring. For continuous dosage of finely pulverised ash into digestate, a cell wheel made for dosage of liquid manure can be used. However, for dosage into a flow under pressure a sluice is necessary to prevent digestate being pressed up into the ash container. Admixture of ash into solid digestate is another possible alternative, e. g. during movement of the solid fraction from a digestate separator to a store...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe French {{stock of}} organic {{spreader}} evolves and presents differences by their users. Cuma and agricultural work companies {{are the main}} operators which buy machines and provide spreading services for farmers. Individual sales are currently at a low level. The market decreases in units sold but prices increase. In this context, operators renew spreaders after 7 - 8 years and over 10 years for tankers, replacing small machines with bigger ones. Cuma use mostly vertical rotors spreaders for solid organic fertilisers and big slurry tankers for <b>liquid</b> organic <b>fertilisers.</b> Application rate equipment is {{at a level of}} confidential use. Agricultural work companies, when they are specialized in spreading, use mostly spreading table spreader, the biggest slurry tankers on the market and also all type of self-propelled machines. They adopt more easily application rate equipment as they have to respect more constraints for spreading than farmers and the possibility to get easier cost amortization due to a high intensive activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} <b>liquid</b> inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> (VitallTM) {{and organic}} composted chicken manure were compared in pot trials for {{their effects on}} the growth of papaya, and on the susceptibility of papaya and durian to disease caused by Phytophthora palmivora. A single application of 2. 5 % chicken manure, or regular applications of Vitall led to increased growth in papaya seedlings over a 3 -month period, compared to seedlings grown in unfertilised vermiculite/sand (50 : 50). Regular applications of half the recommended rate of Vitall produced the largest seedlings. Root dry weights were greater in fertilised than in unfertilised treatments, but did not differ between the inorganic and organic fertilisers. In contrast to the Vitall treatments, the incorporation of chicken manure into the potting mix led to increased survival of P. palmivora-infected papaya and durian seedlings, stimulated root regeneration in papaya after infection with P. palmivora, and the reduction of P. palmivora in the potting mix to undetectable levels within 4 weeks. The improved survival of infected papaya and durian grown in chicken manure amended potting mix was attributed to the higher levels of antagonistic microorganisms, such as actinomycetes, {{which led to the}} suppression of the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are needed for}} manure treatment that can capture nutrients, reduce emissions of ammonia and nuisance odours, and kill harmful pathogens. A reactor concept was developed for simultaneous treatment of separately collected liquid and solid fractions of pig manure. The liquid fraction is concentrated by evaporating the water using energy from the composting system {{and at the same}} time scrubbing ammonia from the composting off-gas by acidifying the urine to pH 4 with nitric acid. This results in two marketable products, a concentrated <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> (NH 4 NO 3) without phosphorus, and a stabilised, solid organic fertiliser, which is free of pathogens and weeds. By connecting the two reactor systems, emissions of ammonia and odours are abated as ammonia emitted from the composting is trapped in the liquid fraction and odorous compounds emitted from the liquid are degraded in the composting reactor. The concept was physically simulated by coupling a 80 -L compost reactor to a 10 -L bubble column. Operation of the bench-scale system showed that the concept is very promising. All nutrients were captured, and emissions of ammonia and odours were almost completely abated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Liquid</b> {{polyphosphate}} <b>fertilisers</b> contain both orthophosphate and pyrophosphate, {{and have}} shown significant yield increases compared to granular orthophosphate fertiliser on highly phosphorus (P) fixing soils. The P sorption chemistry {{of the dominant}} P species in a polyphosphate fertiliser (pyrophosphate and orthophosphate) was compared {{on a range of}} Australian soils, and the effect of these P species on equilibrium solution chemistry was also examined. Phosphorus supplied as pyrophosphate had a stronger sorption affinity than orthophosphate in all soils. The greater efficiency of pyrophosphate-based fertiliser on some soil types is therefore not due to reduced sorption of this P supplied as pyrophosphate compared to P supplied as orthophosphate fertiliser. In general, the addition of pyrophosphate to soil resulted in a larger decrease in calcium concentration in solution compared to orthophosphate. In contrast, there was an increase in iron concentration in solution with pyrophosphate addition, indicating sequestration reactions associated with the dissolution of dissolved organic carbon into soil solution. The pyrophosphate ion generally mobilised more Fe into solution than orthophosphate in several soils, likely through complexation reactions leading to Fe desorption/dissolution from the soil solid phase. These findings highlight the differences in soil chemical reactions that occur with the addition of polyphosphate fertilisers, which may contribute to their yield advantage in some soil types...|$|R
40|$|<b>Liquid</b> {{polyphosphate}} <b>fertilisers</b> {{have shown}} advantages in field experiments as a phosphorus (P) source for crops grown on calcareous soils. Polyphosphate fertilisers contain orthophosphate (oP), pyrophosphate (pP) and other condensed P species. A double labelling technique was developed using ion chromatography {{for separation of}} oP and pP, the major P species in polyphosphate fertilisers, {{in order to measure}} the isotopically exchangeable oP, pP and hydrolysed pP. Isotopically exchangeable P was measured in soils incubating for zero, three and 7 days after applying oP or pP to simulate a fertiliser band concentration at one g P kg− 1 soil. The data from this incubation study suggest that pP addition initially resulted in less isotopically exchangeable P than oP addition but {{there was no significant difference}} in the total isotopically exchangeable P for the two different P sources after 7 days of incubation. The addition of pP to soil resulted in an increase in iron, aluminium and dissolved organic carbon in soil solution, and a decrease in calcium concentration in soil solution. This study has shown that the availability of P added as pP is governed by a complex series of processes that differ from the chemistry of oP reactions in soil. T. M. McBeath, E. Lombi, M. J.

40|$|In West Africa {{scientists}} {{have shown that}} nitrogen applied in solution is the best fertilizer for rice grown in mangrove swamps. Granular fertilisers tend to get washed away by the twice dally flooding. Scientists at the West African Rice Development Association looked for {{a simple way to}} apply liquid fertilizer. They modified the knapsack sprayer into a deep placement nitrogen injector removed the nozzle, straightened the brass lance, and added a sharpened pipe to the end. They also drilled holes in the pipe about 1. 5 mm from the tip. Urea, dissolved in water, forms a nor-corrosive solution. Trained operators can inject 4 - 5 ml of the solution into the soil 20 - 25 cm deep. A single injection is as effective as several broadcast applications, or the use of other slow release forms of nitrogen <b>fertiliser.</b> <b>Liquid</b> nitrogen is available to the rice plant at a higher level, {{over a longer period of}} time, and produces greater yields. 40 to 60 kg of nitrogen per hectare can increase yields by 30 to 50 %.
