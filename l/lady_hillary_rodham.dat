5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the Travel Office operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
25|$|In September 1991, the Regents of the University of California {{approved}} a $33.5 million design by Parkin Architects {{for the proposed}} complex, which was architecturally similar to the existing Price Center. Construction began in December 1992, and the facility was completed in December 1994. Upon its completion, RIMAC was the largest NCAA Division III athletic complex {{in the country and}} remains one of the largest among all universities. The complex was inaugurated by First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton's speech dedicating the newly-named Eleanor Roosevelt College.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Pat Ryan {{graduated}} {{cum laude}} from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising, {{together with a}} certificate to teach {{at the high school}} level, which USC deemed equivalent to a Master's degree. (She was arguably the best-educated First <b>Lady</b> until <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton in 1993.) Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in Whittier, California.|$|R
50|$|Troopergate is {{the popular}} {{name for a}} {{political}} controversy {{that emerged in the}} 1990s in which several Arkansas State Troopers claimed they had arranged sexual liaisons for Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton during his time in office (1979-81, 1983-92) and had helped deceive his wife, First <b>Lady</b> of Arkansas <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 and 1979, {{lawyer and}} First <b>Lady</b> of Arkansas <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton {{engaged in a}} series of trades of cattle futures contracts. Her initial $1,000 {{investment}} had generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. In 1994, after Clinton had become First Lady of the United States, the trading became the subject of considerable controversy regarding the likelihood of such a spectacular rate of return, possible conflict of interest, and allegations of disguised bribery.|$|R
500|$|... {{prominent}} Democratic {{politicians and}} advisors, including New York Representative Charles Rangel, urged First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton {{to run for}} the New York Senate seat. An unprecedented action if she did it, Clinton spent considerable time mulling over the idea while Lowey waited in the wings. Her political advisors told her the race would be difficult and some of them told her she would lose. [...] She waited for the impeachment proceedings of Bill Clinton to conclude, which it did with his acquittal on February 12, 1999.|$|E
500|$|An FBI {{document}} {{suggested that}} Livingstone {{had been given}} his position because First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton {{was a friend of}} Livingstone's mother and recommended him. [...] Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her. Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by the Independent Counsel regarding this matter on January 14, 1998. [...] (That same day, the same Office of the Independent Counsel staff were listening to taped conversations of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky; the Lewinsky scandal was soon to break.) [...] In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that she {{had nothing to do with}} Livingstone's hiring. Livingstone also stated under oath there was no truth to the supposed hiring relationship. Hillary Clinton would later refer to the whole files matter as a [...] "pseudoscandal".|$|E
500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First <b>Lady</b> <b>Hillary</b> <b>Rodham</b> Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
