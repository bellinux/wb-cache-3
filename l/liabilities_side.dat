In most countries central banks influence short term interest rates through determining the equilibrium conditions of supply and demand in the market for bank reserves (liquidity).

First, there is a substantial liquidity surplus, therefore the Bank influences market interest rates using the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> instruments of its balance sheet. Second, as a result of the narrow-band exchange rate regime and the fact that the Treasury Account is held with the Bank, the amount of liquidity is highly volatile and hard to forecast.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the stability of the Croatian banking sector. After the banking crisis of 1998, the Croatian banking system underwent a deep transformation process; foreign investors gained a dominating market share of more than 90 % of total assets, with Austrian banks holding 43 % thereof. Compared to other Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs), the degree of banking intermediation is relatively high in Croatia. In recent years, lending to the private sector and in particular to households has risen whereas lending to the general government has declined. Foreign currencies continue {{to play an important role}} in the Croatian banking sector, in particular on the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> of banks balance sheets. While maintaining a large negative net foreign currency position on their balance sheets (with an increasing portion of net liabilities to nonresidents), Croatian banks overall net foreign currency position seems to be marginally positive. Still, foreign currency(-indexed) lending represents a credit risk as it entails an indirect exchange rate risk. Asset quality, by contrast, has improved significantly over the past five years, the capital adequacy ratio is on a relatively high — albeit declining — level, and real return on equity (ROE) is now as high as the profitability levels observed in other CEECs.

Lowering credit frictions leads to an increasingly procyclical behavior of leverage, which is typical for investment banks. Nevertheless, the impact of credit frictions on the fragility of the model financial system is complex. Lower frictions do increase the stability of the system most of the time, while systemic events become more probable.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{recent trends}} {{in the provision of}} finance and the factors that are likely to influence its future course. It emphasises how the interaction between the allocation of household wealth and the financing needs of firms shape the structure and evolution of financial systems. The paper focuses on the experiences of banks, and argues that as the 1990 s proceed they will face increased competition on both sides of their balance sheets. However, several factors are likely to provide banks some competitive advantage. The most important is that a large pool of borrowers cannot raise funds other than through banks. On the asset side of their balance sheets, the intermediation of funds to small and medium-sized businesses is thus a core function which differentiates banks from other financial institutions and the securities markets generally. But banks also have advantages on the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> of their balance sheets, as they offer depositors a safe and highly liquid repository for their funds. The paper argues that the extent to which banks remain the institutional core of the financial system will depend on their ability to perform their traditional lending role. It concludes by speculating about the implications for the stability of the financial system of the structural changes which have occurred. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} asset {{allocation}} decisions of life insurance companies in emerging markets. Mature market insurers allocate {{only a small}} fraction of their assets to emerging markets because of regulatory constraints, rating pressures, and currency risk. However, global insurers invest directly in emerging markets by setting up subsidiaries rather than through portfolio investment, and this trend is increasing. Local insurers largely remain captive investors of local instruments and provide stability to the domestic securities market. The regulatory regime and the liquidity and depth of local markets play an important role in asset allocation decisions of insurers. Insurance companies are increasingly adopting asset liability management and risk control measures.

40|$|While a basic {{theoretical}} {{principle in}} public economics assumes that individuals 2 ̆ 019 behaviour is fully-optimizer {{with respect to}} the introduction of a tax, an increasing body of research is presenting evidence that agents decision making is often affected by non-negligible cognitive biases, which could be responsible for lower market performance as well as for deviations from standard theoretical predictions. This paper extends the latter strand of research focusing on two trend topics in public economics: tax salience and tax incidence. While the former refers to the prominence of the tax, the latter places emphasis on the statutory vs. factual division of tax payments. Is market performance affected by the salience of the tax? Is the incidence of a tax independent of which side of the market it is levied on (<b>Liability</b> <b>Side</b> Equivalence Principle, LES) ?

40|$|The {{method of}} book value is, relatively, {{the easiest and}} the least {{time-consuming}} method of enterprise assets’ valuation. However, the reliability of valuation by means of this method is questionable.

Deferred incomes and charges are a particular example of the said liabilities. One of the reasons of showing deferred charges on the assets side and provisions on the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> is the existence of a transitory difference in the income tax. The author of the paper raises the question if this difference influences the value of net assets, and if so, whether it depends on the way it is included in the formula of determining this value? It has been proved that the influence of the allocation for the transitory difference in the income tax on the value of net assets depends on the method of their classification when determining this value. It has also been proved that, at the point of calculating the value of net assets, there exists a problem of classifying some liabilities as equities or as outside capital and that it is needed that each and every part of a balance included in this calculation be dealt with individually...|$|E
40|$|A natural person’s {{patrimony}} consists, {{apart from}} rights (assets of the succession), of a <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> as well related to obligations that the patrimony’s holder bequeaths onto the heirs following his/her death. The succession implies {{that there are}} two parties, i. e. the assets of the succession and the inherited debt. The inherited debt is mainly made up of the inheritance duties and liabilities. The main components of the inherited debt are the debts the deceased has left, following that the duties shall be the obligations arising out after the succession will be opened. However, without defining the inherited debt concept in the specialized literature, successional liabilities have been considered to mean those patrimonial obligations of the deceased toward a third party or the inheritors existing in the successional patrimony on the opening of succession, regardless of their origin (contractual, tortious or legal). Inheritance duties refer to those obligations which did not exist in the de cujus patrimony, but come into existence devolving upon the heirs on the date of succession’s opening or subsequently after that time, either in consequence of the deceased’s desire, or independently of it. The main characteristic of the option on succession is that the right of option belongs exclusively to the presumptive heirs. From this point of view, the option on succession seems to have nothing in common with the inherited debt. Nevertheless, I intend to analyse the correlation between the two institutions {{from the perspective of the}} place inheritance creditors hold in the totality of rights of option. Their presence is only justified when there is an inherited debt...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{whether and how}} to report in {{financial}} statements {{the right to use}} property and the obligation to pay rent or return the used property to the lessor after leasing is a fairly complex area in which it is difficult to find a generally acceptable accounting treatment. Especially for entities that are the subject of public interest, it is being demanded that in view of space comparability operative leasing should be reported on the side of lessee in the statement on financial position, both on the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side,</b> {{as well as on the}} assets side. Some possible approaches to reporting these facts are analyzed in this paper. At first the attention was paid to the simple operational lease contracts with a fixed term lease – there were compared the impacts of this way of reporting with the impact of existing accounting solutions. Moreover, the attention was also paid to the complicated lease contracts, such contracts with an option to extend contract or leasing contracts in which rents are divided into a fixed part and a part constructed variable. There were evaluated the effects of different views on the reporting of these contracts, in particular the views of the IASB and the FASB. Many preparers of accounts, however, justifiably concerned that this solution is quite complicated and the entity would be unduly burdensome due to the benefits achieved. This problem could be even more pronounced for smaller entities for potential adjustments to standards for SMEs. Such entities are often against mere change over to the principle based on the transfer of risk and commissions connected with leasing...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{discounted}} cash flows’ valuation setup, and derives a general expression {{for the tax}} shields’ discount rate. This setup applies to any debt policy and any cash flow pattern. It only requires the equality at any time between the assets side and the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> of the market value balance sheet, which has been introduced by Farber, Gillet and Szafarz (2006). This concept is extensively developed in the paper. This model encompasses all the usual setups that consider a fixed discount rate for the tax shields and require a fixed level of debt or a fixed leverage ratio, in particular Modigliani & Miller (1963) and Harris & Pringle (1985). It proposes an endogenized and integrated approach and modelizes the different market value discount rates as functions of both their relevant leverage ratio and the operating profitability of the firm. Among these rates are the cost of debt and the tax shields’ discount rate, which are usually assume constant. In this model, all the discount rates are likely to vary as soon as perpetuity cases are not considered. This setup introduces a new rate {{for the cost of}} levered equity without tax shields and develops the relation between the present value of tax shields and the market value of equity since debt tax shields entirely flow to equity. It only requires the risk free rate and the unlevered cost of capital as inputs but not the capital structure of the firm, as it tackles the circularity problem by considering an iterative approach. This fully dynamic model yields both theoretical and economic sensible results, and allows straightforward applications. It apparently solves the discrepancies of the usual setups and hopefully paves the way for further research. ...|$|E

" The problem arises when there is incomplete knowledge about {{the structure of the}} economy, including the length of leads and lags, the precise size of coefficients and the full specification of the equations used to describe the economy's structure. An indicator provides information about the comparative degree of "ease " or "restraint. " The main argument of the paper is that credit-defined as the total debt obligations of nonfinancial borrowers [...] contains useful informa-tion to supplement monetary aggregates. To paraphrase Friedman, the <b>liabilities</b> <b>side</b> of balance sheets of households and nonfinancial f m s contains information that supplements the information in the monetary aggregates- on the asset side of these balance sheets. Most of the paper makes a different point, however. Friedman devotes most of his effort to showing that, on the criteria he uses, his measure of credit dominates the monetary aggregates during the sample period. My comments have two parts. First, I compare Friedman's approach to some principal alternatives. Then, I offer some specific comments on his procedures and the definition of credit. Implementing Monetary Control The problem Benjamin Friedman addresses does not arise if there is a rule requiring constant money growth or tying money growth to some observable measure. With discretionary policy, the central bank may choose to alter policy in response to perceptions or forecasts of future 250 Allan H. Melrzer conditions. when governments choose discretion over rules, two methods of extracting information about the future effects of current policy are in use or have been proposed. To improve outcomes, these approaches must be sufficiently reliable to do better than a monetary rule. What is "better"? Friedman makes no effort to compare discretion-ary policies to rules, so I suggest a minimum standard. Discretionary policy should reduce fluctuations in nominal GNP below the variability that can be achieved with a rule requiring constant money growth.

40|$|Upon Austria's {{entry into}} Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) took on new tasks {{in the field}} of payment systems. January 4, 1999, marked the launch of the {{cross-border}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system TARGET. This system, in which EU-wide some 5, 000 credit institutions participate, is composed of the national RTGS payment systems operated in the EU countries, the ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) and an interface component called Interlinking. Austria's RTGS system, ARTIS, is integrated into TARGET. TARGET was designed as a real-time system, i. e., in normal circumstances payments reach their destination within a few seconds or minutes after being debited from the account of the sending participants, with all payments treated equally, irrespective of their value and destination. As a gross settlement system, TARGET guarantees intraday finality of payments, since transactions are settled individually. Throughout a business day, TARGET enables participating credit institutions to flexibly manage their liquidity, as they may use their minimum reserves for settlement purposes during the day. Banks may obtain unlimited intraday credit free of charge by providing adequate collateral, namely tier-one and tier-two assets. Euro 1 set up by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) and the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) system, among others, provide key alternative channels for processing payments in euro. Compared with centralised systems, TARGET with its multitude of interfaces is more susceptible to technical incidents. Even though its fees are higher, the majority of euro-denominated payments are processed via TARGET. Starting with the January 1998 reporting period, the OeNB introduced a new balance-of-payments presentation scheme. Transactions associated with the settlement of TARGET payments are recorded under "Currency and deposits" of monetary authorities (<b>liabilities</b> <b>side)</b> under the other investment sub-account of the financial account. In the first half of 1999, such transactions ran to ATS 66. 4 billion net. This item may not, however, be explained as an opposite position of the structural current account deficit of Austria vis-à-vis the EU 15, since TARGET transactions fall predominantly under the interbank category. The capital imported via central bank payment traffic is tantamount to borrowing by the "Austrian economy" that is basically financed at most favourable (tender rate) conditions.
