5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl {{into the corner of}} a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's throat as she <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize it was all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E
5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E

This goodbye is {{initially}} accompanied by repeated {{notes on the}} lower woodwinds and strings {{such as those in}} the introduction of the act but in a much more noticeable and dominating manner. This reflects the increasing expectation of Desdemona of her death. Initially, she attempts to keep these feelings to herself, but the orchestra reveals her increasing inner thoughts. These feelings finally reach a point at which they can no longer be contained and Desdemona <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loud passionate cry of goodbye to Emilia, one that is reinforced by the full orchestral accompaniment.|$|E

25|$|In {{some regions}} in India where human {{disturbance}} is minor, the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power. When alarmed, gaur {{crash into the}} jungle at a surprising speed. However, in Southeast Asia and South India, where {{they are used to}} the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> high whistle for help.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its release, [...] "You Can't Win" [...] has {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. A journalist from the Kansas City Star {{said that the}} song was the best one from The Wiz. Kenny Mack of the Santa Monica Daily Press asserted that Jackson's [...] "famous vulnerability {{and the power of}} his voice on 'You Can't Win' combined for perfect casting" [...] in the film. The Boston Globes Renée Graham stated in 2005, [...] "Halfway through the , Jackson <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> whoop, and the tune evolves from a pop-soul confection into a true R delight, spiced with barking horns and hand-claps as funky and loose as anything Jackson has ever done." [...] Writer Geoff Brown wrote in his book Michael Jackson: A Life in Music that the singer's performance of [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz was [...] "one of the few bright moments in a drab remake of The Wizard of Oz". Margo Jefferson wrote in the biography On Michael Jackson that the entertainer sang the song in the film with [...] "rough, gospel edges of desperation". She added, [...] "The torment feels genuine. It's a painful scene." [...] After Jackson's death in 2009, Edmund W. Lewis of The Louisiana Weekly said that he was [...] "still amazed at the quality of 's performance in The Wiz". He added, [...] "As the scarecrow, he sang the hell out of [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stood on his head: This {{is a term}} to {{describe}} an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender {{in a short period}} of time. Often when a goalie <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and [...] "stacks the pads" [...] and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President Frank Calder, alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, [...] "As far as I am concerned, they can stand on their head(s)." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the chiming of midnight, the revelers and Prospero {{notice a}} figure in a dark, blood-splattered robe {{resembling}} a funeral shroud. The figure's mask resembles the rigid face of a corpse and exhibits the traits of the Red Death. Gravely insulted, Prospero demands to know {{the identity of the}} mysterious guest so they can hang him. The guests, too afraid to approach the figure, instead let him pass through the six chambers. The Prince pursues him with a drawn dagger and corners the guest in the seventh room. When the figure turns to face him, the Prince <b>lets</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> sharp cry and falls dead. The enraged and terrified revelers surge into the black room and forcibly remove the mask and robe, only to find to their horror that there is nothing underneath. Only then do they realize the figure is the Red Death itself, and all of the guests contract and succumb to the disease. The final line of the story sums up, [...] "And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held [...] dominion over all".|$|E

To defeat them, the Warsong leader Grom Hellscream drinks from a corrupted fountain of health contaminated with the blood of the Legion's pit lord commander Mannoroth, successfully killing Cenarius, but binding his clan to the Legion's control. Thrall manages to reach the Oracle, in fact the Prophet, who tells him of Grom's doings. Following the Prophet's directions, Thrall and Jaina join forces to [...] purge both Grom and the world of demonic influence. They succeed in capturing Grom and healing him of Mannoroth's corruption.
