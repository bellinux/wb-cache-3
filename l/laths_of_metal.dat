40|$|Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) {{technology}} {{was used to}} produce tensile and flexural samples based on the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V biomedical composition. Tensile samples were produced in three different orientations in order to investigate the effect of building direction on the mechanical behavior. On the other hand, flexural samples were submitted to thermal treatments to simulate the firing cycle commonly used to veneer metallic devices with ceramics in dental applications. Roughness and hardness measurements as well as tensile and flexural mechanical tests were performed to study the mechanical response of the alloy while X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, STEM) techniques and microanalysis (EDX) were used to investigate sample microstructure. Results evidenced {{a difference in the}} mechanical response of tensile samples built in orthogonal directions. In terms of microstructure, samples not submitted to the firing cycle show a single phase acicular α’ (hcp) structure typical <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> parts subject to high cooling rates.

40|$|Abstract: An 18 Ni (C- 250) {{maraging}} steel was successfully processed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) {{for a single}} pass at room temperature. Microstructural observations showed that the martensite <b>laths</b> <b>of</b> 18 Ni {{maraging steel}} were elongated to more narrow bands with a width of 100 - 200 nm after ECAP deformation. After ageing treatment, many nano-sized precipitates distributed uniformly within the refined martensite lathes. In comparison with the tensile strength (1940 MPa) of general used steel (solution + aging treatment), the tensile strength of the sample processed by ECAP and subsequent aging treatment was enhanced for more than 100 MPa (above 2050 MPa). The enhancement of tensile properties was attributed to microstructural refinement and uniformly distributed nano-precipitates...|$|R
