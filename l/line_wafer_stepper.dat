The proposed solution strategy consists of two parts.

Second, we find fast movement strategies for scanning all chips of a given packing, given the mechanical restrictions of the <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper.</b> The corresponding combinatorial optimization problem is formulated as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show how feasible scan strategies are determined, and how these strategies are improved by local search techniques, such as iterative improvement based on 2 - and 3 -exchanges, and simulated annealing based on 2 -exchanges. ...|$|R

40|$|Vibrations within high-precision {{machines}} are often badly damped, and may easily {{show up as}} {{a major factor in}} limiting the achievable accuracy. As it is hard to damp these vibrations by passive means, active vibration control may become inevitable within such machines. Robust active damping can be obtained by applying integral force feedback to so-called ‘Smart Discs’, i. e., active structural elements consisting of a piezoelectric position actuator and a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are inserted at appropriate locations within a machine frame. A <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper,</b> i. e., the advanced microlithography system that {{is at the heart of}} integrated circuit manufacturing, is an excellent example of a high-precision machine with a frame that has low structural damping. Badly damped vibrations of the lens of the <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper</b> may in future limit the attainable line width of the circuit patterns. For this reason an active lens support, based on Smart Discs, is developed.

40|$|The Laser Step Alignment (LSA) is a through- the-lens, field-by-field {{alignment}} system {{developed for}} an optical step- and- repeat {{system with a}} reduction projection lens (<b>wafer</b> <b>stepper)</b> intended for one micron or submicron lithography. The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the wafer stage so that the alignment mark travels across the laser beam. The passage of the align-ment mark produces diffracted and scattered light, which is photo- electrically detected as the alignment signal. The position of the alignment mark is accurately measured by the laser interferomter attached to the wafer stage. The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers. LSA uses a 633 nm He-Ne laser, so the photoresist is not sensitive to it, and LSA is well applicable to multilayer resist processes. The alignment time is about 0 - 6 seconds per shot in field-by-field mode.

The motor is modelled as a reluctance network. The saturating parts of the magnetic circuit are modelled as variable reluctances and magnetomotive forces represent the currents and the magnets. In saturation, a current leading the no-load voltage results in an increase of the generated force. The good correlation between the calculated and the measured force justifies the model...|$|R

The computer tools they use stimulate the build-up of the design in a bottom-up approach (from detail to assembly to system). Therefore the context information the specialists have is too limited or even lacking. The system designer, on the other hand, lacks the detail information needed to supervise the system integrity during the entire process.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the controller {{design and implementation}} of a high-precision 6 -degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) magnetically levitated (maglev) positioner. This high-precision positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single-moving part that carries three 3 -phase permanent-magnet linear-levitation-motor armatures. Since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and coarse motions, this positioning system is reliable and low-cost. Three planar levitation motors based on the Lorentz-force law not only generate the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but control the platen??s position and orientation in the horizontal plane. All 6 -DOF motions are controlled by magnetic forces only. The platen is regarded a pure mass system, and the spring and damping coefficients are neglected except for the vertical directions. Single-input single-output (SISO) digital lead-lag controllers are designed and implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP). This 6 -DOF fully magnetically levitated positioner has a total mass of 5. 91 kg and currently exhibits a 120 mm ?? 120 mm travel range.

However, {{a significant portion of the}} total observed variability is systematic in nature. Accordingly, particle defects may not continue to dominate parametric yield loss without improved understanding of parametric variations.

Lithography {{is one of the}} most important and critical steps in semiconductor wafer manufacturing. It is directly responsible for shrinking feature sizes to increase transistor densities. However, with further down scaling of the feature size on wafers, the magnitude of adhesive forces becomes a prohibitive factor in further increasing handling speeds and throughput of wafers.

40|$|Excimer lasers are pulsed gas lasers. Depending on the {{gas mixture}} laser {{emission}} is generated on single lines in the UV and VUV portion of the electromagnetic spectra. These emission lines are at wavelengths between 355 nm and 157 nm. The pulse length is normally 5 - 20 ns. Compact Excimer lasers typically have single pulse energy of 10 mJ. The maximum repetition rate is 1 kHz in the compact class. Large Excimer lasers can operate with repetition rates less than 300 Hz, but with single pulse energies up to 1 J. The laser emission is initiated by a pulsed electrical discharge in high pressure gas, having a mixture of rare gases and a halogen. The materials of the laser vessel must be resistant against the Fluorine, or Chlorine. Contaminations must be avoided during assembly and operation of the laser system.
