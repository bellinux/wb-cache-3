25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} {{bailment}} is <b>leaving</b> <b>your</b> {{car with a}} valet. <b>Leaving</b> <b>your</b> car in an unattended parking garage is typically a license rather than a bailment, as the car park's intent to possess your car cannot be shown. However, bailments arise in many other situations, including terminated leases of property, warehousing (including store-it-yourself) or in carriage of goods.|$|R

[...] In {{the wake of his}} loss, Milk, realizing that the Toklas Club would never support him politically, co-founded the San Francisco Gay Democratic Club.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{arrangements}} for the concert were written by Paul Simon and David Matthews. Some songs differed significantly from their original versions; for example, [...] "Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard" [...] featured more prominent Latin elements and included a salsa break, while the folk rock [...] "Kodachrome" [...] was set as a harder rock song and played together with the Chuck Berry classic [...] "Maybellene" [...] as a medley.

500|$|At that time, {{there were}} few {{graduated}} Kodokan judoka. Maeda and Satake were the top graduated professors at Waseda University, both sandan (3rd dan), along with Matsuhiro Ritaro (nidan or 2nd dan) and six other shodan (1st dan). Kyuzo Mifune registered at the Kodokan in 1903 and {{attracted the attention of}} Maeda, who commented, [...] "you are strong and competent, therefore, you will certainly <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> mark in the Kodokan ..." [...] Mifune went to learn under Sakujiro Yokoyama and later, already a celebrated judoka, Mifune said that Maeda's words were a great incentive, as he regarded Maeda with the greatest admiration, even though Yokoyama was his sensei (instructor).|$|E

In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff’s attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} voice-acting of Eric Idle, but criticised the PlayStation version, {{saying that it}} was {{difficult}} to navigate without the PlayStation Mouse and that the text was too small. In their review of the PlayStation version, Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly commented that the PlayStation mouse is required for full enjoyment, but highly praised the voice acting, humour, and graphics. Scary Larry of GamePro, in contrast to EW and EGM, said the standard joypad [...] "works just as well" [...] as the PlayStation Mouse. He praised the humorous graphics, extensive voice acting, and script which [...] "will <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> sides aching from laughter", but found the gameplay too simplistic and lacking in challenge. He recommended it for players who were open to less serious gaming. IGN called Discworld challenging and long, but criticised the long loading times. The reviewer of [...] described the game as [...] "very beautiful" [...] and said that the PlayStation version has more colours than the PC version, but disliked the difficulty {{and the size of the}} save game files.|$|E

500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, HitFix's Melina Newman denounced its lyrical content: [...] "Even though they never are so blatant {{about it that}} booty call subtext can't go right over their tween audience's head, there's no mistaking lines like “if we get together, don’t let the pictures ever <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> phone” for anyone who's 13 or up. The lyrics are unwieldy and uncouth. That's what happens when you're not a boy, but not yet a man: One Direction can't go straight from the G-rated sweetness of “What Makes You Beautiful” to something akin to Enrique Iglesias's [...] "Tonight, I’m F****** You," [...] so instead they’re stuck with this in between clumsiness that the not-so-little girls will understand." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as [...] "not-so-innocent" [...] and a [...] "party jam". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that its sexual suggestive lyricism [...] "arrives too soon after the more accomplished puppy-love odes of previous hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] to further the conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary.

[...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, <b>leave</b> <b>your</b> husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E

You wanna go broke? <b>Leave</b> <b>your</b> company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [...] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'" [...] Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between the two women has [...] "outlived most marriages". Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now.
