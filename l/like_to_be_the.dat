My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy contains multiple excerpts from Cartwright's diary detailing various events, mostly encounters with The Simpsons guest stars. Guest stars she talks about include Ernest Borgnine, Danny DeVito, Kirk Douglas, Mel Gibson, Kelsey Grammer, Tom Jones, Michael Jackson, Mickey Rooney, Meryl Streep and Elizabeth Taylor. One chapter describes the day she found out that Phil Hartman, a frequent guest star on The Simpsons, was murdered.

However, she would miss and accidentally punch Principal Skinner instead, resulting in her being sent to juvenile hall where she would make illegal jeans. According to The Simpsons show runner Mike Scully, when the staff members worked on the episode they decided to include a lot of observations they had made about how it is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> new student in school.

In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored to be in it. Of course, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> romantic lead, and I'm actually closer to Michael's [...] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [...] I think it's always worked that way in Hollywood. When I was in my 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, {{all of whom were}} old enough to be my father." [...] The Game proved to be a major success among Baker's later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

500|$|Stereolab toured {{regularly}} {{to support their}} album releases. In a 1996 The Washington Post gig review, Mark Jenkins wrote that Stereolab started out favoring an [...] "easy-listening syncopation", but eventually reverted to a [...] "messier, more urgent sound" [...] characteristic of their earlier performances. In another review Jenkins said that the band's live songs [...] "frequently veer into more cacophonous, guitar-dominated territory", in contrast to lighter albums like Cobra and Phases Group.... In the Minneapolis Star Tribune Jon Bream compared the band's live sound to feedback-driven rock bands like The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Several critics have said that Stereolab lacked stage presence, arguing that Sadier's vocal delivery was too subdued and that the band tended to play instead of perform its music. Regarding being onstage, Gane has said that [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> center of attention...I just get into the music and am not really aware of the people there. That's my way of getting through it." ...|$|E

Palin also delivered a eulogy to Chapman, as did Idle, quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again. Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman's close friends and family in a rendition of the song [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] from The Life of Brian. Idle closed his remarks by saying: [...] "I'd just <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last person at this meeting to say 'fuck'." ...|$|E

With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> companion from the companion's point of view, and she got to talk about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E

500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E

[...] During the LeBron James Skills Academy in July, McGary stood out as {{the best player in}} attendance. [...] He was {{invited to participate in the}} 5th annual Nike Global Challenge the following month. Due to an ankle injury he did not participate. [...] However, later that month, he participated in the Boost Mobile Elite 24 event, where he shattered a backboard. His other 2011 summer camps included Pittsburgh Jam Fest, the National Basketball Players Association Top 100 camp and the Under Armour Best of the Best Camp, where he was the most valuable player. Also in August, ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six: University of Florida, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Duke University and University of Kentucky. Because McGary does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> bearer of bad news, when he narrowed his list, he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services. McGary scheduled his official Michigan visit for the beginning of September. McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Duke University, in that order, by October 4. [...] However, due to injuries suffered a few weeks earlier while shattering the backboard, he only played pick-up games at Duke. He also made an unofficial visit to Florida prior to these official visits. While Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander was recruiting him, a Brewster Academy groundskeeper relayed a story about McGary consoling a freshman who was in tears when his parents dropped him off on the first day of school. [...] Alexander says the groundskeeper told him that [...] "McGary spotted the kid from a distance, stopped his conversation and ran to him, consoled him and brought him into school with his group of friends."
