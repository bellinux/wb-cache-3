40|$|Abstract- Recent {{experimental}} and theoretical developments concerning {{the interaction of}} laser light w i t h a c t o r y solids are reviewed, with emphasis on <b>long,</b> low-power density <b>pulses.</b> Compared to short, high-power density irradiation, <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> produce principally thermally-driven evaporation which {{can be related to}} the thermochemical properties of the heated surface. Surface temperature measurement and calculation methods are outlined and the use of mass spectrometry to analyze the vapor is reviewed...|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} {{provides a}} wide variety of experimental capabilities to 60 teslas, using short and <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> magnets. Power comes from a pulsed power infrastructure which includes a 1.43 gigawatt motor generator and five 64-megawatt power supplies. The 1200-ton motor generator sits on a 4800-short ton (4350 t) inertia block which rests on 60 springs to minimize earth tremors and is the centerpiece of the Pulsed Field Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|While Aston worked towards {{multiple}} pulses, a team at Cornell University {{had been}} working on a similar design. However, this Relativistic Electron Coil Experiment (RECE) used a single <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> of electrons rather than the stacking concept. Late in 1971 they announced they had achieved complete field reversal. Christofilos was unimpressed; this design would not be useful for a steady state fusion generator, only by continually adding pulses could the machine maintain itself.|$|E
50|$|The central {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} CLIC were performing the power extraction from the drive beam and the construction of the main beam accelerating cavities, which would provide the needed accelerating gradient of 100 MV/m for sufficiently <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> time with the lowest possible breakdown rate. The feasibility of CLIC concerning these issues was demonstrated at the CLIC Test Facility (CTF3) in recent years, and the conceptual design report of the CLIC accelerator has been published in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|... {{heat load}} on {{mechanical}} components: on the electrodes used for beam acceleration, {{and along the}} beam path, mechanical components are subject to very high thermal loads. These loads are continuously applied during <b>long</b> <b>pulses,</b> up to 1h. These loads are anyhow lower than the heat loads expected on the ITER divertor plates.|$|R
40|$|The {{photoconductive}} gain {{mechanism in}} a-Si:H {{was investigated in}} connection with applications to radiation detection. Various device types such as p-i-n, n-i-n and n-i-p-i-n structures were fabricated and tested. Photoconductive gain was measured in two time scales: one for short pulses of visible light (< 1 {mu}sec) which simulates the transit of an energetic charged particle, {{and the other for}} rather <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> of light (1 msec) which simulates x-ray exposure in medical imaging. We used two definitions of photoconductive gain: current gain and charge gain which is an integration of the current gain. We found typical charge gains of 3 {approximately} 9 for short pulses and a few hundred for <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> at a dark current level of 10 mA/cm{sup 2 }. Various gain results are discussed in terms of the device structure, applied bias and dark current...|$|R
40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, {{we study}} propagation of linearly-chirped optical pulses in a homogeneously broadened two-level medium. We {{pay attention to}} the three main topics [...] validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), pulse compression, and collisions of counter-propagating pulses. The cases of <b>long</b> and single-cycle <b>pulses</b> are considered and compared with each other. We show that the RWA does not give a correct description of chirped pulse interaction with the medium. The compression of the chirp-free single-cycle pulse is stronger than of the chirped one, while the opposite is true for <b>long</b> <b>pulses.</b> We demonstrate that the influence of chirp on the collisions of the <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> allows to control the state of the transmitted radiation: the transmission of the chirp-free pulse can be dramatically changed under collision with the chirped counter-propagating one, {{in sharp contrast to the}} case when both pulses are chirped. On the other hand, the collisions of the chirped single-cycle pulses can be used for precise control of medium excitation in a narrow spatial region. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
5000|$|Ultrasound waves may be {{detected}} optically {{by a variety}} of techniques. Most techniques use continuous or <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> (typically of tens of microseconds) lasers but some use short pulses to down convert very high frequencies to DC in a classic pump-probe configuration with the generation. Some techniques (notably conventional Fabry-Pérot detectors) require high frequency stability and this usually implies long coherence length.Common detection techniques include: interferometry (homodyne or heterodyne [...] or Fabry-Pérot) and optical beam deflection (GCLAD) or knife edge detection.|$|E
50|$|The third type {{of solar}} {{simulator}} is the pulsed simulator, {{which uses a}} shutter to quickly block or unblock the light from a continuous source. This category is a compromise between the continuous and flash, having the disadvantage of the high power usage and relatively low intensities of the continuous simulators, but advantage of stable output intensity and spectrum. The short illumination duration also provides {{the benefit of the}} low thermal loads of flashed simulators. Pulses are typically on the order of 100 milliseconds up to 800 milliseconds for special Xe <b>Long</b> <b>Pulse</b> Systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{limits to}} <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> {{durations}} are {{the number of}} transferred electrons to the anode, sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode, and the temperature gradients of the glass. Pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode, while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise. For continuous operation the cooling is the limit. Discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 0.1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds, and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz. Flash duration can be carefully controlled {{with the use of}} an inductor.|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of an extrapolable model for carbon erosion and re-deposition processes is needed to evaluate possible tritium retention and diagnostic coating rates in ITER.

50|$|The yellow {{layer is}} the topmost one, {{sensitive}} to short heat pulses of high temperature. The magenta layer {{is in the}} middle, sensitive to longer pulses of moderate temperature. The cyan layer is at the bottom, sensitive to <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> of low temperature. The layers are separated by thin interlayers, acting as heat insulation, moderating the heat throughput.|$|R
5000|$|... {{end-to-end}} {{measurements of}} code, for example performed by setting an I/O pin on {{the device to}} high {{at the start of}} the task, and to low at the end of the task and using a logic analyzer to measure the <b>longest</b> <b>pulse</b> width, or by measuring within the software itself using the processor clock or instruction count.|$|R
50|$|Grad and Mozina (1998) further {{demonstrated}} {{the effect of}} pulse shapes. A 12 ns spike was added at the beginning, middle, {{and the end of}} a 5 ms pulse. When the 12 ns spike was added {{to the beginning of the}} long laser pulse, where no melt had been produced, no significant effect on removal was observed. On the other hand, when the spike was added at the middle and the end of the <b>long</b> <b>pulse,</b> the improvement of the drilling efficiency was 80 and 90%, respectively. The effect of inter-pulse shaping has also been investigated. Low and Li (2001) showed that a pulse train of linearly increasing magnitude had a significant effect on expulsion processes.|$|E
50|$|For surface {{absorbers}} {{the thickness}} of the absorption layer is very thin (0.1 - 100 µm) and so is the total absorption length. It is used for power measurements of lasers with <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> length (generally for CW laser). If a laser with pulse length in the range of 10−7 - 10−4 sec is used the sensor can be damaged by either dielectric break-down or thermal effects. In case of thermal damage, heat is deposited in a short time and cannot be dissipated until the next pulse arrives. This leads to an accumulation of energy in a thin layer leading to partial vaporization. For dielectric breakdown, the peak energy density during a pulse is high enough to locally ionize the sensor surface.|$|E
50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{compared}} the activation of sensory and motor fibers using electricand magnetic stimulation demonstrated through stimulation of nerve and muscle tissue that magnetic activationof intramuscular nerve fibers {{in the arm}} and leg occurs at a lower threshold than for electricstimulation. Also, sensory fibers were shown to have a lower threshold for electric stimulation.Electric stimulation of the wrist by determined that when short pulses areused (less than 200 μs), motor fibers are more readily excitable, whereas for long pulsedurations (greater than 1000 μs), sensory fibers {{are more prone to}} depolarization. A relatedobservation is that electric stimulation preferentially activates sensoryfibers compared to motor fibers for <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> durations, and the inverse for short pulsedurations. For magnetic stimulation, the motor fiber threshold was lowerthan that for sensory fibers.|$|E
40|$|A {{different}} way to increase the energy within a coherent processing interval (CPI) is suggested – many short dense pulses with inter-pulse coding instead of few widely-spaced <b>long</b> <b>pulses</b> with intra-pulse coding. <b>Long</b> coded <b>pulses</b> re-sult in masking targets at close range and suffer from poor Doppler tolerance. We overcome the range ambiguity, in-herent to dense pulses (high PRF), by inter-pulse coding. Ideal range response (no ambiguity, no sidelobes) can be obtained, e. g., by using a binary periodic Ipatov sequence for inter-pulse coding. The periodic property is maintained {{as long as the}} number of transmitted periods exceeds the number of processed periods by at least two. 1...|$|R

50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are used to}} harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It {{is made up of}} a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the <b>long</b> <b>pulse</b> tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation.
