40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} breakup processes involved {{in the formation of}} a spray created by a liquid jet injected into a gaseous crossflow. This work is motivated by the utilization of this method to inject fuel in combustors and afterburners of airplane engines. This study aims to develop better understanding of the spray breakup processes and provide better experimental inputs to improve the fidelity of numerical models. This work adresses two key research areas: determining the time required for a liquid column to break up in the crossflow (i. e., primary breakup time) and the effect of injector geometry on spray properties. A new diagnostic technique, the <b>liquid</b> jet <b>light</b> <b>guiding</b> technique that utilizes ability of the liquid jet to act as a waveguide for laser light was developed to determine the location where the liquid column breaks up, in order to obtain the primary breakup time. This study found that the liquid jet Reynolds number was an important factor that governed the primary breakup time and improved the existing correlation. Optical diagnostic techniques such as Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer, <b>Liquid</b> Jet <b>Light</b> <b>Guiding</b> Technique, Particle Image Velocimetry and Imaging techniques were employed to measure the spray properties that include spray penetration, droplet sizes and velocities, velocity field {{on the surface of the}} liquid jet and the location of the primary breakup time. These properties were measured for two injectors: one with a sharp transition and the other with a smooth transition. It was found that the spray created by the injector with a sharp transition forms large irregular structures while one with smooth transition produces a smooth liquid jet. The spray transition creates a spray that penetrates deeper into the crossflow, breakup up earlier and produces larger droplets. Additionally, this study reports the phenomenon of the liquid jet splitting into two or more jets in sprays created by the injector with a smooth transition.

40|$|Different {{types of}} optical <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were {{constructed}} and tested to enable convenient multiple {{angle of incidence}} ellipsometry, on solid and liquid interfaces in <b>liquid</b> solutions. Two <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> are needed on an ellipsometer, one to <b>guide</b> the incoming <b>light</b> and one to <b>guide</b> the <b>light</b> that is reflected at the test surface, and therefore one <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> was mounted on the laser arm {{and one on the}} detector arm of the ellipsometer. With this arrangement the optical windows automatically adjust to always be perpendicular to the direction of the light independent of the angle of incidence. The purpose with these <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> is to facilitate the passage of light through the air/solution interface. A thorough theoretical and experimental analysis of optical errors introduced by such <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> is presented. This discussion includes the effect of multiple reflections between and within the windows of the light guides' On the basis of this analysis a new ellipsometry setup with <b>light</b> <b>guides,</b> consisting of glass tube's with glued end windows, was developed.

40|$|The {{placement}} of the fuel in combustors is significant for combustor design. Hence {{the study of the}} liquid penetration into a crossflow has received attention from various researchers. There have been various correlations suggested for the upper surface of the liquid jet trajectories suggested by several researchers. However, many of these correlations are applicable to specific operating conditions, injector geometries and measurement techniques. This study is an attempt to develop spray trajectory correlations that is applicable {{to a wide range of}} operating conditions and injector geometries. Previous studies have shown that the penetration of a spray created by round edged orifice is higher than that created by a sharp edged orifice. The approach is to develop trajectory correlations to the spray created by a round edged orifice that is expected to give the highest penetration. For the injectors of various other geometries, a correction factor is used to obtain the spray trajectories. Preliminary study has shown that the location of the column breakup point obtained by using the <b>liquid</b> jet <b>light</b> <b>guiding</b> technique could possibly be a part of the correction factor to the penetration of the spray. The trajectories of the jet and the location of the column breakup points are obtained for four different injectors at several operating conditions. These results are used for obtaining the correlation for the spray trajectory and the correction factor for the various injectors.

40|$|Background  The {{most widely}} used method for {{establishing}} the minimal erythema dose (MED) before narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy is time-consuming, inconvenient and may yield inconsistent results. Objectives  To assess the equivalence of MED assessment using a filtered xenon arc lamp UV source, a semiautomated MED tester, and a UV-opaque template method of MED determination with a panel of TL- 01 311 -nm UVB fluorescent tubes. Secondly, to gauge the current usage of MED testing, and the method used, in a large sample of U. K. phototherapy units. Thirdly, to assess variation in UV output of the semiautomated skin tester immediately after switching on to identify optimum warm-up time. Finally, to assess reproducibility of MED testing by assessing within-patient variability and interobserver variability of MED test results. Methods  Sixty-five patients about to undergo UVB phototherapy had their MED determined using three different methods. Within each patient we compared the values of MED determined by a semiautomated Durham MED tester, a panel of narrowband UVB lamps with a UV-opaque template constructed by a phototherapist, and a 310 -nm filtered xenon arc lamp with a <b>liquid</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> MED test results were assessed by clinical evaluation using a 6500 K colour temperature examination lamp. The output of the semiautomated MED tester was measured by spectroradiometer {{over a period of}} 20 min in order to identify the time to steady output. Reproducibility of MED testing with the semiautomated MED tester was carried out in 25 normal volunteers. All MEDs were assessed by at least two independent observers. A postal questionnaire was sent to 78 U. K. phototherapy units to assess routine practice concerning MED testing prior to narrowband UVB phototherapy. Results  The semiautomated MED tester showed consistency with the panel method (r = 0 · 92, panel MED = − 0 · 57 + 1 · 14 × Durham MED). The semiautomated MED tester produced a slightly lower MED result than the panel MED. Reproducibility tests showed high interobserver agreement (kappa value = 0 · 79), and high consistency for successive day testing (kappa value = 0 · 79).

40|$|Retinal {{degenerative}} {{diseases such}} as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration {{are one of the}} leading causes of blindness worldwide. Currently, there are a limited amount of treatment methods for these diseases. Therefore, many studies conducted in the field of vision research examine the functioning of the retina and try to find possible treatment methods for different retinal degenerative diseases. 	The most common way of studying the functioning of retinal cells is to record an electroretinogram (ERG). ERG is a light-evoked extracellular field potential that sums up the activity of retinal cells. Different wave components of ERG can be attributed to specific cell layers, thus enabling tracking of the origin of possible abnormalities in the ERG. ERG can be recorded both from humans and animals, and in vision research, mice and rats are popular animal models because of their genetic manipulations. Their retinas also correspond well with the human peripheral retina and their photoreceptors are quite similar to human photoreceptors. 	The retina is typically stimulated by light in vision research. The objective of this thesis is to construct a reliable light stimulation setup for retinal recordings of isolated mouse retinas. This thesis designs, constructs, and tests such stimulation setup. In the literature part of the thesis, the theory related to the functioning of the eye as well as the working principle of the ERG is discussed. In the research part, the stimulation setup is designed and constructed. As a result, the functioning of the setup is tested. 	The light source of the stimuli is a light-emitting diode (LED) that has a wavelength of 505 nm in order to cover the peak absorption wavelengths of the mouse retina. The LED {{has to be able to}} produce stimulus pulses with adjustable intensities, durations, forms, and frequencies. The LED is controlled via a stimulus generator and an LED controller. The light beam is guided from the LED to the retinal sample with a <b>liquid</b> <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> Furthermore, the light beam is homogenized and gathered with diffuser and condenser lenses and its intensity is decreased with neutral density filters. The recording of the ERG is done with a microelectrode array (MEA) that is placed inside a Faraday cage. The retinal sample is placed on the MEA plate and kept alive with continuous perfusion. 	The setup was tested in order to evaluate its functionality. The testing was done by calibrating the light output and by recording ERGs from isolated mouse retina. The light calibration results showed linear intensity behaviour and an ability to produce different waveforms. The ERG recordings showed typical waveforms. The setup met the requirements and it can therefore be regarded as successful...|$|E

This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed <b>light</b> <b>guides,</b> the number of counts and the optimum amplifier shaping time. Two different methods used to fabricate <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their light output, energy resolution, and the optimum shaping time. Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution.
