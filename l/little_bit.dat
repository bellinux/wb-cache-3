5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
5|$|Naem mo in {{northern}} Thailand may be fermented in a clay pot. Different regions of Thailand have different preferred flavors: northern and northeastern pork is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sour, central is sour, and southern is spicy.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} not {{promoted}} well, no radio singles were issued, {{and it did}} not chart. Despite no commercial and sales success, Soul Food Taqueria was mostly well received by music critics, who commended its diverse style, production quality, and viewed it as a progression for Guerrero from his 2000 album A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> of Somethin.|$|E

6000|$|Arter {{that dream}} about Bill, {{there was no}} keeping the cook in his place. He 'ad dreams pretty near every night, and talked <b>little</b> <b>bits</b> of 'em in his sleep. <b>Little</b> <b>bits</b> that you couldn't make head nor tail of, and when we asked 'im next morning he'd always shake his 'ead and say, [...] "Never mind." [...] Sometimes he'd mention a chap's name in 'is sleep and make 'im nervous for days.|$|R
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and turned left, every girl looked like Bettie Page. But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and adding that <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of Ronnie Spector.|$|E
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France. The revised points system would be kept in this form until 1911, only to be changed a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> in 1912 before being {{replaced}} by the time system in 1913. The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 to indicate the final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E

5|$|Then for {{the next}} week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What {{do you think about this}} bit?' We would talk a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed. Based on this, this system {{was classified as}} Tropical Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hilary. The system gradually accelerated to the northwest and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It became a depression on August 16, turned a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no death or damage.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{frustrating}} {{at first but}} eventually we {{found a way to}} communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, it was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> of Heaven, Priest, Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to be one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E

5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The concert {{tour was}} being {{discussed}} by executives {{as early as}} January2007. It was announced on August8,2007 via press release. It was confirmed that the tour would be promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It also featured American band and labelmates the Jonas Brothers as opening act. The tour would expand throughout North America, from October18,2007 in St. Louis, Missouri to January9,2008 in Albany, New York, {{with a total of}} fifty-four dates; fifty-three of which were in the United States and one which was in Canada. In October2007, another date was annexed in order to meet demand. In December2007, a fourteen-date extension of the tour was announced, with American duo Aly & A.J. opening seven of them; the opening act for the remaining dates was yet be announced. The extension featured new opening acts because the Jonas Brothers pulled out to record their then-forthcoming album A <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> Longer (2008). Subsequently, in the same month, one final date was annexed, and the American band Everlife was announced to as the final opening act. One dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer. In total, the Best of Both Worlds Tour raised over US $2million for the center.|$|E
5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
