40|$|This work {{applies the}} method of energy and exergy {{analysis}} over first step of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) production namely kerosene pre fraction plant, to determine unit energy and exergy performance and loss, besides of opportunities for improvement based on operational data. For this purpose macroscopic energy and exergy balance was developed over main equipment including electro pumps, heat exchangers, air coolers, and distillation columns. The results shows that total energy performance of plant is 92. 62 % by 19. 76  MW energy lost, while from exergy perspective, unit performance is 78. 08 % by 17. 92  MW exergy lost. Maximum local exergy lost occurs in the feed pre heater exchanger by 27 % performance {{which is designed to}} recover energy from top product of second column, furthermore results shows that upgrading <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> in air coolers based on heat pump concept would protect energy and exergy emission to the environment and reduce 40 % of total lost energy and 16 % of total lost exergy in plant...|$|E
40|$|Exergy is {{naturally}} {{related to the}} concept of quality of energy. Therefore, exergy analysis has been widely applied in parallel with energy analysis in order to find the most rational use of energy. Within the built environment a wide margin for exergy saving may be found. Actually, buildings require mostly <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> for thermal uses at low temperatures and nowadays their energy demand is mainly satisfied with high quality sources. Exergy analysis of renewable energy-based climatisation systems may be considered an emerging field, where different and often contrasting approaches are followed. Then, in this paper a comprehensive and critical view on the most recent studies on this topic is presented. Special attention is paid to the methodological aspects specifically related to climatisation systems and renewables, and to the comparison of the results. Main renewable energy-based heating and cooling systems are considered in detail. Finally, conclusions regarding {{the state of the art}} and possible trends on this field are derived, with the aim to highlight future research issues and promote further developments of this method. Furthermore, conclusions regarding the usability of the exergy method as a tool to promote a more efficient use of available energy sources are also derived...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} {{sector is}} responsible for a great share of the final energy demand and national CO 2 emissions in countries like Germany. Nowadays, low quality thermal energy demands in buildings are mainly satisfied with high-quality sources (e. g. natural gas fired in condensing boilers). Exergy analysis, pursuing a matching in the quality level of energy supplied and demanded, pinpoints the great necessity of substituting high-quality fossil fuels by other <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> flows, such as waste heat. In this paper a small district heating system in Kassel (Germany) is taken as a case study. Results from preliminary steady-state and dynamic energy and exergy analysis of the system are presented and strategies for improving the performance of waste-heat based district heating systems are derived. Results show that lowering supply temperatures from 95 to 57. 7 °C increases the final exergy efficiency of the systems from 32 % to 39. 3 %. Similarly, reducing return temperatures to the district heating network from 40. 8 to 37. 7 °C increases the exergy performance in 3. 7 %. In turn, the energy performance of all systems studied is nearly the same. This paper shows clearly the added value of exergy analysis for characterising and improving the performance of district heating systems...|$|E

The economy/environment interaction {{is a very}} complex interaction whose mechanisms of formation are difficult to even model and from which are expected major changes of the ecosystems in our globe. It is even more difficult to protect the environment in times of economic crises considering the behaviour of the essential element water in all these systems together with the air masses of the greenhouse gasses and toxic chemical gasses that determine climatic changes. Health effects, leading to diseases, like cancer, pulmonary and cardiac illnesses are produced from pollution of the environment due to the use also of dirty fuels.

40|$|IN A FINE {{introductory}} {{piece of}} deterministic chaos {{and its relationship}} to economic modelling that recently appeared in this journal, David Kelsey (1988, pp. 36 - 37) wrote that: Most of the [chaos] studies which have been carried out have had physical applications in mind [...] Most physical systems are dissipative, i. e, the system contains forces due to friction [...] Another possibility is that the principle of conservation of energy can be invoked to require that a [...] . system be conserva-tive [...] Economic systems cannot in general readily be classified as dissipative or conservative since there is no concept which corresponds to energy. The purpose of this note is to draw a distinction between the thermo-dynamic conception of a dissipative system and its formal, mathematical, definition and to argue that, in terms of the latter, economic systems can indeed be classified as dissipative. Following Mosekilde, Aracil and Allen (1980, p. 20), the thermodynamic conception of a dissipative dynamical system is one of a system that, over time, has its high quality energy transformed into <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> {{as a result of its}} interaction with some sort of resistance (e. g., friction). This is clearly the view of dissipative systems taken by Kelsey. In more general mathematical terms, however, a dissipative system is defined to be any dynamical system of equations whose divergence of flow is negative...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{membrane}} based {{technologies have}} {{attracted much attention}} thanks to their simplicity in reactor design. The concept proposed is to use mixed ionic-electronic conducting membrane (MIEC) in CO 2 reuse and syngas production by taking the advantage of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> resource. The membrane under investigation is a La 0, 9 Cao 01 FeO 3 - 6 (LCF) perovskite membrane. Membranes with perovskite structure have shown high oxygen permeability and 100 % oxygen selectivity. These membranes have also been demonstrated to produce H 2 by water splitting. During the reaction, H 2 is produced on the membrane feed side and the resultant oxygen is transported to the membrane sweep side, thus shifting the water splitting reaction towards hydrogen production. Under the same principle, CO {{is also likely to}} be produced from CO 2 dissociation in the membrane reactor. The produced H 2 can be further processed with CO 2 to yield hydrocarbon fuel. In this way, the usual products of combustion, H 20 and CO 2, can be reused by the membrane reactor. In this thesis, a literature review of the existing technologies of hydrogen production and CO 2 reduction is presented. The reviewed technologies are compared to our proposed method for water splitting and CO 2 reuse. A bench scale reactor was built to test the LCF membrane {{in order to understand the}} characteristics of the membrane. Tests are also done for the proposed water splitting reaction. The reactor design, experimental set-ups and experimental procedures are also presented in this thesis. The results of the experiments are analyzed and future work for improving the membrane reactor is proposed. by Le Chang. Thesis: S.

40|$|Monoethylene glycol (MEG) is {{commonly}} used for hydrate inhibition in fields that require continuous injection. Traditional processes for regeneration and reclamation of MEG require significant amounts of heat. Reclamation (salt removal) is usually done by complete evaporation of salty MEG in a flash separator under partial vacuum. Regeneration (water removal) is done by distillation. Heat integration in current processes is limited. The {{oil and gas industry}} is heading towards energy systems based on electricity from dedicated power plants or from the grid, in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to petroleum production. Current energy systems, at least offshore, are often based on gas turbines which produce electricity and drive large pumps and compressors. Heat is recovered from the exhaust gases, and sufficient supply of process heat is normally not a problem. However, in future scenarios, there may be little or no available source of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> to produce process heat. Hence, efficient utilization of energy becomes even more important than today. Three process layouts for MEG regeneration and reclamation processes with vapor recompression of the steam from the distillation column were simulated in HYSYS. The simulations were based on a typical feed flow rate of rich MEG for a recovery plant. A compressor raises the saturation temperature of the steam in order to allow it to condense in the process heat exchangers. Thus, the external heat demand of the process can be reduced. Another advantage of vapor recompression is reduced cooling requirements, since heat which is normally rejected, is used internally in the process. Increased complexity and capital costs are the major disadvantages. Exergy analyses were performed on the proposed process layout. The analyses showed that the net reduction in exergy consumption for slip-stream reclamation is too low to be of practical importance. However, up to 30 % reductions in exergy consumption were observed when then the steam is condensed in the reboiler of the water removal unit. The tradeoff between heat transfer area and steam saturation temperature is subject to further optimization. Future activities should focus on the technological challenges of steam compression at relatively high temperatures. An economical optimization of the compressor discharge pressure and different compressor solutions should also be considered in order to further evaluate the feasibility and profitability of vapor recompression in MEG recovery units. </p...|$|E

Two working fluids have been explored: helium in {{classical}} configurations and CO 2 in recompression layouts (Feher cycle). Typical recuperator arrangements in both cycles have been strongly constrained by low temperature {{of some of}} the energy thermal sources from the reactor. This limitation has been overcome in two ways: with a combined architecture and with dual cycles. Combined architecture couples the Brayton cycle with a Rankine one capable of taking advantage of the thermal energy content of the working fluid after exiting the turbine stage (iso-butane and steam fitted best the conditions of the He and CO 2 cycles, respectively). Dual cycles set a specific Rankine cycle to exploit the <b>lowest</b> <b>quality</b> thermal <b>energy</b> source, allowing usual recuperator arrangements in the Brayton cycle. The results of the analyses indicate that dual cycles could reach thermal efficiencies around 42. 8 % when using helium, whereas thermal performance might be even better (46. 7 %), if a combined CO 2 H 2 O cycle was set. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} energy storage strategies for short term Thermal Energy Storage in residential buildings with an air-source heat pump. Short term TES allows advanced integration of renewables because the associated mismatch between demand and availability is solved. The {{aim of the research}} was to develop control strategies which define a control sequence of heat pump operations with the purpose of minimization of primary energy input for space heating. This is achieved by more frequent utilization of free, <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> input. Exergy principles were used to assess the quality of energy. More free input will minimize the amount of work (high quality input) that is additionally required for the heat pump to generate the heating energy. In a conventional heat pump energy system, the installation is controlled without notion of exergetic optimal operation. This reference control strategy was compared to three optimization control strategies that were developed in this research, in combination with different storage capacities. The most advanced optimization strategy involves Greedy Optimal Control. This strategy defines optimal control of the installation based on estimates of future heat loads and future conditions for generation. First, a numerical MATLAB model was constructed in order to explore and compare the energetic potential of the strategies. This model showed that the optimization strategies result in significant primary energy saving when applied to large storage volumes that can only be realized within dwellings with latent TES. In latent TES, the high storage density during the phase change allows more compact storage. Secondly, the most potential storage configurations were translated into six use cases. The performance in terms of energy and exergy of these uses cases in combination with the most optimal control strategy was further simulated in a detailed TRNSYS model, and compared with the conventional control strategy. The aim of this model was to assess the influence of dynamic behavior of the heating emission system and temperature control on the performance of both strategies. It includes transient simulation of latent storage (macroencapsulated hydrated salt modules in a TES tank). This study has shown that the control strategy that optimizes operation and storage according to exergy principles, results in maximum 10 % reduction of primary energy consumption for space heating compared to the reference situation.

40|$|During {{the last}} several years there has been {{significant}} development in the energy situation. The present shortages and the resultant problems were not widely anticipated by the American public nor its elected leaders. Recognition of the current and possible future impacts of the energy shortage upon personal lifestyles and community structure is spreading, however, as individuals, businesses, and whole communities increasingly become directly affected by the present shortage. The results of ongoing public and private efforts to solve this shortage at the national and international levels will clearly be the primary determinants of how long the present shortage lasts, and of how severe it becomes. These efforts to a large extent have in the past primarily addressed the supply side of our energy problem. They have attempted to find ways to continue the flow of cheap energy that our society has been built on. Unfortunately, at this time it is impossible to predict with much reliability the actual outcome and the effects of these efforts. More recently, many people familiar with the energy situation have come to the realization that our energy problem does not lie exclusively on the supply side, but results also from the demand side. That is, present rates of growth of energy consumption can effectively hamper any efforts to solve the energy shortage from the supply side. The reasoning behind this is that the type and quantity of energy presently being demanded puts constraints on the ability of alternate energy systems to meet our energy needs. These constraints stem from the practice of using high quality energy to do tasks that only call for a <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> input, and from the need for these alternate energy systems to grow very quickly to keep up with increasing demand. In consideration of these issues, this paper will focus on one aspect of the demand for energy and the means of managing this demand so that supply efforts are less hampered. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to undertake any new research, but rather to take what is known, outline how it can be applied, and how the results can be presented in a form which is meaningful to decision makers. It is thought that the results of such a study could prove to be useful in providing one basis by which the reasonableness of public decision making is measured. As such it is meant to be an extension document: while the particular results are not thought to be generalizable to other Michigan communities, the process by which these results were formulated can be easily done in other settings.

40|$|The ambitious {{targets of}} the European Union in {{increasing}} the use of renewable energies to 20 % of Europe’s energy needs, call for urgent changes, including in the biomass sector. The share of solid biomass for heating purposes could be further increased by replacing oil- and gas-fired furnaces with biomass boilers and by expanding the spectrum of biomass raw materials for small-scale combustion systems. The interest in using non-woody biomass fuels for heat production has been increasing in Europe due to two main factors. First, the market for fossil fuels is unstable and their prices are continuously rising. Second, the increase competition for woody biomass between the heating sector and other industries, have increased the price of wood. As a result, the interest for alternative biomass fuels is growing rapidly, covering woody materials of <b>low</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>energy</b> crops and forest residues. The present work aims at investigating the technical feasibility of using non-woody biomass fuels in existing small-scale combustion appliances developed for burning wood. Therefore, combustion tests with different non-woody biomass fuels and in different combustion appliances were performed in standard laboratory conditions and in households under real life conditions (field tests). The laboratory tests were performed using eight different fuels (straw, Miscanthus, maize, vineyard pruning, hay, wheat bran and Sorghum) while in the field tests straw, Miscanthus and maize were burned. The gaseous and particle emissions, the slag tendency and {{the efficiency of the}} combustion systems operated with non-woody biomass fuels were analysed and when possible compared with the legal requirements defined in FPrEN 303 - 5. The limitations of the investigated combustion appliances when operated with non-woody biomass fuels were analysed and discussed. Non-woody biomass fuels could be used for heat production in existing combustion appliances as long as the systems are adapted for burning high ash content fuels. Among the investigated fuels, Miscanthus, vineyard pruning and hay could be burnt in most of the tested combustion appliances while fulfilling the legal European requirements (defined in FprEN 303 - 5) in terms of emissions and efficiency. The non-woody biomass fuels showed problems with ash accumulation and slag formation and could only be burned without unwanted shutdowns in combustion appliances adapted to manage high ash content fuels. Straw, wheat bran and maize were the most problematic fuels regarding slagging. The combustion appliances require appropriate technological developments to manage the strong variability in terms of chemical and thermal properties of the non-woody biomass fuels. The results of the laboratory tests were generally in agreement with the field test results.

40|$|Energy use in {{the world}} is {{continuously}} increasing. In the last 30 years the use of primary energy worldwide has more than doubled and it is mainly supplied with fossil fuels. A more efficient use of energy in the built environment has to be pursued if a more sustainable development is to be attained. The housing sector accounts for a major share of the energy use. Both in residential and commercial buildings, energy is mainly used for heating. Heat is energy with low quality. Traditional energy analysis methods, by failing to consider the energy quality, cannot give a holistic insight of the potential for reducing the energy used in the built environment. Exergy, instead, provides a tool to quantify the energy quality based on thermodynamic grounds. In this thesis a methodology based on both the reduction of the energy demand and exergy demand in buildings is proposed to mitigate the problems related to the energy use in buildings through a reduced and more efficient use of energy. The complex relations between building parameters to reduce the energy demand are managed with parametric analysis tools. The potential for energy demand reduction is investigated by means of screening analyses, local sensitivity analyses and global methods. A method for assessing the potential reduction of the energy demand in existing buildings and to evaluate the cost-efficiency of renovation measures based on the screening analysis is introduced and tested on two building typologies. In parallel, a program tool for parametric energy simulations, Consolis Parametric, has been developed on the core of an existing dynamic software, Consolis Energy +. Factorial analysis has been used to investigate the relations between the reduction of the energy demand and of the energy supply when ground source heat pumps are used for heating and cooling. Optimal configurations- dependent on the insulation of the building- of number of boreholes and spacing were identified for minimum electricity consumption. In the second part of this thesis exergy is used as tool for the definition of the efficient energy {{use in the}} built environment. The analysis of a multi-step heat pump to supply energy at two temperature levels, for space heating and domestic hot water production, exemplified how the reduction of the exergy loss can lead to a more efficient use of energy. The analysis was performed by means of SEPE, a modular software program developed in this work for exergy analysis in buildings. For the systematic reduction of the exergy losses in the built environment, an important prerequisite is the reduction of the exergy required by the building. Systems like floor heating and cooling, based on low difference emission temperature, are examples of low-exergy systems. Buildings with reduced need of exergy input increase the efficiency of systems like heat pumps and enhance the use of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy,</b> like waste heat and energy from low temperature renewable sources.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} potable water {{is on the}} rise. A recent market survey by the World Resources Institute shows a doubling in desalinated water production every ten years from both seawater and brackish water sources. The production of desalinated water is energy intensive, requiring approximately 3 - 6 kWh per cubic meter of produced desalted water. At current U. S. water use rates, 1 kW of energy capacity per capita (or 1000 MW for every one million people) {{would be required to}} meet water needs with desalted water. The choice of the desalination technology determines the form of energy required: electrical energy for reverse osmosis systems, relatively <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> thermal <b>energy</b> for distillation systems, and both electrical and thermal energy for hybrid systems such as pre-heat RO systems. Nuclear energy plants are attractive for large scale desalination application. Nuclear plants can provide both electrical and thermal energy in an integrated, co-generated fashion to produce a spectrum of energy products including electricity, desalted water, process heat, district heating, and potentially hydrogen generation. A particularly attractive option for nuclear desalination is to couple it with an advanced, modular, passively safe reactor design such as the International Reactor Innovative and Secure (IRIS) plant.

40|$|The main thesis {{examined}} in this research is that "the embedded energy of construction is much more significant than the operational energy for buildings in a tropical country such as Sri Lanka". All building elements (e. g. brickwall), materials (e. g. bricks) and "primitive" raw materials (e. g. clay) are placed in an aggregation-decomposition hierarchy. The process analysis carried out here basically captures most of the energy inputs associated with levels 1 and 2 in the IFIAS (1974) scheme, and accounts for around 90 % of the embedded energy in a product. These calculations are based on Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (TOE). The data required to estimate these embedded energies were collected from building materials manufacturers. A computerised database was implemented using a relational database management system. This {{can be used to}} represent and calculate the embedded energies and carbon coefficients of building materials and elements that are hierarchically arranged. It can also handle multiple sources of data and perform calculations to give the average, maximum and minimum embedded energies, which are also classified according to fuel type and process stage. Though the analysis was done assuming that the final building is located in the City of Colombo, these database values can be used, with some caution, for buildings even outside the Colombo City or District. The embedded energy requirements were also calculated {{on the basis of the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> (bio-equivalent energy), in addition to the more conventional basis of TOE. According to <b>energy</b> <b>quality</b> calculations carried out (based on efficiency considerations), 1 GJ of energy from electricity is equivalent to 5 GJ of biomass energy, 1 GJ of fossil fuel energy is equivalent to 1. 8 GJ of biomass energy and 1 GJ of electrical energy is equivalent to 2. 78 GJ of fossil fuel energy. It is seen that the price per unit of biomass energy based on the actual prices of products is around one third of the actual price per unit of biomass energy. For fossil fuel and electricity on the other hand, the actual prices of products are much higher than the actual prices of the energy sources used for their production. In order to minimise adverse energy effects and to give a beneficial effect to halting global warming, policy measures to promote timber products are desirable. It is also seen that though materials which use timber fuels (e. g. bricks and tiles) consume more energy, the use of timber fuels is more competitive when compared on a bio-equivalent unit basis. Furthermore, with respect to carbon emissions, wood fuels are considered to be self sustaining. The use of timber, whether as a construction material or a fuel, will require properly planned re-forestation strategies. The energy contribution from walls for a typical two storey house is from 10 - 44 %; for a single storey house it is from 29 - 49 %. The contribution from roofs for the two storey house is from 4 - 7 %, whereas it is 8 - 16 % for the single storey house. The contribution from windows is 0. 6 - 3 % for the single storey house and 0. 2 - 4. 5 % for the two storey. house. The contribution from the floor slab for the two storey house is 6 - 7 %. The above ranges are a result of the difference of the between the use of low and high energy materials. The ratio between total embedded energy and annual operational energy for the buildings selected lies between 14 to 35 for the houses while for an office building with air conditioning loading it is 5. Though air conditioning has a large contribution towards the annual operational energy of a building, the total number of air conditioned buildings are small for a developing country such as Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, the results of the analysis show that the focus of energy efficient designs for buildings with air conditioning has to be on the operational energy. On the other hand, for houses, which are largely not air conditioned, the way to promote efficiency is by reducing the embedded energy through the appropriate choice of building materials. This is borne out not only by the high ratio of construction to operational energy ratio obtained, but also by the fact that the ratios for houses with low energy materials is almost half those for the houses with high energy materials.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of various low-exergy system components and their {{integration into the}} energy system for buildings and small communities. The exergy content of {{a certain amount of}} energy is defined as the part of this energy {{that can be used to}} produce mechanical <b>energy.</b> The <b>quality</b> of a certain amount of energy is defined as the relative exergy content of this energy. Most of our buildings with their heating and cooling systems today are built for conversion of high <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> sources to <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> use with a huge destruction of the available exergy as a result. Globally we have a huge potential for transforming our processes to more efficient use of the exergy and also for feeding our processes directly from renewable energy sources without the use of high <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> sources. To develop our building concepts towards a low exergy building we have to analyze all the processes for energy conversion that take place through the operation of the building, to bring down the needed level of <b>quality</b> for the <b>energy</b> used and then make a holistic analysis of the system. Different processes for energy conversion in buildings are discussed especially giving the potential for saving energy and shifting the energy use to lower quality levels, i. e. in many cases to reduce the temperature levels needed for heating and cooling. The major obstacle for an extensive and effective use of renewabl...|$|R
40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>quality</b> {{information}} such as spam and rumors is a nuisance to people and hinders them from consuming information that is pertinent to them or that they are looking for. As social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google+ have become important communication platforms in people's daily lives, malicious users make them as major targets to pollute with <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information, which we also call as Denial of Information (DoI) attacks. How to analyze and detect <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information in social networks for preventing DoI attacks is the major research problem I will address in this dissertation. Although individual social networks are capable of filtering {{a significant amount of}} <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information they receive, they usually require large amounts of resources (e. g, personnel) and incur a delay before detecting new types of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information. Also the evolution of various <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information posts lots of challenges to defensive techniques. My work contains three major parts: 1). analytics and detection framework of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information, 2). evolutionary study of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information, and 3). detection approaches of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information. In part I, I proposed social spam analytics and detection framework SPADE across multiple social networks showing the efficiency and flexibility of cross-domain classification and associative classification. In part II, I performed a large-scale evolutionary study on web page spam and email spam {{over a long period of}} time. In part III, I designed three detection approaches used in detecting <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information in social networks: click traffic analysis of short URL spam, behavior analysis of URL spam and information diffusion analysis of rumors in social networks. Our study shows promising results in analyzing and detecting <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> information in social networks. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of quality pricing and {{international}} trade. Our model is based on Musa and Rosen (1978). Firms sell goods of heterogeneous quality to consumers that di¤er in their willingness to pay for quality. In equilibrium, the market power of a given …rm depends on the prices and qualities of its closest competitors more than on prices of further away …rms. Mark-ups therefore depend mostly on market conditions {{in the vicinity of}} a …rm’s quality. We test the static and dynamic predictions of this simple model in the European car market. In this speci…c market, <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> cars {{are more likely to be}} exported than high quality cars. Competition abroad is stronger for <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> cars, leading to low export prices in the <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> segment. We also …nd that exchange rate pass-through is larger for <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> cars, as a large fraction of the competitors of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> exporters are other <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> exporters that face the same exchange rate shocks...|$|R
40|$|Exergy {{represents}} the useful energy {{and it is}} interpreted as available work. <b>Quality</b> in <b>energy</b> conversion can be quantified through exergetic analysis based on the Second Principle of Thermodynamics (SPT). The design of energy systems is important in such way that the <b>energy</b> <b>quality</b> of an end-use is matched {{as much as possible}} to the energy supply, avoiding situations where a high quality supply is used for a <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> purpose. The extension of the efficiency criterion to include the SPT would result in fundamental changes in the way electric energy systems are designed and operated. The optimisation of a constraint space-heating system was investigated. This paper analyses the application of the SPT in the planning of electric energy systems case studies including exergetic efficiency achievement with economic considerations...|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} for the concrete industry to find adequate methods of using <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> aggregate, because the quality of aggregate has become lower and recently {{it is not easy to}} obtain proper aggregate for concrete. In this experiment, it is examined whether <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> aggregate can be effectively used by the following two methods. One method is to adjust mix proportion of concrete in order to cover the defect of using <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> aggregate. In another method, good quality aggregate is mixed with <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> aggregate in order to improve the average characteristics of aggregate. Although the problem is not solved completely by these methods, there seems to be the possibility of using the <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> aggregate by properly adapting these methods according to the required properties of concrete...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} cointegration and {{the difference}} in the extent of price transmission, and speed of adjustment between global and domestic prices of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice. Unit root tests, cointegration tests and error correction models are employed in the analysis. While there are no comparable studies in the literature, {{the findings of this study}} indicate that the dynamics of price transmission may be different between high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice markets. That is, the extent of price transmission appears to be larger for the global prices of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice whereas the speed of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium may be faster for domestic prices of high quality rice. Moreover, a shock in the global prices of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice may have a long-lasting effect on domestic prices of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice as compared to their high quality counterparts affecting domestic prices of high quality rice...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines cointegration {{and dynamics}} of price transmission among domestic {{as well as}} domestic & global and domestic & major supplier’s markets of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice; and compares the magnitude of price transmission and speed of adjustment between the high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice markets. Unit root tests, the consistent momentum threshold autoregressive (M–TAR) models and vector error correction models (symmetric and asymmetric) are employed in this study. The {{results showed that the}} provincial markets of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice are cointegrated with their respective market of Kabul, exception being Kandahar and Maimana markets of <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice. They are also cointegrated with their corresponding Pakistani and global markets. Evidence of short– and long–run asymmetric adjustment among the provincial markets of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice with respect to their corresponding Kabul, Pakistani and global markets indicates the presence of persistent and temporary inefficiencies in the rice markets. The short– and long–run speed of adjustment coefficients are relatively larger for high than <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice markets, implying efficient and/or remunerative spatial arbitrage in the high quality rice markets. Conversely, the elasticity of price transmission is relatively greater for the majority of <b>low</b> than high <b>quality</b> rice markets pairs. A random shock in Kabul, Pakistani and global markets of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice affect their respective provincial markets in varying degrees. In a nutshell, the dynamics of price transmission may be different between the pairs of high and <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> rice markets. This paper illuminates the dynamics of spatial price transmission among the segmented rice markets and emphasizes the need for improving the functioning of rice markets in the country using an integrated approach...|$|R
50|$|Donor methods: view <b>energy</b> <b>quality</b> as {{a measure}} of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into {{sustaining}} a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p. 3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, <b>energy</b> <b>quality</b> is upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded <b>energy</b> <b>quality</b> has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of <b>energy</b> <b>quality.</b> Donor methods attempt to understand the usefulness of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher <b>quality</b> <b>energy</b> controls lower <b>quality</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|R

30|$|A second {{possible}} explanation is that a 2 -level fuzzy input variable is not sufficiently descriptive to give adequate treatment to one or more rules.

However, with only two labels for the fuzzy input variables, a not-weak presence in <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> solutions is not distinguishable from a strong presence in <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> solutions.|$|R
