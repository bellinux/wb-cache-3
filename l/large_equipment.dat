Around 99% of the structural work and almost 50% of the cabling work had been completed by June 2010. Almost all of the <b>large</b> <b>equipment,</b> including engines and diesel generators, was installed.

25|$|The first {{practical}} {{design for}} hovercraft {{was derived from}} a British invention in the 1950s to 1960s. They are now used throughout the world as specialised transports in disaster relief, coastguard, military and survey applications, {{as well as for}} sport or passenger service. Very large versions have been used to transport hundreds of people and vehicles across the English Channel, whilst others have military applications used to transport tanks, soldiers and <b>large</b> <b>equipment</b> in hostile environments and terrain.|$|E
25|$|By {{this point}} Dee had begun efforts {{to mount the}} system to its {{intended}} platform, the Bristol Beaufighter. Hodgkin {{was put in charge}} of getting Bristol to provide an example with the radome fit, but he found that the engineer in charge of the workshop was reluctant to do so. High-level pressure from Dee and others followed, and X7579 was quickly adapted, arriving at Christchurch in September 1941. At the time the Mk. VII consisted {{of a large number of}} fairly <b>large</b> <b>equipment</b> boxes that were entirely unsuitable for production use, and Hodgkin expressed his surprise at how well the work progressed in spite of this. The aircraft was ready for testing on 2 October.|$|E
500|$|Divided for the {{majority}} of its length, traffic volumes on Highway63 south of the Highway881 junction near Fort McMurray remain relatively light despite the high number of fatal crashes. [...] The volume is comparable to major two-lane highways in Alberta such as Highways 2A, 8, 22, 28, and 39. [...] All are in the vicinity of 10,000 vehicles per day or more in rural areas, generally double the average of Highway63. [...] While Alberta has plans to twin at least a portion of most of these highways, no project has reached the construction stage nor been expedited like Highway63. [...] Until 2013, traffic levels had steadily increased on Highway63, and an increasing number of trucks carrying <b>large</b> <b>equipment</b> caused traffic delays. They often are wide enough to occupy two traffic lanes, impeding traffic in both directions. The highway is the only route leading south out of Fort McMurray until its split with Highway881, making it a critical link to Fort McMurray and the Athabasca oil sands. [...] The economic importance of the area, the number of slow moving vehicles, and the absence of alternate routes are not generally reflected in annual traffic numbers, but were factors in the decision to expedite twinning of the highway.|$|E

30|$|As {{the demand}} for coal {{increased}} and surface mining became more prevalent, new techniques and <b>larger</b> <b>equipment</b> were developed to remove greater amounts of overburden (the rock materials overlying coal seams), producing more earthen material requiring replacement, reclamation, and revegetation.|$|R

2500|$|Queen Victoria of England was a {{favorite}} of Henry Rogers, and the new town was named in her honor. Victoria was {{the midpoint of the}} VGN's Norfolk Division, which extended from Sewell's Point to Roanoke. Designated to be a [...] "division point" [...] on the railroad (specifically a location for crew changes and servicing of the steam locomotives), Victoria became the location of a <b>large</b> <b>equipment</b> maintenance operation with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, and a large yard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{machine shop}} is a two-story structure, [...] long and [...] wide, made of coursed mine rock with a hipped gable roof covered in {{corrugated}} sheet metal. A clerestory window admits {{light to the}} interior, which is floored in concrete. [...] The original machine shop was designed around 1882 by Erasmus D. Leavitt Jr., a consulting engineer with Calumet & Hecla; {{it was used to}} repair <b>large</b> <b>equipment,</b> including mining skips and trams. [...] A major reconstruction was performed in 1907, and additions were made in 1911; {{it is likely that the}} building in its current form dates entirely from these two years.|$|E

2500|$|Debris {{from past}} human {{occupation}} is {{scattered throughout the}} island and in offshore waters. Most is from the U.S. military occupation of the island from 1942 to 1946. The most noticeable remnant is the [...] airstrip. It is completely overgrown with vegetation and is unusable. In the northeast section, apparently the main camp area, are the remains of several buildings and heavy equipment. Five wooden antenna poles about [...] in height remain standing in the camp. Debris from several crashed airplanes and <b>large</b> <b>equipment</b> such as bulldozers is scattered around the island. Numerous bulldozer excavations containing the remnants of metal, fuel and water drums are scattered about the north central portion and northern edge of the island. The Navy reported the loss of 11 landing craft in the surf during World War II.|$|E
