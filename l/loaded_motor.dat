40|$|There {{are many}} {{industrial}} activities and work situations where heavy, but delicate {{pieces of equipment}} must be either handled, manipulated or placed into limited inlet spaces. Yet the accuracy of gross <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> performance and the levels of physical stress induced had not been methodically researched and was therefore investigated in this set of studies. Initially, the levels of truncal stress during the placement and removal of loads to and from a pigeonhole matrix were determined, which showed that truncal stresses were lower when handling {{to and from the}} central area of the matrix and increased significantly when handling loads to and from those boxes around the periphery. The variations in performance as well as truncal stress when handling to and from a pigeonhole matrix were examined in the next section of the work. The results confirmed the previous findings regarding truncal stress variation dependent upon position in the matrix, and also showed that there were significantly fewer placement contact errors in, the central area of the matrix than at the periphery. The placement of the load to the areas of the matrix which resulting in high truncal stress were observed to require the subject to adopt postures which involved shoulder rotation and/or lateral flexion, whilst only changes in truncal inclination and lumbar angle were made when placing loads to the lower stress areas. The effect of reducing inlet clearance between the load and the target box was found to reduce the level of performance, increase task duration, increase overall truncal stress, increase the post task heart rate and reduce both the peak and mean acceleration and the peak and mean force applied to the load. An inlet clearance of 10 cms was found be to critical for task performance. As the load size increased, the level of performance decreased even though the load weight was constant.

This model {{is closely related to}} the membrane-embedded F$_ 0 $ motor of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which converts the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons into mechanical motion of the rotor. It is shown that the Coulomb coupling between the negative charge of the empty rotor site and the positive stator charge, located near the periplasmic proton-conducting channel (proton source), plays a dominant role in the torque-generating process. When approaching the source outlet, the rotor site has a proton energy level higher than the energy level of the site, located near the cytoplasmic channel (proton drain). In the first stage of this torque-generating process, the energy of the electrochemical potential is converted into potential energy of the proton-binding sites on the rotor. Afterwards, the tangential component of the Coulomb force produces a mechanical torque. We demonstrate that, at low temperatures, the <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> works in the shuttling regime where the energy of the electrochemical potential is consumed without producing any unidirectional rotation. The motor switches to the torque-generating regime at high temperatures, when the Brownian ratchet mechanism turns on.

40|$|Although {{controversy}} still remains, isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty recently {{gained in}} popularity {{as a treatment}} option for patellofemoral osteoarthritis. It has compared to total knee arthroplasty the advantage of preserving the tibiofemoral articulation, which in theory would allow the preservation of natural tibiofemoral kinematics. Today, however, no data exist to support this assumption. This study was therefore performed in order to investigate the effect of isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty on the native three-dimensional tibiofemoral kinematic behaviour and whether a change in patellar thickness would have an influence. Six fresh-frozen cadavers were fixed on a custom-made mechanical knee rig. Full 3 D kinematics was analysed during passive flexion-extension cycles, open chain extension, with and without mechanical resistance, as well as deep knee squats, using infrared motion capture cameras and retroflective markers. Measurements were taken for the native knee and after prosthetic trochlear resurfacing with and without patellar resurfacing in three different patellar thicknesses. Compared to the natural knee, patellofemoral arthroplasty resulted in significant changes in tibiofemoral kinematics, which were most pronounced in the most <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> tasks. Increased internal tibial rotation was noted in the mid- and high flexion ranges, reaching at 120 A degrees of flexion a mean difference of 4. 5 A degrees A A +/- A 4. 3 A degrees (p < 0. 0001) during squat motion, over the whole flexion range during open chain motion and in deeper flexion beyond 50 A degrees (mean at 70 A degrees, 1. 9 A degrees A A +/- A 3. 7 A degrees) during resisted open chain. During squats, also, a more posterior translation of the lateral femoral condyle was observed. The effect was accentuated in case of patella overstuffing, whereas kinematics was closer to normal with patellar thinning. Isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty alters natural tibiofemoral kinematics, and the effects become more pronounced in case of increased patellar thickness. Therefore, it might be recommended to aim for a slight over-resection of patellar bone if sufficient bone stock is available...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work {{is to develop a}} tool for condition monitoring of squirrel-cage motors using axial magnetic flux measurements, and to design a diagnostics system for electrical motors. The basic theory of the measurements and systems was found through literature reviews and was further developed from the experimental results of {{this research}} work. Fluxgate magnetometers and Hall effect sensors are not reliable enough for condition monitoring purposes, but measurements by flux coil sensors can reach adequate reliability. The useful frequency area of the flux coil sensor is from about 0. 2 Hz to 15 kHz, an area is well applicable for condition monitoring of squirrel-cage motors. Output voltage is frequency dependent, increasing towards higher frequencies. Sufficient sensitivity is usually reached by a flux coil sensor having a diameter of about 30 cm and the number of turns of about 200. Sensitivity can be improved by increasing the diameter or number of turns of the coil. The sensor should be placed axially centred {{on the end of the}} motor, and measurements should be made with the <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> in steady operation. Output voltage is typically from the microvolt to millivolt level, however, installation inside the motor can increase it from tens of millivolts to some volts. The dynamic resolution requirement of measurement is about 70 dB and the highest line resolution needed for the spectrum analysis is about 3200 lines. Time base signal can be used to study rapid disturbances of flux caused by mechanical loading or switching of the frequency converter. Various motor failures cause specific variation to the frequency distribution of flux, so spectrum analysis is well applicable for condition monitoring. Reference measurement of each motor is required because stator winding factors, installation tolerances, operating conditions and mechanical load affect leakage flux. A broken rotor bar failure can be detected from the amplitude difference between the supply frequency and its rotor bar induced sideband. A broken rotor end ring failure can be detected by the amplitude difference between the slip frequency and the supply frequency. However, it was found that the stator current spectrum is a more reliable method of detecting both these rotor failures. The supply voltage asymmetry can also be evaluated by specific sidebands of axial flux. Turn to turn failure of the stator winding was most reliably detected by sidebands around the rotor slot pass frequencies. Equations for frequency converter supplied motors are the bases for similar equations, but the supply frequency is replaced by the output current frequency of the converter. The developed diagnostics system design for condition monitoring of ac motors includes stator current, flux coil, temperature, vibration, partial discharge, bearing current and voltage measurements. At the system diagnosis stage these measurable signals are divided to time base and frequency base signals and for each of them a fault indicator is determined. For flux coil measurements four fault indicators were found: rotor bar failure ratio, rotor end ring failure ratio, stator winding turn to turn ratio and supply voltage asymmetry operation ratio. With these failure indicators we determine failure location, state and cause. From this information a lifetime prediction of the motor is made. The results of this work are used to analyse flux coil measurements of squirrel-cage motors. In addition the research has led to a special application to monitor electric motors using an on-line condition monitoring system for paper machines and power plants...|$|E

BelgiumAvailable grant support : noDoctoral School Programme : noStarting date : 1 / 05 / 2007 Public defence date : 16 / 09 / 2013 BackgroundAs an orthopaedic surgeon with a long clinical experience, I am grateful {{to have the opportunity}} to conduct reversed translational research: from bed to bench and back. During my work as a doctoral student, I was able to investigate existing clinical problems by bringing them back to the experimental laboratory, trying to find solutions which might be subsequently useful in the daily orthopaedic practice. The reasoning developed after observing results in patients and studying the literature is described below. This has evolved from assessing new designs and surgical techniques to more basic investigations evaluating the behaviour of the soft tissue envelope in the native and the replaced knee. Total knee arthroplasty has become one of the most frequently performed orthopaedic interventions which is nowadays generally accepted as an excellent treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. Based on the existing literature, outcome studies of total knee arthroplasty are good to excellent, and these results are reasonably durable over time. Current implant survival rates vary between 90 % and 95 % at 10 to 21 years follow-up. Despite these satisfactory results, however, it has also become clear that full restoration of normal knee function is rarely achieved with the currently available implants and surgical techniques. A well-known clinical problem is persisting post-operative pain and disability after a well performed TKA. Overall, 10 % to 20 % of patients are not happy with the function and pain relief they attain following knee replacement. Pain and instability or stiffness after TKA are of course multifactorial and the possibility remains that some of these knees had technical problems that have gone undiagnosed! The cause is unclear, but one of the leading theories is subtle degrees of malalignment. Therefore, advances in knee arthroplasty should be focused nowadays towards optimizing functionality through better and more accurate surgical techniques rather than improved implant designs. This is also the philosophy behind my work. Chapter 1 : Introduction The research question is: Can we improve outcome after TKA?I. Focussing on Alignment. 1. How can a surgeon enhance his alignment accuracy?Since design doesnt seem to be the only important factor, we turned our attention to surgical technique. Surgical technique in TKA can be aimed at the correction of alignment and/or the balancing of the soft tissues in the replaced knee. A majority of the orthopaedic surgeons believe that the use of anatomical (bony) landmarks is necessary to reconstruct a TKA close to the mechanical axis of the lower limb. Deviations from the desired 0 &# 176; mechanical axis might reduce the functional results post-operatively. A rather dogmatic window of 3 &# 176; varus/valgus is widely accepted. On the other hand, we are aware that the human eye is capable to distinguish only 3 &# 176; or more of deviation. [Delport et al., in preparation]. Therefore the orthopaedic industry has introduced more sophisticated instruments and systems to reduce outliers and improve results. For instance, navigation and robotics have been used for some time, but have proved to be very time consuming and expensive. Although they tend to decrease the range in post-operative alignment, improvements in functional results are not always obtained. 2. First results with Patient Specific Instruments. More recently, patient specific surgical guides were introduced to increase surgical accuracy. Many preliminary reports show promising reports. We conclude that this novel technique hereby described has major benefits: less operative time, less instruments and proper implant positioning, but more prospective studies are mandatory [Delport et al. Arch Clin Exp Surg. 2013; 2 (1). ]However, the use of all these new techniques still assumes implicitly that correction of the mechanical axis of the lower limb during TKA to within 3 &# 176; of the neutral axis is optimal. Recent literature however pointed out that the relationship between mechanical axis and survival is weak! Post-operative mechanical axis 0 &# 176; +/- 3 &# 176; did not improve 15 year implant survival rate. II. Soft Tissue Envelope 1. The {{importance of the}} soft tissues. Although it may appear natural to view the ligaments of the knee joint mainly as mechanical and structural joint stabilizers, an abundant body of evidence indicates that they have a sensory role. a. The neurosensory properties of the collateral ligaments. The loaded activities of the patient after a TKA will interfere with the neurosensory properties of the ligaments if the isometric nature of these ligaments is not reproduced. The collateral ligaments of the knee joint are equipped with rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors, which are very sensitive to small changes in the ligament load. b. The pattern of ligament tension in MCL and LCL. The pattern of ligament tension in naturally occurring situations is very complex. The passive behaviour and the response of the MCL and LCL to varus and valgus stresses are been described. 2. New possible pathways in improving patient satisfaction after TKA. Aspects of current management: New possible pathways in improving outcome and patient satisfaction after TKA. were described and published recently. Chapter II: Is a TKA with Rotating Platform performing better? I. Introduction: aims, hypothesis and methodology. Several innovations in implant design have been introduced. One of these is the concept of Posterior Stabilised Rotating Platform designs, which in theory could mimic the natural behaviour of the knee better, improving functionality, durability and long-term implant survival compared to the existing designs. We have been able to participate in the development of a particular design: Performance PS-Rotating Platform (Biomet). The hypothesis is that this specific design (PS-RP) leads to better results biomechanically (mainly kinematically) and clinically. II. Studies:Study 1 :We analysed the in vivo functionality of this implant with a kinematic study using video-fluoroscopy. We investigated 31 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement with a similar prosthetic design but with three different options: fixed-bearing posterior cruciate ligament-retaining, fixed-bearing posterior-stabilised and mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised. To do this we used a three-dimensional to two-dimensional model registration technique. Both the fixed- and mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised configurations used the same femoral component. We found that fixed-bearing posterior stabilised and mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised knee replacements demonstrated similar kinematic patterns, with consistent femoral roll-back during flexion. Mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised knee replacements demonstrated greater and more natural internal rotation of the tibia during flexion than fixed-bearing posterior-stabilised designs. Such rotation occurred at the interface between the insert and tibial tray for mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised designs. However, for fixed-bearing posterior-stabilised designs, rotation occurred at the proximal surface of the bearing. We conclude that mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised knee replacements reproduce internal rotation of the tibia more closely during flexion than fixed-bearing posterior-stabilised designs. Furthermore, mobile-bearing posterior-stabilised knee replacements demonstrate a unidirectional movement which occurs at the upper and lower sides of the mobile insert. The femur moves in an anteroposterior direction on the upper surface of theinsert, whereas the movement at the lower surface is pure rotation. Such unidirectional movement may lead to less wear when compared with the multidirectional movement seen in fixed-bearing posterior-stabilised knee replacements, and should be associated with more evenly applied cam-post stresses. This first part of the doctoral thesis is published [Delport et al. ]. Other relevant kinematic publications are referenced and discussed. Study 2 :Since the kinematic study pointed to the fact that less wear was to be expected, we measured the component wear in this specific type of implant. The aim of our in vitro study was to investigate wear of a polyethylene (PE) tibial insert on a rotating platform as compared to the same insert fixed to the tibial baseplate and articulating with a similar femoral component. All tests were performed at Endolab Laboratories, Rosenheim, Germany using a knee joint simulator following ISO 14243 - 1 (load control). Three specific configurations were tested and compared to a loaded soak control: (1) the rotating platform using machined polyethylene (PE), (2) fixed bearing using machined PE, (3) fixed bearing using compression moulded PE. The total wear rates found for all systems tested were low. The mean wear rate was 1. 40 mg per million cycles for the molded fixed bearing, 4. 07 mg per million cycles for the machined fixed bearing type and 0. 82 mg per million cycles for the machined rotating platform bearing type. We conclude that the TKA system we tested (Performance®, Biomet, Warsaw, IND, USA) demonstrated very low gravimetric wear. The wear rate of the same implant in the fixed mode compared to the rotating platform mode was four times higher (p 1100 TKA. This group of replaced knees was primarily constituted of Performance TKA. Approximately 600 CR implants were available to compare to 500 PS knees. This latter group consist of 250 PS fixed and 250 PS-RP knees. Our analysis of the results in this large cohort of patients revealed no difference in outcome. However this study is not a randomized controlled trial, but rather a retrospective investigation by the single surgeon using a single implant in three different versions [Delport et al., The Open Orthopaedics Journal]. Nevertheless, many other publications also concluded that the use of a Rotating Platform does not lead to improved clinical success. III. Discussion [...] Chapter III: Experimental setup of the soft tissue envelope analysis in the human knee joint before and after TKA. I. Introduction. We became convinced that if we are trying to improve the post-operative function it is useful to look at the behaviour of the native knee and try to copy this in the replaced knee. This work is a continuation of the fundamental research line of the Orthopaedic Department, and the Department of Biomechanics of the University Hospitals Pellenberg Leuven, into the field of clinical and fundamental research on orthopaedic implant technology. This part of the doctoral work was conducted in cooperation with the European Center for Knee Research (Smith & Nephew, Haasrode, Belgium). With the idea in mind that ligament strains in the native knee should be similar to those after TKA, we intended to measure the medial and the lateral collateral ligament strain before and after TKA. We believe that ligamentous strains after TKA should be similar or close to the native situation to prevent patient discomfort and improve function. We also think that it is only possible to closely reproduce the kinematics of a normal knee in a TKA if the ligaments remain isometric. Due to differences in material properties and surface geometry, however we realise that reconstruction of native laxity using contemporary TKA remains difficult. II. Aims. The aim of this project is to determine how collateral ligament strains compare before and after TKA using a measured resection technique with specimen specific cutting blocks. III. Hypothesis. 1. Length changes of the medial and lateral collateral ligament will be smaller than 5 % when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during laxity testing. 2. 1. Length changes of the medial and lateral collateral ligament will be smaller than 5 % when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during several motor tasks. 3. Insertion of a knee prosthesis aiming at neutral alignment will alter ligament strains, knee mechanics and kinematics during several motor tasks more than when implanted in constitutional alignment. 4. It is possible to determine a safe zone for frontal plane TKA alignment in relation to the constitutional alignment axis in which ligament strains are almost physiological (average strain deviations less than 5 %). IV. Methodology of the ex vivo experiment. An in vitro cadaver test (6 specimens) - Using extensometers (MTS) - Using a navigation system (Vicon) - Using pressure measurements (Tekscan). The work was performed using fresh frozen cadaver specimens. Trackers with reflecting spheres were mounted on the tibia, femur and patella of the frozen specimen. A spiral CT scan was performed to determine the spatial relation of the surface anatomy of the knee and reference insertions of ligaments to the tracking spheres. This was done using commercially available segmentation software. V. Materials: Part I, II, III and IV. We prepared the ligaments using the MCL technique of LaPrade and the LCL technique of Espregueira and sutured the extensometers. For the laxity test we measured the strain in the collateral ligaments directly with extensometers to quantify ligament laxity. We also measured the strain in the collateral ligaments directly with extensometers simulating three motor tasks: passive  open chain - squat. Then we implanted a Genesis II PS fixed bearing in neutral position (0 &# 176;) using Patient Specific Guides (Visionaire, Smith & Nephew). Same tests were repeated for both settings. In 7 the relation between post-operative alignment and ligament strain was evaluated by introducing different alignment conditions. VI. Methodological sequence. Chapter IV: The Laxity test. Collateral ligament strains during knee joint laxity evaluation before and after TKA. This study enables a very precise measurement of varus and valgus laxity as compared to clinical assessment. The biomechanics of the ligaments in the replaced knee are significantly different from those in the native knee. In the native knee, strain increases with flexion in the MCL, while the LCL relaxes in flexion. The differences are very subtle, never exceeding more than 2 - 3 mm (in terms of changes in length) or 2 - 3 &# 176; (in terms of tibial tilting); thus, they could potentially go unnoticed, even by an experienced surgeon. After insertion of a TKA, strain decreases in the MCL during flexion while increasing minimally in the LCL. However, since we tried to preserve the ligaments that act isometrically, it might be appropriate to aim for a laxity that is within the range of the native knee. We concluded that the range of varus-valgus laxity in extension and flexion as measured passively in cadaver specimens are small and near-isometric. Further investigation is necessary to determine if the laxity data from this study after implantation of a contemporary PS-TKA can inform the surgeon regarding what to aim for in positioning the implant with respect to the mechanical axis. Chapter V: Relation between post-operative alignment and ligament strain. Restoration of constitutional alignment in TKA leads to more physiological strains in the collateral ligaments. The MCL and the LCL showed minimal changes in length when measured directly by extensometers in the native knee during 3 motor tasks (passive motion  open chain  squat). With our technique using extensometers directly on the ligaments we measured strains of less than 2 % confirming our first hypothesis. Several published data, including the excellent doctoral thesis of Jan Victor, although using other techniques, concluded to similar figures. The LCL showed the same pattern of strains less than 2 % until 80 &# 176; of flexion. Thereafter the LCL demonstrated gradually more laxity. Insertion of a total knee led to minimal differences compared to the native knee on the medial side (MCL), at least during passive and open chain motions with differences in strain of less than ± 2 % over the flexion range = isometric. The lateral ligament(LCL) showed quite different behavior. This ligament is stretched by an extra 6 % compared to the native situation during open chain. This means that hypothesis 2 is also confirmed. Insertion of a TKA will alter kinematics and lateral ligament strains in the unloaded situation. In the loaded test however, after insertion of a total knee and during squatting, the MCL showed 9 % extra strain. The LCL relaxes more during squatting after TKA reaching almost 6 % less strain at 120 &# 176; compared to the native situation. We have also showed that during passive motion knee behaviour is more determined by the soft tissue envelope than during <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> tasks where the geometry of the articular surface becomes more important. To investigate Hypothesis 2 and 3, we evaluated the influence of surgical malposition with the same set of tests. As suggested in the literature we also believe that surgical malposition of a TKP (even minor) has an influence on the strain in both medial and lateral collateral ligaments. (see graphs). We observed clear differences in collateral ligament strains using the inserts, mimicking malalignment. In the varus malposition, the LCL is more strained and in the valgus malposition the MCL is more under strain compared to the neutral situation. This means that 5 &# 176; of deviation gives rise to high strains in the opposite ligament. Varus and valgus malalignment leads to strain deviations close to or larger than 5 %. Strain deviations were typically higher for less-loaded motor tasks and less high for the highly-loaded motor task (squat). Although data presented are averages for the six specimens, the conclusions remained valid for each specimen separately. We have proved that strain deviations (for both ligaments taken together) are always minimal for the TKA configurations closest to constitutional alignment. Varus and valgus inserts systematically lead to strain deviations, which are higher, while absolute neutral alignment also shows relatively low strain deviations, albeit higher than in constitutional alignment. All this is consistently true for all motor tasks. Since the extensometers were capable of detecting strain with an accuracy of 1. 0 %, we believe that our measurements are comparable with the natural behavior of the mechanoreceptors in the human knee soft tissue envelope. Type I Ruffini receptors have a very low threshold and high sensitivity, driven by very small tensile stresses (around 15 kPa = 112 mm Hg, to compare atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg). Our second hypothesis was also confirmed. Fitting a quadratic trend-line to the data shows good matching for the <b>loaded</b> <b>motor</b> tasks and a less good fit for passive motion. The minimum of the parabolic curves is always situated close to constitutional alignment (indicated with the dashed line in figure below). Using these data,we are able to calculate this safe zone around the neutral axis as well as around the constitutional axis. This proved our third hypothesis. If the surgeon aims for a minimal strain deviation of 4 %, he should determine the final leg alignment after TKA maximal 4 &# 176; varus o...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{save the}} test {{energy of the}} {{electric}} drive vehicle, an electric vehicle drive dynamic testing system, with energy recovery is proposed. The electric vehicle DC/AC power drive can be regulated by a speed control mode and a torque control mode in a three-phase electric vehicle induction motor. The three-phase electric vehicle induction motor is directly coupled with a three-phase <b>load</b> induction <b>motor</b> through a coupler. The load of the DC/AC power drive is also regulated by the torque control mode and the speed control mode to drive the three-phase <b>load</b> induction <b>motor.</b> The three-phase <b>load</b> induction <b>motor</b> is operated in the regenerative braking mode, and the regenerative energy of the <b>load</b> induction <b>motor</b> can {{be transferred to the}} utility system by a power regenerative DC/AC inverter that feedbacks the energy to the utility system with a unit power factor.

40|$|The In this paper, a {{simulator}} of a one-wheel Electric Vehicle {{system is}} designed for testing an anti-slip controller using the Motor-Generator sys-tem. The drive motor of the M-G system is used to simulate the drive wheel of the Electric Vehicle, and the <b>load</b> <b>motor</b> is used to simulate the load force of the chassis. In the driving process, the torque of the <b>load</b> <b>motor</b> is changed according to the drive force of the chassis that is calculated by the program. So it can simulate the dynamic process of the tire-road system. Based on this simulator system, an anti-slip controller based on an Adhesion Status Analyzer is proposed. Information about the wheel speed is acquired by using a Back EMF Observer. A load torque disturbance observer is de-signed to stabilize the acceleration of the wheels. The Adhesion Status Analyzer is used to generate safe acceleration commands for the anti-slip controller. When a slip occurs, the anti-slip controller will decrease the torque quickly, {{and at the same}} time, by estimating the dynamic status of adhesion, the Adhesion Status Analyzer will restrain the acceleration com-mand within a safe area. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is veri-fied by using the EV slip simulator...|$|R
