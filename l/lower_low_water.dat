Wind damage was quite significant across South Carolina, particularly the city of Beaufort, South Carolina, with many downed trees, telephone poles, and streetlights.

These species differ in their position along the microtopographical gradient and in their geographical distribution. Height increment, subcapitulum bulk density, biomass production, capitulum water content and cumulative evaporation were measured. Height increment and biomass production of S. magellanicum was <b>lower</b> at <b>low</b> <b>water</b> table than at high water table, whereas height increment and biomass production of S. rubellum, S. imbricatum and S. fuscum were unaffected. Height increment of S. magellanicum, S. rubellum and S. imbricatum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature. Biomass production of only S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was higher at high temperature than at low temperature, corresponding with their more southern distribution. Cumulative evaporation of S. magellanicum and S. rubellum was <b>lower</b> at <b>low</b> <b>water</b> table and {{could be explained by}} hampered water transport towards the capitula.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} the performance of two palm species under semi-arid conditions during the rainy and dry periods: the semi-arid native Syagrus coronata and a native to tropical America, Acrocomia aculeata. The leaf water potential, gas exchange, leaf soluble sugars, starch, free amino acids, total soluble protein content and morphological traits were measured. The highest leaf water potential and CO 2 assimilation values in both species were achieved during the rainy period. In response to the low soil moisture content during the dry period, gas exchange decreased 72 and 92 % in S. coronata and A. aculeata, respectively, when compared with values from rainy period. As evergreen plants, both species maintained intact leaf photosynthetic pigment contents during the rainy and dry periods. Other important traits for drought tolerance are larger adaxial surface hypoderm and cuticle found in both species with higher stomatal density on the abaxial leaf surface.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{tropical}} zone, small watersheds {{are affected by}} intense meteorological events. These events {{play an important role}} in the erosion of soils and therefore on the sources of organic carbon in small tropical rivers. We studied the geochemistry of two soils on Basse-Terre Island (French West Indies, FWI) : ferralitic soil and Andosol. The two studied soils are very similar in terms of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil solution parameters. The total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents vary between 1. 7 and 92 g kg‐ 1 and between 0. 1 and 5. 5 g kg‐ 1, respectively, with the highest concentrations observed in the topsoil. The C/N ratios are relatively constant throughout the soil profiles (ca. 12). The carbon isotopic composition of SOM varies between ‐ 27. 3 ‰ and ‐ 22. 7 ‰ and presents an enrichment with increasing depth of soil profiles. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in soil solutions, varying from 3. 2 to 91. 3 mg L‐ 1, are similar for the both extraction used in lab (with milliQ water and Ca(NO 3) 2) but are higher than those measured in soil solutions sampled from lysimeters (0. 65 – 1. 46 mg L‐ 1). The isotopic compositions of DOC obtained by extractions and SOM are comparable, with δ 13 C values ranging from ‐ 28. 6 ‰ to ‐ 25. 8 ‰. The DOC sampled from lysimeters is systematically depleted in 13 C compared to DOC obtained by extractions, with δ 13 C values of ‐ 33. 8 ‰ to ‐ 30. 6 ‰. The enrichment of δ 13 C of SOM through the soil profiles is either consistent with the carbon isotopic fractionation of SOM by decomposing organisms, or the differential mineralization of both labile and stable carbon stocks in soils. DOC concentrations in stream waters vary between 0. 46 and 5. 75 mg L‐ 1, and are generally <b>lower</b> during <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level than floods. The isotopic compositions of DOC in the rivers range from ‐ 38. 9 ‰ to ‐ 27. 2 ‰, with δ 13 C values, which are more depleted in 13 C during <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level than flood events. The δ 13 CDOC of water river samples and soil solutions obtained by extraction and collected with lysimeters demonstrates that the DOC in rivers derives essentially from both the lixiviation of the soil surface layers during floods and groundwater flow during <b>low</b> <b>water</b> levels. Lixiviation of soil surface layers can be boosted by significant increases of intensity and duration of meteorological events and can strongly favor the release of surface soil organic matter in rivers and the impoverishment in nutrients of soil surface layers...|$|R

Wadi El-Rayan, as Ramsar site, is a very important wetland, in Egypt, as a reservoir for agricultural drainage water, fisheries and tourism. The Lakes are man-made basins in the Fayoum depression. Wadi El-Rayan Lakes are two reservoirs (upper Lake and Lower Lake), at different elevations. The Upper Lake is classified as open basin, while the Lower Lake is a closed basin, with no significant obvious water outflow.
