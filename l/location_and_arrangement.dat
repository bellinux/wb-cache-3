40|$|Organisms are {{required}} to perceive, process and remember a wealth of visual information from the environment to guide behaviour during spatial navigation. However, our knowledge is limited regarding how the brain encodes and reconstructs in memory, spatial and non-spatial properties of objects in scenes. For example, how are object <b>locations,</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> identities encoded and represented across core scene-selective regions? How does {{the identity of a}} focal entity influence memory for the spatial extent of a scene? This thesis used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural approaches across 4 independent experiments to investigate these themes. Empirical Chapters 1 and 2 employed fMRI repetition suppression (RS) to examine how activation across scene-selective regions differed in response to spatial (object <b>Locations</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arrangements)</b> <b>and</b> non-spatial (object Identities) conditions. Results revealed no effect of RS in any ROI, considered to reflect the type of task used (inversion detection). The second fMRI experiment employed a novel task, where participants responded to multiple changes between scenes. Results showed a significant effect of RS in two regions, but no dissociable effects between conditions. In two behavioural chapters, we extended these themes by using boundary extension (BE),to investigate whether memory for the spatial extent of a scene is influenced by the type of entity (object/person). Results revealed that BE was observed in both experiments for objects in scenes (in line with previous research), but not for people in scenes. Further analyses demonstrated that this effect might reflect the increase in attention assigned to people compared to objects, possibly to predict their future actions/behaviours. Together, this body of research provides insight into the mechanisms that drive RS during scene encoding, and identifies that possible differences in saliency associated with people and objects may mediate how the spatial extent of a scene is encoded and subsequently remembered...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} time of interactive systems is decreasing rapidly while {{the stress of}} competition rises. Due to this fact the use of tools for usability evaluation is getting increasing attention. Simultaneously, the quantity of standards and guidelines which have to be regarded rises {{as well as the}} errors by their manual application. A couple of tools for automatic guideline review exist which only focus on the evaluation of <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangement</b> of GUI objects (within the scope of the GUI design). Just a few tools consider the used terms (information design – wording) whereas no tool exists which is able to evaluate the use of operating controls referring to the conformity with user expectations (interaction design). In this thesis a concept for the automatic criteria oriented usability evaluation of all design areas (GUI design, wording, interaction design) by verifying the guideline conformity is developed. This concept is realised in the tool Reviser (Rapid EValuation of Interactive Systems using ExpeRt knowledge). Reviser is designed as an expert system which enables the dialog based specification of criteria in terms of rules. Designated areas of application are menu based interactive systems like cell phones or driver information systems. For the evaluation of the GUI design numerous metrics for measuring the colouring, <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangement</b> of GUI objects are implemented. Furthermore the consistency of the GUI as a predictor for user satisfaction and strain is quantified. For the evaluation of the wording a comparison of used terms with a given ontology will be performed. The ontology represents the semantic relations of terms of menu based systems and has to be determined empirically. The static evaluation of the interaction design based on a formal system specification is not possible. Hence an autonomous agent is used for the first time, which is able to operate on an interactive system using a-priori knowledge. For demonstration of the tools’ ability, two driver information systems (Audi MMI, BMW iDrive) are evaluated. The systems differ in the type of user controls, the menu construction and the information presentation. Reviser was able to identify different errors of the system designs and generates numerous suggestions and remarks for the improvement of both designs. Additionally, an empirical evaluation validates almost all of the results automatically generated by Reviser. This shows that Reviser is the first tool, which has the ability to perform an automatic criteria orientated usability evaluation of interactive systems covering all design areas...|$|E
40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that valves are absent in veins smaller than two millimetres in diameter. Consequently, current investigations on the pathophysiology of chronic venous disease (CVD) consider and evaluate only the valvular competence of large veins. The authors review literature {{from their own}} collections {{as well as from}} medical database searches to assess the functional relevance of these valves. Microscopic venous valves (MVVs) were first described in 1934 in the human digits and have subsequently been demonstrated {{in other parts of the}} human body as well as in many tissues and organs of animals.

The huge body of knowledge available concerning MVVs urges us to correct textbooks of anatomy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selectivity}} of the lipid–protein {{interactions in}} trypsinised Na,K-ATPase membranes from Squalus acanthias {{has been determined}} by using EPR spectroscopy with different lipid probes spin-labelled on the 14 -C atom of the fatty acid chain. From measurements at low ionic strength and different pH values, the pattern of selectivity is: (stearic acid) −>(phosphatidylserine) −>(stearic acid) 0 >(phosphatidylcholine) ±, where superscripts indicate the formal electrostatic charge on the lipid headgroup. This {{is in the same}} order as that determined with native Na,K-ATPase membranes [M. Esmann, D. Marsh, Biochemistry 24 (1985) 3572 – 3578]. The selectivity for phosphatidylserine is independent of pH, over the range pH 6. 0 – 9. 0, as found also for native membranes. For membranes trypsinised in the presence of Rb+ ions, and in the presence of Na+ (which allows more extensive proteolysis), the relative association constants, Kr, of all lipids are the same as for control membranes, with the exception of ionised (stearic acid) − that shows the highest specificity. Therefore, both the stoichiometry and the principal determinants of the specificity of lipid–protein interaction are preserved on extensive trypsinisation of Na,K-ATPase membranes. This has implications for the <b>location</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangement</b> of those amino acid side chains that determine the lipid selectivity of the native Na,K-ATPase...|$|E

40|$|Various {{financial}} instruments {{are being used}} to increase the uptake of photovoltaic (PV) systems. One argument for doing so is that PV systems have a particularly good capacity to reduce summer peak loads. The actual extent to which PV systems are able to do so, however, cannot be determined precisely without either installing PV systems and measuring their impacts, or undertaking modelling using meteorological and electricity load data. Although the latter approach has the advantages of being low cost, quick to implement and the ability to assess the impacts of different amounts of PV installed at various locations across a grid, it can also be problematic as solar radiation data and electricity load data tend to be recorded using different time measurement systems. Solar radiation data from three locations on the electricity grid in Western Australia were used in conjunction with historic electricity load data to model the impacts of various PV penetrations, <b>locations</b> <b>and</b> <b>arrangements</b> of PV systems.
