40|$|This paper {{presents}} detailed {{results of}} a series of pullout tests on cogged deformed reinforcing bars embedded in concrete filled steel tubes. To evaluate confinement effects on anchorage performance, tests were carried out on steel tubes with different diameter to thickness ratios. Both hoop strains and longitudinal strains in the tubes were measured, together with applied load and slip. Various lead-in <b>lengths</b> <b>before</b> the <b>bend</b> and <b>length</b> of tailed extension after the bend were examined. Pullout tests were conducted with both monotonic and cyclic loading. All of the tested specimens failed by bar fracture outside the steel tubes. Although the provided development length is less than the required value in AS 3600, adequate anchorage capacity was achieved. In addition, a spring stiffness model had been developed to theoretically simulate the pullout tests. Reasonable agreement between the experimental and analytical results was obtained. The test results provide valuable information on the anchorage mechanism of cogged deformed bars inserted in concrete filled steel tubes...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on steel moment-resisting connection between steel beams and concrete filled steel tubes {{has shown that}} there are considerable advantages to be obtained by anchoring the connection to the concrete infill within the tube using anchors in blind bolts. In the research reported here, extensive experimental tests and numerical analyses have been performed to study the anchorage behaviour of cogged deformed reinforcing bars within concrete filled circular steel tubes. This data in essential knowledge {{for the design of}} the steel connections that use anchored blind bolts, both for strength and stiffness. A series of pull-out tests were conducted using steel tubes with different diameter to thickness ratios under monotonic and cyclic loading. Both hoop strains and longitudinal strains in the tubes were measured together with applied load and slip. Various lead-in <b>lengths</b> <b>before</b> the <b>bend</b> and <b>length</b> of tailed extension after the bend were examined. These dimensions were limited by the dimensions of the steel tube and did not meet the requirements for "standard" cogs as specified in concrete standards such as AS 3600 and ACI 318. Nevertheless, all of the tested specimens failed by bar fracture outside the steel tubes. A comprehensive 3 D Finite Element model was developed to simulate the pull-out tests. The FE model took into account material nonlinearities, deformations in reinforcing bars and interactions between different surfaces. The FE results were found to be in good agreement with experimental results. This model was then used to conduct parametric studies to investigate the influence of the confinement provided by the steel tube on the infilled concrete...|$|R
