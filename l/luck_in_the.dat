5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good <b>luck</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there.

To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E
