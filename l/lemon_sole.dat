40|$|Flatfishes {{have been}} the subject of {{scientific}} research since the beginning of the 19 th century but information on the specific habitat requirement of the adult life stages is largely anecdotal. Detailed knowledge of flatfish habitats however is a precondition for a more ecosystem orientated approach to fisheries management. Here the association between benthic habitat and the adult life stage of three flatfish species plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea) and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) was investigated in the English Channel. Data from groundfish surveys spanning a period of 9 years was used to identify three distinct site groups: sites where a species occurred in consistently high abundances, sites of variable or low abundance and sites at which none were caught. Following the supposition of habitat selection theories such as the ideal free distribution theory these three sites groups should represent a gradient in habitat suitability from highly suitable to less suitable and unsuitable respectively. Habitat parameters and features for the three site groups and species were described and analysed. In particular sediment type and the importance of structuring epifauna for adult flatfish was investigated. Overall plaice and sole showed very similar trends for abiotic environmental parameters such as depth, temperature, salinity and tidal currents. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sole</b> was found over distinctly different habitats which may indicate a stronger niche partitioning of this species. Sediment associations differed between the three species with plaice predominantly occurring over sandy substrates with little mud and gravel content, while sole was found over a wider range of muddy to sandy substrates. <b>Lemon</b> <b>sole</b> was predominantly found over sand however containing a higher percentage of gravel than plaice. Structuring emergent epifauna was related positively to plaice and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> abundances. These structures might be important as they tend to harbour larger numbers of epibenthic species upon which adult plaice and <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> prey. No such trend was found for the tactile feeding sole which mainly forages on infaunal polychaetes and molluscs...|$|E
40|$|The age, growth, {{maturity}} and population dynamics of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt), captured off {{the west coast}} of Ireland (ICES division Vllb), were determined for the period November 2000 to February 2002. The maximum age recorded was 14 years. Males of the population were dominated by 4 year olds, while females were dominated by 5 year olds. Females dominated the sex ratio in the overall sample, each month sampled, at each age and from 22 cm in total length onwards (when N > 20). Possible reasons for the dominance of females in the sex ratio are discussed. Three models were used to obtain the parameters of the von Bertalanfly growth equation. These were the Ford-Walford plot (Beverton and Holt 1957), the Gulland and Holt plot (1959) and the Rafail (1973) method. Results of the fitted von Bertalanffy growth curves showed that female <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> o f f {{the west coast of}} Ireland grew faster than males and attained a greater size. Male and female <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> mature from 2 years of age onwards. There is evidence in the population o f a smaller asymptotic length (L«, = 34. 47 cm), faster growth rate (K = 0. 1955) and younger age at first maturity, all of which are indicative o f a decrease in population size, when present results are compared to data collected in the same area 22 years earlier. Results of the yield per recruit curve indicate that <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> are currently being over-fished o f f the west coast of Ireland.

Although of considerable economic importance to fisheries in South-west Britain, {{little research has been}} undertaken into the demographic characteristics and stock structure of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> (Microstomus kitt) on the South-west European continental shelf, and they are not considered to be of sufficient economic value Europe-wide to wan-ant annual assessment. This study investigates whether populations of <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> in ICES. (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) Divisions Vlla;e;f;g & h should be viewed as discrete stocks for assessment and management purposes by examining various life history parameters and population characteristics from samples collected during research surveys from 1992 to 2001. Clear differences were found in the recruitment process (length and age based) and length frequency distributions in catches from north (Vlla;f;g) and south (Vlle;h) of the Cornish Peninsula. Temporal changes in L 1 and a crude maturity analysis support this north/south divide. Sex ratios are similar in Vlla and f, but markedly different to the ratio's observed in Vllg and e. Mean length at age analysis was inconclusive, probably as a result of limited data. It is proposed that, in the absence of further research, <b>lemon</b> <b>sole</b> populations in Vlle&h and Vllf&g exhibit sufficient similarities to be considered as two gross management and assessment units. From a practical perspective, however, current data availability will preclude useful stock assessments and reduce the potential for management options for all areas except Vlle.
