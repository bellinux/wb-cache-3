In a sense, <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> {{can be considered a}} generalization of array types. If the components of a layer are of a class type, the identifiers of component fields and methods can be lifted to the <b>layer</b> <b>type</b> level such that the lifted identifiers can be used to access all respective layer fields or layer methods by dot notation. This facilitates usual programming tasks. In addition, by employing predefined layer methods based on flags, functions, and relations over indices, <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> open up the way for a flexible and concise modeling of networks of communicating objects...|$|R

As a preliminary work on the topic, the simplest algorithm of PIA(1, 1) is employed in the calculations. Linear and nonlinear problems are solved to outline the basic ideas of the new solution technique. The inner and outer solutions are determined with the iteration algorithm and matched to construct a composite expansion valid within {{all parts of the}} domain. The solutions are contrasted with the available exact or numerical solutions. It is shown that the perturbation–iteration algorithm can be effectively used for solving boundary <b>layer</b> <b>type</b> problems.|$|R
40|$|Hydration of the < 1 μm size {{fraction}} of SWy- 1 source clay (low-charge montmorillonite) was studied by modeling of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded under controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions on Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Ca-, and Sr saturated specimens. The quantitative description of smectite hydration, {{based on the}} relative proportions of different <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> derived from the fitting of experimental XRD patterns, was consistent with previous reports of smectite hydration. However, the coexistence of smectite <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> exhibiting contrasting hydration states was systematically observed, and heterogeneity rather than homogeneity {{seems to be the}} rule for smectite hydration. This heterogeneity can be characterized qualitatively using the standard deviation of the departure from rationality of the 00 l reflection series (ξ), which is systematically larger than 0. 4 A when the prevailing <b>layer</b> <b>type</b> accounts for ~ 70 % or less of the total layers (~ 25 of XRD patterns examined). In addition, hydration heterogeneities are not randomly distributed within smectite crystallites, and models describing these complex structures involve two distinct contributions, each containing different <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> that are randomly interstratifed. As a result, the different <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> are partially segregated in the sample. However, these two contributions do not imply the actual presence of two populations of particles in the sample. XRD profile modeling has allowed also the refinement of structural parameters, such as the location of interlayer species and the layer thickness corresponding to the different <b>layer</b> <b>types,</b> for all interlayer cations and RH values. From the observed dependence of the latter parameter on the cation ionic potential (r/v, v = cation valency and r = ionic radius) and on RH, the following equations were derived: 36 37 Layer thickness (1 W) = 12. 556 + 0. 3525 × (r/v - 0. 241) × (v × RH - 0. 979) Layer thickness (2 W) = 15. 592 + 0. 6472 × (38 r/v - 0. 839) × (v × RH - 1. 412) which allow the quantification of the increase of layer thickness with increasing RH for both 1 W (one-water) and 2 W (two-water) layers. In addition for 2 W layers interlayer H 2 O molecules are probably distributed as a unique plane {{on each side of the}} central interlayer cation. This plane of H 2 O molecules is located at ~ 1. 20 A from the central interlayer cation along the c* axis...|$|R

40|$|At present, {{designing}} convolutional {{neural network}} (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified {{from a handful of}} existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using Q-learning with an ϵ-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex <b>layer</b> <b>types.</b> We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks...|$|R

30|$|The {{boundary}} conditions equation (10) {{associated with the}} ordinary nonlinear differential equations of the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>type</b> is of the two-point asymptotic class. Two-point {{boundary conditions}} have values of the dependent variable specified at two different values of the independent variable. Specification of an asymptotic boundary condition implies the value of velocity approaches to unity {{and the value of}} temperature approaches to zero as the outer specified value of the independent variable is approached. The method of numerically integrating two-point asymptotic boundary value problem of the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>type,</b> the initial value method, requires that the problem be recast as an initial value problem. Thus it is necessary to set up as many boundary conditions at the surface as there are at infinity. The governing differential equations are then integrated with these assumed surface boundary conditions. If the required outer boundary condition is satisfied, a solution has been achieved.|$|R

It supports the consistent handling of different map <b>layer</b> <b>types</b> (point, line, area, raster, chart, etc.) and multiple visual variables.

40|$|Abstract [...] Saponites and vermiculites {{may assume}} at least 11 ordered or semi-ordered layer {{stacking}} sequences. For a given relative humidity, the <b>layer</b> stacking <b>type</b> assumed {{is a function}} of the nature of the interlayer cation, the layer charge density, the mean size of the particles, and the di- or trioctahedral character of the sheets. For each interlayer cation, a succession of <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> can be observed as relative humidity increases. For high relative humidity, some particular <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> exist, but only for low-charge minerals. No other differences have been found for saponites and vermiculites in each successive <b>layer</b> stacking <b>type.</b> The degree of order that these <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> imply is probably due to the existence of electrostatic bonds between hydrated interlayer cations and surface oxygens of the substituted tetrahedra. For octahedrally substituted 2 : 1 phyllosilicates, however, the disorder of the layer stacking sequences is related to a highly delocalized istribution ofnegative charges on the surface oxygens of the layers. A study of the superstructures detected in saponites and vermiculites indicates that he interlayer cations tend to be located as far as possible from one another. The superstructures exist only with some cations and some <b>layer</b> stacking <b>types</b> and if the layer charge density is compatible with the charge produced by the cation distribution i this kind of superstructure.
