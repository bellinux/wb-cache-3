It is possible that Java cattle have specific gene character that is not found in other kind of cattle in Indonesia. The objective {{of this study was}} to obtain data of the gene tipology through the analysis of blood protein variability by electrophoretic method. Blood used as the sample originated from 30 heads of Java cattle at Brebes Regency, Central Java, in which those were taken purposively. Variables observed were blood protein variability, that were albumin (Alb), transferrin (Tf), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and post transferrin (Ptf). Banding protein obtained was used for calculating the values <b>of</b> gene <b>frequency</b> and average <b>of</b> the heterozygosity. The results showed that: (1) At albumin (Alb) <b>locus,</b> gene <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> allele B, A and C was 0. 634; 0. 183; and 0. 183, respectively; (2) At transferrin (Tf) <b>locus,</b> gene <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> allele D 3, D 1 and D 2 was 0. 533; 0. 15; and 0. 317, respectively; (3) At ceruloplasmin (Cp) <b>locus,</b> gene <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> allele F and S was 0. 563 and 0. 467; (4) At post transferrin (Ptf) <b>locus,</b> gene <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> allele S and F was 0. 8 and 0. 2.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} was aimed at testing the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> word <b>frequency</b> effects in {{spelling}} to dictation: Are they located {{at the level of}} spoken word recognition (Chua & Rickard Liow, 2014) or {{at the level of the}} orthographic output lexicon (Delattre, Bonin, & Barry, 2006) ? Words that varied on objective word frequency and on phonological neighborhood density were orally presented to adults who had to write them down. Following the additive factors logic (Sternberg, 1969, 2001), if word frequency in spelling to dictation influences a processing level, that is, the orthographic output level, different from that influenced by phonological neighborhood density, that is, spoken word recognition, the impact of the 2 factors should be additive. In contrast, their influence should be overadditive if they act at the same processing level in spelling to dictation, namely the spoken word recognition level. We found that both factors had a reliable influence on the spelling latencies but did not interact.

40|$|The {{issue of}} what kind <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> affects {{compound}} word (e. g., ‘‘butterfly’’) production has recently received special attention {{in the context of}} distinguishing two major types of speech production mod-els. The frequency effect is widely assumed to originate from the lex-ical system (Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994), and one model (IN, Caramazza, 1997) predicts that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the compound words themselves (‘‘butterfly’’) determines naming performance and another model (WEAVER++, Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999) predicts the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the constituents (/butter / and /fly/) are the effective fre-quency. Such predictions are deduced from the following combina-tions of assumptions of the two models. WEAVER++ assumes that compounds are decomposed into its constituents at a lexeme level where phonological (or orthographic) forms are represented, and this is also the level at which frequency effect locates. IN assumes that a compound is represented by one node (‘‘butterfly’’) in its only lexical layer, which is also the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frequency</b> effect.

40|$|Phonological {{variation}} and phonological opacity have been extensively studied independently of each other. This paper examines two phonological processes that simultaneously exhibit both phenomena: Assibilation and Apocope in Finnish. The evidence converges on two main conclusions. First, variation {{results from the}} presence of MULTIPLE METRICAL SYSTEMS within Finnish. Assibilation and Apocope are metrically conditioned alternations and the segmental variation reflects metrical variation. The metrical analysis explains a number of apparently unrelated phenomena, including typological asymmetries across dialects, quantitative asymmetries within dialects, differences between nouns and verbs, differences among noun classes, and the <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> lexical <b>frequency</b> effects. Second, phonological opacity arises from MORPHOLOGICAL LEVEL ORDERING. By interleaving transparent phonologies with independently motivated morphosyntactic constituents (stems, words, phrases) we derive the transparent and opaque interactions of four phonological processes, including Assibilation and Apocope...|$|R

In Experiment 1, a referent picture (e. g., {{the picture of a}} bench) was presented along with three pictures, two of which had names that shared the same initial phonemes as the name of the referent (e. g., bed and bell). Participants were more likely to fixate the picture with the higher frequency name (bed) than the picture with the lower frequency name (bell). In Experiment 2, referent pictures were presented with three unrelated distractors. Fixation latencies to referents with high-frequency names were shorter than those to referents with low-frequency names. The proportion of fixations to the referents and distractors were analyzed in 33 -ms time slices to provide fine-grained information about the time course <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> effects. These analyses established that frequency affects the earliest moments of lexical access and rule out a late-acting, decision-bias locus for frequency. Simulations using models in which frequency operates on resting-activation levels, on connection strengths, and as a postactivation decision bias provided further constraints on the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> effects. © 2001 Academic Press Key Words: lexical frequency; spoken-word recognition; eye tracking.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{establishes}} an electrophysiological index of lexical access in speech production by exploring the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frequency</b> and cognate effects during overt naming. We conducted 2 event-related potential (ERP) studies with 16 Spanish [...] Catalan bilinguals performing a picture naming task in Spanish (L 1) and 16 Catalan [...] Spanish bilinguals performing a picture naming task in Spanish (L 2). Behavioral results showed a clear frequency effect and {{an interaction between}} frequency and cognate status. The ERP elicited during the production of high-frequency words diverged from the low-frequency ERP between 150 and 200 ms post-target presentation and kept diverging until voice onset. The same results were obtained when comparing cognate and noncognate con-ditions. Positive correlations were observed between naming latencies and mean amplitude of the P 2 component following the divergence, for both the lexical frequency and the cognate effects. We conclude that lexical access during picture naming begins approximately 180 ms after picture presentation. Furthermore, these results offer direct electrophysiological evidence for an early influence <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> and cognate status in speech production.

40|$|In 7 {{experiments}} {{the authors}} investigated the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> word <b>frequency</b> effects in speech production. Experiment 1 demonstrated a frequency effect in picture naming that was robust over repetitions. Experiments 2, 3, and 7 excluded contributions from object identification and initiation of articulation. Experiments 4 and 5 investigated whether the effect arises in accessing the syntactic word (lemma) {{by using a}} grammatical gender decision task. Although a frequency effect was found, it dissipated under repeated access to a word's gender. Experiment 6 tested whether the robust frequency effect arises in accessing the phonological form (lexeme) by having Ss translate words that produced homophones. Low-frequent homophones behaved like high-frequent controls, inheriting the accessing speed of their high-frequent homophone twins. Because homophones share the lexeme, not the lemma, this suggests a lexeme-level origin of the robust effect. The word frequency effect in speech production was discovered by Oldfield and Wingfield (1965).

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, I investigated the interactions in a gene family of additive selection and biased gene conversion in a finite population when conversion events are rare.

I {{suggest that it is}} not unreasonable for gene families to experience threshold fitness functions, and show that certain types of thresholds can greatly constrain the rate at which advantageous alleles are fixed as compared to other fitness schemes, such as additive selection. It is also shown that the double sampling process operating on a gene family in a finite population (sampling over the number of genes in the gene family and over the number of individuals in the population) can have interesting consequences. For selectively neutral alleles that experience interallelic bias, the probability of fixation at each single locus may be essentially neutral, but the cumulative effects on the entire gene family of small departures from neutrality can be significant, especially if the gene family is large. Thus, in some situations, gene families can respond to directional forces that are weak in comparison to drift at single loci...|$|R

The critical finding is that the N 170 amplitude was sensitive to case mixing, but the P 3 amplitude was sensitive to word frequency and lexicality.

We also report that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large normal alleles (> 22 CAG repeats) at the SCA 2 lo-cus is 0. 038 while at the SCA 6 <b>locus</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> large normal alleles (> 13 repeats) is 0. 032. We discussed our data {{in light of the}} distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in the Japanese and white popula-tions...|$|R
40|$|Background Previous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the role of individuals’ personal characteristics in diabetes management and used the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control theory to assess adherence to a diabetes management regimen. These studies have emphasized that having internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control may be a protective factor in diabetes management. Objective The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the predictor effect <b>of</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control on self-care activities and A 1 c level. Method The study is descriptive and relational. Researchers used a Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale and a <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control Scale to collect data. The study sample consisted of 129 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Results The average score <b>of</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control of individuals with diabetes was 10. 26, and the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> self-care activities in the past week was 2. 9 days. A weak but statistically significant negative relation was found between the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control level and self-care activities of individuals with diabetes, which had no effect on A 1 c. It was determined that <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control predicts 19 % of self-care activities. Conclusion According to the study results, having internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control had positive effects on self-care activities. Training and planning activities to improve internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control can improve diabetes management...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{genotype}} <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> one-year-old {{oyster spat}} (Crassostrea gigas) from parents of known genotype, are {{compared to the}} frequencies expected with Mendelian inheritance. The genotypes are characterized at three enzyme loci, Aspartate amino-transferase (AAT), Phosphohexose isomerase (PHI) and Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and a general protein locus. In this study expression <b>of</b> these <b>loci</b> as histochemically stained patterns on a gel following electrophoresis is controlled by two codominant alleles at each <b>locus.</b> <b>Frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the genotypes at all four loci, in all offspring groups investigated, are not statistically different from those expected with Mendelian inheritance, supporting the hypothesis {{that this is the}} method of inheritance. It is further concluded that there are no large amounts of selection connected with any <b>of</b> these <b>loci.</b> An additional observation, that there is no statistical difference between genotype ratios of siblings in two different growing areas, is discussed in terms of G. Williams' (1975) "elm-oyster" model. It is suggested that the search for selection at single loci is probably not a generally useful one for the oyster breeder...|$|R
