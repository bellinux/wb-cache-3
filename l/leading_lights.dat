5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{compared}} with such <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) {{would prove to}} be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft's fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.|$|E
5|$|History of the hermitage is {{traced to}} the 9th century when Padmasambhava (Padma ’byung gnas) meditated here. The main cave where he did penance {{is known as the}} ‘Cavern of Dochung Chongzhi (Rdo cung cong zhi’i phug pa)’. Over the centuries, the monastery has seen many <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> of the Tibetan monastic order playing a role in its building, such as the Zhang ’gro ba’i mgon po g.yu brag pa (1123–1193), female saint Ma cig lab sgron, Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho’s (1641–1713), Ngawang Jampa (Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa, 1682–1762) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes (1663–1737). Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi (Rgyal mo tshe ring bkra shis) and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas (1689–1747) also {{supported}} the activities of the hermitage. However, the most significant face of development occurred during the third Purchok incarnation Lozang Tsültrim Jampa Gyatso (Phur lcog sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang tshul khrims byams pa rgya mtsho) who was teacher of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighthouse}} reserve {{was formally}} {{transferred to the}} Crown in 1896/97 and early in 1896 the Department of Harbours and Rivers called tenders {{for the construction of}} two lighthouse towers and cottages on Bribie Island and a lighthouse tower and cottage at Caloundra Head. Materials were shipped by barge from Brisbane and department officers supervised the erection of the lightstations using day labour. The Caloundra Head Lighthouse was a hardwood-framed structure, clad with corrugated iron. A fourth order dioptric apparatus, which operated by concentrating light by refraction, was imported from Chance Bros & Co near Birmingham. The towers for the two <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> on Bribie Island were of a much simpler construction: open timber frames that could be moved as the channel changed.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Paley and his news staff {{was not always}} smooth. His friendship with Edward R. Murrow, one of the <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> in the CBS news division (and by then {{a vice president of}} CBS), suffered during the 1950s over the hard-hitting tone of the Murrow-hosted See It Now series. The implication was that the network's sponsors were uneasy about some of the controversial topics of the series, leading Paley to worry about lost revenue to the network as well as unwelcome scrutiny during the era of McCarthyism. In 1955, Alcoa withdrew its sponsorship of See It Now, and eventually the program's weekly broadcast on Tuesdays was stopped, though it continued as a series of special segments until 1958.|$|E

25|$|From 1846, when {{declared}} a port of entry, Brisbane/Moreton Bay {{had been the}} principal port of Queensland. By the late 1850s the main northern channel lay about half a nautical mile west of Moreton Island and was marked by Cape Moreton Light, the lightship Rose, and covered lights: Comboyuro Point Light, North Point Light and Cowan Cowan Light. In 1879 George Poynter Heath, Portmaster of Queensland from 1862 to 1890 and Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board from 1869 to 1890, sounded a new channel from Caloundra Head along {{the eastern shore of}} Bribie Island to provide a deep water entry to the Port of Brisbane. This North West Channel quickly proved to be the safest and most reliable deep water entrance to the port, but remained unlit until 1896 when two <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> on Bribie Island and at Caloundra Head (marking the entrance to the channel), were completed.|$|E

25|$|A defender with {{exceptional}} pace, Fry {{learned his}} football at Repton School, {{where he played}} for and captained the school team.

Fry went on to win Blues in each of his four years at Oxford University captaining the side in his third year. In 1891, he joined another famous amateur club, the Corinthians, going on to make a total of 74 appearances for them between 1891 and 1903 scoring four goals. Although extremely proud of his amateur status, he decided that entering the professional game would enhance his chance of international honours. He chose Southampton F.C. (The Saints), as the <b>leading</b> <b>lights</b> in the Southern League, and also because The Dell was conveniently close to his home. He made his debut for Southampton (as an amateur) on 26 December 1900,against Tottenham Hotspur and went on to help them win the Southern League title during that 1900–01 season.|$|E

The second Ghanaian woman and fourth West African woman to receive a university baccalaureate degree, M. J.
