5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> unsafe sex.

5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it {{plays an important role in}} word learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Older males in breeding plumage are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> this behaviour than are those breeding in eclipse plumage. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks red petals from flowers and displays them to females.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: An enriched {{environment}} (EE) facilitates physical, {{cognitive and}} social activity in animal models of stroke. The {{aim of this}} pilot {{study was to determine}} whether enriching the environment of a mixed rehabilitation unit increased stroke patient activity. Methods: A non- randomized controlled trial was conducted. Direct observation was used to determine the difference in change in physical, cognitive, social or any activity over 2 weeks in patients exposed to an enriched versus non-enriched environment. Results: Stroke patients in the EE (n[*]=[*] 15) were 1. 2 (95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 4) times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> any activity compared with those in a non-enriched environment (n[*]=[*] 14). They were 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 5) times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> cognitive activities, 1. 2 (95 % CI 1. 0 – 1. 5) times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> social activities, 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 6 – 0. 9) times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be inactive and alone and 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 7) times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be asleep than patients without enrichment. Conclusions: This preliminary trial suggests that the comprehensive model of enrichment developed for use in a rehabilitation unit was effective in increasing activity in stroke patients and reducing time spent inactive and alone. Implications for Rehabilitation: Stroke patients within a mixed rehabilitation unit who are exposed to an enriched environment (EE) are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> activity than those not exposed to the enriched environment. Patients in enriched conditions are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be “inactive and alone” or asleep during waking hours. These results suggest a comprehensive model of enrichment is effective in increasing activity levels...|$|R

25|$|Social {{psychological}} {{literature has}} found that the level of motivation one has to engage in an activity influences one’s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> social facilitation (that is, to increase one’s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual’s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual’s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.|$|E

25|$|Narcissism as a {{personality}} trait, generally assessed with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, {{is related to}} some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high on narcissism inventories are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> counterproductive work behavior (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or {{other people in the}} workplace). Although individuals high on narcissism might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened. Thus narcissistic employees are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> CWB when they feel threatened. Individuals high in narcissism have fragile self-esteem and are easily threatened. One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.|$|E

40|$|Background: Young motorists <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> anti-social {{and often}} {{dangerous}} driving manoeuvres (which {{is often referred}} to as “hooning” within Australia) is an increasing road safety problem.

This paper outlines research that aimed to identify the characteristics of individuals most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>in</b> hooning behaviours, as well as examine the frequency of such driving behaviours and if such activity is linked with self-reported crash involvement. [...] Methods: A total of 717 young drivers in Queensland voluntarily completed a questionnaire to investigate their driving behaviour and crash history.

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that men are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> extramarital sex if they are {{unsatisfied}} sexually, while women are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction {{may be more important}} to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that {{men and women who are}} involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engaging</b> <b>in</b> {{political}} protests {{are becoming}} increasingly common, and considering the potential, individual, costs and the low probability of affecting the political outcome, {{it is necessary to}} understand the motivations behind such actions. The desire {{to be part of a}} social group is deeply rooted in human nature, and previous research proposes that the groups one belongs to may influence the decision <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> protests. We build on this research and suggest that social exclusion, individual fear of exclusion and need to belong interact in explaining who is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become <b>engaged.</b> <b>In</b> two studies, one natural experiment and one lab-experiment, we show that social exclusion increase willingness to participate in protests for individuals high in both rejection sensitivity and need to belong. We conclude that contextual factors, such as exclusion or marginalization should be considered in relation to individual level personality factors when explaining who is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> political protests. These results are important since they suggest that some people <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> politics simply due to social reasons and are less ideologically motivated...|$|R
