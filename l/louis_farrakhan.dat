5|$|The school's {{first class}} {{included}} nine students; the school now has 2,400 pupils drawn {{from all parts}} of Boston. Its graduates have included four Harvard presidents, eight Massachusetts state governors, and five signers of the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as several preeminent architects, a leading art historian, a notable naturalist and the conductors of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Pops orchestras. There are also several notable non-graduate alumni, including <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> a leader of the Nation of Islam. Boston Latin admitted only male students at its founding in 1635. The school's first female student was admitted in the nineteenth century. In 1972, Boston Latin admitted its first co-educational class.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan</b> has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely dismissed as a fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E

25|$|While {{recovering}} in {{the hospital}} from gunshot wounds he incurred in late 2001, Game told his brother {{to go out and}} buy all of the classic hip-hop albums. Over the course of five months, he studied all of the various influential rap albums and developed a strategy to turn himself into a rapper. With the help of his older brother Big Fase, they founded the label. It originally featured such artists as Glasses Malone, Vita, and Nu Jerzey Devil, along with Game himself. His stage name was coined by his grandmother, who was a huge fan of the 1997 blockbuster, The Game. Game first gained prominence when he attended a hip-hop summit hosted by Russell Simmons and <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan.</b> After he had fully recovered, Game and Big Fase made a mixtape together. He released his first mixtape You Know What It Is Vol. 1 in 2002, and landed a record deal with the independent label Get Low Recordz owned by JT the Bigga Figga.|$|E
25|$|The main {{belief of}} The Nation of Islam and its {{followers}} {{is that there}} is no god but Allah. Their most important worship is praying five times a day. The official beliefs as stated by the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad (Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah, 1992). Many of MalcolmX's teachings of NOI theology are in his The End of White World Supremacy, while a later more critical discussion of those beliefs can be found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, co-written with Alex Haley. It is important to note that near the end of Malcolm X's life, Malcolm, along with Elijah Muhammad's son, Wallace Muhammad, broke away from major parts of Elijah Muhammad's theology. This was spurred originally by immoral actions by Elijah Muhammad, which were in-congruent with the Nations own teaching, but then mainly from Malcolm's experience at the Hajj Pilgrimage to Mecca. Malcolm, following Wallace's footsteps, along with many other followers entered traditional Islam (Autobiography of Malcolm X). They rejected that Fard Muhammad was God incarnate, as God cannot be in human form, and that Elijah Muhammad was a prophet sent by God, as the Prophet Muhammad from 570 CE to 632 CE is the last prophet for humankind, according to Islam - Qur'an Verse 40, Surah Al-Ahzab (chapter 33).|$|E
25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%‚Äì34%), and dramatically in New York (41%‚Äì26%).|$|E

Before a suspect could be taken into custody, Farrakhan and Rangel arrived at the scene, saying that a riot would likely occur if the suspect and others were not released. [...] Some police officials also limited the investigation, including deputy commissioner for public affairs Benjamin Ward, who had ordered all white police officers away from the scene in acquiescing to the demands of Farrakhan and Rangel.|$|E
500|$|Most {{local media}} sources gave Clarence13X {{positive}} {{coverage in the}} wake of his death. The Daily News connected his murder with the recent death of NOI activist Charles Kenyatta, casting them as part of a [...] "Muslim War". The mayor believed that the NYPD told them this and was angered by their claim. <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan</b> denied culpability, maintaining that he had good relations with Clarence13X. NYPD investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring, possibly connected to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. In August 1969, an arrest was made in connection with his murder. The suspect denied involvement, and charges were soon dropped. Five Percenters have posited different culprits, including the CIA, the NOI, or a disgruntled follower.|$|E
500|$|Membership of the National Front {{declined}} significantly {{following the}} election of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher. As a result, the party became more radicalised, and a dissatisfied Griffin, along with fellow NF activists Derek Holland and Patrick Harrington, began to embrace the ideals of Italian fascist Roberto Fiore, who had arrived in the UK in 1980. By 1983, the group had broken away to form the NF Political Soldier faction, which advocated a revival of country [...] "values" [...] and a return to feudalism with the establishment of nationalist communes. Writing for Bulldog in 1985, Griffin praised the black separatist <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> but his comments were unpopular with some members of the party. He also attempted to form alliances with Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, and praised the efforts of Welsh nationalist movement Meibion Glynd≈µr.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{had some}} {{controversial}} interactions with Jewish leaders {{in his early}} years in office. In 1996, his message of unity and cooperation with the Jews was met with skepticism. In 1997, Jackson was criticized for stating simple disagreement with anti-Semitic remarks made by <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan</b> {{while he was in}} New York City for the mayoral race; Jewish leaders were unsatisfied by Jackson's response to Farrakhan. In 1997, Newsweek mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed [...] "the Century Club", and raised the question of whether he would be the first black president. Jackson criticized the Bill Clinton administration for working with Republicans and voted in dissent on several notable bills that were the products of compromise between Democrats and Republicans. Jackson preferred direct aid and debt relief to trade reform as a method of helping impoverished nations such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, fearing that relaxed trade regulations would possibly benefit corporations and exploit labor. He is also an opponent of incentives for corporations to invest in developing nations. He was outspoken on issues of minority hiring in information technology. Jackson voted against the impeachment of Bill Clinton, voting against all four articles of impeachment considered by the House.|$|E
500|$|Eve {{served as}} an {{observer}} and negotiator {{in the wake of}} the 1971 Attica Prison riot. Believing that the situation called for people who were credible to both the prison population as well as to people involved with and observing the situation from outside the prison, he joined Tom Wicker and John Dunne, among others, in entering the prison to hear the inmates' demands. Eve was the first mediator to arrive at the scene of the rebellion. He was the first elected official to enter the prison yard following the riot in which 42 prisoners were taken, and he led the September 11 tour by the requested visitors to the seized Cellblock D as well as other areas of the prison. The prisoners requested direct communication with the Commissioner of Corrections, Russell G. Oswald, and that specific individuals hear their demands, naming <b>Louis</b> <b>Farrakhan,</b> Huey Newton, and William Kunstler; Kunstler eventually agreed to serve as their legal counsel. [...] The primary prisoner demand was that, upon surrendering control of the prison back to the guards, they not be beaten. Farrakhan refused to attend to the situation in person, however, which Eve felt was a turning point in the negotiations. [...] Eve has expressed the belief that Governor Rockefeller was responsible for the massacre that subsequently occurred in the prison, and that Rockefeller made a deliberate decision to escalate the conflict knowing that there would likely be some loss of life. After negotiations stalled over a demand for amnesty, a rescue operation saved 29 hostages and led to 10 inmate deaths. [...] Eve was critical of Rockefeller's decision to not come observe the prison and the negotiations but rather pursue tactical measures: [...] "I think Governor Rockefeller ought to be indicted." [...] In the 1992 Attica civil-liability trial, Eve testified on behalf of the inmates. In March 2001, then New York Governor George Pataki appointed Eve to the Attica Task Force that met with families of Attica prison employees who survived the 1971 uprising and negotiated reparations.|$|E
