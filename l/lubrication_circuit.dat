First, the oils pump performance were analyzed with a tri-dimensional simulation model, realized with the commercial code PumpLinx®, which allowed to obtain the performance curves of the oil pump, varying the oils. Then the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> was studied with a 1 D model, realized with the commercial code LMS AMESim®, and the behaviour of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> was analyzed in terms of pressure drops and components oil consumption. The adopted oils were: 0 W 30; 5 W 40 and 10 W 60. In previous activities, both models showed good correlation with experimental data. Analyzing the models results, {{it was noted that}} the pressure behavior in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> is highly influenced by the oil, especially for low engine speed and high temperatures.

40|$|Today {{the design}} of {{hydraulic}} and lubrication circuits {{is becoming more and}} more important. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology for {{the design of}} the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> of an agricultural tractor. In this paper the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> of a continuously variable transmission is analysed. Several lines of the circuit are considered and in particular the lubrication of gears is discussed. The worst possible working condition which corresponds to the highest power dissipation for each part of the transmission is determined. The model of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> is developed with two different software simulations (Automation Studio & Amesim). In order to check the reliability of the simulation models and to characterise the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit,</b> experimental tests are performed. The comparison between the values of pressure drops obtained by the models and by the experimental test, demonstrates that it is possible to use these programs for the set up of a simple model of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit.</b> The calculation of oil flows necessary for a force-fed lubrication of the gears, the simulation of the circuit by commercial software, and the validation of the circuit design allow to set up a preliminary equilibrium among the pipes and a proper flow rate distribution. Optimising the circuit design in the initial phase of the project is very important. The experimental adjustment of the circuit, which is often difficult, can be simplified; time and cost production can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|This study initiates {{a three-year}} project to {{investigate}} the potential benefits in fuel efficiency, engine emissions, lubricant longevity, and engine durability. Two experimental testing platforms were designed and implemented to empirically {{study the effects of}} lubricant formulations on the internal combustion engine's frictional losses. A motored cylinder head enables the characterization of valvetrain lubrication regimes and friction contributions. A Kohler KDW- 702 engine was also instrumented with pressure and torque measuring instrumentation, in addition to being modified to have two separate <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuits</b> - one to lubrication the valvetrain system, and one for the crankcase system. Using a novel split lubrication strategy, the full engine experimental setup was used {{to investigate the}} effect of lubricant viscosity on subsystem friction as well as demonstrate the efficiency gains possible by optimizing lubricant formulations on a subsystem basis. The Kohler KDW- 702 test engine was shown to experience significant boundary contact within its valvetrain system, contrasting the predominantly hydrodynamic nature of the crankshaft bearings and piston assembly. A split lubrication configuration addressed this, using a 15 W- 40 oil in the cylinder head, and a 1 OW- 30 oil in the crankcase, yielding 6 % lower overall friction and 3 % higher mechanical efficiency over the stock recommended full 15 W- 40 lubrication configuration. While significant frictional gains have been demonstrated {{through the use of a}} split lubrication system and optimized lubricant viscosity classifications, the project will continue to demonstrate benefits in engine emissions, lubricant degradation, and engine component wear. by Tomas Vianna Martins.

40|$|The {{target for}} future cooling systems is {{to control the}} fluid {{temperatures}} and flows through a demand oriented control of the engine cooling to minimize energy demand and to achieve comfort, emissions, or service life advantages. The scope of this work {{is to create a}} complete engine thermal model (including both cooling and <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuits)</b> able to reproduce engine warm up along the New European Driving Cycle in order {{to assess the impact of}} different thermal management concepts on fuel consumption. The engine cylinder structure was modeled through a finite element representation of cylinder liner, piston and head in order to simulate the cylinder heat exchange to coolant or oil flow circuits and to predict heat distribution during transient conditions. Heat exchanges with other components (EGR cooler, turbo cooler, oil cooler) were also taken into account. The thermal model was indirectly integrated with the engine model to evaluate the heat generated by the combustion process: the combustion gas temperatures and convective heat exchange coefficients between gas and walls were obtained from the results of detailed engine model simulation. The main advantage of this approach is the lower computational time in comparison with direct integration. The cooling system analyzed in this work presents some innovative technologies in terms of thermal-management, such as a controlled water pump (Switchable Water Pump) and an electronically controlled thermostat. Through the simulation, it was therefore possible to assess the impact of different control strategies of the cooling system control. In particular, it was possible to evaluate solutions capable to control the engine warm up, in order to reduce the fuel consumption and increase the overall efficiency of the engine during the driving cycle...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of complex}} {{lubrication}} {{systems in the}} Oil&Gas industry has reached high levels of competitiveness in terms of requested performances and reliability. In particular, the use of HazOp (acronym of Hazard and Operability) analysis represents a decisive factor to evaluate safety and reliability of plants. The HazOp analysis is a structured and systematic examination of a planned or existing operation {{in order to identify}} and evaluate problems that may represent risks to personnel or equipment. In particular, P&ID schemes (acronym of Piping and Instrument Diagram according to regulation in force ISO 14617) are used to evaluate the design of the plant in order to increase its safety and reliability in different operating conditions. The use of a simulation tool can drastically increase speed, efficiency and reliability of the design process. In this work, a tool, called TTH lib (acronym of Transient Thermal Hydraulic Library) for the 1 -D simulation of thermal hydraulic plants is presented. The proposed tool is applied to the analysis of safety relevant components of compressor and pumping units, such as <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuits.</b> Opposed to the known commercial products, TTH lib has been customized in order to ease simulation of complex interactions with digital logic components and plant controllers including their sensors and measurement systems.

40|$|Modern {{internal}} combustion engines {{are the results}} of several years of designing to meet the growing demand of high specific power, low fuel consumption and low exhaust emissions. Nowadays, the running conditions {{are becoming more and}} more demanding and therefore modern engines must provide high performances in a variety of operating conditions like cold start, frequent start and stop, long time high speed and load. Consequently, all the components and auxiliary systems work under onerous conditions. In particular, the lubrication system is highly stressed because these circuits must supply also other components, for example the variable valve timing (VVT) actuation system. To satisfy these demanding situations, a lot of advances in lubrication technology have been achieved and more work is still needed. Hence a design optimization of the engine <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> and of its components, is becoming more important, due to the necessity to combine efficiency with a rational management of energy consumption. In this paper, the authors present an optimized design methodology of lubricant circuit components. This methodology is based on a modeling approach which uses a numerical fluid-dynamics 1 D code (commercial code - Imagine AMESim®) and aims to be a useful tool for the lubricant circuit designer. Moreover, this modeling approach could be an interesting support during experimental measurements, to estimate some parameters (i. e. flow rate) that are not easily measured in every engine point. This fluid-dynamic model has been proposed to describe the complex architecture of <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> of the Ferrari 8 cylinders dry sump engine and it has been validated by comparison with experimental data.

40|$|Race {{internal}} combustion engines {{are the result}} of several years of design made to satisfy the growing demand of high specific power. As a result of this increased specific power demand all of the engine components that require lubrication are exposed to a broader range of more extreme operating conditions. Hence an optimized design of a race engine lubricant circuit is becoming much more important, due to the necessity to have its effectiveness with a rational management of its own energy. In this paper, Authors analyse a motorbike high performance <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> by a simulation methodology, already used and validated for other high performance engine types. It will be illustrated a simulation model, made by mono-dimensional (1 D) code, which allows to study all lubricant circuit behaviour, analyzing parameters that are not easy to evaluate experimentally and that, too often, designers don't take into account during engine development. These parameters allow the designer to study the whole lubricant circuit, highlighting eventual critical working conditions. The model was build up by a commercial code AMESim®, trade mark of LMS®. This code, by its own libraries, permits to the user to simulate the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> and its components, taking into account all the problems concerning pressure drops, flow rate and heat exchange that characterize engine lubricant circuit behaviour. An useful instrument for lubricant circuit was been implemented to the aim of analyzing a complex architecture of an innovative 4 cylinder race motorbike high performance engine.

40|$|The {{technology}} of lubrication systems for aircrafts engines has seen significant development during {{the history of}} aeronautics and has progressed in parallel with {{the evolution of the}} engines themselves. Starting from the first, wetsump schemes derived from automotive applications, more complex systems and components have been introduced. The progressive increase of aeronautic engines' power and speed, {{as well as that of}} the maximum operative altitude of the aircraft, have increased the lubricant flow rate required to avoid severe mechanical issues that can cause dangerous conditions for the vehicle and its users. Currently, the main focus on the development of novel lubrication pumps is aimed at reducing the pumps' weight and envelope while maintaining, or possibly increasing, their reliability. The first two objective could be pursued by searching for novel pump types and/or increasing the pump speed in order to downsize its required capacity, but the low-pressure environment, typical of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuits,</b> over imposes a few, severe, limitations to avoid cavitation occurrence that decrease the effectiveness of this approach. The central aim of the presented research, performed within the program "Greening the Propulsion", is to provide a theoretical framework to help in the development of a novel gerotor pump for the lubrication of aeronautic engines. The first step of the research involves the study of the state of the art of aeronautic engines' lubrication systems, providing particular care to the effect that any design choice and possible operational condition may have on the lubrication pump design. Hence, the state of the art for gerotor pumps is investigated; results of this study are used, along with catalogue comparisons, to build simplified sizing tools to perform a benchmarking activity involving gerotors and other low pressure pumps type. This activity, performed to position gerotor pumps in the aeronautic engine lubrication market, is then used as a starting point to highlight the weak points of gerotors traditional design and to propose some possible solutions to enhance the pumps performances. To study the outcomes of these modifications, a rigorous theoretical framework is required; sizing and modeling criteria, based on the theory of gearing and compressible fluids, are hence detailed and used to build an Automatic Design and Simulation Framework, able to automatically design, validate and simulate a novel gerotor pump given a minimum number of geometrical and physical input parameters. This design and simulation tool is then used to evaluate the performance boost provided by the proposed variations and to optimize the gears profiles by pairing it with a multiobjective algorithm based on evolutionary strategies. Another critical component of any lubrication system is the pressure relief valve used to avoid the occurrence of dangerous conditions for the pipes integrity. A side activity involving the study of a preliminary sizing tool for pressure relief valve is hence performed. A preliminary design framework is presented and discussed, highlighting the importance of the valve discharge coefficient. To study its dependence on the valve's geometry, a lengthy CFD simulation campaign is performed varying the poppet shape and the fluid Reynolds' number. Results are hence discussed and used inside the design framework...|$|R

An energy audit of an industrial pasta factory {{equipped with a}} cogeneration system natural gas fuelled has carried out along last two years. This CHP plant, with a 650 kWe capacity, currently covers a relevant fraction of the electric and high-temperature heat loads during peak hours, while it is switched off during off-peak hours because of the much lower electricity price. Heat content of flue gases is recovered by two cascaded gas-diathermic oil and diathermic oil- water heat exchangers; the superheated water obtained is then supplied to the pasta dryers. A detailed plant description and an energetic and economic analysis are provided, that indicate margins for improvement of the current CHP system based on maximizing heat recovery. The existing plant only achieves heat recovery at high temperature (from exhaust gas), while {{a fraction of the}} thermal demand is associated with low temperature heat uses. Then a first retrofit hypothesis includes an additional low temperature heat recovery from the cooling jacket water and the <b>lubrication</b> oil <b>circuits</b> of the prime mover. As the above solution allows to achieve only minor benefits, from an economic viewpoint, a second and more comprehensive retrofit hypothesis was made, based on the use of a CHP gas turbine.

30|$|Because wear {{particle}} {{sizes are}} small, it is a challenging task to isolate and examine an individual particle. In practice, wear particles flowing {{in the machine}} <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> are inspected [3, 4]. In its early development, ferrography relies on manually extracting an oil sample containing wear particles and placing them under a microscope to observe the shapes of particles under test [5, 6]. In addition, the amount and concentration of particles can be found to infer the machine health condition. Alternatively, particles may be separated by applying magnetization, but this method can only be used for metallic wear elements [7]. On the other hand, the use of electrostatics is a possible alternative [8]. These processes, although had been successfully implemented, are time consuming, and the assessment may be subjective. Automatic operation and systematic assessment procedures are therefore more desirable.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} make ferrography {{analysis}} automatic, online video ferrography (OLVF) systems had been developed [9].

The use of online video ferrography has some practical difficulties; signal and image processing routines are needed to enhance wear particle images. In this regard, wavelet transformation had been employed for engine wear monitoring [12]. When it is required to examine the characteristics of wear particles, segmentation [13], morphology [14], multi-view processing [15], three-dimensional reconstruction [16], object detection [17], and artificial intelligence [18] techniques are required.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental procedure for comparing different families of IC Engine lubricating pumps {{in terms of}} total consumed energy in a NEDC driving cycle. Measures are performed on a test rig able to reproduce the oil temperature profile, the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> permeability and its variation during the engine warm-up. The pump under test is driven by a variable speed electric motor supplying the engine velocity profile of the driving cycle. The load on the pump is generated {{by means of a}} variable restrictor controlled in a closed loop by a proper combination of speed, temperature, flow rate and pressure signals in order to replicate the typical permeability of the lubricating circuit.

40|$|The {{condition}} of lubricating oil used in automotive and industrial gearboxes must be controlled {{in order to}} guarantee optimum performance and prevent damage to machinery parts. In normal practice, this is done by regular oil change intervals and routine laboratory analysis, both of which involve considerable operating costs. In this paper, we present a compact and robust optical sensor that can be installed in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> to provide quasi-continuous information about the {{condition of}} the oil. The measuring principle is based on non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy. The implemented sensor setup consists of an optical measurement cell, two thin-film infrared emitters, and two four-channel pyroelectric detectors equipped with optical bandpass filters. We present a method based on multivariate partial least squares regression to select appropriate optical bandpass filters for monitoring the oxidation, water content, and acid number of the oil. We perform a ray tracing analysis to analyze and correct the influence of the light path in the optical setup on the optical parameters of the bandpass filters. The measurement values acquired with the sensor for three different gearbox oil types show high correlation with laboratory reference data for the oxidation, water content, and acid number. The presented sensor can thus be a useful supplementary tool for the online condition monitoring of lubricants when integrated into a gearbox oil circuit...|$|E
40|$|This work {{develops}} a coupled 1 D- 3 D computational tool for analyzing conjugate heat transfer {{in the engine}} bay of a passenger vehicle. 1 D thermal models of powertrain in conjunction with detailed 3 D models of ow structures can provide a powerful means to correctly capture the physics of the system while keeping the computational cost reasonably low. To the authors' best knowledge, simultaneous coupling of 1 D and 3 D computational tools has not been applied to modelling thermal interaction in the vehicle powertrain before. Thus, this work constitutes a first step towards performing such coupled simulations and analyzing their outcome. The present study builds on a 1 D model of a powertrain cooling system, built in GT-SUITE software, by adding a comprehensive <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit</b> and mean value engine model to monitor the time dependent temperatures of oil and engine solids. A 3 D model of natural convection & radiation in the engine bay was built in STAR-CCM+ where the primary boundaries for heat transfer between the surrounding air in the underhood region and engine solids were defined.

40|$|Hydraulics has {{the highest}} energy density of any power {{transmission}} technology and is a very effective way to transfer power from a source to a user. The convenience of sharing a single power source with many users with high reliability, justifies the wide use of this technology. The recent development of new components and technologies especially the use of electronic sensors and controls on hydraulic components, makes hydraulic systems more flexible and efficient. Hydraulic systems {{can be used in}} niche application where electromagnetic effects must be avoided. But hydraulics has a few disadvantage including low efficiency, high costs, noise, leaks and complexity. Hydraulic systems capability of creating high forces with small electronic control devices has found wide application, and electro hydraulic components are widely used in applications that require precise actuator control or matching of variable working conditions. Hydraulic is widely used in many sectors. In this PhD Thesis the research has been focused on the optimization of hydraulic components used in the industrial fields and on engines for lubrication circuits. In recent years, many studies were initiated to improve the performance of hydraulic components. However, the scientific understanding of valves, pumps and transmissions operation is limited {{because of the lack of}} three-dimensional fluid dynamics computation capability. In this PhD thesis a 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling technique developed by the Hydraulic Research Group of the University of Naples Federico II led by Professor Adolfo Senatore is presented. The methodology has been applied for the study of several different applications. Using a three-dimensional CFD approach it is possible to improve component performance and the understanding of the internal flow of each component. To achieve the goals, the hydraulic research group of University of Naples “Federico II” has worked in close collaboration with the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power at the University of Minnesota led by the Professor Kim A.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>circuit,</b> reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.
