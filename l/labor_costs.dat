5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce <b>labor</b> <b>costs,</b> but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort.

5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|The concept {{behind a}} Qualifying Industrial Zone is {{credited}} to Omar Salah, a Jordanian businessman. In 1993, {{in anticipation of}} the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Salah traveled to Israel with the intention of doing business with Israeli businessmen. He was also interested in business ventures that could take advantage of the eight-year-old free trade agreement between the United States and Israel that allowed Israeli goods to enter the US markets duty-free. After the treaty was signed in 1994, a business venture was struck between Salah and Delta Galil, where labor was transferred to Irbid in northern Jordan, to take advantage of low <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> that were forty to seventy percent lower than in Israel. Salah had envisioned that by exploiting Israeli resources such as labor, finances, and contacts, and then leveraging it to produce value-added goods, the economy of Jordan would be benefited. In addition, he surmised that economic cooperation between the two nations would help foster peace in the region.|$|E
5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall <b>labor</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition.

A higher salary, in turn, causes low <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> seeking FDI to withdraw their investment. Government policies aimed to sustain cheap <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> seeking FDI are examined. Policies to subsidize foreign operation such as providing tax breaks and reducing the time {{to set up a}} new firm can stimulate FDI in the short term but in the long term the foreign firms still withdraw their investments due to high salaries.
