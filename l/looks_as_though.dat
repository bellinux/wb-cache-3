5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we're too late '.|$|E

It <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking {{certainly}} cannot be excluded. It is notable {{for the fact that}} most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the present}} moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, {{following}} a long walk, he and the prince find a well. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars {{to think of the}} prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E

He spent time as a poster designer but realized it was not lucrative enough for his lifestyle, which was being partly financed by Ethel, who was also paying for their father's care. While discussing his future with his brother, Barrymore said [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'll have to succumb to the family curse, acting", and he later admitted that [...] "there isn't any romance about how I went on stage.... I needed the money." ...|$|E
500|$|Hurley, Jin and Sawyer raid the van {{and find}} maps and beer. Meanwhile, Hurley tells Charlie to stop moping and help him start the car, saying that he might die doing it but they should make their own luck, face death, and {{possibly}} win. Hurley eventually convinces the others to push the van to a slope {{in order to get}} it started. Despite Sawyer's warnings, Hurley goes through with the plan. Charlie declares [...] "victory or death" [...] and rides with Hurley, as Sawyer and Jin push the vehicle down the steep hill. At first it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they will crash, but the van starts just in time. Later, the entire group enjoys a ride.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they're {{going to be}} ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!". With Alex Catarinella of Paper saying [...] "she belts out soaring vocals, is further proof that she's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus." ...|$|E

500|$|The Ford-powered M2B {{made its}} debut driven by McLaren at the world {{championship}} season-opening Monaco Grand Prix. There he qualified 10th on the grid and ran as high as sixth but retired after nine laps due to an oil leak. After Monaco McLaren decided [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we're {{going to have to}} make some fairly drastic moves in the engine room", and so for the next race in Belgium the Serenissima engine was used. The replacement unit did not provide an immediate solution though, terminally damaging its bearings in practice. With no spare, McLaren was unable to start the race. The team missed the next race in France, but at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch the M2B finished sixth to score McLaren's first championship point. Another non-start resulted when the Serenissima failed again before the Dutch Grand Prix, and the entries for the German and Italian Grands Prix were withdrawn in anticipation of the improved Ford engine being readied. Thus equipped at the United States Grand Prix, McLaren drove to fifth place and two more points. At final event in Mexico, the rear bodywork was cut away to help prevent overheating but the engine failed during the race. McLaren had intended for Chris Amon, who was already racing sports cars for the team, to race a second car but the engine problems prevented this.|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nebraska" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen {{felt that the}} episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were [...] "beautifully acted". In his A– review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that [...] "Nebraska" [...] accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere {{for the second half}} of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience [...] "plenty to chew on", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; [...] "'Nebraska' doesn’t entirely rectify this concern, but it’s a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; [...] "I liked how this episode thrust us right back into it, and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing—a mixture this show can do very well." [...] Concluding his review, Goldman issued [...] "Nebraska" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: [...] "'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating things that happened earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...] But just when it <b>looks</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, [...] "Nebraska" [...] surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that [...] "Nebraska" [...] was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was [...] "just one huge whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode.|$|E

The appointment was welcomed by some detractors of García's fiscal policies during his first administration.

In the book she alleges that she and Charles Laughton never had children because Laughton was homosexual. Maureen O'Hara, a friend and co-star of Laughton, denied this {{was the reason for}} the couple's childlessness. She claimed Laughton had told her that the reason he and his wife never had children was because of a botched abortion Lanchester had early in her career of performing burlesque. Lanchester admitted in her autobiography that she had two abortions in her youth (one being Laughton's), {{but it is not clear}} if the second left her incapable of becoming pregnant again.
