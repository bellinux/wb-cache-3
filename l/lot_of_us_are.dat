Though Representative Tom Petri {{identified}} himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing [...] "a lot {{for the country and}} the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin" [...] he called Thompson [...] "a long shot" [...] and stopped short of endorsing him. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner described Thompson's campaign as [...] "anemic" [...] and Representative Paul Ryan commented that [...] "I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes." [...] Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to [...] "get it out of his system." [...] Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor [...] "had a profound impact" [...] on party members in Wisconsin, which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say [...] "'Oh, come on'" [...] after hearing of his run. Despite the qualms, spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants [...] "for people to give him a chance... he knows he has a lot to prove, and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it." [...] A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates, with only 6 percent support. To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour". Communications director Rennick Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital, Thompson would spend [...] "scads of time in Iowa in July." [...] He compared Thompson's strategy to Jimmy Carter's 1976 [...] "retail politics" [...] strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album.

It talks about how self-destructive a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{sociologist}} {{and professor}} of religion William Martin, author of With God on Our Side: It is difficult to assess the influence of Reconstructionist thought with any accuracy. Because it is so genuinely radical, most leaders of the Religious Right are careful {{to distance themselves from}} it. At the same time, it clearly holds some appeal for many of them. One undoubtedly spoke for others when he confessed, 'Though we hide their books under the bed, we read them just the same.' In addition, several key leaders have acknowledged an intellectual debt to the theonomists. Jerry Falwell and D. James Kennedy have endorsed Reconstructionist books. Rushdoony has appeared on Kennedy's television program and the 700 Club several times. Pat Robertson makes frequent use of 'dominion' language; his book, The Secret Kingdom, has often been cited for its theonomy elements; and pluralists were made uncomfortable when, during his presidential campaign, he said he 'would only bring Christians and Jews into the government,' as well as when he later wrote, 'There will never be world peace until God's house and God's people are given their rightful place of leadership {{at the top of the}} world.' And Jay Grimstead, who leads the Coalition on Revival, which brings Reconstructionists together with more mainstream evangelicals, has said, 'I don't call myself Reconstructionist,' but 'A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> coming to realize that the Bible is God's standard of morality … in all points of history … and for all societies, Christian and non-Christian alike… It so happens that Rushdoony, Bahnsen, and North understood that sooner.'
