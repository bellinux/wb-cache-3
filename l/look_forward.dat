5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their employer and undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E

5|$|Cloud {{has been}} merchandised extensively, in many {{different}} forms, including figurines and jewelry. In commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other Final Fantasy protagonists. Square Enix's manager of merchandise, Kanji Tashiro, said at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International that Cloud's likeness has produced some of the company's best-selling items, and that fans could <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to further adaptations of the character in the future. Popular models at the time included Cloud's Advent Children figurine and Final Fantasy VII Hardy-Daytona bike set, both of which sold particularly well in European and North American markets. Square has also released two promotional books primarily focusing on Cloud's character: Cloud vol.1, which was released in 2007, and Cloud message, in 2008. In 2013, {{a replica of the}} Buster Sword was created by blacksmith Tony Swatton for the webseries Man at Arms.|$|E

Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E

5|$|When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 {{video of}} himself making 45 of 50 three point shots, Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later. On April 24, 2013, he posted {{a video of}} himself making 70 of 76 three {{pointers}} in five minutes, and 8 hours later, Stephen Curry challenged him, via Twitter, to a three-point shooting contest. Curry had set the National Basketball Association single-season three pointers made record one week earlier. The following morning ESPN retweeted the video and noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row.

5|$|In The King of Fighters XIII, Iori's {{gameplay}} mechanics were {{modified to}} {{be a close}} range fighter. Despite losing his flaming techniques, he was given brutal moves using his nails to emphasize his character's ferociousness. His strongest technique in the game, , is a new move that focuses on violent combos {{and serves as a}} reference to the character's ending from The King of Fighters '96 in which he brutally murders his teammates. Iori's 10th color scheme in the game matches his classic outfit's scheme, and during development of the game, details were added to increase the similarities. The ending of the character {{at the end of the}} game was also pointed by developers as something to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to. His version, featuring his classic techniques, was designed with the intention of not surpassing the current Iori so that players would choose the fighting style they prefer in the game. This was further emphasized in the console version of The King of Fighters XIII where Iori had his moveset adjusted for better balancing by not using flaming techniques.|$|E
5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although {{he was not sure}} whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
5|$|When first {{introducing}} Sasuke, Kishimoto {{wrote him}} as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers {{due to the fact}} both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan latters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened {{as a result of their}} fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto drastically changed Sasuke's character, and the plot, by making him one of the series' antagonists, comparing Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> the final fight between the two characters. In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on hand-to-hand combat rather than ninja techniques. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E
