50|$|By {{encouraging}} the recycling {{rather than the}} consumption of land, land recycling promotes smart growth and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, 4.5 acre of undeveloped land is conserved.Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further <b>land</b> <b>consumption.</b> Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.|$|E

The prevalent Erdinger Moos area with its many intersecting small streams, and woodland series was taking into consideration in the planning by the landscape architect. At the same time, consideration was taking in making the airport unattractive to birds, in order to prevent bird strikes. An additional 230-acre green belt was placed around the airport as a compensation area, in which the overall compensation areas extend over 600 acres. Even with the focus on the environment, environmental groups criticize the enormous <b>land</b> <b>consumption</b> of the airport and each additional expansion project.

A typical capacity is the Eurostar, which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train, totaling 9,600 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 passenger cars per hour per lane, excluding other vehicles, assuming an average vehicle occupancy of 1.57 people. A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect <b>land</b> <b>consumption).</b> The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 passengers per hour per direction).

50|$|With {{the growth}} of {{suburbanization}} {{and the spread of}} people living outside the city this can cause negative impacts on the environment. Suburbanization has been linked to the increase in vehicle mileage, increase land use, and increase in residential energy consumption. From these factors of suburbanization it has then caused a degradation of air quality, increase usage of natural resources like water and oil, as well as increased amounts of greenhouse gas. With the increased use of vehicles to commute to and from the work place this causes increased use of oil and gas as well as increase in emissions. With the increase in emissions from vehicles this then can cause air pollution and degrades the air quality of an area. Suburbanization is growing which causes an increase in housing development which causes an increase in <b>land</b> <b>consumption</b> and available land. Suburbanization has also been linked to increase in natural resource use like water to meet residents’ demands and to maintain suburban lawns. Also with the increase in technology and consumptions of residents there is an increase in energy consumption with the amount of electricity used by residents.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the end of}} the Second World War in 1945, Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s {{built-up}} area stretched mainly along both sides of the thoroughfare, Landesstraße 350, west of the Ohmbach. From the village’s north end (280 m above sea level) to the former ﬁre station at the crossing of Landesstraßen 350 and 352 in the south (269 m above sea level), the village has a length of more than 1.75 km, and if the distance to {{the way out of the}} village at the Bockhof is counted, this rises to more than 2.5 km. Until the mid 20th century, Herschweiler-Pettersheim was a typical linear village (by some deﬁnitions, a “thorpe”), and one of the longest villages in the Kusel district. As early as then, however, the side dales branching off the Ohmbach to the west were already settled up to about 200 m in, the Kerb valley in “die Hohl”, the “Gigum” in the Geilbach valley and the old Ducal road (Herzogstraße) in the Ehrsbach valley, which in feudal times led from Schloss Pettersheim over the heights towards the Oster valley to Zweibrücken. East of the Ohmbach, the {{built-up area}} reached thinly up the old Konker Straße (“Konken Road”). Good conditions for building houses and commercial buildings together with springs were found there in a sheltered location at the dale’s edge, which was rich in groundwater, on both sides of the old road link through to today’s Kreisstraße 20 towards Wahnwegen. Sewer-laying work about 1980 unearthed a layered log road about one metre deep under the roadway that had been used as a link between the residential areas “in der Hohl” and “Im Eck” in Herschweiler’s old village core across the wet and marshy Ohmbach valley ﬂoor. There was even expansion not far from Schloss Pettersheim on a road link across the dale linking two roads running through the heights. This link led to a Waldecke (“forest corner”) on the Hühnerkopf, and then onwards to the Roman road east of Wahnwegen. In this part of the village, formerly known as Walleck, and nowadays as Wallheck (both derived from Waldecke), with its houses set at odd angles to each other and its maze of lanes, one can still make out the original layout of the place despite all the conversions and modernization. The agricultural homesteads on the Bockhof were built at a U-shaped valley, the “Kirschen-Grund” (“Cherry Ground”), which ends here, and on today’s Landesstraße 352. After the Second World War with its great loss of male inhabitants (67 had fallen in the war and 29 had gone missing from a village of 1,100 inhabitants; in the First World War, 24 had fallen), the economic downturn, the Allied occupation and currency depreciation came a time of general, lively building activity once the Wirtschaftswunder had begun and the prisoners of war had come home (the last one came home in 1950). Thus, the parts of the village had fully grown together and also grown in breadth. Parallel to Hauptstraße (“Main Street”) after the war, a linking roadway within the municipality, later known as Kirchenstraße (“Church Street”), was built up as far as the location of the Evangelical church. The church itself was built in 1953 and 1954 at an exposed spot east of the Ohmbach in the highest part of the village core. Moreover, a new building zone ﬁlled in the gap between Bockhof and Pettersheim. On the riverside ﬂats in 1973, the company Chalou GmbH built a clothing factory. Gaps on Bockhofstraße were also ﬁlled. A new building zone called Buchrech opened east of the church as the beginning of a new residential neighbourhood along a second street running parallel to Hauptstraße, at mid-slope up the Hühnerkopf’s west ﬂank. Yet another new building zone called “Am Hühnerrech” reaching to Seitersstraße, followed, which has since 2003 been growing to the east into the countryside. For urban growth, this is a very questionable development both because of the spillover into residential land, the demographic development and the high <b>land</b> <b>consumption</b> on the one hand and because of the threatening degradation of the village core on the other. The people who originally lived on the village thoroughfare move away from the core and settle towards the edge of the village in a pleasant neighbourhood, just as happens in other villages, leaving the houses along the thoroughfare empty and unused. In 2003, six houses in the Upper Village (Oberdorf) alone stood empty. Further houses will follow owing to the population’s age structure. An older, empty pair of semi-detached houses next door to the inn “Zum Hirschen” were torn down in 2003. Even in the village centre, a former big department store that had sold clothing and food had to give way to today’s village square. Despite stagnating and declining population growth, the built-up area’s outer edge, and the village’s street, watermain and sewer networks are all being expanded, which could have major consequences for later generations. For this reason, renewal of the inner village might be more important than opening new building zones on former meadows. As early as the time between 1960 and 1980, many houses in Herschweiler-Pettersheim had ﬂoors added and thereby were made more suitable to the demand for more living space. Even the graveyard laid out in the Geilbach valley in 1839 has had to be repeatedly expanded. Since the sporting ground built in 1928 in the “Wallheck” also served the municipality as a fairground in the years after the war, a new one was built specially for the village’s sport club in the years 1955-1957 in the “Wallhecksdell”. A new clubhouse with changing cubicles and a room for business was dedicated in 1967. Work on a new grass playing ﬁeld was begun in 1975. Owing to improper grading, the project met with great and long-lasting problems with landslides, such that the grass playing ﬁeld could only be dedicated in 1984. The masses of earth that had slid down the slope, which had even shoved the forest ﬂoor, complete with trees, ahead of them, had to be removed to the edge of the village.|$|E
