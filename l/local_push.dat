40|$|Abstract—The {{fundamental}} {{challenges of}} providing live mul-timedia streaming (LMS) services in vehicular ad hoc net-works (VANETs) come from achieving stable and high streaming rate (smooth playback) {{for all the}} interested vehicles while using minimal bandwidth resources, especially under the highly dynamic topology of VANETs and the lossy nature of vehicular wireless communications. Packet level network coding (PLNC) technique has been widely accepted as an effective approach to improve the network performance during the last decade. More recent symbol-level network coding (SLNC) could further improve the efficiency of bandwidth utilization by exploiting both wireless symbol-level diversity {{and the benefits of}} network coding. In this paper, we introduce CodePlay, a new LMS scheme in VANETs that fully takes advantage of SLNC through a coordinated <b>local</b> <b>push</b> mechanism. Streaming contents are ac-tively disseminated from dedicated sources to interested vehicles via local coordination of distributively selected relays, each of which will ensure smooth playback for vehicles nearby. Extensive simulations show that simply replacing the SLNC with PLNC technique in previous LMS schemes can not provide satisfiable user experience, and special scheme design based on the unique characteristics of SLNC proposed in CodePlay is necessary for future LMS applications in VANET.

40|$|We propose {{and analyze}} two {{algorithms}} for maintaining approximate Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors on a dynamic graph, where edges are added or deleted. Our algorithms are natural dynamic versions of two known local variations of power iteration. One, Forward Push, propagates probability mass forwards along edges {{from a source}} node, while the other, Reverse Push, propagates local changes backwards along edges from a target. In both variations, we maintain an invariant between two vectors, and when an edge is updated, our algorithm first modifies the vectors to restore the invariant, then performs any needed <b>local</b> <b>push</b> operations to restore accuracy. For Reverse Push, we prove that for an arbitrary directed graph in a random edge model, or for an arbitrary undirected graph, given a uniformly random target node t, the cost to maintain a PPR vector to t of additive error ε as k edges are updated is O(k + d̅ / ε), where d̅ is the average degree of the graph. This is O(1) work per update, plus the cost of computing a reverse vector once on a static graph. For Forward Push, we show that on an arbitrary undirected graph, given a uniformly random start node s, the cost to maintain a PPR vector from s of degree-normalized error ε as k edges are updated is O(k + 1 / ε), which is again O(1) per update plus the cost of computing a PPR vector once on a static graph.

40|$|Since China’s {{economic}} reform and {{opening up to}} the outside world, foreign investment has become the major dynamo of regional development in China. Under the polarized development strategy in the 1980 s and 1990 s, foreign investment has been highly concentrated in the coastal regions and the uneven distribution of foreign investment may be {{partly responsible for the}} significant regional disparity at the inter-provincial or even intra-provincial level within the country. Since the early 2000 s, with China’s integration into the global economy and the dynamic economic restructuring in the coastal regions, foreign investment has been undergoing redistribution with the country. 　　　Based on a combination of both quantitative and qualitative research methods, this study examines the spatio-temporal pattern and dynamics of foreign investment from different sources within a full coverage of time periods from China’s opening up to recent years (1980 - 2006) at the intra-provincial level in Guangdong. This study demonstrates that the spatio-temporal pattern of foreign investment in Guangdong has transformed from having Shenzhen as its single growth pole in the early stage to having Shenzhen and Guangzhou as bi-growth poles in the later stages and foreign investment has widely diffused via the transportation lines from the growth poles to the peripheral regions within or out of the province. The emergence of Shenzhen instead of Guangzhou as the initial growth pole enriches traditional theories and empirical experiences of having the historic economic and industrial centre as the growth pole in the early stage of take-off of a region. Moreover, this study examines the theoretical base and effectiveness of the growth pole strategy and argues that it can be a means of transferring economic growth to new regions instead of reinforcing the cumulative effects of polarized development. Most failure of the growth pole strategy is due to the procedure of the implementation instead of the theoretical base of the strategy. 　　　To explain the initial and ongoing diffusion of foreign investment in Guangdong, this study proposes a multi-level analytical framework, which includes the push and pull factors of home and host regions at the local level, the role of government at the regional level, the structure of global production network at the global level, and the characteristics of foreign investment form different sources at the firm level. Specifically, four distinctive diffusion models of foreign investment are identified, i. e. the “cost-and-government-driven” model of Hong Kong firms, the “supply-chain-driven” model of Taiwan firms, the “market-and-group-driven” model of Japan firms, and the “market-and-institution-driven” model of US firms. This study suggests that the <b>local</b> <b>push</b> and pull factors are far from enough in interpreting such dynamic and various patterns of the diffusion of foreign investment, which should be put into a multi-level context including the local, regional, global and firm level factors and considerations. In-depth knowledge of the spatio-temporal pattern and dynamics of foreign investment from different sources is considered as the prerequisite to improve the efficiency of government development policies. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Many Australians {{today are}} image consumers. We fail to {{question}} the importance of lifestyle imagery created and promoted by Real Estate Agencies whom have no actual part in the physical creation of house, or indeed the intimate making of "home" through our experiences of place. Real Estate Markets dictate how, where, when and what we buy. Re-sale values, profit-making, and value-adding interfere with the crafting of a home over time as a tangible, individual, collaborative, and rich lived experience of dwelling. The "NOT FOR SALE" project is a response and critique of the dominance of real estate forces in West End within the context and unshakable presence of a booming inner-city property market. This proposal originated from an experimental dwelling in Avebury St., West End. This project has been fashioned {{over a period of}} several years primarily from recycled local materials, interconnected with the changing needs and spatial requirements of the occupants and project participants. The influence of property markets is of little concern in this home "making". The "NOT FOR SALE" project attempts to question and critique the purely financial value that we as a society place upon our homes. By appropriating and re-coding the Real Estate Signage typologies, we aim to provoke social commentary on the dominance of real estate forces in the West End suburb. There is a strong and rich tradition of anti-consumerist activist graffiti in West End. Activists re-code signs and property with political commentary and critique. The "NOT FOR SALE" project draws upon this tradition through our RRESign (Recodified Real Estate Signs) : we aim to redress the dominant commercial forces associated with the single house/property. Collectively, at the scale of the street, these RRESigns will reflect a critique of street scale, amenity, and character. Finally, at the scale of the suburb, the network of RRESigns will reflect a critique of the idea of place making. Collectively, the aim of the "NOT FOR SALE" RRESign interventions is to highlight the idea of making and the material characteristics of dwelling that challenges the cultural value of commodified property, re-defining and prioritising the idea of "home". Conventional Real Estate signs use images and text to sell an idea of home: our proposed interventions sell nothing, and are rather celebrations of the joy of making tactile, handcrafted objects, and by extension, the making and crafting of home. The intimate and experiential understanding of home will be harnessed through the engagement of local residents. Community groups within West End such as <b>Local</b> <b>Push</b> can further disseminate the RRESign interventions. The signs will be constructed West End-specific materials (old signs purchased from inexpensive second-hand material merchant Reverse Garbage in Montague Rd.) : turning post-consumer waste into objects of material beauty and social critique. Residents and community groups will be encouraged to place their RRESigns outside their properties and adjacent real estate signs, frustrating and recoding the existing For-Sale signs that currently dominate the West End street scape. The project is dependent on the support of the local residents, extending from a few signs in Avebury St. to a network of RRESigns throughout West End.

40|$|About this release This release {{features}} a large collection of classes representing polar and cryosphere-related environments and environmental processes, primarily prepared by @kaiiam. These semantics are in aid of efforts {{such as the}} Alfred Wegener Institute's Frontiers in Arctic Marine Monitoring programme. Knowledge was harvested from numerous resources - such as the review by Boetius et al. (2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13 : 677 – 690) - which are cross referenced in each class. Efforts to align with existing resources have been initiated, e. g. : [URL] Past and ongoing work related to this project is organised in project cryophile. This work has also motivated the general development of the environmental process hierarchy. A number of other requests, such as that for fissures (see # 466) are also bundled in this release. As usual, the hyperlinks to the terms will be live once OntoBee runs its import cycle over the weekend; however, the PURLs are valid immediately. To better axiomatise the new classes and enhance existing ones, we have also imported numerous classes from other OBO projects, detailed below.

Effective preparedness for this role requires access to and awareness of population-based data (PBD). We investigated the degree to which this is currently achieved among HCPs in Utah by surveying a sample about access, awareness and attitudes concerning PBD in clinical practice. We found variability in the number and nature (national vs. <b>local,</b> <b>pushed</b> vs. pulled) of PBD sources accessed by HCPs, with a subset using multiple sources and using them frequently. We found that HCPs believe PBD improves their clinical performance and that they cannot rely on their own practice to remain informed. These findings suggest that an integrated system, which interprets PBD from multiple sources and optimizes the delivery of PBD, may facilitate preparedness of HCPs through the application of PBD in routine clinical practice...|$|R
