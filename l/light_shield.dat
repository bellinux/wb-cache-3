25|$|Light {{infantry}} javelineers {{would have}} used {{a version of the}} pelte (Ancient Greek: πέλτη) shield, from whence their name, peltast, derived. This was a <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> made of leather-faced wicker. The shield was of Thracian origin and was originally crescent-shaped, however, by the time of Macedonian greatness many depictions of peltai show them as being oval or round.|$|E
25|$|Peltasts {{were armed}} {{with a number of}} {{javelins}} and a sword, carried a <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> but wore no armour, though they sometimes had helmets; they were adept at skirmishing and were often used to guard the flanks of more heavily equipped infantry. They usually adopted an open order when facing enemy heavy infantry. They could throw their javelins at will at the enemy and, unencumbered by armour or heavy shields, easily evade any counter-charges made by heavily equipped hoplites. They were, however, quite vulnerable to shock-capable cavalry and often operated to particular advantage on broken ground where cavalry was useless and heavy infantry found it difficult to maintain formation.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} an active light noise filter is {{proposed}} by using two identical light receivers. They {{work as a}} differential electrometer by a common mode connection. Therefore, only an output of a laser light incident upon one receiver can be obtained as a signal. It was found from the experiment that the light noise was reduced to about 0. 6 % in the usual light room and further the {{signal to noise ratio}} was improved up to 30 times at least as compared to a usual <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> method. The method can then be effectively used under a well-lighted room such as a factory without noise <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> cover...|$|R
50|$|This makes manual {{handling}} in a glove box with only <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> (as commonly done with plutonium) too hazardous, (except possibly {{in a short}} period immediately following chemical separation of the uranium from its decay products) and instead requiring complex remote manipulation for fuel fabrication.|$|R

2500|$|The huge glowing {{radiators}} {{mounted to}} the engines dissipate their heat, and the enormously long central truss, {{with its own}} protective coolers and reflectors, protects the cargo and crew modules from the engines' heat and radiation using the simple rule of r-squared attenuation rather than heavy shielding. (Yes, [...] really thinks {{about this kind of}} stuff and explains it very clearly in text and in person.) The ship has a pair of centrifugal-gravity-gen modules for the crew who remain awake for the duration, which has become a pretty typical feature of quasi-realistic ship designs in movies. But one unique feature it has which directly relates to the sub-light realistic travel is a cascade-style shield stack to protect the speeding craft from interstellar debris. Jim's [...] completely explains this technology, apparently based on current NASA research, and how it obliterates potentially catastrophic particles by letting them slam through a series of thin, <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube {{of the telescope}} and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across {{the field of view}} which reduces contrast. Light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> (also usable as a dew shield) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation. In one Italian regional lighting code this effect of stray light is defined as [...] "optical pollution", {{due to the fact that}} there is a direct path from the light source to the [...] "optic" [...] – the observer's eye or telescope.|$|E
2500|$|The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager {{designed}} for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument {{is equipped with}} a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromatic CCD imager with a [...] aperture giving a resolution of 5μrad (~1arcsec). The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation, and isolation {{from the rest of the}} structure. The Ritchey–Chretien mirrors and metering structure are made of silicon carbide, to boost stiffness, reduce weight, and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite <b>light</b> <b>shield,</b> and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is , with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about , for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed by Herschel). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixel JPEG images. These public images do not contain the full dynamic range of brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files.|$|E
5000|$|The Ka-Tsu's {{primary purpose}} was to {{transport}} cargo and/or troops ashore. It was unarmored apart from some <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> for the crew. Its engine compartment and electric final drives were hermetically sealed, as {{it was intended to}} be launched from a submarine. The twin drive propeller shafts were designed to retract [...] "into their ducts" [...] once the vehicle reached the beach.|$|R

40|$|Summary of Research {{that was}} part of the grant: NASA NAG 5 - 13405 : Magnetic Characterization of Micro Shutters for James Web Space Telescope (JWST) Period: May 1 2003 -October 31 2005 The above funding {{resulted}} in following major achievements related to microshutter system for JWST. 1. The original rectangular pattern of magnetic material was changed into magnetic striped pattern to prevent unnecessary twisting during the actuation. The Original geometry favored magnetic remanence vector being oriented along the longer side of the shutter and thus resulting torque caused out of plane twist. Stripe pattern minimizes the out of plane motion and thus prolongs the life-time of microshutter device. 2. We built a new magnetic system (magnetic rotisserie) allowing an accelerated life test of microshutters at various temperatures. This system identified that shutter are capable to withstand as many as several millions of actuating cycles. Our system also identified fabrication related features, like bowing with temperature, collisions with the frame due to misalignment, delaminating of the <b>light</b> <b>shields</b> due to uncontrolled voltage release and poorly fabricated <b>light</b> <b>shields...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1944 the Bechelaren was {{returned}} to duty on the lower Danube. On the night of April 5-6, 1944, while escorting a convoy, the vessel was damaged by planes of the Red Air Force. After repairs, it {{was returned}} to service at Visegrád in Hungary. Later it returned to Linz, where (since 66mm ammunition was no longer being manufactured) its four 66 mm guns were replaced with two 88 mm naval guns with <b>light</b> <b>shields.</b>|$|R

50|$|Her stay at Saipan was {{not without}} incident. On 30 July, shortly after midnight, a {{tremendous}} explosion rocked the area; the concussion from the blast blew in the plywood <b>light</b> <b>shields</b> at the William Ward Burrows hatches facing the island. Japanese infiltrators had detonated a cache of 84 tons of dynamite. Boats from the ship put out to investigate, but could only ascertain that damage to the dump had been done and the guards had disappeared, probably killed in the blast.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to reduce the attractiveness of the building to pests, {{and one of the}} ways that this can be achieved is through the lighting. A museum should use <b>light</b> <b>shields,</b> curtains, and keep windows closed to minimize the attractiveness of entering the building. Any “lighting affixed to the building should be made with sodium vapor and not mercury” and should have a yellowish tint. Sodium vapor repels insects, and installing these lights outside of the building can help reduce the pests.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> by intracellular gas vacuoles in Halobacterium salinarium strain 5 {{was examined}} {{by looking at}} the ultraviolet light inactivation curves of both wild-type cells and mutants which are defective in the production of gas vacuoles. Whereas strains defective in gas vacuole production were slightly more sensitive to ultraviolet inactivation, no significant differences in ultraviolet sensitivity were seen, indicating that these subcellular inclusion bodies are not effective as light-shielding organelles. In addition, it was shown that ultraviolet light acts as a plasmid-curing agent in Halobacterium...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, navigational buoys {{were used to}} monitor Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel), an aquatic {{invasive}} species in Otsego Lake, New York. Buoys {{from the north and}} south sites of Otsego Lake were taken out of the water on December 29 and December 31, 2012, respectively, after being in the water since April 14, 2012. All sampled mussels were frozen until further analyzed; an electronic caliper and compound microscope were used to measure shell lengths. We observed growth, settlement, and density of each colonized buoy and determined that <b>light</b> <b>shielded</b> bottom sides of the buoy had the most colonization whereas the shallowest submersed side had the least. Shell length of mussels from the south site was significantly larger than those from the north site. The mussels from the metal anchor-chain ring at the deepest end of the buoy were the largest, while no difference was found among the rest. Colonization of zebra mussels can be due to specific substrate types and amount of nutrition available in the habitat. Additionally research is recommended comparing buoy designs to determine if buoys without <b>light</b> <b>shielded</b> bottoms will be less colonized.
