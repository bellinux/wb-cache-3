5000|$|When {{he bought}} {{her from the}} Admiralty through his secret agent on November 14, Commander Matthew F. Maury had {{intended}} Rappahannock to replace the cruiser [...] {{and was about to}} transfer Georgias guns to her. She was ideal for a cruiser [...] - [...] wooden-hulled and bark-rigged with two engines and a <b>lifting</b> <b>screw</b> propeller.|$|E
50|$|Shannon {{could use}} both sail or steam power. While steam was much {{preferred}} for combat, sail propulsion was considered vital for a ship intended to operate worldwide. She {{was given a}} <b>lifting</b> <b>screw</b> {{in order to increase}} her efficiency under sail, the last Royal Navy warship to be so equipped. She had three masts, and was initially given a ship rig with 24000 ft² of sail, a point insisted on by the Director of Naval Operations, Capt. Hood. In service, this was reduced to a barque rig with 21500 ft². She was equipped with Laird two-cylinder compound engines, the high-pressure cylinders being 44 in in diameter and the low-pressure cylinders 85 in. Steam came from eight cylindrical boilers at 70 lb pressure. Her design top speed was 13 knots (24 km/h), but her best actual speed was 12.25 knots (23 km/h). To reduce fouling, she had zinc and wood sheathing on her hull.|$|E
60|$|Except for {{the first}} day and night out from Queenstown, when the ship rolled and pitched with {{straining}} and squeaking noises, and a thumping of the <b>lifted</b> <b>screws,</b> there was no rough weather, and at last the ocean was livid and oily, with a long swell, on which she swayed with no perceptible motion save from her machinery.|$|R
60|$|He slept soundly, and did {{not hear}} {{the roar of the}} engines below him when the Adelaide flung her stern out and the <b>lifted</b> <b>screw</b> whirred madly in the air. The thud of green water on her deck passed unheeded too, though the second heard it as he watched the maze of clanking, banging steel, until the young third {{relieved}} him. The latter came down dripping, and shook a little shower of brine off him when he stopped beside his superior.|$|R

5000|$|Viper was an {{armoured}} gunboat of the breastwork type. Her hull was of iron construction, with 10 in of teak backing. [...] Vertical trunks {{were provided}} at the stern to <b>lift</b> the <b>screws</b> {{clear of the}} hull, thereby allowing a better hull-form for purely wind-driven sailing.|$|R
60|$|Appleby {{crouched}} at {{the foot}} of the mast with straining eyes. He could see the long black strip of hull swing with the heave until all the deck, which caught a flash of the dim moonlight, was visible. Then it swung back with slanted spars and funnel, and there was a white frothing about the tip of the <b>lifted</b> <b>screw.</b> It was evident that the gunboat would pass them unpleasantly close, and already the black shape of the man upon her forecastle was discernible against the sky, while hazy figures upon her slanting bridge grew into sharper form, and it seemed to Appleby that they could scarcely escape observation. Still, a boat lying low on the dusky water is difficult to see, and while he held his breath the war vessel drew abreast of them.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a combined theoretical and experimental investigation conducted at the Georgia School of Technology on the static thrust of the <b>lifting</b> air <b>screw</b> of the type used in modern autogiros and helicopters. The theoretical part of this study is based on Glauert's analysis but certain modifications are made that further clarify and simplify the problem. Of these changes the elimination of the solidity as an independent parameter is the most important. The experimental data were obtained from tests on four rotor models of two, four, and five blades and, in general, agree quite well with the theoretical calculations. The theory indicates a method of evaluating scale effects on <b>lifting</b> air <b>screws,</b> and these corrections have been applied to the model results to derive general full-scale static thrust, torque, and figure-of-merit curves for constant-chord, constant-incidence rotors. Convenient charts are included that enable hovering flight performance to be calculated rapidly...|$|R
50|$|The gun car was {{positioned}} over the pit, the wheels were locked and the platform was locked into position with gun mount and car's weight {{shifted from the}} trucks (bogies) directly to the ground by jacks and <b>lifting</b> <b>screws.</b> The rails were removed from above the pit because the gun breech was too wide to pass between them. The gun could elevate up to 43°, which gave it a maximum range of 42,000 yards (23.8 miles/38.4 km), and could be traversed 2.5° left and right of center. Any greater change of direction required the gun to be moved forward or backward along its curved track and a new recoil pit dug. The gun used the standard naval gun mounting and recoil system, {{with the addition of}} a pneumatic system to assist the runout springs to return the gun to firing position after recoil at the higher maximum elevation of 43° compared to maximum 30° in naval use.|$|R
40|$|The North Wastewater Treatment Plant of Ciudad Juárez (the Plant) had odor and {{corrosion}} {{problems associated}} with hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) gases emitted by daily plant operations. There have been many odor concerns from residents living near the Plant, namely those on the United States of the border. After several attempts to remediate the situation, the Plant implemented the use of surface cover and Sol-Air Ultraviolet (UV) units to reduce the H 2 S emissions. ^ A three-phase air impact study was performed to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} UV units in reducing the H 2 S emissions from the entrance canal and <b>lift</b> <b>screw</b> areas at the Plant. Onsite meteorological measurements and on- and offsite H 2 S concentrations were collected to quantify the concentrations of H 2 S prior to and after the installation of surface cover and UV systems at the Plant. H 2 S impact on the surrounding areas were estimated using the emission rates, developed from field data and emission models, and an U. S. EPA preferred air dispersion model, AERMOD.

5000|$|Vixen was an {{armoured}} gunboat of the breastwork type. Her hull was of composite construction, {{with iron}} frames and iron bulwarks, {{but with an}} outer cladding of 140 mm teak over the entire hull. [...] An armoured citadel protected her machinery and the ram bow was reinforced by massive ironwork structures. Underwater, her hull was sheathed in copper to prevent marine growth. Vertical trunks were provided at the stern to <b>lift</b> the <b>screws</b> clear of the hull, thereby allowing a better hull-form for purely wind-driven sailing.|$|R

50|$|In the Netherlands, the tjasker is a {{drainage}} mill {{with common}} sails connected to an Archimedean screw. This {{is used for}} pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot. The Archimedean <b>screw</b> <b>lifts</b> water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.|$|R
60|$|Although {{the muscular}} effort was not great, {{steering}} was hard. Mossamedes rode high above {{water and the}} gale pressed upon her side; the combers <b>lifted</b> her, and <b>screw</b> and rudder could not get proper hold. Sometimes she came up to windward and rolled until the white seas swept her rail; sometimes she yawed to lee. Kit saw the bows circle and pictured the compass spinning in its bowl.|$|R
50|$|The {{drive to}} {{the larger of the}} two Archimedes' screws that drain the polder is from a 38-cog gear wheel meshing with the great spur wheel.

2500|$|The Post Office {{commissioned}} a new design of pillar box in 1980 from {{a panel of}} three competing designers. The competition was won by Tony Gibbs and his design, which {{was thought to be}} ultra-modern at the time, was designated Type K by the Post Office. Made in traditional cast iron, it stayed in production until 2000. Notable features included: replaceable <b>lifting</b> ring <b>screwed</b> into the dome of the box, body and roof of box cast as one piece, large easy-to-read collection time plate, all surface details and collection plate window recessed to give a perfect cylindrical outline, integral restrictor plate, know colloquially as a [...] "Belfast Flap" [...] to restrict posting to letters only and a flanged shallow base suitable for installation in modern buildings, shopping centres and other urban areas. These boxes were thus much easier to move and handle as they could be rolled over level ground or lifted by crane into position. The design had one major flaw {{in the area of the}} door hinge, which is prone to snap under stress and the K type pillar boxes are no longer being installed.|$|R
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the <b>lift.</b> The <b>screw</b> version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket. The ram may have a second screwed ram within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|R

60|$|Standing on a slanted {{platform}} {{with his hand}} on the throttle, he waited for the lurch that <b>lifted</b> the spinning <b>screw.</b> When the blades left the water, the engines raced with a horrible din and he must cut off steam. If he let the engines go, something might break when the propeller got hold again. The work demanded a firm but delicate touch, since the pressure must change with the swiftly-changing load. One could not argue when the bows would plunge and the stern swing clear; one must know instinctively. The muscular effort was not hard, but Lister's face was wet with sweat, and when he was slow and the engine-room rang with the clash of machinery his heart beat. The big columns that held the cylinders rocked; crank and connecting-rod spun too fast for him to see. There was a confusing flash of steel and a daunting uproar.|$|R
