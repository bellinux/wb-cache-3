2500|$|The most {{important}} northern Aché ritual was the club-fight. These events were organized by [...] "big men" [...] and took place once {{every year or}} two. Several bands would converge on a single camping area. Those who invited the others would prepare a cleared area in which to do ritual combat. Men prepared <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> clubs with sharpened edges (paddle-shaped), and decorated themselves with charcoal (mixed with honey and saliva) and vulture down. Although club fights consisted of hosting and invited teams of men, after the fighting began all men were free to choose opponents from either group. Men faced off and took turns swinging at each other's heads. Some men were hit directly {{on the top of}} the head and sustained fractured skulls, that later healed, but with tell-tale signs of combat. Other men dodged the clubs, but might be hit on the arms or shoulders. [...] Some men died in almost every large clubfighting event. Sometimes clubfighting would also emerge spontaneously within a small residential band, when one man was caught having sexual relations with another man's wife. These types of duels were never lethal. In all clubfights, some bystanders (including women) would rush in and try to hamper or disarm men who were in combat with their father, sons or brothers.|$|E
60|$|At last I {{came to a}} crowd, and in {{the midst}} of it, one of those great French merry-go-rounds turned by machinery, with {{pictures}} of languishing ladies round the central column. All the way from the Champs Elysees the huge piece of fool's tackle had lumbered and creaked hither across the sea to Martinique, and was now making the round of the islands, and a very profitable round, to judge from the number of its customers. The hobby-horses swarmed with Negresses and Hindoos of the lower order. The Negresses, I am sorry to say, forgot themselves, kicked up their legs, shouted to the bystanders, and were altogether incondite. The Hindoo women, though showing much more of their limbs than the Negresses, kept them gracefully together, drew their veils round their heads, and sat coyly, half frightened, half amused, to the delight of their papas, or husbands, who had in some cases to urge them to get up and ride, while they stood by, as on guard, with the <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> quarter staff in hand.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1989 {{specifically}} for walkers on the Thames Path. Formerly there was a ferry at this point which took the towpath across the river when it was used for towing barges. At 88 yards, it is the <b>longest</b> <b>hardwood</b> bridge in Britain.|$|R

6000|$|Another {{thing was}} {{noteworthy}} about the Coolies, {{at the very}} first glance, and all we saw afterwards proved that that first glance was correct; I mean their fondness for children. If you took notice of a child, not only the mother smiled thanks and delight, but the men around likewise, as if a compliment had been paid to their whole company. We saw afterwards almost daily proofs of the Coolie men's fondness for their children; of their fondness also--an excellent sign that the morale is not destroyed at the root--for dumb animals. [...] A Coolie cow or donkey is petted, led about tenderly, tempted with tit-bits. Pet animals, {{where they can be}} got, are the Coolie's delight, as they are the delight of the wild Indian. I wish I could say the same of the Negro. His treatment of his children and of his beasts of burden is, but too often, as exactly opposed to that of the Coolie as are his manners. No wonder that the two races do not, and it is to be feared never will, amalgamate; that the Coolie, shocked by the unfortunate awkwardness of gesture and vulgarity of manners of the average Negro, and still more of the Negress, looks on them as savages; while the Negro, in his turn hates the Coolie as a hard-working interloper, and despises him as a heathen; or that heavy fights between the two races arise now and then, in which the Coolie, in spite of his slender limbs, has generally the advantage over the burly Negro, by dint of his greater courage, and the terrible quickness with which he wields his beloved weapon, the <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> quarterstaff.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to compare solid wood flooring to engineered wood flooring due to {{the wide range of}} quality in both product categories, particularly engineered. Solid wood has some limitations. Recommended maximum widths and lengths are typically 5" [...] / 127mm wide and 7' / 2100mm <b>long.</b> Solid <b>hardwood</b> is also more prone to [...] "gapping" [...] (excessive space between planks), [...] "crowning" [...] (convex curving upwards when humidity increases) and [...] "cupping" [...] (a [...] or [...] "dished" [...] appearance of the plank, with the height of the plank along its longer edges being higher than the centre) with increased plank size. Solid wood CANNOT be used with underfloor radiant heating. However extra care is necessary with the planning and installation of the heating system and the wood flooring, such as limiting the temperature to 85 F, avoid sharp temperature fluctuations, utilizing an outdoor thermostat to anticipate heating demands, and monitoring the moisture content for the subfloor before installation.|$|R
50|$|To Māori, {{weapons were}} more than just {{implements}} of warfare — they were taonga (treasures), and handed down as precious heirlooms from generation to generation. Weapons were made of wood, stone and bone in a slow, painstaking process. Traditionally, a <b>long</b> weapon from <b>hardwood</b> could take months to shape and decorate; a stone patu would take over a year to complete. Though it took time to fashion weapons, the level of dedication and pride in creating these objects made them valuable. Karakia (incantations) were sometimes said over weapons to imbue them with deities and make them tapu (sacred).|$|R
50|$|The torimono sandōgu {{consisted}} of the sodegarami (sleeve entangler), sasumata (spear fork) and tsukubo (push pole). All three implements were mounted on <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> poles usually around 2 meters in length, sharp metal barbs or spines attached to metal strips covered one end of these implements to keep the person being captured from grabbing the pole. The {{opposite end of the}} pole would have a metal cap, or ishizuki like those found on naginata and other pole weapons. Torimono sandōgu implements were designed to entangle, restrain and obstruct criminals rather than injure them.|$|E

5000|$|A kora is a mandinka harp {{built from}} a large {{calabash}} cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> neck. The skin is supported by two handles that run under it. It supports a notched double free-standing bridge. It doesn't fit into any one category of musical instruments, but rather several, and must be classified as a [...] "double-bridge-harp-lute". The strings run in two divided ranks, making it a double harp. They do not end in a soundboard but are held in notches on a bridge, making it a bridge harp. They originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber, making it a lute too.|$|E
30|$|Generally, the “cutting” by {{the threads}} of {{increment}} bores produces no sawdust during coring. Apart from a “cutting” increment borer type, {{there is a}} “sawing” increment bore type, which utilizes a plug cutter instead of cutting edge {{at the tip of}} the bit [2]. The plug cutter produces sawdust (or splints) when coring. One of the main advantages of the sawing increment borer is its reduced friction on the outside of the drill compared to cutting increment borer. The sawing increment borer requires smaller torque for coring, and therefore is suited for sampling <b>long</b> cores of <b>hardwood</b> (e.g., “Dendrobohrer” by Pressler GmbH) [3]. The disadvantage is longer time required for coring.|$|R

5000|$|Officers in the Korean army came {{exclusively}} from the aristocracy, {{but unlike the}} highly militarist Japanese aristocracy trained to be soldiers from their youth onward, for the Korean aristocracy scholarship was valued and war was disparaged as something unworthy of a Confucian gentleman-scholar. The quality of Korean generalship was very variable with some Korean officers being able and others being men who had not devoted much time {{to the study of}} war. Korean infantrymen wore a Chinese style helmet, but no armor. The standard Korean sword was a two-edged, straight blade. A uniquely Korean weapon was the flail, a 1.5m <b>long</b> <b>hardwood</b> stick, painted red, acting as the handle for a chain attached to a shaft with iron nails. The Korean infantrymen often fought as archers, and a Japanese source from 1592 commented Koreans were superior as soldiers to the Japanese only as archers because Korean bows had a range of 450m against 300m of Japanese archers. The standard Korean gun was the sŭngja (victory gun), a simple arquebus inferior to the guns used by the Japanese. Korean artillery however was much superior to Japanese artillery, and unlike the Japanese, the Koreans had built ships capable of carrying heavy cannons. Turnbull wrote that Korea's salvation was its navy.

40|$|International audienceFicus {{species are}} {{multipurpose}} trees well known by rural populations in Sahelian and Sudanian zones of Africa. Their uses are well documented but their amenability for vegetative propagation {{has not been}} extensively studied. This paper compares the rooting ability of stem and aerial root cuttings from thirteen Ficus species found in West Africa. It highlights the differences between species belonging to the sub-genera Sycomorus and Urostigma. The former show no capacity to propagate from cuttings whereas the latter, with epiphytic development, can be propagated by cuttings, although this capacity varies among species. Thus, F. thonningii, F. leprieurii and F. ovata are easily propagated, while F. platyphylla and F. elasticoides are propagated with difficulty. The rooting capacity also varies depending on the cutting material used. It decreases in the following order: <b>long</b> leafless <b>hardwood</b> cuttings (pole) > nodal cuttings > apical cuttings. Rooting potential increases when the cuttings are harvested {{towards the end of}} the dry season(March to May). Aerial root can be used for cuttings in all species of the sub-genus Urostigma. The capacity of root cuttings to regenerate is greatest when cuttings are collected at the beginning of the dry season (November). In this case, wound-induced adventitious roots arise at the basal end of the cutting while de novo buds are developed from the cambium at the distal end. The subsequent morphological development is identical to that of a stem cutting. These results clarify and allow the optimal use of the knowledge and methods developed by the indigenous people of the Sahel and could assist and promote fig tree (Ficus sp.) domestication in the dry tropics...|$|R

Recent analysis of the sword has determined that it is a 15th-century design, and probably made in London. The blade itself is thought to have been fitted in the late 16th or 17th century. It is possible that the sword was made for the 1422 Tynwald meeting that was attended by Sir John Stanley. The sword has a two-edged steel blade, 29 inches <b>long,</b> with a <b>hardwood</b> hilt, 9 inches long, which tapers from the guard to the pommel.
