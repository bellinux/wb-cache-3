40|$|Oil prices, {{inventory}} levels, {{and utilization}} rates {{are influenced by}} changes that are transmitted horizontally and/or vertically through the energy supply chain. We define horizontal transmissions as changes that are generated by linkages among fuels at a similar stage of processing while vertical transmissions are changes that are generated by upstream/downstream linkages in the oil supply chain. Here, we investigate vertical and horizontal transmissions by estimating vector error correction models (VECMs) that represent relationships among {{the price of crude}} oil, US refinery utilization rates, US stocks of crude oil, US stocks of <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline,</b> the US price of <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline,</b> and the US price of a substitute fuel, natural gas. Causal relationships estimated from both weekly and quarterly observations indicate that the price of crude oil is an important gateway for disturbances to the oil supply chain. Impulse response functions indicate that disturbances to crude oil prices ripple down the oil supply chain and affect inventory behaviors, refinery utilization rates, and the price of <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline,</b> and are transmitted laterally to the natural gas market.

This paper studies the impact of fuel ethanol on <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline</b> market, especially how the gasoline price will be affected if fuel ethanol takes a big share of motor fuel consumption. A system of structural equations is estimated over historical data to simulate the <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline</b> market. The proportion of fuel and additive use ethanol is calculated in the historical period. Ethanol supply is treated as a substitute to <b>motor</b> <b>gasoline</b> in the future and set to increase exogenously as mandated in scenarios. Projections for period 2008 to 2022 are made.
