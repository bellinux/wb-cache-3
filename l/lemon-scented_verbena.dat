60|$|It was {{the little}} flower-pot, in which I had planted a spray of <b>lemon-scented</b> <b>verbena,</b> which Viola had long coveted. I {{explained}} how Harold had presided over it as an offering from the Hydriot Company to its youngest shareholder, and her delight was extreme. She said she would keep it for ever in her own room; it was just what she wanted, the prettiest thing she had had--so kind of him; but those great, grand giants never thought anything too little for them. And then she went into one of her despairs. She had prepared a number of Christmas presents for the people about the castle to whom {{she had always been}} like the child of the house, and her maid had forgotten to bring the box she had packed, nor was there any means of getting them, unless she could persuade her brother to send early the next morning.|$|E
40|$|The drying {{target is}} to reduce the {{moisture}} content and thereby increase the life time of products by limiting enzymatic and oxidative degradation. In addition, by reducing the amount of water, the percentages of active principles are increased in relation to the total mass. The aim of the current {{study was to determine the}} correct diffusion rate and activation energy by adapting the mathematical model according to the experimental data. Brazilian <b>lemon-scented</b> <b>verbena</b> leaves were harvested with a moisture content of around 85 % wet basis (wb), and were then subjected to drying in a medicinal plant dryer at an air temperatures of 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 ºC at 0. 29 ± 0. 03 m. s- 1. Approximately 400 g of leaves at a layer thickness of 0. 15 m were used with three tests performed at each temperature. Several models of drying kinetics were adapted for use with the experimental data, including Henderson & Pabis, Henderson & modified Pabis, Lewis, Midilli et al., Page, Thompson and Wang & Singh. The adjusted determination coefficients (R 2), relative mean errors (P), estimated errors (SE) and residue distributions were all compared. The best models, which best represented the Brazilian <b>lemon-scented</b> <b>verbena</b> drying, were Midilli et al. and Page. The calculated effective diffusivity coefficients ranged from 2. 91 x 10 - 12 to 11. 71 x 10 - 12 m 2. s- 1 for the studied temperature range. The activation energy for the diffusion of water was 31. 79 kJ. mol- 1...|$|E
