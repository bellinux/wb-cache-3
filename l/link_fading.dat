40|$|A channel {{model for}} time-variant {{multi-link}} wireless body area networks (WBANs) is proposed in this paper, {{based on an}} extensive measurement campaign using a multi-port channel sounder. A total of 12 nodes {{were placed on the}} body to measure the multi-link channel within the created WBAN. The resulting empirical model takes into account the received power, the <b>link</b> <b>fading</b> statistics, and the link auto- and cross-correlations. The distance dependence of the received power is investigated, and the <b>link</b> <b>fading</b> is modeled by a log-normal distribution. The link autocorrelation function is divided into a decaying component and a sinusoidal component to account for the periodical movement of the limbs caused by walking. The cross-correlation between different links is also shown to be high for a number of specific on-body links. Finally, the model is validated by considering several extraction-independent validation metrics: multi-hop link capacity, level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD). The capacity aims at validating the path-loss and fading model, while the LCR and AFD aim at validating the temporal behavior. For all validation metrics, the model is shown to satisfactorily reproduce the measurements, whereas its limits are pointed out. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|In general, the {{different}} links of a broadcast channel may experience different fading dynamics and, potentially, unequal or hybrid channel state information (CSI) conditions. The faster the fading and the shorter the fading block length, the more often the link {{needs to be}} trained and estimated at the receiver, and the more likely that CSI is stale or unavailable at the transmitter. Disparity of <b>link</b> <b>fading</b> dynamics {{in the presence of}} CSI limitations can be modeled by a multi-user broadcast channel with both non-identical <b>link</b> <b>fading</b> block lengths as well as dissimilar link CSIR/CSIT conditions. This paper investigates a MISO broadcast channel where some receivers experience longer coherence intervals (static receivers) and have CSIR, while some other receivers experience shorter coherence intervals (dynamic receivers) and do not enjoy free CSIR. We consider a variety of CSIT conditions for the above mentioned model, including no CSIT, delayed CSIT, or hybrid CSIT. To investigate the degrees of freedom region, we employ interference alignment and beamforming along with a product superposition that allows simultaneous but non-contaminating transmission of pilots and data to different receivers. Outer bounds employ the extremal entropy inequality as well as a bounding of the performance of a discrete memoryless multiuser multilevel broadcast channel. For several cases, inner and outer bounds are established that either partially meet, or the gap diminishes with increasing coherence times.

Increased capacity is achieved by introducing additional spatial channels which are exploited using space-time coding. The spatial diversity improves the link reliability by reducing the adverse effects of <b>link</b> <b>fading</b> and shadowing. The choice of coding and the resulting performance improvement are dependent upon the channel phenomenology. In this paper, experimental channel-probing estimates are reported for outdoor environments near the personal communication services frequency allocation (1790 MHz). A simple channel parameterization is introduced. Channel distance metrics are introduced. Because the bandwidth of the channel-probing signal (1. 3 MHz) is sufficient to resolve some delays in outdoor environments, frequency-selective fading is also investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION Due to rapid advances in the area of wireless communications and Internet, provision of data services for applications like e-mail, web browsing, telnet, etc., over wireless is gaining importance.

40|$|Abstract—The {{total cost}} of an Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) can be {{substantially}} decreased by using Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), which are inexpensive computer net-works whose nodes communicate wirelessly using a license-free spectrum in a self-organized manner. The Early Warning System triggers on the small-amplitude, but fast P-wave in order to shutdown critical infrastructures before the destructive, but slow S-waves arrive {{only a few seconds}} later. It demands low-latency communications of high robustness. We conducted shakeboard-based measurements using IEEE 802. 11 a/b. Innovatively, our tests show that already for the slight shaking related to P-waves representative for strong (Mw> 6) and nearby (epicentral distance < 40 km) earthquakes, the performance of the wireless communications can be considerably affected at the very moment when the Early Warning system is supposed to be used. We observed swift link quality oscillations of up to 10 dB within only half a second. The more an environment is vulnerable to multi-path interference and shadow fading, e. g. no line of sight (NLOS), the more erratic are the wireless links between nodes. However, for clear line of sight (LOS) the influence of the vibrations is negligible. We recommend several measures that should be applied {{in order to make the}} unique use case of Earthquake Early Warning, nonetheless, well-functioning on top of a Wireless Mesh Network. A higher fade margin, in our setup at least an additional 5 dB, should be included to cope with sudden <b>link</b> <b>fading.</b> Moreover, antenna diversity should be enabled as it strongly mitigates the adverse effects of shaking...|$|E
40|$|Sensing in {{opportunistic}} spectrum access (OSA) has {{a responsibility}} to detect the available channel by performing binary hypothesis as busy or idle states. If channel is busy, secondary user (SU) cannot access and refrain from data transmission. SU is allowed to access when primary user (PU) does not use it (idle states). However, channel is sensed on imperfect communication <b>link.</b> <b>Fading,</b> noise and any obstacles existed can cause sensing errors in PU signal detection. False alarm detects idle states as a busy channel while miss-identification detects busy states as an idle channel. False detection makes SU refrain from transmission and reduces number of bits transmitted. On the other hand, miss-identification causes SU collide to PU transmission. This paper study the performance of OSA based on the greedy approach with sensing errors by the restriction of maximum collision probability allowed (collision threshold) by PU network. The throughput of SU and spectrum capacity metric is used to evaluate OSA performance and make comparisons to those ones without sensing error as function of number of slot based on the greedy approach. The relations between throughput and signal to noise ratio (SNR) with different collision probability as well as false detection with different SNR are presented. According to the obtained results show that CR users can gain the reward from the previous slot for both of with and without sensing errors. It is indicated by the throughput improvement as slot number increases. However, sensing on imperfect channel with sensing errors can degrade the throughput performance. Subsequently, the throughput of SU and spectrum capacity improves by increasing maximum collision probability allowed by PU network as well. Due to frequent collision with PU, the throughput of SU and spectrum capacity decreases at certain value of collision threshold. Computer simulation is used to evaluate and validate these works...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of the TCP protocol [Pos 81], which is used for reliable, connectionoriented transfer of information. Since TCP will interpret a bit error introduced during a <b>link</b> <b>fade</b> as an indication of congestion, {{it is important to understand}} the performance implications of allowing the satellite link to operate at a non-zero bit error rate. Mitigation of fade-induced bit errors carries a cost in the form of increased power requirements or the need for error correction, which requires additional bandwidth and circuitry. Allowing the bit error rate on the link to rise too much will leave the satellite user with poor performance, and use link capacity for retransmission of damaged packets. It is therefore important to understand the maximum error rate at which TCP can operate with acceptable performance. This paper reports on an experimental investigation of this question using the NASA ACTS satellite during user-induced fades. The focus of this study is twofold.

30|$|The mobile {{worldwide}} interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) {{system is}} defined as a broadband wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) in the IEEE 802.16 e standard [1]. It aims to provide broadband wireless services anytime and anywhere by connecting mobile devices to base stations (BSs). In 2009, the WiMAX system was launched in Taiwan. WiMAX users in Taiwan numbered approximately 135, 500 at the end of March 2013. Both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) modulation technologies are used in the WiMAX system. In an OFDM system, a frame is composed of sub-channels with several sub-carriers. Each sub-channel consists of symbols in the time domain [2] and sub-carriers in the frequency domain. The two types of data channel are the uplink channel (UL) in which data are sent from mobile station (MS) to the BS and the downlink channel (DL) in which data are sent from the BS to MS. These channels operate in a bandwidth that is distributed over 1.25 – 20  MHz, based on the available frequency resources and service demands. The WiMAX physical layer selects appropriate frames that are adapted to the time division duplex (TDD) mode for uplink and downlink directions to meet the user’s demands. The OFDMA in mobile WiMAX systems is used to alleviate the adverse effect of multipath fading in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. The OFDMA multiplexes multiple data streams onto DL and UL sub-channels [3]. In an OFDMA system, a data stream is divided into several parallel sub-streams with a reduced data rate (increasing the symbol duration), and each sub-stream is modulated and transmitted on a separate orthogonal sub-carrier. Five service types that are considered in mobile WiMAX systems are unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), extended rtPS (ertPS), non-real-time polling service (nrtPS), and best effort service (BES) [3]. In this work, to allocate the resources for data bursts [4], three services, voice service at a constant bit rate (CBR), video service at a variable bit rate (VBR), and the VBR data service, are considered. IEEE 802.16 defines burst profiles based on the combination of the modulation and coding schemes in each connection of physical configuration to adapt the data rate for the user. To compensate for the adverse effects of radio <b>link</b> <b>fading,</b> interference, and noise effects [4], many radio resource management (RRM) techniques have been developed, improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless transmission [5]. Channel aware technology enables a BS to choose the modulation and coding scheme based on the carrier-to-interference noise ratio (CINR) by link adaptation. In IEEE 802.16 e, the CINR of every mobile station changes dynamically. Many RRM algorithms have been presented to assign OFDMA slots according to the channel conditions for meeting user’s demand [6]. However, no WiMAX standard for optimal slot allocation has been defined.|$|E
