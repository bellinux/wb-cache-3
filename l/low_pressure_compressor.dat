25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (<b>low</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>compressor,</b> which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E

40|$|Using {{analytical}} mathematical modeling {{techniques for}} the system components, an attempt is made to gauge the destabilizing effects {{in a number of}} compressor designs. In particular the overhung (or cantilevered) compressor designs and the straddle-mounted (or simply supported) compressor designs are examined. Recommendations are made, based on experiences with stable and unstable compressors, which can be used as guides in future designs. High and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors</b> which operate well above their fundamental rotor-bearing lateral natural frequencies can suffer from destructive subsynchronous vibration. Usually the elements in the system design which contribute to this vibration, other than the shafting and the bearings, are the seals (both gas labyrinth and oil breakdown bushings) and the aerodynamic components...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. A {{reliable}} and practical method of modelling nonlinear dynamic systems is essential. Traditionally these {{systems have been}} modelled {{by the use of}} parameterised models. An alternative available to model nonlinear dynamic systems is artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks are powerful empirical modelling tools that can be trained to mimic complicated multi-input, multi-output nonlinear dynamic systems. The system that is investigated for the modelling purpose is the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, or more specifically the high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors</b> of the Pebble Bed Micro Model. In order to utilize the best neural networks topology and configuration, neural networks were compared. In the comparison of the neural networks, the execution time, final error, maximum amplitude error, number of epochs used and convergence speed were investigated. All these variables were compared for both time-delayed feedforward and recurrent networks. The learning algorithms used to train the neural networks include the Levenberg-Marquardt, resilient back-propagation, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-Newton, one step secant, gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum algorithms. The neural networks were successfully applied on both the high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors</b> and a high level of modelling accuracy was obtained in all the test instances. The applied Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, in conjunction with the appropriate network topology, presents the optimal results. This study showed that neural networks provide a fast, stable and accurate method of modelling nonlinear dynamic systems and provide a viable alternative to existing methods for modelling nonlinear dynamic systems. The results obtained showed that the accuracy and performance of the different topologies used, is directly subjective to the complexity of the system being modelled. The methodology that is used can also be applied to any linear or nonlinear, static or dynamic system. Master...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of the PW1120, according to Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) specifications, started in June 1980. It retained the F100 core module, gearbox, fuel pump, forward ducts, {{as well as the}} F100 digital electronic control, with only minor modifications. Unique PW1120 components included a wide chord <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> (LP) <b>compressor,</b> single-stage uncooled <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> (LP) turbine, simplified single stream augmentor, and a lightweight convergent/divergent nozzle. Full scale testing was initiated in June 1982, and flight clearance of the PW1120 was tested in August 1984. The PW1120 had 70 percent similarity with the F100, so the IDF/AF would not need a special facility for spare parts. It would be built under licence by Bet-Shemesh Engines Limited in Israel.|$|R

He holds a BSME from the University of Colorado. David began his career with GE Aircraft Engines in 1985 working on such projects as T 700, GE 36, CFE 738, F 412, GE 90, and CF 34 - 8 C engines designing rotating engine structures (high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressors,</b> high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> turbines). David also conducted the life re-certification analysis for the CT 7 - 5 LPT and similar work for the CT 7 - 9 LPT. In 1996 David founded Peregrine Consulting, Inc. and has served as an expert consultant to name brand turbomachinery OEMs since. Current supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycles are recuperated cycles {{because of the large}} amount of heat left after expansion through the turbine. The high level of efficiency of SCO 2 cycles is largely owing to the use of recuperators to recapture this heat. However this characteristic has made it difficult to incorporate closed-cycle SCO 2 designs in applications where air-combustible fuels such as fossil fuels are the source of heat. For air-combustible heat sources the ability to transfer the heat of combustion into the cycle is greatly inhibited by the hig...|$|R
50|$|The Kuznetsov NK-8 is a two-spool {{turbofan}} engine - with two low pressure turbines driving the fan and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> and one high pressure turbine driving the higher {{stages of the}} compressor.As the No. 2 engine's low-pressure shaft failed in the engine due to metal fatigue, the low-pressure turbine become suddenly physically separated from the low-pressure compressor, freeing the turbine. Because the engine combustion chamber was still producing power, the suddenly freed turbine spun out of control with such enormous speed that within {{a fraction of a}} second, the centrifugal force caused the turbine to disintegrate. The enclosure of the turbine failed to contain the pieces of the turbine, which were ejected tangentially at high speed, causing severe damage to the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{definition}} for the bypass ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the {{mass flow rate}} of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core. A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10 kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1 kg of air passing through the core. Note that in an aft fan engine, like the General Electric CJ805-23, all of the fan air enters the bypass stream, whereas on most turbofans only the air entering the outer section of the fan passes to the bypass duct. Another special case is the General Electric TF39 {{where most of the}} fan air plus some of the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor</b> air enter the bypass duct.|$|E
50|$|A {{freeflow}} diving {{gas supply}} has a continuous flow of breathing gas (almost always air) to the diver's helmet, {{or in some}} cases, full-face mask. The gas flows {{regardless of whether the}} diver breathes it, and most of the gas supply is not used. This is wasteful, so is generally only used when the breathing gas is air, which is cheap, and can be supplied from a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>compressor.</b> Freeflow helmets were used in early diving apparatus, and the historically important Standard Diving gear with the copper helmet is a free-flow system. The system is simple and robust, and relatively safe in contaminated water as the internal pressure of the helmet can be maintained at a slightly higher setting than the external pressure to prevent leaks back through the exhaust valve.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is dedicated to}} the modeling of the end-wall flows in a throughflow model for turbomachinery applications. The throughflow model is based on the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations solved by a Finite-Volume technique. Two approaches are presented for the end-wall modeling. The first one is based on an inviscid formulation with dedicated 3 -D distributions of loss coefficient and deviation in the end-wall regions. The second approach is directly based on a viscous formulation with no-slip boundary condition along the annular end-walls and blade force modification in the region close to the end-walls. The throughflow results are compared to a series of 3 -D Navier-Stokes calculations averaged in the circumferential direction.
