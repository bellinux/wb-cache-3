White's aim is to either promote his pawn or else compel Black to give up his rook for it – either result will leave White with an overwhelming material advantage and a straightforward win. White has managed to advance his pawn to the seventh rank, but it is prevented from queening because his own king is in the way.

Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think about it when you touch me there / Close my eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> <b>Move</b> It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start".

500|$|Director Nate Fox {{stated that}} much of the {{inspiration}} of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series, DMZ and [...] Both center on a city after a large disaster. The series also inspired the crafting of the game's grim take on the superhero genre. Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game. However, any correlation to DC Comics' Static Shock was unintentional. Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of [...] "spending time in a lawless place" [...] within the game. Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence, in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City; similarly, Spider-Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate what it would be <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions. They had toyed around with a version of the game that they compared to a superhero version of Animal Crossing, and along side superhero work, the hero would have an alter-ego of property developer to meet the citizens' more common needs, but dropped this and focused solely on superhero activities after about six months of work. The character of Cole was created to be a [...] "kind of an everyman" [...] so that players could then [...] "get into the headspace of {{what it would be like}} to be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities". The team also avoided giving Cole an alter-ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game's story.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} JDF detects the jammer intrusion when a CM <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{from the}} present cluster to another; also, it detects and declares the presence of jamming periodically say every 3 s. Therefore, the JDF consumes 12.632 mJ to detect the jammer intrusion and consumes 8.86 mJ to detect the presence of jamming. The simulation is done for 600 s as discussed in Section 4.2. At the outset, the simulation is carried out without mobility. After that the simulation is continued with mobility. (Initially, the constant jammer is launched then set of samples is considered without mobility and with mobility in the network. Similarly, the simulation is repeated for other types of jammer).|$|R
