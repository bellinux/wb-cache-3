50|$|Layer 2 {{switching}} {{uses the}} {{media access control}} address (MAC address) from the host's network interface cards (NICs) to decide where to forward frames. Layer 2 switching is hardware-based, which means switches use application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs) to build and maintain filter tables (also known as MAC address tables or CAM tables). One way to think of a <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> is as multiport bridge.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> remains {{more of a}} {{marketing}} term than a technical term, the products that were introduced as [...] "switches" [...] tended to use microsegmentation and full duplex to prevent collisions among devices connected to Ethernet. By using an internal forwarding plane much faster than any interface, they {{give the impression of}} simultaneous paths among multiple devices. 'Non-blocking' devices use a forwarding plane or equivalent method fast enough to allow full duplex traffic for each port simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|LAN {{switching}} {{is a form}} of {{packet switching}} used in local area networks (LAN). Switching technologies are crucial to network design, as they allow traffic to be sent only where it is needed in most cases, using fast, hardware-based methods. LAN switching uses different kinds of network switches. A standard switch is known as a <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> and is commonly found in nearly any LAN. Layer 3 or layer 4 switches require advanced technology (see managed switch) and are more expensive, and thus are usually only found in larger LANs or in special network environments.|$|E
50|$|Another known {{take on the}} router-based schemes {{comes from}} Hazeyama et al. In their approach, they wish to {{integrate}} the SPIE approach as outlined by Snoeren, with their approach of recording the layer 2 link-id along with the network ID (VLAN or true ID), the MAC address of the <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> that received the packet and the link id it came in on. This information is then put into two look-up tables - both containing the switch (layer 2 router) MAC id for look-up. They rely on the MAC:port tuple {{as a method of}} tracing a packet back (even if the MAC address has been spoofed).|$|E
50|$|All {{switches}} in an Ethernet fabric {{are managed}} {{as if they}} were a single logical chassis. To the rest of the network, the fabric looks no different than any other single <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch.</b> Each physical switch in the fabric is managed {{as if it were a}} port module in a chassis. This enables fabric scalability without manual configuration. The logical chassis capability significantly reduces management of small-form-factor edge switches. Instead of managing each top-of-rack switch (or switches in blade server chassis) individually, organizations can manage them as one logical chassis, which further optimizes the network in the virtualized data center and will further enable a cloud computing model.|$|E

50|$|Bridged {{networks}} {{break up}} collision domains, but the network remains one large broadcast domain. Similarly, <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switches</b> (bridges) cannot break up broadcast domains, {{which can cause}} performance issues and limits {{the size of your}} network. Broadcast and multicasts, along with the slow convergence of spanning tree, can cause major problems as the network grows. Because of these problems, <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switches</b> cannot completely replace routers in the internet work.|$|R
50|$|<b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switching</b> {{is highly}} {{efficient}} {{because there is}} no modification to the data packet and the frame, encapsulation of the packet changes only when the data packet is passing through dissimilar media (such as from Ethernet to FDDI). <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switching</b> is used for work group connectivity and network segmentation (breaking up collision domains). This allows a flatter network design with more network segments than traditional networks joined by repeater hubs and routers.Layer <b>2</b> <b>switching</b> has helped develop new components in the network infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of layer 3 switches {{is the potential}} for lower network latency as a packet can be routed without making extra network hops to a router. For example, connecting two distinct segments (e.g. VLANs) with a router to a standard <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> requires passing the frame to the switch (first L2 hop), then to the router (second L2 hop) where the packet inside the frame is routed (L3 hop) and then passed back to the switch (third L2 hop). A layer 3 switch accomplishes the same task without the need for a router (and therefore additional hops) by making the routing decision itself, i.e. the packet is routed to another subnet and switched to the destination network port simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|The {{switching}} function was primarily entrusted to Layer 2 of the OSI model, i. e. the Data Link Layer. A <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> performs forwarding decisions {{by analyzing the}} MAC (Media Access Control) address of the destination segment in the frame. The <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> checks for the destination address and transmits the packet to the appropriate segment if the address is present in its table of known destinations. If the entry for that address is not present, the switch then forwards the packet to all segments except the one on which it came from. This is known as flooding. When it gets a reply from the destination segment, it learns {{the location of the}} new address and adds it to its table of known destinations. As number of users are increasing on the network, the speed and the bandwidth of the network is being stretched to its limits. Earlier, switching was primarily entrusted to Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, but now there are switches that operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer), Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 5 (Session Layer) of the OSI model. Going from one layer to the other layer does involve some costs/tradeoffs. My thesis explores the costs and tradeoffs involved with switching based on layers 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OSI reference model...|$|E
30|$|The SEC 2 and VICTOR {{have some}} common features. The network {{infrastructure}} of SEC 2 {{as well as}} VICTOR is organized in two levels: a core domain and edge domains. An edge domain consists of physical hosts and switches. The core domain is made {{of a set of}} customized <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch</b> called as Forwarding Element (FE) and Central Controller (CC). Central Controller (CC) controls the operation of FEs. FE performs two functions namely, (a) address lookup and mapping and (b) policy enforcement. The security service of SEC 2 is made available through tunnelling or FEs. FEs can implement firewalls, NAT and middleboxes. The remaining seven datacenters proposals have different aims but do not provide any security features as summarized in Table 1.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to discuss the common misconceptions and poorly publicized issues {{regarding}} the use of switches for security policy enforcement. Not only are there hundreds of switches to choose from, but they are also very complex and the technology behind them is progressing at a rapid rate. To allow for these facts and still be able to cover the topic in a reasonably detailed manner, I will concentrate on Cisco Catalyst ethernet switches, which from my experience appear to be the most common type of switch used in the enterprise today; however, many of the concepts presented in this paper are just as applicable to any <b>layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch,</b> regardless of vendor. Overview As corporations become more dependent on high-speed secure networks, switches have quickly replaced hubs in the enterprise. Due to the higher cost of switches and their marketed capability of being able to separate traffic via VLANs, many corporations end up placing a high degree of trust in their switches. VLANs are intended to act as impenetrable barriers between logical networks on the same switch, as illustrated in diagram # 1. [1...|$|E
40|$|Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is the {{transfer}} of data into buffers between two compute nodes that {{does not require the}} involvement of a CPU or Operating System (OS). The idea is borrowed from Direct Memory Access (DMA) which allows memory within a compute node to be transferred without transiting through the CPU. RDMA is termed a zero-copy protocol as it eliminates the need to copy data between buffers within the protocol stack. Because of this and other features, RDMA promotes reliable, high throughput and low latency transfer for packet-switched networking. While the benefits of RMDA are well known and available within the general purpose and high performance computing community, only a few open source and portable RDMA capabilities exists for the FPGA community. Within the limited availability of solutions for FPGAs, many rely on standard Internet Protocol. This thesis presents an open source and portable RMDA core that enables line rate scaling for data transfer over packet-switched networks over Ethernet for the FPGA community. An RDMA protocol in which the currency is Datagrams is designed, implemented and tested between two Xilinx FPGA 2 ̆ 7 s over a <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switch.</b> The implementation does not rely on an Internet Protocol and is portable, simple and lightweight.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTransport Layer (OSI Layer 3) switching and routing provides routing flexibility but not high throughput. Link <b>layer</b> (OSI <b>Layer</b> <b>2)</b> <b>switching</b> provides high throughput {{but not the}} routing flexibility needed to manage topology change and load fluctuations in the network. Neither Layer 3 routing nor <b>Layer</b> <b>2</b> <b>switching</b> protocols were originally designed to support confidentiality and integrity of data, and authentication of participants. Proposals to integrate security may have positive results for data confidentiality, integrity and authentication, but often result in additional overhead, increased transmission latency, and decreased throughput.
