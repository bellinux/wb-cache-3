40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} demand and supply {{determinants}} of loan contract terms in small business lending. Chapter 2 presents results on loan maturity {{and is based}} on a cross-sectional dataset of German small business loans. I find a very robust positive and monotonic relation between risk and maturity. In the case of high asymmetric information this may be explained by theories on signaling. So, good borrowers choose short maturities to signal their good quality to the bank and to separate themselves from the bad borrowers. In the case of low asymmetric information this may be explained by relationship lenders assisting borrowers who experience financial difficulties by granting them longer maturities to ease their repayment pressure. Chapters 3 and 4 of the thesis explicitly use information from loan applications as well as loan contracts of loans made to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by one Bulgarian bank between 2003 and 2007. Chapter 3 studies the determinants of the <b>loan</b> <b>currency.</b> Concerning the demand side, I find that firms are more likely to request EUR if they need larger, long-term or mortgage loans. My results also indicate that this is driven by firms’ anticipation that the bank is reluctant to grant such loans in local currency. On the supply side I find that the bank is more likely to switch the <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> to EUR when it has more refinancing in EUR and especially when it has more EUR deposits. These findings imply that, in a country like Bulgaria, it will be most important to establish a stable and credible macroeconomic environment so that depositors are willing to save and banks to lend long-term in local currency. Another topic that has received much attention from academics as well as policy makers is credit rationing, but empirically there still remain questions on how big the actual extent of credit rationing is and how it evolves over bank relationships. In contrast to previous studies, I employ a more direct indicator of the actual extent of credit rationing, namely the ratio of granted to requested loan amounts, in chapter 4. My results indicate that credit rationing is considerable, especially in the beginning of bank relationships and for the more opaque borrowers. Moreover, the degree of credit rationing decreases over bank-borrower relationships and this decrease is indeed due to the bank’s willingness to increase its lending stakes over time. These results imply that efforts to create institutions which reduce informational asymmetries seem to be important in increasing small firms’ access to finance. Chapter 5 specifically looks at the effects of the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis on credit availability for MSMEs in Azerbaijan. The bank {{at the heart of this}} study experienced unexpected refinancing delays allowing me to examine an exogenous supply shock. At the same time, Azerbaijan’s economy is weakly diversified and highly oil dependent making it vulnerable to the economic crisis in the aftermath of the Lehman failure. The analysis reveals that the refinancing problems seem to impact on all loan types such as agro, micro and SME loans as the bank discourages new loan applications and grants fewer loans. The impact of the Lehman failure has more differential effects on the various loan groups: Agro loans are not affected, whereas the likelihood to be approved a loan application decreases considerably for SME loans. But especially for SME borrowers bank relationships seem to be important in mitigating these effects...|$|E

We first model the choice of <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When foreign currency funds come at a lower interest rate, all foreign currency earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose foreign currency loans. When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to foreign currency loans, as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with foreign currency income and assets are more likely to borrow in a foreign currency. In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of foreign currency funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the foreign currency borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage foreign currency borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of foreign currency borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate foreign currency borrowing. foreign currency borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|E
40|$|In {{episodes of}} {{significant}} banking distress or perceived systemic {{risk to the}} financial system, policymakers have often opted for issuing blanket guarantees on bank liabilities to stop or avoid widespread bank runs. In theory, blanket guarantees can prevent bank runs if they are credible. However, guarantee could add substantial fiscal costs to bank restructuring programs and may increase moral hazard going forward. Using a sample of 42 episodes of banking crises, this paper finds that blanket guarantees are successful in reducing liquidity pressures on banks arising from deposit withdrawals. However, banks'' foreign liabilities appear virtually irresponsive to blanket guarantees. Furthermore, guarantees tend to be fiscally costly, though this positive association arises {{in large part because}} guarantees tend to be employed in conjunction with extensive liquidity support and when crises are severe.

40|$|According to the Polish Banking Supervision (KNF) statistics, banking {{mortgage}} loans total 22. 4 % {{of the overall}} assets of the Polish banking credit portfolio as of January 2015 data. Around 15 % of those loans might have Loan To Property Value proportion (LTV) exceeding 100 %. Rapid growth of {{mortgage loans}} in Poland {{was the result of}} growth of foreign currency mortgage loans. That was the typical situation for Central and Eastern European Countries. In the Polish banking sector, collective provisions typical for retail segment including IBNR (Identified but nor Reported Loss Provisions) provision applied under current IAS 39 seems to be too low to cover credit risk. Assuming conservative credit risk parameters in determining collective provisions might affect adversely the financial situation of the Polish banks. The financial results of the Polish banks might go down considerably. In addition, borrowers having loans denominated in foreign currency have won certain legal cases in Europe and in Poland. Therefore, the presence of the foreign currency denominated mortgage loans (FCML) in the Polish banking sector represents an element of the systemic risk and has to be solved. Growth of FCML weakens the abilities of central banks to control over credit creation and to steer monetary policy. On the other hand, compulsory conversion of the mortgage loans hitherto denominated in foreign currency into mortgage loans in Polish zloty by special law, might create considerable losses in the Polish banking sector and reduction of Capital Adequacy Ratio of the Polish banks. Therefore, direct replication of the Hungarian style legal solution of the foreign currency banking (compulsory <b>loan</b> <b>currency</b> conversion into PLN) loans might create problems in the Polish banking sector. Moreover, potential state aid devoted to some borrowers in Poland that have saved significant amount of money having cheaper foreign currency mortgage loans is controversial from the social justice point of view.

In particular, Swiss franc (CHF) -denominated loans, popular in Eastern European countries, could trigger simultaneous bank failures if depreciation of the domestic currencies prevents borrowers from servicing the <b>loans.</b> Foreign <b>currency</b> <b>loans</b> thus pose a systemic risk from a "common market shock" perspective.
