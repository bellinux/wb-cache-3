5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the miracle}} for Jansenists represented God's grace manifested in human history, however briefly. Jansenists theologians and writers were also deeply {{interested in the}} power of <b>lay</b> <b>witness</b> and <b>lay</b> faithfulness to true religion. The initiative to create the Jansenist periodical Nouvelles Ecclésiastiques in 1727 owed largely to this interest in inviting ordinary Christians to witness religious truth for themselves. As a result, the movement was thoroughly pleased by the miracles which occurred at Saint-Médard between 1727 and 1731. They separated the 'pure of heart' from the hard-hearted Church hierarchy. For the Paris Jansenists, the miracles served as proof that God was on their side and opposed Unigenitus.|$|R
40|$|This {{book is a}} {{guide to}} the law of {{evidence}} that utilizes evidentiary examples from popular culture to provide a strong understanding of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and its interpretive case law. It also provides an understanding of how popular culture sources inform jurors’ preconceptions about the trial process. Illustrations from famous cases, movies, novels, cartoons, and other media highlight the presumptions jurors bring to the courtroom. Issues covered include: relevance; unfair prejudice; the rule against hearsay and its exceptions; recent developments in the Confrontation Clause and expert testimony; differences between expert <b>witness</b> and <b>lay</b> <b>witness</b> testimony; impeachment methods; procedures for juror questioning of witnesses; admissibility of videotape evidence; and requirements for introducing electronic evidence...|$|R

40|$|The {{expert witness}} is {{indispensable}} {{in a medical}} malpractice case. However, there are three main defects in the currently existing expert witness system. One is incompetence of expert witnesses. Another is professional negligence of expert witnesses. The other is dishonesty of expert witnesses. To make the expert witness system more efficient, this article examines currently existing rules and offers some proposals regarding the three issues. For the first one, the suggestion {{of this article is}} to rely on the standards of expert qualification and admitting expert testimony. For the second one, this article distinguishes expert <b>witnesses</b> from <b>lay</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and concludes witness immunity should not be extended to a friendly expert witness. Thus negligent experts should be regulated by professional responsibility. For the third one, the bias of experts is inherent in the adversarial system. This article gives some proposals to control it, but it is almost impossible to get rid of it...|$|R

50|$|Rules of {{evidence}} {{are meant to}} screen what evidence the jury may consider to prevent testimony that is mere opinion from infringing upon the territory of jury decision-making.

40|$|Parties in patent {{lawsuits}} {{that are going}} to trial face a crucial choice: who is the best witness to explain the often complex or scientific technology behind an invention or an accused product? Often, the parties will select an employee witness such as an engineer, scientist, or a named inventor of the patent-in-suit to offer this key testimony rather than a hired expert. Many litigants have found that there are benefits to choosing an employee witness who can testify based on first-hand experience with the technology in question rather than a hired expert, who must prepare an expert report and may not have the same incentives as the litigant. But when litigants offer such employee <b>witnesses</b> as <b>lay</b> rather than expert <b>witnesses,</b> courts have struggled to define the precise boundaries of lay versus expert testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence. This has created a growing conflict among courts over how far a <b>lay</b> <b>witness</b> may go in testifying about technical and scientific matters in patent trials when the subject of the witness’s testimony comes from first-hand knowledge. This paper addresses these conflicting cases and proposes an approach that courts can use to determine which subjects are appropriate matters only for expert witnesses and which subjects can be addressed by highly skilled and knowledgeable <b>lay</b> <b>witnesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{competent}} United States Attorney should easily win {{any federal}} drug case. The elements of federal drug crimes {{are easy to}} prove, easy to explain, and easy for juries to comprehend. Why then does the government need members of law enforcement to testify as experts in federal drug prosecutions? The answer: they do not. Yet district courts routinely admit (and appellate courts uphold) expert agent and officer testimony on {{a wide array of}} drug topics—including when officers testify both as expert and <b>lay</b> <b>witnesses.</b> Were the examples of law enforcement expert testimony few, perhaps no problem would arise. But this problem is pervasive. By frequently allowing members of law enforcement to testify in easily proven drug cases, federal district courts neglect their “gatekeeper” role to admit only reliable expert testimony. More problematically, officers’ expert testimony may implicitly comment on defendant’s mens rea, thereby reducing the prosecution’s burden to prove all elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet, the fix is startlingly easy: the federal judiciary should disallow members of law enforcement from testifying as both an expert and <b>lay</b> <b>witness</b> in federal drug prosecutions. And, before admitting officer expert testimony, district courts must vigilantly guard against proposed officer testimony that is either empirically invalid, or could inappropriately comment on defendant’s mens rea. Doing so would allow federal courts to meaningfully resume their roles as gatekeepers while simultaneously enabling the jury to perform its duty as fact-finder...|$|R
50|$|On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team {{consists}} of three attorneys and three witnesses {{on each side of}} the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a sports draft format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case.

The record also instructs that Kazelin's body should be disinterred from its existing location at Göthelich/Gösseling, then in the Archdiocese of Salzburg, and transported to the lands at Eberndorf to be buried there in a new, larger Abbey Church of Our Lady, funded and maintained using the bequest.

40|$|As {{illustrated}} by the story of Amanda Knox and many others wrongfully convicted, false confessions often trump factual innocence.

This latter phenomenon, termed “corrob-oration inflation, ” suggests that pretrial corroboration re-quirements as well as the concept of “harmless error ” on appeal are based on an erroneous presumption of indepen-dence among items of evidence. In addition to previously suggested reforms to police practices that are designed to curb the risk of false confessions, measures should be taken as well to minimize the rippling consequences of those confessions...|$|R

50|$|With {{the statute}} in mind, the court stated that Sharon Kowalski has stated a clear {{preference}} for Thompson {{to be her}} guardian, citing the study by the Miller-Dwan specialists. The court noted that the three witnesses opposed to Thompson's appointment were all <b>lay</b> <b>witnesses</b> with no medical training. In regard to Thompson's qualifications {{to serve as a}} guardian, the court stated that testimony from multiple witnesses established that Thompson had been loving and caring when dealing with Sharon and was {{able to take care of}} her on a day-to-day basis. Finally, the court addressed the lower court's concern that Thompson was involving Sharon in multiple gay and lesbian public events-the case had generated considerable media attention-that her family testified she might not otherwise choose to attend. The court said that the lower court's reliance on this in its guardianship decision was misguided, as the record indicated that Sharon enjoyed these events and even received an award at a National Organization for Women meeting.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of visual media technologies used in remote witness testimony, examining whether it is suitable to use students as mock jurors when measuring the impact of new technologies. A 2 × 2 mixed factorial design explored how student status impacted ratings {{of the quality of}} the technology and remote witness facilities. A sample of 79 students and non-empanelled jurors from the Victorian Metropolitan County Court viewed direct questioning of four <b>lay</b> <b>witnesses</b> who testified from a remote location via standard or enhanced video technology. Students differed significantly from jurors in their attitudes towards media and technology. In responding to technology enhancements, students were similar in rating changes in the quality of the technology, but differed significantly in how they rated changes to the design of remote witness facilities. Students were thus a suitable sample to measure the effect of technological change in court on perceptions of technology, but not on perceptions of design. We conclude by stressing such technology enhancements can improve the quality of experience for all jurors...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} uses descriptive qualitative method. The researcher {{used the}} film entitled “The Great Debaters” and its transcript {{as the source}} of the data in order to collect the data of the research. The aims of this study were to find out 1) the types of evidences used in the arguments delivered by the characters in the film “The Great Debaters”; 2) how the characters in the film “The Great Debaters” use evidence in their arguments. To achieve the aims, the researcher analyzed the data by using 1) Johnson and Huber & Robert B. theory of evidence types; 2) Baron’s theory of positive evidence and negative evidence. The writer also uses the Toulmin theory of argumentation formula as the guideline to describe how the evidences are elaborated in the argument.

Cases were referred to trial only after a judge presided over a preliminary fact-finding investigation in which the suspect was not permitted counsel.
