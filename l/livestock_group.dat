Their members are people of Banjar Tegal Jaya, Dalung Village, Kuta Utara Sub District, Badung Regency. They are mostly farmers who are still having productive farm lands with very limited extensions. Nowadays, along with the care for their cattles, they usually give their cattle green woof from natural grasses. Sometimes, they also give rice straws from their waste of rice harvest which is plentiful enough along the year. They, however only do it {{only if they are}} in difficulties of getting enough fresh natural greens. Due to this condition, therefore socialization and demonstration for rice straw process with bio-fermentation technology were held. Bio-cas is a probiotik which helps to raise digestion for the livestocks. The substances derive from the cattle’s rumen liquid consisting of bacteria from genus Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Streptococus with the other fermentative fungi genus in a media of sugar solution to fermente the organic complex into a simple organic. With this Community Service Program, the expected result is: The members of the group or breeders have knowledge and comprehension that rice straw could be used as source of livestock woof which could be stored within 3 to 4 months with a bio-cas fermentation method. From this Program, the members of the breeder group have got appropriate knowledge in utilizing rice straw. And moreover, through the use of the fermented rice straw, the members of the group would not be in difficulties to obtain green woof source for their cattles. </em...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific {{interference}} among livestock, {{native and}} non-native large herbivores {{is a key}} management and conservation issue, and {{little is known about}} its dynamics and implications. We investigated whether native Alpine chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra) modify their spatial distribution when non-native mouflon Ovis orientalis musimon and livestock (domestic sheep Ovis aries, and domestic goats Capra hircus) inhabit the same areas in the Alpine meadows of Italian Eastern Alps. We walked 5 hiking trails (5. 0 ± 0. 1 km) at dawn, twice a month during summers 2007 and 2008. During these surveys, we located each group of free-ranging ungulates (chamois, mouflon, and livestock). We also estimated the quality of meadows, finding that forage availability increased linearly as the distance from rocks (i. e., chamois refuges) increased. We predicted that the linear distance between chamois groups and rocks would depend on the co-presence of livestock and mouflon groups. Our results showed that chamois {{were more likely to be}} observed in areas with low food availability, but safer (i. e., closer to the rocks), whenever the nearest <b>livestock</b> <b>group</b> was larger and closer, especially if the shepherd's dog was present. Avoidance of the best feeding patches by the wild species is presumably due to spatial interference (e. g. visual and acoustic disturbance) and/or predation risk perception caused by the presence of shepherd's dogs. Similarly, the larger was the nearest group of mouflon, the closer to rocks was located the chamois group. Interestingly, mouflon group vicinity induced chamois to move closer to rocks only if mouflon rams were within the group. This suggests that physical displacement of the smaller species (i. e. chamois) is likely to occur to avoid direct disturbance of larger mouflon rams. Our study clearly showed how a native herbivorous species adjusts its spatial distribution and decreases the likelihood of using areas with higher food availability when livestock and/or a non-native species co-occur...|$|E

40|$|Two new {{titles in}} 'The Tropical Agriculturalist' series CTA and Macmillan publish jointly 'The Tropical Agriculturalist' series, the {{practical}} field guides aimed at farmers, farm managers, extension officers, students, teachers and those studying and {{taking part in}} rural development projects. Two new titles {{have been added to}} the series: Rabbits and Weed control. Rabbits have a great deal to offer in food production in the Tropics. They can turn forage into high-quality protein and yet they remain within the investment range of poor families, thus contributing to domestic self sufficiency. The author of Rabbits, Denis Fielding of the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine in Edinburgh, has written a book which is practical, readable and realistic, and which also takes account of all research into rabbit-keeping in the rural Tropics in recent years. The book covers in detail the characteristics and requirements of this <b>livestock</b> <b>group,</b> and how to raise and produce them in a number of tropical zones and farming systems. Breeds, breeding, health, nutrition, housing, slaughtering and meat and skin processing are all covered. The black-and white illustrations and diagrams are clear and easy to follow. The work concludes with a short bibliography, a glossary of specialist terms used, and an index. Weed control by E M Lavabre, scientific adviser to IRRCC-CIRAD, contains contributions from John Wibberley, consultant and lecturer in tropical agriculture, M Deat and J Deuse, and was originally published in French as Le desherbage des cultures sous les tropiques. Weed control describes the basic biology of weeds and the characteristics of the different species. All methods of control (manual, animal-powered and engine-driven, cultural and chemical), are described and illustrated in detail, together with the main herbicides and their applications. However, it is recognized that for some tropical crops the use of herbicides will remain limited. Emphasis is placed on looking at all possible weed control options, including crop rotation, preceding crop, careful crop sequencing and mixed cropping. The importance of choosing the most appropriate method is stressed. Full use is made of line drawings, tables, diagrams and black-and-white photographs, and this volume also has a clear glossary of terms used, a brief bibliography and an index.

30|$|Livestock {{ownership}} and herd size in traditional farming systems are two related variables {{which have been}} used to represent the level of a farmer’s dependence on natural resources such as pasture and water for extensive livestock production (Kemausuor et al. 2011; Legesse et al. 2013). The availability of such natural resources depends on a combination of resource management strategies and climatic conditions. Different <b>livestock</b> <b>groups</b> in this regard have varying degrees of susceptibility to stress conditions such as more frequent and longer periods of drought under a changing climate. For instance, cattle known for slower biological turnover are considered more vulnerable to feed shortages during drought than small ruminants and camels (Lesnoff et al. 2012). Households with cattle, in the event of drought, carry a potentially diversifiable risk (idiosyncratic risk) as well as the aggregate or co-variant risk of drought at a regional scale (Ligon and Schechter 2003; Lesnoff et al. 2012). However, larger herd size is associated with greater demand for food.|$|R

30|$|Although {{cattle and}} small {{ruminant}} herds mostly grazed on spatially different rangelands {{in the study}} region, {{no significant differences in}} herbage offer and quality were observed on the sites visited by the two <b>livestock</b> <b>groups,</b> {{with the exception of the}} winter pastures. Besides environmental characteristics of a pasture such as slope, exposition, stone cover and density of woody vegetation, factors such as land use rights are likely to prevail over species-specific diet preferences (Ganskopp and Bohnert 2009), together with high stocking rates and absence of active herding, leading to a broad dietary overlap (Vallentine 2001; Yoshihara et al. 2009). However, as herbage allowance was negatively correlated with the size of the area visited per day and the daily walked distance (in particular for cattle), it can be assumed that grazing cattle were hampered by topographical features (Ganskopp and Bohnert 2009) and animals therefore walked further distances per day, which inevitably increased their theoretical utilized pasture area, but not necessarily the herbage allowance. This relationship seemed to be more pronounced on the Mongolian side, which may be explained by an increased competition between livestock species for the same fodder resources (Vallentine 2001).|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the oil {{industry}} and <b>livestock</b> <b>groups,</b> Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are considering whether to reduce biofuel blending mandates. <b>Livestock</b> <b>groups</b> want lower corn prices and the oil industry claims that it simply cannot blend more biofuels than current levels. The oil industry argues that its only compliance option is to reduce domestic gasoline and diesel sales if mandates are not reduced; however, an alternative compliance path is to increase the demand for ethanol by investing in E 85 fueling capabilities. Ethanol demand would increase by between 800 million and one billion gallons per year for each 2, 500 stations with E 85 fueling capabilities given the existing fleet of flex vehicles. The cost of investing in E 85 at existing stations depends on whether a new tank needs to be installed or whether an existing tank can be converted. If new tanks need to be installed then the cost of 2, 500 stations would be at least $ 325 million. If no new tanks need to be installed then the cost would be approximately $ 87. 5 million. With the price of the tradable ethanol credits trading between $ 0. 60 and $ 0. 70 per gallon, and with at least 14 billion credits needed under current mandates, it seems that the reduction in compliance costs could be greater than the costs of investing in E 85 infrastructure, which would create an incentive for investment. Simulation results show that this is indeed the case if EPA sets mandates that are attainable with investment. If EPA sets 2014 mandates that can be met with 13. 9 billion gallons, then investment in 2, 500 E 85 stations would reduce oil company compliance costs from $ 2. 84 billion to $ 1. 09 billion. If EPA sets 2015 requirements that can be met with 14. 7 billion gallons, then 2015 compliance costs would be reduced by more than $ 2. 4 billion dollars from investment in an additional 2, 500 E 85 stations. Taxpayers, gas station owners, or oil companies could pay for the investment. Congress could divert farm subsidies to pay for E 85 investment with a justification that an important beneficiary of ethanol is land-owning farmers. Gas station owners will have an incentive to make the investment if the wholesale price of E 85 drops enough to generate fuel cost savings to drivers as well as higher wholesale-retail margins to station owners. Oil companies might find it more efficient to make the investment themselves if the required price of ethanol credits rises too high for too long...|$|R

It {{is commonly}} cultivated as a food-feed crop that provides pods for human food and haulms for livestock feeding (Larbi et al. 1999, Omokanye et al. 2001). From farmer participatory studies in the Deccan plateau of India, Rama Devi et al. (2000) concluded that food from grain/pods and fodder from the crop residues almost equally contribute to livelihoods in mixed-crop livestock systems. It was because of this important dual-purpose usage of groundnut that the groundnut improvement group of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and <b>livestock</b> nutrition <b>group</b> of the International Livestoc...|$|R
30|$|Then {{we looked}} at spatial and {{temporal}} trends in <b>livestock</b> in Koyiaki <b>Group</b> Ranch between 1977 and 2014 and compared livestock density and composition between areas inside and outside conservancies. We delineated areas in Koyiaki as either inside or outside a conservancy in ArcMap 10. Trends in cattle and shoat density are shown for inside and outside conservancies over this time period.|$|R
40|$|Many countries, {{including}} the United States, {{are in the}} process of inventorying greenhouse gas emissions as a prerequisite for designing control strategies. We have developed a measurement-based inventory of methane emissions from cattle in the United States. Methane emission factors were established for the major <b>livestock</b> <b>groups</b> using an internal tracer method. The groups studied included cows, replacement heifers, slaughter cattle, calves, and bulls in the beef sector and cows plus replacement heifers in the dairy industry. Since methane emission is dependent on the quality and quantity of feed, diets were chosen that are representative of the feed regimes utilized by producers in the United States. Regional cattle populations, obtained from U. S. Department of Agriculture statistics, were combined with the methane emission factors to yield regional emission estimates. The methane totals from the five regions were then summed to give a U. S. inventory of cattle emissions for 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1998. Annual releases ranged from 6. 50 Tg in 1990 to a high of 6. 98 Tg in 1996. On a regional scale the North Central region of the United States had the largest methane emissions from livestock followed by the South Central and the West. The beef cow group released the most methane (∼ 2. 5 Tg yr− 1) followed by slaughter cattle (∼ 1. 7 Tg yr− 1) and dairy cows at about 1. 5 Tg yr− 1. Methane released by cattle in the United States contributes about 11 % of the global cattle source...|$|R
40|$|Society {{services}} {{activity on}} cattle waste management system {{have been implemented}} in Sido Mulyo <b>Livestock</b> Farmers <b>Group</b> at Pulosari, Jumoyo, Salam, Magelang. Animal byproducts that consist of feces and urine of cattle wastewas processed into organic fertilizer compost and liquid fertilizer. Sido Mulyo <b>Livestock</b> Farmer <b>Group</b> has one unit of 20 m 3 biodigester to accommodate the feces from approximately 30 cattle owned by the group member. Biogas {{has been used as}} a fuel source for family group members located around the cage. Slurry resulted from anaerobic digestion of biodigester disposed to pastures located on the right side of the cage. Ownership system in the groupis every group member hasa responsibility for taking care of their own cattle. The number of livestock owned by each member of the SidoMulyoLivestock Farmers Group ranged between 1 to  4 cattle. Society services methods that have been implemented was in the form of mentoring for a member of the Sido Mulyogroup. The other activities that have been implemented was the training and development of cattle industry, especially the handling of livestock waste in the form of feces, urine, and the feed residue. The activities was continued by the manufacture of compost packaging design, followed by the last series of activities such as monitoring and program development. The enthusiasm of the group members in joining to the extension activities is very good. The timing of the extension are determined in the afternoon after members of the group have finished searching feed for their cattle.  The sustainability forwaste processing into organic fertilizer compost and liquid organic fertilizer becomes a major concern, because it is highly dependent on consumer demand...|$|R
