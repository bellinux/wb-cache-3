25|$|The cockpit {{windshield}} of {{the first}} 247s was angled forward, instead of the conventional aft sweep. This was the design solution (similar to that adopted by other contemporary aircraft that used a forward-raked windscreen) {{to the problem of}} <b>lighted</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> instruments reflecting off the windshield at night, but {{it turned out that the}} forward-sloping windshield would reflect ground lights instead, especially during landings and it also increased drag slightly. By the introduction of the 247D, the windshield was sloped aft in the usual way, and the night-glare problem was resolved by installing an extension (the glarescreen) over the <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Grand Théâtre {{technical}} staff took {{an active part}} in these refurbishments, along with external technical contractors called in on the project. House mechanics took apart and reassembled most of the essential works in the system, with their electrician colleagues refitting all the lighting equipment and rewiring it. The <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> has now been replaced with computerised control desks that operate 500 electric circuits, twice as many as before the renovation work. The Grand Théâtre audio and video services completely renewed its equipment below the stage.|$|R

DMX consoles are largely computerized, thus allowing digital process control from multiple input devices, and synchronization via MIDI, SMPTE etc.|$|R
5000|$|For a time, Bigsby lost {{interest}} in the project—but Crooks kept working on his design. After several months, {{he came up with}} a design he was satisfied with. Its cabinet featured padded Naugahyde, aluminum guards around the cabinet, a <b>lighted</b> <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> a JBL D-130 speaker, and independent bass and treble controls. Crooks's amplifier was both visually and sonorously appealing. He used his shop's name [...] "Standel" [...] as the amplifier's brand. He called the model the 25L15, because it had 25 watts of power and a Lansing 15-inch speaker. Bigsby eventually purchased a Standel 25L15, #1018 on April 10, 1954.|$|R

40|$|Reducing {{high energy}} {{consumption}} and costs is imperative and significant to our daily life. In this paper, we describe a capstone senior design project that develops an efficient energy-saving solution. The solution {{is called the}} GreenLite system and consists of two components: a self- adjustable solar tracker panel and a <b>light</b> harvesting <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> The solar tracker panel tends to maximize the absorption of solar power. Specifically, the solar tracker panel can adjust itself automatically to the direction where the panel is directly facing the Sun. To achieve this, the component employs photo-sensors to measure the irradiance of the Sun and to provide the feedback signal on the current position of the panel. The component also uses actuators that contain motors to rotate the panel at all possible angles. The <b>light</b> harvesting <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> designs a dimming fluorescent lighting system. Specifically, the system tends to reduce energy demand by diming lights proportional {{to the amount of}} daylight received, based on the measurements from photo-sensors. Moreover, this <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> is powered by the energy obtained form the solar tracker panel. In the project, the microcontroller dspic 30 f 4011, programmed by C++ language, is used to control the motors on the actuators. The system is also designed as sturdy and lightweight as possible for increased durability and mobility. The details of the implementation are given, and the lessons learnt are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Critical {{human factors}} and user {{interface}} engineering problems were {{revealed in the}} investigation of the reactor control system's user interface. Despite the valve being stuck open, a <b>light</b> on the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> ostensibly indicated that the valve was closed. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve. As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.|$|R
50|$|The console {{consisting}} of a vertical display panel about 10 in high by about 5 ft long with a similarly sized slightly angled <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> below it. Each of these two parts was filled with labeled buttons and illuminated indicators each (roughly) one inch square. The display section {{was made up of}} indicators which when illuminated showed, in binary (grouped as octal) characters, the machine’s current running (or static) status at the individual machine core address and register level, for the compute, read and write operations then in progress. When a program was running, this display was a kaleidoscope of quickly changing, flashing, multi-colored <b>lights.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> section consisted of press-buttons to select the next register to be set and a central part that mirrored the lay-out of a single machine core address. Other buttons accessed more complex operations. Use of these buttons enabled the operator to select and then directly input to the machine’s core storage locations and registers the octal pattern he/she keyed in manually. For an operator to input a single machine instruction, each of up to ten octal characters of the instruction had to be selected and keyed in as its binary pattern - each with the correct (odd) parity bit.|$|R
50|$|Since {{winning the}} Wings Around the Globe {{race in the}} first film, Dusty Crophopper has a {{successful}} career as a racer. Unfortunately, his engine's gearbox becomes damaged because Dusty routinely operates the engine beyond its design limits. With that particular model of gearbox now out of production and none available anywhere, Dusty's mechanic Dottie fits a warning <b>light</b> to his <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> to ensure he doesn't damage his gearbox any further. No longer able to race and faced {{with the possibility of}} returning to his old job as a crop-duster, Dusty goes on a defiant flight and tests his limits. In doing so, Dusty exceeds his limits and makes a forced landing at Propwash Junction airport, causing a fire.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{introduction}} of a controller area network (CAN) to a house trailer or caravan. The past two decades have seen a large invasion of micro-controllers in modern vehicles. This {{is due in part to}} the miniaturization and decrease in costs of electronics, but also for the increase of services. These services include comfort, safety, diagnostics and fail-safes. Comfort such as controlled temperature or automatic wipers. Safety has the form of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and electronic stability program (ESP). Diagnostics address the detection of failed systems or the failure of one of its components, while fail-safes enables the systems to achieve a graceful degradation of performance when parts of the system have failed. The increase of electronic control units (ECUs) has resulted in an increase of wiring, which is very expensive and also weights much. Those also are two issues undesirable on a caravan where ECUs can bring an increase of services. The answer to the problem has been the development of a communication network between the ECUs through which messages are sent. The ECUs are referred to as nodes on the network. The system developed consists of four nodes connected together with the Controller Area Network (CAN) : front and rear control units, a combined yaw rate and acceleration sensor and a <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> As a whole, this base system <b>controls</b> all the <b>lights</b> on the outside of the caravan that are normally connected directly to the car. The most important benefit of this system is the cable reduction, but another advantage is the possibility to <b>control</b> the outdoor <b>lights</b> from the <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> The front <b>control</b> unit converts the light signals coming from the car to CAN-bus messages. The rear control unit receives these messages and converts them back to light signals. On the same bus and at the same time the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> can monitor the status of the light bulbs in the tail light ramp. Furthermore the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> can send dimmer control messages to maneuver the dimmer output on the front control unit. In addition to this, the system contains an in and outdoor temperature sensor, a yaw rate and acceleration sensor. All of this information is available on the CAN-bus and presented on the display in the <b>control</b> <b>panel.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
