25|$|The Naga Memorandum {{submitted}} by the Naga Club (which later became the Naga National Council) to the Simon Commission explicitly stated, 'to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> to determine ourselves as in ancient times.' In February 1946, the Naga Club officially took shape into a unified Naga National Council in Wokha. In June 1946, the Naga National Council submitted a four-point memorandum to officials discussing the independence of India from British colonial rule. The memorandum strongly protested against the grouping of Assam with Bengal and asserted that Naga Hills should be constitutionally included in an autonomous Assam, in a free India, with local autonomy, due safeguards and separate electorate for the Naga tribes.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} {{failure of}} Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, {{which made the}} studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. [...] "Three-quarters" [...] of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff {{that there would be}} a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented [...] "They did <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good." [...] Bird regarded the trade-off as having [...] "one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," [...] but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as [...] "fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can." [...] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; [...] "we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees," [...] said production designer Mark Whiting.|$|E
60|$|Goza leapt up, {{gave the}} royal salute, and retreated {{backwards}} from {{the presence of}} the king, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b> I also rose to depart, but Cetewayo motioned to me to be seated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] said Cecilia after a pause, [...] "as Sir Francis {{is going}} to-morrow, {{would you mind}} <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> for a few minutes? There is {{something}} which I {{have to say to}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Sire,' he said, 'here {{are your}} {{faithful}} nobles, eager to replace your majesty {{on the throne}} of your ancestors.' The National Guard in the palace withdrew at once, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> with the Swiss.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Leave</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Alone</b> – Capitol (No {{catalogue}} number, cancelled before release. [...] However, {{a tentative}} album cover slick for this release {{is shown in}} the [...] "collage" [...] of The Outsiders' [...] "Capitol Collectors Series" [...] CD booklet) ...|$|E
2500|$|Capitol gave {{tentative}} {{approval for}} a fourth album, which {{was to have been}} named after this single, <b>Leave</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Alone.</b> [...] However, the project was abandoned midway through, in favor of a faux live album called Happening Live!, where crowd noises plus song and bandmember introductions by Sonny Geraci were added to stripped-down studio renditions of older recordings, along with some recordings by the new line-up. [...] Not long thereafter, the group disbanded.|$|E
2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b> The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E
60|$|As he {{finished}} speaking men sprang at us and, pulling {{us from the}} horses, thrust us out of their company. Then they turned and in another minute {{were lost in the}} darkness, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nicephorus made a {{sign with}} his hand, {{and the four}} half-dumb men, all of whom resembled him strangely, {{especially}} in the weakness of their mouths and chins, obeyed. Bowing {{to me in a}} stately fashion, they withdrew, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} lass {{turned and ran}} out of that part of the house, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> together.--Alan in high good humour at the furthering of his schemes, and I in bitter dudgeon at being called a Jacobite and treated like a child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Verena, [...] "it's {{all very}} comfortable {{for you to}} say that you wish to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b> But you can't <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b> We are here, and we have got to be disposed of. You have got to put us somewhere. It's a remarkable social system that has no place for us!" [...] the girl went on, with her most charming laugh.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Am I {{her husband}} or are you? <b>Leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> for what {{time we have}} together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] Victor cried, [...] "I've {{heard of}} people being buried alive. It is too horrible to think about! <b>Leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> till to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{bowed to}} each other and all were sent from the chamber, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> quite <b>alone.</b>|$|R
60|$|The gypsies, {{taking us}} as {{in some way}} {{the cause of the}} {{extraordinary}} disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
60|$|Again {{she spoke}} to them, but in tones so low I could not catch the words, and then she started toward the {{opposite}} side of the chamber with the six mighty monsters trailing at heel. One by one she sent them through the secret panel into the room beyond, and when the last had passed from the chamber where we stood in wide-eyed amazement she turned and smiled at us and then herself passed through, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Macumazahn," [...] he went on, [...] "bid the men <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone,</b> {{and then}} follow me {{presently}} {{to the little}} glade down there by the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} came, Mr. Merrill," [...] said Wetherell, simply, [...] "I {{wanted to speak}} to you. Cynthia, will you <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> for a few minutes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now remember, Link," [...] said Dave, on parting {{with the}} youth, [...] "you {{have promised to}} <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> in the future. See that you keep that promise." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> {{they ran}} at him. But {{my father was}} much too quick for them. He rushed back into the corn and {{afterwards}} joined us in the wood, for he had seen wire before and knew how to escape it. Still he was terribly frightened and made us keep in the wood till the following evening, not even allowing my mother {{to go to her}} form in the rough pasture on its other side and lie up there.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Bickley {{lifted his}} {{revolver}} and fired. The man, {{shot through the}} heart, sprang {{into the air and}} fell upon his face--stone dead. There was consternation, for these people had never seen us shoot anything before, and were quite unacquainted with the properties of firearms, which they supposed to be merely instruments for making a noise. They stared, they gasped in fear and astonishment, and then they fled, pursued by Tommy, barking, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> with the two dead men.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} the {{resolution}} and address, Corny, to work my way into good quarters, this unexpected siege excepted," [...] he observed to me, when the others had withdrawn, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone.</b> [...] "This rivalry of ours is a generous one, and may now have fair play. If we quit this Nest of Herman Mordaunt's without ascertaining the true state of Anneke's feelings, we shall deserve to be condemned to celibacy {{for the remainder of}} our days. There never were two such opportunities for wooing to advantage!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] said Mrs. Ellison, when in Isabel's {{room the}} {{travellers}} had briefly celebrated these events, [...] "I should think you'd hate to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> up here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know. I had {{a violent}} {{hatred of the}} lives we were leading. I thought--we had to get away. To think.... But things don't <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There will be lodgings for {{two more}} here in a short time," [...] said Amos Green. [...] "If they only <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone,</b> this cell won't hold us long." ...|$|E
60|$|After a whispered {{colloquy}} {{with someone}} beyond carried {{on through the}} join of the curtains, he vanished between them, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> for five minutes or more. At length they opened and a tall and elegant woman with an Arab cast of countenance and clad in white robes, appeared and beckoned to us to enter. She did not speak or answer when I spoke to her, which was not wonderful as afterwards I discovered {{that she was a}} mute. We went in, I wondering very much {{what we were going to}} see.|$|R
60|$|A blessed {{thing it}} is for any man or woman to have a friend, one human soul whom we can trust utterly, who knows {{the best and worst}} of us, and who loves us in spite of all our faults; who will speak the honest truth to us, while the world flatters us to our face, and laughs at us behind our back; who will give us counsel and reproof in the days of {{prosperity}} and self-conceit; but who, again, will comfort and encourage us in the day of difficulty and sorrow, when the world <b>leaves</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> to fight our battle as we can.|$|R
60|$|Those {{who have}} not {{witnessed}} gales and storms in tropical regions can form but a faint conception of the fearful hurricane that burst upon the island of Mango at this time. Before we reached the temple the storm burst upon us with a deafening roar; and the natives, who knew too well the devastation that was to follow, fled right and left through the woods {{in order to save}} their property, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> {{in the midst of the}} howling storm. The trees around us bent before the blast like willows, and we were about to flee in order to seek shelter when the teacher ran toward us with a knife in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is quite}} right to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> {{together}} under the circumstances. And now tell me why my precious boy should doubt that his own mother wished to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Show him up directly. Nadgett! don't you <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> together. Mind you don't, now! By the Lord!' {{he added}} in a whisper to himself: 'We don't know what may happen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss DeGraf," [...] said Kenneth, {{noticing the}} boy's face critically, {{as he stood}} where {{the light from the}} passage fell upon it. [...] "Will you <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone,</b> please, Mr. Markham?" ...|$|E
60|$|While the Hesea still {{spoke the}} silvery {{curtains}} swung to their place as mysteriously {{as they had}} opened. Then, as though at some signal, the black-robed priests advanced. Surrounding Atene, they led her from the Sanctuary, accompanied by her uncle the Shaman, who, as it seemed to me, either through fatigue or fear, could scarcely stand upon his feet, but stood blinking his dim eyes as though the light dazed him. When these were gone, the priests and priestesses, who all this time had been ranged round the walls, far out of hearing of our talk, gathered themselves into their separate companies, and still chanting, departed also, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone</b> with Oros and the corpse of the Khan, which remained {{where it had been}} set down.|$|R
6000|$|When all had gone, <b>leaving</b> <b>us</b> <b>alone,</b> {{save for}} the priest Oros and the priestess Papave, who {{remained}} in attendance on their mistress, Ayesha, who sat gazing before her with dreaming, empty eyes, seemed to awake, for she rose and said--"A noble chant, is it not, and an ancient? It was the wedding song of the feast of Isis and Osiris at Behbit in Egypt, and there I heard it before ever I saw the darksome Caves of Kor. Often have I observed, my Holly, that music lingers longer than aught else in this changeful world, though it is rare that the very words should remain unvaried. Come, beloved--tell me, by what name shall I call thee? Thou art Kallikrates and yet----" ...|$|R
6000|$|His sister started up, {{and caught}} him fast by the arm. [...] "Robert!" [...] she exclaimed; [...] "you're not serious? You don't mean to <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> on foot, <b>alone</b> in the dark?" ...|$|R
