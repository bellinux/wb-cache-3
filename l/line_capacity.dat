5|$|It is {{proposed}} in the 2007 NSW State Plan that by 2017, the <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> between Hurstville and Sutherland will be amplified to allow extra services to and from Cronulla, {{as well as for}} services accessing the Mortdale Maintenance Centre. The 2010 Metropolitan Transport Plan made no mention of the project.|$|E
5|$|The 44-kilometre, 36 station fully {{underground}} Downtown Line, will {{connect the}} northwestern and eastern regions of Singapore {{to the new}} downtown at Marina Bay {{in the south and}} to the CBD. Similar to the Circle Line, three-car trainsets will run on the Downtown Line with <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> projected for 500,000 commuters daily. The Downtown Line is slated to be completed in three stages. Stage 1 from Bugis to Chinatown began operations on 22 December 2013. Stage 2 from Bukit Panjang to Rochor began operations on 27 December 2015. Stage 3 from Fort Canning to Expo commenced operations on 21 October 2017 and Stage 3e from Expo to Sungei Bedok will begin operations in 2024 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Bakerloo <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> {{could be}} {{increased}} by 25% with 27 tph at peak times by 2033.|$|E
25|$|Waterloo & City <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> {{increased}} by 50% by 2032, after the track at Waterloo station is remodelled.|$|E
25|$|Piccadilly <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> {{could be}} {{increased}} by 60% with 33 trains per hour (tph) at peak times by 2025.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity</b> will be extended to 12 trains per hour in either direction. To achieve this, it will be doubled to four tracks.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity</b> was {{increased}} by [...] per day, from [...] [...] The upgrade involved US$100 million in improvements to pumping stations, but no {{change to the}} actual pipes.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{a second}} track was planned {{to expand the}} <b>line's</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 2014, a second line with two-tracks 329 km in length was {{approved}} by the National Development and Reform Commission.|$|R
25|$|Walkley had {{a passing}} loop added in 2013 to {{increase}} train frequency and <b>line</b> <b>capacity.</b> It {{is the site}} of a proposed O-Train station.|$|E
25|$|Completely {{independent}} of the CBTC installation is the 7 Subway Extension (see below), which features both CBTC signals and fixed-block signaling. The extension will also increase <b>line</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason was}} the {{improved}} {{capacity of the}} U2 tunnel that was needed to accommodate the U3 traffic. Current subway lines in Nuremberg are built for a train frequency of 200 seconds or 3 minutes (sole exception: Ziegelstein-Flughafen: 400 seconds), which is already fully used on the U1 {{during the day and}} on the U2 during morning rush hour. With the new ATC system in place, additional (virtual) blocks will exist between stationary block signals, thus increasing <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> to a train frequency of 100 seconds. However, these new blocks can only be used by ATC-operated trains since they are virtual and have no stationary signal associated with them that can be observed by a driver-operated train without ATC equipment. Thus the increased <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> can only be effectively used after the U2 has been converted to full ATC operation.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of fixed blocks {{is that the}} faster trains are permitted to run, the longer the stopping distance, and therefore the longer the blocks need to be. This decreases a <b>line's</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Open a new {{train station}} at Autoroute 13 near {{boulevard}} Gouin (between Bois-Franc and Sunnybrooke stations). The project {{is subject to}} an increase on the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity,</b> pushing its commissioning date to 2015 or later.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2016, TTC {{spokesperson}} Brad Ross {{said that}} the ridership on the Yonge line is regularly 24,000 passengers per hour during the morning rush hours, approaching the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity</b> of 25,500. Automatic train control would increase the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity</b> to over 32,000 riders per hour but that would still {{not be enough to}} support the increased ridership from the extension. The TTC would need the completion of the relief line and SmartTrack in order to support the extra riders from York Region. (Note that the TTC and the Metrolinx report disagree as to the estimated capacity of the Yonge line after the implementation of automatic train control.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Kimball {{terminal}} {{was completely}} renovated {{and a new}} bridge over the North Branch of the Chicago River was completed in the 1970s. The Western and Merchandise Mart stations were rebuilt in the 1980s. Prior {{to the start of}} the Brown <b>Line</b> <b>Capacity</b> Expansion Project, these two stations, along with the Kimball terminal were the only ADA accessible stations on the Brown Line outside of the Loop.|$|E
25|$|Several {{possible}} expansions to the SkyTrain network {{have been}} announced. In 2005, TransLink released a ten-year outlook outlining a potential UBC Line and further {{expansion of the}} Expo Line into Surrey. In 2011, two separate rapid transit studies have given further examination and consultation into rapid transit options for expansion for the UBC/Broadway corridor, and Surrey and the South of Fraser region. Expo <b>Line</b> <b>capacity</b> upgrades are also being planned to meet future demand.|$|E
25|$|The above {{discussion}} compares line or corridor {{capacity and}} may therefore not be relevant for a networked PRT system, where several parallel lines (or parallel {{components of a}} grid) carry traffic. In addition, Muller estimated that while PRT may need more than one guideway to match the capacity of a conventional system, the capital cost of the multiple guideways may still be {{less than that of}} the single guideway conventional system. Thus comparisons of <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> should also consider the cost per line.|$|E
30|$|Improve {{the power}} flow {{distribution}} in the network to fit better with the <b>line</b> <b>capacities,</b> for example, by installing new facilities, like series reactors, phase shifting transformers, or devices to increase voltage support (shunt reactive, such as static VAR compensators).|$|R
50|$|In 1905 {{the tracks}} were {{electrified}} {{and the first}} electric trains became operational. Between 1913 and 1915, the MR added additional tracks to double the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity.</b> On 10 December 1932, the MR opened a branch line north from Wembley Park to Stanmore.|$|R
5|$|The Trans-Mongolian line, {{connecting}} Ulan-Ude on the Trans-Siberian with China's Erenhot via the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, both {{serves as}} a crucial link {{to the outside world}} for landlocked Mongolia, and the shortest connection between the Trans-Siberian Railway and Beijing. This <b>line's</b> <b>capacity,</b> however, is limited by its being single-track.|$|R
25|$|CIR-ELKE is an {{improvement}} {{on the basic}} LZB system. It uses the same physical interface and packets as standard LZB but upgrades its software, adding capabilities and modifying some procedures. It is designed to increase <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> by up to 40% and to further shorten travel times. The name is an abbreviation of the English/German project title Computer Integrated Railroading - Erhöhung der Leistungsfähigkeit im Kernnetz der Eisenbahn (Computer Integrated Railroading - Increase Capacity in the Core Railway Network). Being an extension of LZB it is also called LZB-CIR-ELKE further abbreviated into LZB-CE.|$|E
25|$|The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G) had {{main lines}} to Ayr and Carlisle; {{but the first}} section of the Ayr line was over the Glasgow and Paisley joint line: the line was {{operated}} by a Joint Committee, answerable to both the G and its rival, the Caledonian Railway. This lack of sovereignty was difficult enough in the railway politics of the time; but as traffic developed, congestion on the busy line became a serious issue. At that time goods traffic was heavy and slow, and <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> and reliability were heavily compromised.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2009, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that T. Boone Pickens has postponed {{plans to build}} his Texas wind farm. He said the project was stopped partly because existing transmission <b>line</b> <b>capacity</b> wasn't available. His company had planned to build new lines, but couldn't get financing. On the same date, The New York Times, {{reported that}} Pickens is committed to purchasing 667 wind turbines and will develop wind projects for them. On his Mesa Power Group website, Pickens said he expected to continue development of the Pampa project, {{but not at the}} pace originally expected.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{the line}} from Dapto to Kiama was electrified. A second platform, with awning and waiting shed, was {{constructed}} to provide a crossing point for trains and increase the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 2013, the pedestrian level crossing between the two platforms was modified to meet wheelchair access requirements.|$|R
30|$|The average burden rate {{of lines}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the total amount of {{electricity}} to the rated <b>capacity</b> of the <b>lines,</b> which can directly reflect the utilization level of the <b>line</b> <b>capacities</b> in distribution networks. Therefore, it can be applied to evaluate the utilization rate of lines.|$|R
30|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to improve urban railway <b>lines</b> <b>capacity</b> {{analysis}} considering the uncertainty associated to dwell times. In these type of lines dwell times have an important impact on capacity because there are frequent stops, and running times are quite stable due {{to the use of}} automatic driving systems.|$|R
25|$|By the {{completion}} of the Brown <b>Line</b> <b>Capacity</b> Expansion Project in 2010, original artwork was installed in each of the 18 renovated stations along the CTA's Brown Line. By combining the visibility and accessibility of the city's mass transit system with the creativity of Chicago's art resources, this program resulted in a successful public display of professional works of art designed with input from nearby communities. This program provided high-profile locations for public art and server as a gateway to communities served by the CTA stations. Media under consideration included, but were not limited to, mosaics, art glass, ornamental fencing, mixed-media artwork, and freestanding sculpture and furniture.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the CTA and the City of Chicago Public Art Program {{installed}} nine {{permanent works}} of art at eight renovated rail stations on what {{is now known as}} the Pink Line. The CTA has since created an ongoing program to showcase permanent {{works of art}} in conjunction with the City of Chicago Public Art Program. The Arts in Transit Program is funded by the Federal Transit Administration, and created opportunities to develop original artwork for station reconstruction projects along the CTA Red and Brown Lines. Artists were selected for each of the stations included in the Brown <b>Line</b> <b>Capacity</b> Expansion Project and select renovated Red Line stations.|$|E
25|$|The Astraea {{class was}} an eight ship class of {{protected}} cruisers {{built for the}} Royal Navy during the 1890s. The ships served {{on a number of}} foreign stations during their careers, particularly in the waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and around the Cape of Good Hope. Already obsolete by the outbreak of the First World War, most continued to see service in a variety of roles, though rarely in a front <b>line</b> <b>capacity.</b> By {{the end of the war}} the majority were being used as training or depot ships, and they were soon sold out of the service and scrapped. However one ship, , was bought by the Marine Society and used as a training ship until 1940.|$|E
50|$|The Caledonian Railway {{opened its}} line from Carlisle to Garriongill Junction in 1848 and its trains then ran through to Glasgow over the WM&CR. The {{demands on the}} <b>line's</b> <b>capacity</b> may led to the WM&CR {{passenger}} service being terminated at this time before being reinstated {{for a short time}} a few years later.|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of having fixed blocks {{is that the}} faster trains are allowed to run, the longer the stopping distance, and therefore the longer the blocks need to be, thus decreasing the <b>line's</b> <b>capacity.</b> The fixed blocks must be sized for the worst case stopping distance, regardless of the actual speed of the trains.|$|R
