40|$|Laboratory column {{experiments}} plus {{analytical and}} numerical modeling together suggest that, under certain conditions, downward organic liquid mobilization can occur and impact smoldering behavior. This applies for organic liquids mixed with inert sand subjected to smoldering as thermal treatment. The observed effects include increased peak temperatures (here {{by up to}} 35 %) and increased treatment times (here by up to 30 %). Downward organic liquid migration occurs when (i) injected Darcy air flux {{is less than a}} threshold value (here less than 3 cm/s), (ii) treatment systems are tall (here 90 cm, not 30 cm), and (iii) the organic liquid is temperature-sensitive (viscosity less than 0. 01 Pa s at 150 °C). The developed analytical equation provides the applied air flux that can negate the downwards organic <b>liquid</b> <b>gradient</b> required for migration. Smoldering behavior is demonstrated to adjust to liquid migration and thereby still destroy all the organic waste in the system. Smoldering is a relatively new, energy-efficient thermal treatment for organic liquid waste and these results are important for designing field applications of smoldering treatment...|$|E

The ethylene glycol solution (core liquid) withde-ionized (DI) water (cladding liquid) is co-injected into the lens chamber to form a gradient refractive index profile. The influences of the diffusion coefficient, mass fraction of ethylene glycol and flow rate of liquids on the refractive index profile of L-GRIN microlens are analyzed, and the finite element method and ray tracing method are used to simulate the convection-diffusion process and beam focusing process, which is helpful for the prediction of focusing effects and manipulation of the device. It is found that not only the focal length but the focal spot of the output beam can be adjusted by the diffusion coefficient, mass fraction and flow rate of liquids. The focal length of the microlens varies from 942 to 11 μm when the mass fraction of the ethylene glycol solution varies from 0. 05 to 0. 4, and the focal length changes from 127. 1 to 8 μm by varying the flow rate of the core liquid from 0. 5 × 103 to 5 × 103 pL/s {{when there is no}} slip between the core and cladding inlet.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] analysis of batch sedimentation tests performed for the purpose of continuous sedimentation vessel design is described. Conventional design techniques employ the concept of settling flux with, under certain conditions, a constitutive equation linking solid concentration and pressure in a unique and time-independent manner. Experimental studies employing measurement of local concentration and the <b>liquid</b> pressure <b>gradient</b> during sedimentation were used to determine the limits of the conventional design techniques. A 'maximum fluidized concentration' is defined which is the value above which it is difficult to maintain stable flux conditions and is the limit of applicability of conventional design methods based on settling flux. It is shown that the suspended solids contribute towards the <b>liquid</b> pressure <b>gradient</b> and, therefore, to the buoyancy experienced by the settling solids. However, during settlement the <b>liquid</b> pressure <b>gradient</b> reverts to the hydrostatic gradient alone; hence the buoyancy effect is a function of sedimentation time. Additional considerations also suggest that a unique relation between concentration and pressure should only be used as a constituent term in a time-dependent consolidation model. Current research effort includes a suitable method of linking time-dependent consolidation theory, under conditions of extremely low applied pressure, and sedimentation flux analysis...|$|R

The heavy chain subclass percentages were 47 % IgG 1, 14 % IgG 2 and 29 % IgG 3, and {{were different from}} previously reported distributions of myeloma proteins. In addition, 69 % (eleven out of fifteen) of the cryoglobulins and 100 % (seven out of seven) of the IgG 1 cryos contained type lambda light chains.

Six out of seven of the heavy chains were subjected to automated Edman degradation and were classified as containing vH-i or vH-ii variable region subgroups on the basis of their blocked amino termini. One type lambda light chain was unusual in that it contained an amino terminal sequence initially described in an amyloid fibril protein and is the first instance in which light chains with this sequence have been isolated from IgG.

40|$|The {{fracture}} {{properties of}} small, cylindrical samples of endosperm machined from single kernels of several varieties of wheat were measured using three methods: compression, wedge fracture and indentation. In addition, dynamic compression tests were also performed in impact loading. Density measurements using a variable density <b>liquid</b> <b>gradient</b> {{were carried out}} on machined endosperm samples {{that had previously been}} tested for fracture properties, enabling direct comparisons between their density and fracture properties. Within each variety, a distribution of density and hardness values was found. Soft wheat varieties (Riband, Apollo) showed a broad distribution of density with medians in the range 1340 to 1395 kg/m 3, whilst hard varieties such as Mercia and a durum wheat exhibited much narrower distributions and higher mean densities, Mercia being skewed towards higher densities, with a median at around 1410 kg/m 3. A considerable amount of overlap in density between the soft and hard variety occurred, with both containing a significant proportion of harder and higher density wheat grains, and the major difference appearing to be the presence in the soft wheat of a large proportion of lower density endosperm in the range 1280 to 1360 kg/m 3. The differences in density between endosperm samples were attributed to variations in endosperm porosity, which were correlated with the fracture properties of the endosperm. It is proposed that increased levels of porosity weaken the endosperm structure and are responsible in part for soft endosperm texture. The relationship between endosperm density and fracture properties was non-linear, the failure stress and fracture toughness increasing rapidly as the density approached a limiting value corresponding to the density expected for pore-free endosperm. This indicates that endosperm is a notch sensitive material, where the pores concentrate applied stresses and can act as sites of crack initiation. It was shown that the notch sensitivity of endosperm is qualitatively consistent with models of brittle fracture based on fracture mechanics theory, i. e. stress concentration by void...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{experimental work}} {{on the possibility of}} using deflection baffles in conventional distillation trays as flow straightening devices, with the view of enhancing tray efficiency. The mode of operation is based on deflecting part of the liquid momentum from the centre of the tray to the segment regions in order to drive stagnating liquid at the edges forward. The first part of the work was a detailed investigation into the two-phase flow patterns produced on a conventional sieve tray having 1 mm hole size perforations. The data provide a check on some earlier work and extend the range of the existing databank, particularly to conditions more typical of industrial operation. A critical survey of data collected on trays with different hole sizes (Hine, 1990; Chambers, 1993; Fenwick, 1996; this work) showed that the hole diameter has a significant influence on the flow regime, the size of the stagnant regions and the hydraulic and mass transfer performance. Five modified tray topologies were created with different configurations of baffles and tested extensively in the 2. 44 m diameter air-water pilot distillation simulator for their efficacy in achieving uniform flow across the tray and for their impact on tray loading capacity and mass transfer efficiency. Special attention was given to the calibration of the over 100 temperature probes used in measuring the water temperature across the tray on which the heat and mass transfer analogy is based. In addition to normal tray capacity experiments, higher weir load experiments were conducted using a 'half-tray' mode in order to extend the range of data to conditions more typical of industrial operation. The modified trays show superior flow characteristics compared to the conventional tray in terms of the ability to replenish the zones of exceptionally low temperatures and high residence times {{at the edges of the}} tray, to lower the bulk <b>liquid</b> <b>gradient</b> and to achieve a more uniform flow across the tray. These superior flow abilities, however, tend to diminish with increasing weir load because of the increasing tendency for the liquid to jump over the barriers instead of flowing over them. The modified tray topologies showed no tendency to cause undue limitation to tray loading capacity. Although the improvement in the efficiency of a single tray over that of the conventional tray was moderate and in some cases marginal, the multiplier effect in a multiple tray column situation would be significant (Porter et al., 1972). These results are in good agreement with an associated CFD studies (Fischer, 1999) carried out by partners in the Advanced Studies in Distillation consortium. It is concluded that deflection baffles can be used in a conventional distillation sieve tray to achieve better liquid flow distribution and obtain enhanced mass transfer efficiency, without undermining the tray loading capacity. Unlike any other controlled-flow tray whose mechanical complexity impose stringent manufacturing and installation tolerances, the baffled-tray models are simple to design, manufacture and install and thus provide an economic method of retrofitting badly performing sieve trays both in terms of downtime and fabrication.

We demonstrate how this scheme can be used to perform precise droplet positioning as well as merging, splitting, and sorting within open microfluidic networks. We further show how this scheme can be implemented for control of continuous-flow systems, specifically for generation of acoustically tunable <b>liquid</b> <b>gradients.</b> Device operation hinges on a resonance-decoding and rectification mechanism by which the frequency content in a composite acoustic input is decomposed into multiple independently buffered output pressures.

Cavities selectively amplify resonant tones in the input signal, resulting in highly elevated local cavity pressures. Fluidic-rectification structures then serve to convert the elevated oscillating cavity pressures into unidirectional flows.

While much more representative of practical applications, the small spatial scales and rapid time-scales prevent detailed measurement of the internal fluid dynamics and <b>liquid</b> property <b>gradients</b> produced by impinging upon surfaces. Realized through the extended spatial and temporal scales afforded by a microgravity environment, an improved understanding of drop breakup dynamics is sought to understand and ultimately control the impingement dynamics of droplets upon surfaces in practical situations. The primary objective of this research will be to mark the onset of different 'splashing modes' and to determine their temperature, pressure and angle dependence for impinging droplets representative of practical fluids. In addition, we are modeling the evolution of droplets that do not initially splash but rather undergo a 'fingering' evolution observed on the spreading fluid front and the transformation of these fingers into splashed products. An example of our experimental data is presented below. These images are of Isopar V impacting a mirror-polished surface. They were acquired using a high-speed camera at 1000 frames per second.

40|$|Based on the {{experimental}} finding that microbubble swarms dramatically promote heat transfer from a vertical heated wall, despite their potentially adiabatic nature, tests of microbubble fluid mechanics in the isothermal state are performed {{to clarify the}} unique motion characteristics of microbubble swarms. At constant bubble flow rate, the microbubble swarm shows a significant pulsatory rise along a vertical flat wall, particularly for small bubbles. Particle tracking velocimetry applied to the microbubbles shows that a two-way interaction between the microbubbles and the liquid flow self-excites the pulsation during their co-current rise. The sequence consists of the following processes: (i) increase in the bubble number density close to the wall {{as a result of}} the <b>liquid</b> velocity <b>gradient</b> driven by the microbubbles themselves; (ii) wave generation inside the microbubble swarm to induce the pulsatory rise of the swarm; and (iii) amplification of the waves, which results in void-bursting motion in the final stage...|$|R
