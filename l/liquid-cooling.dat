5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional <b>liquid-cooling</b> system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for <b>liquid-cooling</b> and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{material}} flammability due to exposure to high oxygen concentrations {{is a concern}} from both a safety and operational perspective. Localized, high oxygen concentrations can occur when exiting a higher oxygen concentration environment due to material saturation, as well as oxygen entrapment between barrier materials. Understanding of oxygen diffusion and permeation and its correlation to flammability risks can {{reduce the likelihood of}} fires while improving procedures as NASA moves to longer missions with increased extravehicular activities in both spacecraft and off-Earth habitats. This paper examines the time required for common spacecraft materials exposed to oxygen to return to reduced flammability after removal from the increased oxygen concentration environment. Specifically, NASA-STD- 6001 A maximum oxygen concentration testing and ASTM F- 1927 permeability testing were performed on Nomex 4 HT 90 - 40, Tiburon 5 Surgical Drape, Cotton, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) <b>Liquid-Cooled</b> Ventilation Garment, EMU Thermal Comfort Undergarment, EMU Mosite Foam with Spandex Covering, Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) Outer Cross-section, ACES Liquid Cooled Garment (LCG), ACES O 2 Hose Material, Minicel 6 Polyethylene Foam, Minicel Polyethylene Foam with Nomex Covering, Pyrell Polyurethane Foam, and Zotek 7 F- 30 Foam...|$|R

50|$|The G-300 uses three {{rotating}} combustion chambers.

50|$|Also, {{a modern}} and {{seemingly}} unrelated domain that Eheim got indirectly involved in {{is the use}} of its aquarium pumps in the <b>liquid-cooling</b> systems of overclocked computers.

50|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} some Northstar-equipped cars is a liquid-cooled {{alternator}} used on Cadillac's Seville, DeVille, and Eldorado. The <b>liquid-cooling</b> helped prolong {{the life of}} the alternator in these electronic-laden models, though GM reverted to a traditional air-cooled setup for 2001 to eliminate potential leak points and extraneous tubing.|$|E
50|$|Focusing {{heavily on}} the gaming market, Digital Storm’s designs for gaming {{desktops}} and laptops focus primarily on high-performance custom PC configurations, though they also produce workstation models.

50|$|In 1993 {{the engine}} was adopted for the R1100GS. In 1999, a more {{powerful}} six-speed version of the R259 engine was fitted in the BMW R1100S. In 2013 BMW introduced <b>liquid-cooling</b> for their flat-twin motorcycle engines, but the company still fit oilhead boxer engines to roadsters such as the R nineT and the R1100R.|$|E
50|$|All {{conversions}} of {{the original}} iDataPlex cluster were performed at the University of Regensburg. Newly developed parts were manufactured in the machine shop of the university's physics department. The data center of the university was extended to provide the <b>liquid-cooling</b> infrastructure.

50|$|A related {{event was}} the {{introduction}} of the CVCC clean-burn auto engine at the 1972 Tokyo show. It was Honda's first liquid-cooled engine to go into production; Honda cars as well as motorcycles had all been air-cooled up to that time. Soichiro Honda was not easily convinced that <b>liquid-cooling</b> was superior to air-cooled engines (which he had worked on for 50 years) but younger engineers eventually prevailed.|$|E
50|$|It {{features}} an advanced cooling system (both lubrication and <b>liquid-cooling)</b> compared to many same-level new engines worldwide and also {{compared to the}} PSA TU5JP4. The EF7 has a direct-drive oil pump. The water pump, oil pump and oil coolant system are integrated in one place to reduce removal of parts for maintenance compared to other engines. Other parts are re-engineered to provide ease in changing the oil filter.|$|E
50|$|For more {{stringent}} cooling requirements, the REDI (Ruggedized Enhanced Design Implementation - previously known as VITA 48) standard describes how to implement layout techniques to better support cooling methodologies on specific form factors. This provides a specification {{not only for}} ESD metal covers on two sides of VPX boards, but also for forced air, conduction- and <b>liquid-cooling</b> implementations. REDI also addresses spray cooling. To allow for greater power and heat dissipation, REDI includes provision for increased board-to-board spacing and increased board thickness.|$|E
50|$|Emissions {{regulations}} {{and the market}} demand for maximum power are driving the motorcycle industry to <b>liquid-cooling</b> for most motorcycles. Even Harley-Davidson, a strong advocate of air-cooled motors, has recently (and discreetly) added water cooling to the heads of their V-twin motors in their large touring models (currently for 2015 the Ultra Limited, Ultra limited low, CVO Street Glide, CVO Limited, and the CVO Road Glide Ultra) with the radiators being hidden in the lower leg fairings. Also, Harley offers three motorcycles that have 60 degree V-twin fully water cooled motors (as opposed to the traditional 45 degree air cooled) in the Street 500, Street 750, and two V-Rod motorcycles.|$|E

5000|$|This engine had {{its origins}} at the BSA Umberslade Hall {{research}} unit in Birmingham. David Garside, a BSA engineer, designed an air-cooled twin-rotor motorcycle engine {{that was based}} on the Fichtel & Sachs motor in the Hercules motorcycle. [...] Wankel engines run very hot, so Garside gave this air-cooled motor interior cooling air that was drawn first through the rotors and into a large plenum before entering the combustion chambers via the carburetors. Only 100 air-cooled Norton Classics were produced. The later Norton Commander had <b>liquid-cooling,</b> but with the same air-cooling of the rotors as the Classic. These Norton engines had a total-loss oiling system, just like an oil-injected two-stroke engine.|$|E
50|$|After {{isolating}} {{the pump}} problem, {{cars and trucks}} built for the war effort (no civilian cars were built during that time) were equipped with carbon-seal water pumps that did not leak and caused no more geysers. Meanwhile, air cooling advanced in memory of boiling engines... even though boil-over {{was no longer a}} common problem. Air-cooled engines became popular throughout Europe. After the war, Volkswagen advertised in the USA as not boiling over, even though new water-cooled cars no longer boiled over, but these cars sold well. But as air quality awareness rose in the 1960s, and laws governing exhaust emissions were passed, unleaded gas replaced leaded gas and leaner fuel mixtures became the norm. Subaru chose <b>liquid-cooling</b> for their EA series (flat) engine when it was introduced in 1966.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{involves}} {{alteration of}} an existing vehicle, most notably the original car or chassis, often a Volkswagen Beetle or a purpose-built chassis. The model is nicknamed Bug, therefore the term [...] "buggy". The Beetle automobile platform is preferred {{for a variety of}} reasons. Most significant is the position of the rear mounted Volkswagen engine, which with removal of bodywork transfers a high proportion of the weight to the rear driven wheels for extra traction. The engine is air cooled, simplifying engine modification, and the absence of a radiator and <b>liquid-cooling</b> system eliminates multiple sources of failure. The low price, robustness of the front suspension, and the sizable quantity of spare parts from other VW Beetles and Type 2 (Microbus) are a further advantage. Chevrolet Corvair engines are also a way to upgrade to 6 cylinders and sometimes vehicles are fitted with turbochargers.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of bolted 6061-T6 aluminium, {{with the two}} seats mounted on a fuselage boom tube that runs from the front rudder pedals to the tail. The landing gear consists of two main wheels on chrome molybdenum steel gear legs and axles, and a tail wheel configuration. The flexible steel axles work as shock absorbers during taxiing and landing. The tail wheel is steerable {{by means of the}} rudder pedals. The standard Rotax 582 engine is mounted in pusher configuration behind the wing's trailing edge. The engine's <b>liquid-cooling</b> allows fast descents while towing, without subjecting the engine cylinders to shock-cooling. The wing is supported by a V-strut and jury struts. The wing and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. A unique feature is the extended rudder post, which is supported by steel cables from the wings and used as a tow attachment point. The aircraft is equipped with dual controls for pilot training and the rear seat is removable when not needed. The aircraft takes about 200 hours to assemble from the kit.|$|E
50|$|If {{the design}} of the <b>liquid-cooling</b> system allows for high coolant temperatures, energy can be saved or even reused, {{depending}} on the climate conditions and on the local infrastructure. For example, free cooling is possible if the coolant temperature is higher than the ambient temperature. In that case the energy for chillers can be saved. If the coolant temperature is even higher, the waste heat from the compute equipment could be used for heating purposes or to drive an adsorption chiller to generate chilled water. The former option is implemented, e.g., by theLeibniz-Rechenzentrum in Germany, where SuperMUC drives the heating of the data center during winter with roughly 1 MW recovered from the compute equipment. The latter option, which is the design target of iDataCool, requires a high quality of the heat, which can only be achieved by direct hot-water cooling. One example for direct hot-water cooling is the Aquasar project at ETH Zürich, which is operated at coolant temperatures around 60°C.The aim of iDataCool was to achieve coolant temperatures of more than 65°C, at which commercially available adsorption chillers tend to become efficient, and to demonstrate the long-term stability of a large production machine under these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In this entry, for clarity, {{the term}} [...] "inline engine" [...] refers only to engines {{with a single}} row of cylinders, as used in {{automotive}} language, but in aviation terms, the phrase [...] "inline engine" [...] also covers V-type and opposed engines (as described below), and {{is not limited to}} engines with a single row of cylinders. This is typically to differentiate them from radial engines. A straight engine typically has an even number of cylinders, but there are instances of three- and five-cylinder engines. The greatest advantage of an inline engine is that it allows the aircraft to be designed with a low frontal area to minimise drag. If the engine crankshaft is located above the cylinders, it is called an inverted inline engine: this allows the propeller to be mounted high up to increase ground clearance, enabling shorter landing gear. The disadvantages of an inline engine include a poor power-to-weight ratio, because the crankcase and crankshaft are long and thus heavy. An in-line engine may be either air-cooled or liquid-cooled, but <b>liquid-cooling</b> is more common because it is difficult to get enough air-flow to cool the rear cylinders directly. Inline engines were common in early aircraft; one was used in the Wright Flyer, the aircraft that made the first controlled powered flight. However, the inherent disadvantages of the design soon became apparent, and the inline design was abandoned, becoming a rarity in modern aviation.|$|E

40|$|Single-phase <b>liquid-cooling</b> microchannels have {{received}} great attention {{to remove the}} gradually increased heat loads of heat sinks. Proper changes of the flow path and/or heat transfer surface can result in much better thermal performance of microchannel heat sinks. In this study, a kind of rectangular straight microchannel heat sink with bifurcation flow arrangement has been designed, and the corresponding laminar flow and heat transfer have been investigated numerically. Four different configurations are considered. The effects of the bifurcation ratio (the initial channel number over the bifurcating channel number) and length ratio (the channel length before bifurcation over the bifurcation channel length) on laminar heat transfer, pressure drop, and thermal resistance are considered and {{compared with those of}} the traditional straight microchannel heat sink without bifurcation flow. The overall thermal resistances subjected to inlet Reynolds number and pumping power are compared for the five microchannel heat sinks. Results show that the thermal performance of the microchannel heat sink with bifurcation flow is better than that of the corresponding straight microchannel heat sink. The heat sinks with larger bifurcation ratio and length ratio provide much better thermal performance.

40|$|Battery thermal {{management}} {{is critical in}} achieving performance and the extended life of batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles under real-driving conditions. Appropriate modeling for predicting thermal behavior of battery systems in vehicles helps to make decisions for improved design and shortens the development process. For this paper, {{we looked at the}} impact of cooling strategies with air and direct/indirect liquid cooling. The simplicity of an air-cooling system is an advantage over a <b>liquid-cooling</b> system. In addition to its intrinsically lower heat transfer coefficient, another disadvantage of air cooling is that the small heat capacity of air makes it difficult to accomplish temperature uniformity inside a cell or between cells in a module. <b>Liquid-cooling</b> is more effective in heat transfer and takes up less volume, but the added complexity and cost may outweigh the merits. The surface heat transfer coefficient, h, and the blower power for air cooling are sensitive to the hydraulic diameter of the cooling channel (Dh). However, because of the added thermal resistances, h evaluated at cell surface is not as sensitive to the variation of Dh in an indirect (water/glycol jacket) cooling system. Due to the high heat transfer coefficient at small Dh, direct liquid cooling using dielectric mineral oils may be preferred in spite of high pressure loss in certain circumstances such as in highly transient large heat generating battery systems. In general, air-cooling should be considered first, as the power demand increases with heavier vehicles and more aggressive driving, water/glycol jacket cooling should be considered next.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{operating}} cooling fluid, internal combustion engine cooling systems can be classified in two macro areas: air-cooling system and <b>liquid-cooling</b> system. In four-stroke engines, <b>liquid-cooling</b> system is generally preferred to the air-cooling system because of its efficiency in the engine heat dissipation. However, thanks to its simplicity, today the engine air-cooling system is still widely used in the engine market, especially on two-stroke engine applications like small motorbike, light aircraft, and handheld products. To assure the necessary heat waste in air-cooled engines, the key point is the optimization of the air flow over the cylinder external surface. Air flow separation from cylinder external surface can result in high temperature gradients inside the cylinder volume causing destructive heat problem for the engine. It can be avoided only by a fine optimization of the cylinder fin design placed externally to the cylinder surface. To fulfil this need, the definition of specific methodology to evaluate the air-cooling effect on the engine is mandatory. In the present paper, the authors present a 3 D-CFD simulation methodology designed to perform a detailed evaluation of two-stroke air-cooled engines. The methodology was applied on two different engines equipping handheld brush-cutter machines. The optimization of the air-cooling system of such a machine is a very challenging task because the machine design must be very compact forcing all the engine parts to remain quite close each other. The simulation results are compared to experimental evidences in order to verify the validity of the proposed approach...|$|E
