The former was rich in early developing embryos and its activity decreased during embryonic development. The latter was found constantly throughout the developing stages of embryos. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I existed in a cytoplasmic fraction and <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II {{is concentrated in}} nuclei. Both enzymes ligate 5 '-phosphoryl and 3 '-hydroxyl groups in oligo(dT) {{in the presence of}} poly(dA). <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II is also able to join oligo(dT) (poly(rA). Both enzymes require ATP and Mg 2 + for activity. The Km for ATP is 2. 7 × 10 − 6 M for <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I, and 3. 0 × 10 − 5 M for <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I requires dithiothreitol and polyvinyl alcohol, but <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II does not. Both enzymes are inhibited in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is active at a low salt concentration (0 – 30 mM KCl), but <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II is active at high salt concentrations (50 – 100 mM). <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is more labile than <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II.

To assess the role of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> function in the etiology of BS, we have cloned the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I cDNA from normal human cells by a PCR strategy using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved regions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> genes.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha mRNA encodes {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial versions of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha. Nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha exists and functions {{in a stable}} complex with the DNA repair protein XRCC1. These proteins interact via their C-terminal BRCT domains. XRCC1 has no enzymatic activity but instead appears to acts as a scaffold protein by interacting {{with a large number}} of proteins involved in base excision and single-strand break repair. The participation of XRCC1 in these pathways is consistent with the phenotype of xrcc1 cells. In contrast to nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha, mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha functions independently of XRCC1, which is not found in mitochondria. It appears that nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha forms a complex with XRCC1 in the cytoplasm and the subsequent nuclear targeting of the resultant complex is directed by the XRCC1 nuclear localization signal. While mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha also interacts with XRCC1, {{it is likely that the}} activity of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha is greater than the activity of the XRCC1 nuclear localization signal and that the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha/XRCC1 complex is disrupted when mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha passes through the mitochondrial membrane.|$|R

The SRV virions have no glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity. All enzyme activities, but glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and adenosine triphosphatase, were increased by disruption of the virions.

40|$|Three biochemically {{distinct}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> {{activities have}} been identified in mammalian cell extracts. We have recently purified <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II and <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III to near homogeneity from bovine liver and testis tissue, respectively. Amino acid sequencing studies indicated that these enzymes are encoded by the same gene. In the present study, human and murine cDNA clones encoding <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III were isolated with probes based on the peptide sequences. The human <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 862 amino acids, whose sequence is more closely related to those of the DNA ligases encoded by poxviruses than to replicative DNA ligases, such as human <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA produced a catalytically active <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> similar in size and substrate specificity to the purified bovine enzyme. The <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III gene was localized to human chromosome 17, which eliminated this gene as a candidate for the cancer-prone disease Bloom syndrome that is associated with DNA joining abnormalities. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III is ubiquitously expressed at low levels, except in the testes, in which the steady-state levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III mRNA are at least 10 -fold higher than those detected in other tissues and cells. Since <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I mRNA is also present at high levels in the testes, we examined the expression of the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> genes during spermatogenesis. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I mRNA expression correlated with the contribution of proliferating spermatogonia cells to the testes, in agreement with the previously defined role of this enzyme in DNA replication. In contrast, elevated levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III mRNA were observed in primary spermatocytes undergoing recombination prior to the first meiotic division. Therefore, we suggest that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III seals <b>DNA</b> strand breaks that arise during the process of meiotic recombination in germ cells and as a consequence of DNA damage in somatic cells...|$|R
5000|$|Since the LIG3 gene encodes {{the only}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> in mitochondria, {{inactivation}} of the LIG3 gene results in loss of mitochondrial DNA {{that in turn}} leads to loss of mitochondrial function. Fibroblasts with inactivated Lig3 gene can be propagated in the media supplemented with uridine and pyruvate. However, these cells lack mtDNA. Interestingly, physiological levels of mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III appear excessive, and cells with 100-fold reduced mitochondrial content of mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha maintain normal mtDNA copy number. The essential role of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha in mitochondrial DNA metabolism can be fulfilled by other DNA ligases, including the NAD-dependent <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> of E. coli, if they are targeted to mitochondria. [...] Thus, viable cells that lack nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha can be generated. While <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is the predominant enzyme that joins Okazaki fragments during DNA replication, it is now evident that the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha/XRCC1 complex enables cells that either lack or have reduced <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I activity to complete DNA replication. Given the biochemical and cell biology studies linking the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha/XRCC1 complex with excision repair and the repair of DNA single strand breaks, it was surprising that the cells lacking nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha did not exhibit significantly increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agent.

40|$|Repair of DNA double-strand breaks {{can occur}} by either non{{homologous}} end joining or homologous recombination. Most nonhomologous end joining requires a specialized <b>ligase,</b> <b>DNA</b> ligase IV (Lig 4). In Drosophila melanogaster, double-strand breaks created by excision of a P element are usually repaired by a homologous recombination pathway called synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). SDSA requires strand invasion mediated by DmRad 51, {{the product of}} the spn-A gene. In spn-A mutants, repair proceeds through a nonconservative pathway involving the annealing of microhomologies found within the 17 -nt overhangs produced by P excision. We report here that end joining of P-element breaks in the absence of DmRad 51 does not require Drosophila LIG 4. In wild-type flies, SDSA is sometimes incomplete, and repair is finished by an end-joining pathway that also appears to be independent of LIG 4. Loss of LIG 4 does not increase sensitivity to ionizing radiation in late-stage larvae, but lig 4 spn-A double mutants do show heightened sensitivity relative to spn-A single mutants. Together, our results suggest that a LIG 4 -independent end-joining pathway is responsible for the majority of double-strand break repair in the absence of homologous recombination in flies...|$|E
40|$|Three {{distinct}} DNA ligases, I to III, {{have been}} found previously in mammalian cells, but a cloned cDNA has been identified only for DNA ligase I, an essential enzyme active in DNA replication. A short peptide sequence conserved close to the C terminus of all known eukaryotic DNA ligases was used to search for additional homologous sequences in human cDNA libraries. Two different incomplete cDNA clones that showed partial homology to the conserved peptide were identified. Full-length cDNAs were obtained and expressed by in vitro transcription and translation. The 103 -kDa product of one cDNA clone formed a characteristic complex with the XRCC 1 DNA repair protein and was identical with the previously described DNA ligase III.

40|$|Cells {{infected}} by adenovirus E 4 mutants accumulate end-to-end concatemers of the viral genome that are assembled from unit-length viral DNAs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Genome concatenation {{can be prevented}} by expression either of E 4 11 k (product of E 4 orf 3) or of the complex of E 4 34 k (product of E 4 orf 6) and E 1 b 55 k. Both E 4 11 k and the E 4 34 k/E 1 b 55 k complex prevent concatenation {{at least in part}} by inactivation of the host protein Mre 11 : E 4 11 k sequesters Mre 11 in aggresomes, while the E 4 34 k/E 1 b 55 k complex participates in a virus-specific E 3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The E 4 34 k/E 1 b 55 k complex, but not E 4 11 k, also inhibits NHEJ activity on internal breaks in the viral genome and on V(D) J recombination substrate plasmids, suggesting that it may interfere with NHEJ independently of its effect on Mre 11. We show here that DNA ligase IV, which performs the joining step of NHEJ, is degraded as a consequence of adenovirus infection. Degradation is dependent upon E 4 34 k and E 1 b 55 k, functional proteasomes, and the activity of cellular cullin 5, a component of the adenoviral ubiquitin <b>ligase.</b> <b>DNA</b> ligase IV also interacts physically with E 1 b 55 k.

In this study, we show that two forms of mammalian <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III, alpha and beta, are produced by a conserved tissue-specific alternative splicing mechanism involving exons encoding the C termini of the polypeptides. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha cDNA, which encodes a 103 -kDa polypeptide, is expressed in all tissues and cells, whereas <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-beta cDNA, which encodes a 96 -kDa polypeptide, is expressed only in the testis. During male germ cell differentiation, elevated expression of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-beta mRNA is restricted, beginning only in the latter stages of meiotic prophase and ending in the round spermatid stage. In 96 -kDa <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-beta, the C-terminal 77 amino acids of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III-alpha are replaced by a different 17 - to 18 -amino acid sequence.

40|$|PTTG binding factor (PBF) {{has been}} implicated in many cancers, {{including}} thyroid. One of the main treatments for thyroid cancer is ablation using Il 3 l. Previous research has shown PBF can inhibit Il 3 l uptake into the thyroid, which may account for some cancer recurrence. Unpublished data has shown PBF can bind to and inactivate p 53, disrupt DNA repair, induce genetic instability and cause a twofold rise in the E 2 <b>ligase</b> <b>DNA</b> repair protein Rad 6. Rad 6 is known to form a complex with p 53 and aids regulation of p 53 cellular levels. The aim of this project {{was to determine if}} PBF binds to and promotes Rad 6 to impair DNA repair using siRNA, transfection, Western blotting and Co-Immunoprecipitation techniques. Results found that knock down of Rad 6 lowered p 53 levels and overexpressed Rad 6 resulted in an abnormal Rad 6 -p 53 co-localisation. Also, as PBF can induce Rad 6, Rad 6 can also induce PBF. In conclusion increased Rad 6 expression resulted in an abnormal, perhaps oncogenic, interaction with p 53, but it is still unknown if PBF binds to Rad 6 inhibiting DNA repair capacity. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a worldwide problem which is often asymptomatic in the early stages leading to delayed diagnosis. Unfortunately advanced disease has no cure with treatment being palliative only. Evidence is accumulating that sex hormones can act both as a risk factor and propagate CRC tumour growth. However, current research examining the oestrogen metabolism pathway in CRC has revealed conflicting results. In an attempt to uncover what drives tumour growth the key oestrogen enzymes in both CRC cell lines and human tissue were investigated using LCA 4 S, FACS, RT-PCR, Western Blotting and radiolabelled STS activity assay. Results demonstrated that CRC cell line data are extremely variable. Colo 205 cells had greatest STS activity within CRC cell lines and in contrast to other studies oestradiol had no effect on apoptosis. In human female samples STS activity was increased in cancerous tissue compared to matched normal controls and this activity could be inhibited by STX 64. In conclusion sex hormones are involved in the development and growth of colorectal cancer and STS inhibitors may benefit females with colorectal cancer...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Endonucleases {{are a large}} {{class of}} enzymes that {{catalyze}} the formation of site-specific double strand breaks in DNA. Homing endonucleases are expressed from open reading frames within intervening sequences (introns or inteins) and promote the lateral transfer of their host intron to a cognate intronless allele. A novel mechanism of DNA endonucleolytic cleavage, exhibited by the homing endonuclease I-Ppol and characterized by a histidine general base, has been visualized at high resolution by intermediate trapping and studied computationally. The structures of three separate catalytic species were determined by X-ray crystallography and are presented here. The nudged elastic band method was {{used to calculate the}} minimum energy path for the catalyzed reaction and the predicted rate is compared to experiment. In addition, the structure of I-Ppol bound to its DNA target site shows that bound DNA is severely bent, resulting in significant deformations of the minor and major grooves near the scissile phosphates. To study the role of conformational changes within the protein catalyst and the DNA substrate, the structures of both the apo enzyme and the L 116 A mutant protein/DNA complex with severely decreased binding affinity were determined. The wild-type protein displays a rigid-body rotation of its individual subunits upon DNA binding. Homing site DNA is not detectably bent in the absence of protein, but is sharply bent in both the WT and L 116 A complexes, indicating that binding involves a large distortion of the DNA and a smaller change in protein conformation. The critical function of leucine 116 is also described. T 4 phage polynucleotide kinase (PNK) was identified over 35 years ago and has become a staple reagent for molecular biologists. The enzyme displays 5 '-hydroxyl kinase, 3 '-phosphatase, and 2 ', 3 '-cyclic phosphodiesterase activities against a wide range of substrates.

The optimal incubation temperature for T4 <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> is 16 C.|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} compatibility of {{vaccinia virus}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> with eukaryotic counterparts was demonstrated by {{its ability to}} complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc 9. The vaccinia <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> is a 63 kDa protein expressed early during infection that is non-essential for virus DNA replication and recombination in cultured cells. This implies complementation by a mammalian <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase,</b> yet no obvious recruitment of host <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was observed during infection. An antiserum raised against a peptide conserved in eukaryotic DNA ligases identified the virus enzyme in discrete cytoplasmic 'factories', the sites of virus DNA synthesis, demonstrating immunological cross-reactivity between host <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I and the vaccinia enzyme. <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> was not detected in the factories of a mutant virus lacking the ligase gene. Despite this, no difference in growth between wild-type (WT) and mutant virus was detectable even in Bloom's syndrome cells which have reduced <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I activity. However, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> negative virus showed an increased sensitivity to UV or bleomycin in cultured cells, {{and the importance of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> for virus virulence in vivo was demonstrated by the attenuated phenotype of the deletion mutant in intranasally infected mice...|$|R
50|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II: {{appears to}} be used in repair. It is formed by {{alternative}} splicing of a proteolytic fragment of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III and does not have its own gene, therefore it is often considered to be virtually identical to <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III.|$|R
40|$|The human <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III gene encodes both {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} proteins. Abundant evidence supports {{the conclusion that}} the nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III protein plays an essential role in both base excision repair and homologous recombination. However, the role of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III protein in mitochondrial genome dynamics has been obscure. Human tumor-derived HT 1080 cells were transfected with an antisense <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III expression vector and clones with diminished levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III activity identified. Mitochondrial protein extracts prepared from these clones had decreased levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III relative to extracts from cells transfected with a control vector. Analysis of these clones revealed that the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III antisense mRNA-expressing cells had reduced mtDNA content compared to control cells. In addition, the residual mtDNA present in these cells had numerous single-strand nicks that were not detected in mtDNA from control cells. Cells expressing antisense ligase III also had diminished capacity to restore their mtDNA to pre-irradiation levels following exposure to γ-irradiation. An antisense-mediated reduction in cellular <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV had no effect on the copy number or integrity of mtDNA. This observaion, coupled with other evidence, suggests that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV is not present in the mitochondria and does not play a role in maintaining mtDNA integrity. We conclude that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III is essential for the proper maintenance of mtDNA in cultured mammalian somatic cells...|$|R
40|$|Present {{address of}} CP: IBMC du CNRSInternational audienceMammalian <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I {{has been shown}} to be a phosphoprotein. Dephosphorylation of {{purified}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I causes inactivation, an effect dependent on the presence of the N-terminal region of the protein. Expression of full-length human <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I in Escherichia coli yielded soluble but catalytically inactive enzyme whereas an N-terminally truncated form expressed activity. Incubation of the full-length preparation from E. coli with purified casein kinase II (CKII) resulted in phosphorylation of the N-terminal region and was accompanied by activation of the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase.</b> Of a variety of purified protein kinases tested, only CKII stimulated the activity of calf thymus <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I revealed that CKII specifically phosphorylated a major peptide also apparently phosphorylated in cells, implying that CKII is a protein kinase acting on <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I in the cell nucleus. These data suggest that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is negatively regulated by its N-terminal region and that this inhibition can be relieved by post-translational modification...|$|R
40|$|DNA replication, repair, and {{recombination}} {{are essential}} processes in mammalian cells. Hence, {{the application of}} gene targeting {{to the study of}} these DNA metabolic pathways requires the creation of nonnull mutations. We have developed a method for introducing partially defective mutants in murine embryonic stem cells that circumvents the problem of cellular lethality of targeted mutations at essential loci. Using this approach, we have determined that mammalian <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is essential for cell viability. Thus, DNA ligases II and III are not redundant with <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I for the function(s) associated with cell proliferation. Partial complementation of the lethal <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I null mutation allowed the creation of deficient embryonic stem cell lines. We found that a wild-type <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I cDNA, as well as a variant <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I cDNA, was able to rescue the lethality of the homozygous null mutation, whereas an N-terminal deletion mutant consisting of the minimal <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I catalytic domain was not. This observation demonstrates that sequences outside the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I catalytic domain are essential for <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I function in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IIIalpha and <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I {{participate in}} the short- and long-patch base excision repair pathways, respectively. Using an in vitro repair assay employing DNA ligase-depleted cell extracts and DNA substrates containing a single lesion repaired either through short-patch (regular abasic site) or long-patch (reduced abasic site) base excision repair pathways, we addressed the question whether DNA ligases are specific to each pathway or if they are exchangeable. We find that immunodepletion of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I {{did not affect the}} short-patch repair pathway but blocked long-patch repair, suggesting that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IIIa is not able to substitute <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I during long-patch repair. In contrast, immunodepletion of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IIIa did not significantly affect either pathway. Moreover, repair of normal abasic sites in wild-type and X-ray cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC 1) -DNA ligase IIIalpha-immunodepleted cell extracts involved similar proportions of short- and long-patch repair events. This suggests that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I was able to efficiently substitute the XRCC 1 -DNA ligase IIIa complex during short-patch repair...|$|R
40|$|The data in {{the present}} study show that DNA {{polymerase}} γ and <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III interact in mitochondrial protein extracts from cultured HT 1080 cells. An interaction was also observed between the two recombinant proteins in vitro. Expression of catalytically inert versions of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III that bind DNA polymerase γ was associated with reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number and integrity. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or integrity. Experiments revealed that wild-type <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III facilitates the interaction of DNA polymerase γ with a nicked DNA substrate in vitro, and that the zinc finger domain of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III is required for this activity. Mitochondrial protein extracts prepared from cells overexpressing a <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III protein that lacked the zinc finger domain had reduced base excision repair activity compared with extracts from cells overexpressing the wild-type protein. These data support the interpretation that the interaction of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III and <b>DNA</b> polymerase γ is required for proper maintenance of the mammalian mitochondrial genome...|$|R
40|$|A protein {{inhibitor}} {{for human}} <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I {{has recently been}} identified. It was copurified with {{a fraction of the}} enzymes from HeLa cells through several steps of chromatography. The inhibitor was first identified by the absence of ligation activity of the associated enzyme, while it retained the ability to form the ligase-[32 P]AMP adducts. The inhibitor was eluted as a single peak at approximately 0. 25 - 0. 30 M NaCl from a Mono S column. It inhibited the ligation of both double-stranded and single-stranded breaks by purified <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I but not by T 4 <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> and <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II. Subsequent gel-filtration chromatography indicated that this inhibitor, with a molecular mass of 55 - 75 kDa, could form a complex with <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I and inhibited the DNA ligation activity. Rechromatography of the ligase I-inhibitor complex in high-salt conditions resulted in the dissociation of the complex and the restoration of enzyme activity, indicating that the physical interaction of inhibitor with <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I is one of the mechanisms of inhibition. These data indicate that this protein inhibitor for <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I may play a specific role in regulating DNA ligation during replication, repair, or recombination...|$|R
40|$|A <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV (LIG 4) -null human pre-B {{cell line}} and human cell lines with hypomorphic {{mutations}} in LIG 4 are signi®cantly impaired {{in the frequency}} and ®delity of end joining using an in vivo plasmid assay. Analysis of the null line demonstrates {{the existence of an}} error-prone <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV-independent rejoining mechanism in mammalian cells. Analysis of lines with hypomorphic mutations demonstrates that residual <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV activity, which is suf®cient to promote ef®cient end joining, nevertheless can result in decreased ®delity of rejoining. Thus, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV is an important factor in¯uencing the ®delity of end joining in vivo. The LIG 4 -defective cell lines also showed impaired end joining in an in vitro assay using cell-free extracts. Elevated degradation of the terminal nucleotide was observed in a LIG 4 -defective line, and addition of the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV±XRCC 4 complex restored end protection. End protection by <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV was not dependent upon ligation. Finally, using puri®ed proteins, we demonstrate that <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV±XRCC 4 is able to protect DNA ends from degradation by T 7 exonuclease. Thus, the ability of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV±XRCC 4 to protect DNA ends may contribute to the ability of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> IV to promote accurate rejoining in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Four biochemically {{distinct}} DNA ligases {{have been}} identified in mammalian cells. One of these enzymes, <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> I, is functionally homologous to the <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC 9 gene. Cdc 9 <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> has been assumed to be the only species of <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> in this organism. In the present study we have identified a second <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> activity in mitotic extracts of S. cerevisiae with chromatographic properties different from Cdc 9 <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase,</b> which is the major DNA joining activity. This minor DNA joining activity, which contributes 5 - 10 % of the total cellular DNA joining activity, forms a 90 kDa enzyme-adenylate intermediate which, unlike the Cdc 9 enzyme-adenylate intermediate, reacts with an oligo (pdT) /poly (rA) substrate. The levels of the minor DNA joining activity are not altered by mutation or by overexpression of the CDC 9 gene. Furthermore, the 90 kDa polypeptide is not recognized by a Cdc 9 antiserum. Since this minor species {{does not appear to be}} a modified form of Cdc 9 <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase,</b> it has been designated as S. cerevisiae <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> II. Based on the similarities in polynucleotide substrate specificity, this enzyme may be the functional homolog of mammalian <b>DNA</b> <b>ligase</b> III or IV...|$|R
