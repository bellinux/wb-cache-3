Their advisers learned to calculate how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> {{a drug to}} move from blood into urine, and therefore how much time a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test.

25|$|Dewey is {{well known}} for his work in the applied {{philosophy}} of the philosophy of education. Dewey's philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing. Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal, and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real-life activities. For example, in math, students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to travel distances with certain modes of transportation.|$|E

25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> them to pay off the balance.|$|E

It had to include {{the time required to}} assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then [...] sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} {{recording}} [...] "Yoda", Yankovic started recording [...] "Like a Surgeon", the lead single for the album. Although Yankovic normally refuses to use parody ideas from other people, Madonna is {{partly responsible for}} [...] "Like a Surgeon". Madonna asked {{one of her friends}} how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> until Yankovic satirized her song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] into [...] "Like a Surgeon". This friend was a mutual friend of Al's manager, Jay Levey. When word got back to Yankovic, he decided {{it was a good idea}} and wrote the song. This is the only known time that Yankovic has gotten a parody idea directly from the original artist.|$|E

[...] The two officials decided that Weinman must be asked to modify his design for the half dollar—it was hoped that if Weinman shrank the figure of Liberty, and lowered the relief, the piece would prove coinable.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{introduced}} Arnold to Reuben Colburn, a boat builder from Gardinerstown, Maine, {{who was in}} Cambridge at the time. [...] Colburn {{offered his}} services, and Arnold requested detailed information about the route, including potential British naval threats, Indian sentiment, useful supply opportunities, and an estimate of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to construct bateaux sufficient for the contemplated force. [...] Colburn left for Maine on August21 to fulfill these requests. [...] Colburn asked Samuel Goodwin, the local surveyor in Gardinerston, to provide maps for Arnold.

500|$|He {{referenced}} {{the idea}} of a molecular assembler, a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a grey goo scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the modern fancy rat begins with the rat-catchers of the 18th and 19th centuries who trapped rats {{throughout}} Europe. These rat-catchers would then either kill the rats, or, more likely, sell the rats {{to be used in}} blood sport. Rat-baiting was a popular sport until the beginning of the 20th century. It involved filling a pit with several rats and then placing bets on how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a terrier to kill them all. It is believed that both rat-catchers and sportsmen began to keep certain, odd-colored rats {{during the height of the}} sport, eventually breeding them and then selling them as pets. The two men thought to have formed the basis of rat fancy are Jack Black, rat-catcher to Queen Victoria, and Jimmy Shaw, manager of one of the largest sporting public houses in London. These two men are responsible for beginning many of the color varieties present today. Black, specifically, was known for taming the [...] "prettier" [...] rats of unusual color, decorating them with ribbons, and selling them as pets.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Patton's Third Army {{was engaged}} in heavy {{fighting}} near Saarbrücken. Guessing {{the intent of the}} Allied command meeting, Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of the Third Army from its present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives {{in the area of the}} bulge occupied by German forces. At the Supreme Command conference, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by Patton, Bradley, General Jacob Devers, Major General Kenneth Strong, Deputy Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, and several staff officers. When Eisenhower asked Patton how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> him to disengage six divisions of his Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the U.S. 101st Airborne Division which had been trapped at Bastogne, Patton replied, [...] "As soon as you're through with me." [...] Patton then clarified that he had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on December 21, then only 48 hours away. Eisenhower was incredulous: [...] "Don't be fatuous, George. If you try to go that early you won't have all three divisions ready and you'll go piecemeal." [...] Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered Patton to attack the morning of December 22, using at least three divisions.|$|E

500|$|A {{histological}} {{study by}} Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, {{and others in}} 2009 estimated that Archaeopteryx grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of Archaeopteryx bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of Archaeopteryx come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of Archaeopteryx could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in Archaeopteryx. The poorly vascularized bone of Archaeopteryx might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> to [...] "grow" [...] each specimen of Archaeopteryx to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of [...] The {{study also found that}} the avialans Jeholornis and Sapeornis grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid Mahakala. The avialans Confuciusornis and Ichthyornis grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi, and the authors speculated that Archaeopteryx and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate.|$|E
