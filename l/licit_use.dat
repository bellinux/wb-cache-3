In Australia, steroids are increasingly used, licitly and illicitly, by a range of men and women. A new law targeting anabolic steroids, Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Assault and Intoxication) Act, was introduced in 2014, but only severely punishes illicit users. Given the increasing <b>licit</b> <b>use</b> of steroids in Australia, {{the severity of the}} punishment for illicit possession can only be explained by looking at the law as operating on the symbolic level, with steroids symbolising a deviant, violent masculinity. Ethnographic accounts of a range of illicit and licit steroid users show how people are differentially impacted by this new law. Beyond the law, biomedicine and gender are two other significant institutions shaping the experience of steroids in Australia. This research brings a range of steroid users into conversation with each other to unpack how institutions differentially shape the steroid experience depending upon who is using the drug and to what end.

40|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} are a {{heterogeneous}} group of xenobiotics or endobiotics that alter synaptic {{organization in the}} central nervous system in a transient or permanent basis, often leading to a compulsively use. What unites its members is that they confer pleasure (hedonism) to the abusers, namely by their action in the mesolimbic dopamine system. To exert its effects, different drugs of abuse will act on receptors and neurotransmitter transporters, modeling neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Besides acting on presynaptic neurons also function in neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels in postsynaptic neurons, thereby modifying the signaling pathways. In this work, the pharmacodynamic and the potential of some psychoactive substances that are typically subjected to abuse in Portugal, is reviewed. With this approach it was also possible a discussion of drugs of abuse that exhibit very different toxicological effects such as stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens.

40|$|The {{need for}} suppressing the illicit traffic in drags {{can hardly be}} over-emphasised. Yet, the <b>licit</b> <b>uses</b> of drugs, {{especially}} for medical and scientific need, cannot be suppressed. Apparently, {{it is a question}} of determining the world requirements of drugs for such legitimate uses, and of producing and manufacturing them accordingly. Owing to their multifarious medical uses in various parts of the world, it proves to be almost impossible to determine exactly the amount of drugs required for legitimate purposes. There is also the complicating factor that drugs are used for sociological and religious reasons, which have a long history. Not only are the <b>licit</b> <b>uses</b> and legitimate amounts of dro 4 a difficult to determine but also such difficulties give rise to illicit traffic in them. Yet, it is believed that a concerted international policy coupled with national co-operation, on various facets of the related problem, namely, limitation of production and/or manufacture of drugs, restriction on cultivation of plants that may contribute to addiction-producing substances, training and rehabilitation of drug addicts, and efficient national administration, would help eradicate drug-abuse. In search of an appropriate remedy, this thesis has been devoted to a practical study of the problem and to exploring in this area of international law the relationship between the political and economic interests and the international economic order. It has four Parts: Part I deals with the social and cultural aspects of drug-use and also details the historical origins of opium, which has a long association with drug-abuse.

40|$|Background: Alcohol use and {{illicit drug}} use peak during young {{adulthood}} (around 18 - 29 years of age), but comparatively {{little is known about}} polydrug use in nationally representative samples of young adults. Drawing on a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey), this study examines polydrug use patterns and associated psychosocial risk factors among young adults (n = 3, 333; age 19 - 29). Method: The use of a broad range of licit and illicit drugs were examined, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillizers/sleeping pills. Latent class analysis was employed to identify patterns of polydrug use. Results: Polydrug use in this sample was best described using a 5 -class solution. The majority of young adults predominantly used alcohol only (52. 3 %), alcohol and tobacco (34. 18 %). The other classes were cannabis, ecstasy, and <b>licit</b> drug <b>use</b> (9. 4 %), cannabis, amphetamine derivative, and <b>licit</b> drug <b>use</b> (2. 8 %), and sedative and alcohol use (1. 3 %).

40|$|Aims: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore how various aspects of {{everyday}} life, measured using self-reported experiences from childhood, adolescence and adulthood were associated with {{alcohol and drug use}} in a population-based sample of Swedish women. Methods: The thesis is based on data from the “Women and Alcohol in Gothenburg” project, a Swedish three-wave longitudinal, population-based, multi-purpose study. Three of the studies included women 20 and 25 years old when interviewed; and the sample sizes were 946 and 760, respectively. The fourth study included 851 women 20 - 55 years old. Studies I and II focused on the associations between the independent variables early risk indicators, socio-demographic factors, alcohol use, smoking, psychiatric illness and the dependent variables illicit and <b>licit</b> drug <b>use.</b> In Studies III and IV cluster analysis was used to identify clusters based on variables measuring patterns of drinking context and patterns of everyday occupations. The patterns of everyday occupations were defined as employment status, household work, leisure activities, time for free disposal and satisfaction with each domain. Drinking context was operationalised with questions on where and with whom the drinking occurred, together with questions on self-reported effects of drinking. Further, the associations between identified clusters and problematic alcohol consumption were analyzed. All four studies were based on cross-sectional analyses. Results: Significant associations regarding early risk indicators and drug use were found; to some extent these were different for occasional use and more frequent use. Early alcohol debut and behavioral factors were related to all three drug use patterns, whereas family factors were associated with occasional use and with more frequent use of illicit and <b>licit</b> drugs. Frequent <b>use</b> of both illicit and licit drugs was also associated with a history of eating problems. Problematic alcohol consumption, smoking and psychiatric illness were significantly associated with illicit and licit drug use; with the strongest associations found for illicit drug use among the 20 -year-old women. Cluster analysis identified distinct groups with respect to the investigated patterns. Concerning drinking context patterns, the cluster characterized with coping effects of drinking, frequent drinking in different settings but also solitary drinking, was significantly associated with alcohol use disorder and high alcohol consumption. High episodic drinking was more common in the cluster reporting frequent drinking together with social effects such as becoming less shy or having more fun. Problematic alcohol consumption was more common in clusters characterized with varied or low engagement in leisure activities in combination with a large amount of spare time. Conclusions: The strong associations between illicit and <b>licit</b> drug <b>use,</b> alcohol consumption, smoking, and psychiatric illness point to a higher risk for developing any or several of these problems once one of these habits has been established. The results also underline the importance of identifying groups of individuals with different drinking patterns and with different patterns of everyday occupations.

Knowledge {{about the}} roles that heavy alcohol and {{cigarette}} use play in patterns of concurrent substance use among adolescents is lacking despite studies showing that adolescent substance users are typically multisubstance users and that alcohol and cigarettes are commonly used heavily by those who use illicit substances. METHODS. The roles of increasing use and heavy first-time use of alcohol and cigarettes in multisubstance use patterns were examined in a cohort of 4192 secondary students who were surveyed three times over a 4 -year period. RESULTS. When subsequent use patterns were compared for students who increased their levels of alcohol or cigarette use and those who initiated use {{for the first time}} but at heavy frequencies, analyses indicated that the former group was more likely to initiate the subsequent use of other substances and to maintain and increase use already initiated. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that adolescents are likely to have been involved in a history of <b>licit</b> substance <b>use</b> characterized by increasing levels of use before progressing to and maintaining the use of other substances. Increasing frequencies of alcohol and cigarette use, therefore, may be markers for more serious patterns of substance use...|$|R
40|$|Background: Illicit {{drug use}} among gay men is common and is {{associated}} with behaviours that {{are at high risk}} for HIV transmission. Methods: We explored illicit drug use within an ongoing cohort study of gay men living with HIV in Sydney, Australia. Most (84. 3 %) of the 274 New South Wales participants interviewed in 2004 for the Positive Health Cohort of HIV-seropositive gay men had used illicit drugs in the 6 months before their baseline interview. Results: One in six men (17. 8 %) used `party drugs` at least monthly. At 12 months` follow-up, in 2005, these patterns of illicit drug use were similar. Being younger, participating in gay `party scenes` and engaging in `esoteric sex practices` at baseline were associated with any and more frequent use of party drugs, both in 2004 and 2005. 11 <b>licit</b> drug <b>use</b> was, however, not associated with condom use at the most recent sexual encounters. Discussion: Illicit drug use appears to be highly contextual among these gay men living with HIV, and the association with risk behaviour may reflect participation in sexually adventurous subcultures as much as a direct causal effect.

40|$|Aggression {{within the}} culinary {{industry}} has been an ongoing and under reported issue among professional chefs, not only in Australia but also internationally. Limited research {{suggests that there is}} high prevalence of aggression/bullying within the culinary industry, and that this may be a product of a unique combination of physical, psychological, and environmental demands embedded in a culture where such aggression is normalised. The current, survey-based, study aimed to assess whether chefs were indeed more aggressive than the general population, and if so, to examine the factors of perceived stress, rank within the kitchen hierarchy, gender, and <b>licit</b> substance <b>use</b> to identify where any differences may lie. Ninety-one Central Queensland based, Australian, chefs were recruited as participants in this study, consisting of 67 males and 24 females. Participants were asked to complete a self-report survey containing the Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire, a Workplace Stress Scale, and demographic questions pertaining to gender, rank, and alcohol and tobacco use. Results revealed that chefs were significantly more aggressive than a geographically similar general population. It was found that when looking at rank within the kitchen hierarchy, common chefs/line cook, particularly male chefs, were significantly more aggressive than other ranks within the kitchen. Conclusion and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Under the Controlled Substances Act, {{dihydromorphine}} {{is listed}} as a Schedule I substance along with heroin. [...] In the United States, {{its role in the}} production of dihydrocodeine and other related drugs make it a Schedule I substance with one of the higher annual manufacturing quotas granted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration—3300 kilos in 2013; manufacturers, distributors, and importers with the correct DEA license and state permits related thereto are able to use Schedule I drugs in this fashion when they are transformed into something of a lower schedule. The DEA has assigned dihydromorphine and all of its salts, esters, &c the ACSCN of 9145. As with nicomorphine, MDMA, heroin (DEA 2013 production quota: 25 grammes) and the like, dihydromorphine is also used in research such as that mentioned above in properly licensed facilities; Form 225, the most common and least expensive individual researcher's license, does not include Schedule I so the lab must have a higher-level DEA registration [...] As with other <b>licit</b> opioids <b>used</b> for medical purposes in other countries, including even much weaker opioids like nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, and tilidine, the reason for dihydromorphine being in Schedule I is that it was not in medical use in the USA at time the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 was drawn up.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has reported that}} across the nation 29 % of college students engage in cigarette smoking while {{four out of five}} students who have reported smoking in the past 30 days have also binge drank or used an illicit substance. In turn, 70 % of students who described using an illicit substance in the past month have smoked cigarettes as well. Because the number of college students abusing substances continues to increase, the prevalence of both cigarette and illicit substance use denotes a major health concern. Developed to explain the rate and onset of specific use patterns, the “gateway” hypothesis posits that individuals who <b>use</b> <b>licit</b> drugs (cigarettes or alcohol) are more likely to progress to illicit drug use later in life. While current smoking statusand the amount of cigarettes smoked per day have been predictive of the progression to illicit substances (i. e. marijuana, cocaine, crack, and heroin) across age strata, some inconsistencies exist maintaining cigarettes may not precede marijuana use. Further, {{research has}} reported that with earlier age of onset of <b>licit</b> drug <b>use,</b> individuals are the more likely to transition to illicit drug use although the differentiation between alcohol or cigarettes as well as the progression to specific illicit drugs has not been fully assessed. A distinct but not mutually exclusive body of literature has reported that individuals who experience trauma are two {{times more likely to have}} current alcohol dependence and eight times more likely to be drug dependent compared to those without trauma exposure. With the majority of studies suggesting substance use is associated with an attempt to alleviate symptoms of trauma, most research indicates trauma exposure precedes substance use. However, the onset pattern of substance use, particularly the “gateway” hypothesis, has yet to be explored in individuals with trauma exposure. The current study sought to assess the “gateway” hypothesis by examining the relationship between age of first cigarette and subsequent use of illicit substances in college. Additionally, a second aim of the current study was to explore the “gateway” hypothesis in individuals with previous trauma exposure. It was hypothesized that age of first cigarette would predict current use patterns of illicit substances among college students. Further, this hypothesis was explored in individuals who self-reported varying levels of early trauma exposure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a multi-centric {{investigation}} {{on the role of}} family relations, spirituality and entertainment in moderating the relationship between peer influence and drug <b>use</b> (<b>licit</b> and illicit) among students from eight universities from five countries in Latin-America and three from the Caribbean. The sample was composed by 2198 university students from faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities/Health Sciences. Drug use was the dependent variable and the level of peer influence (number of friends who use drugs) was the independent variable. The results showed that problematic family relationship, high number of party-based entertainment and high number of friends on drugs use (peer influence) increased the odds of youths using illicit drugs. The only interaction statistically significant for licit and illicit drug use was party-based entertainment and friends on drugs. The <b>use</b> of <b>licit</b> drugs presented large variability among universities in the sample, potentially influenced by cultural/religious aspects...|$|R
