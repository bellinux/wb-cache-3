25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Shure {{introduced}} the Vagabond 88 wireless microphone system. Operating within a copper wire circle either {{suspended from the}} ceiling or laid on the floor, the system could transmit within an area of approximately 700 square feet. The system consisted of a low-frequency FM radio transmitter and microphone, utilized five subminiature vacuum tubes, and was powered by two hearing aid batteries. The Vagabond system was expensive and somewhat fragile, but was adopted for use by several Las Vegas venues of the time. Not until 1990 did Shure re-enter the wireless microphone market {{with the introduction of}} the <b>L</b> <b>Series.</b>|$|E
25|$|Various engine {{configurations}} were available, initially {{ranging from}} the top of the line 103kW SOHC 6-cylinder turbo L20ET to the 4-cylinder Z18S and 6-cylinder LD28 diesel versions at the other end of the scale. The all-new 16-valve DOHC FJ20 engine debuted in late 1981, and was the first four-cylinder engine from any Japanese manufacturer to employ more than two valves per cylinder (see below). Some of the top spec models featured adjustable suspension dampers that could be adjusted while driving, this was another first for mass-produced JDM vehicles. Nissan Glorias and Laurels also used the <b>L</b> <b>series</b> engines, as well as some diesel (Laurel only) variants.|$|E

A domestic-market version of the LS 400 and LS 430, badged as Toyota Celsior (Japanese: トヨタ・セルシオ, Toyota Serushio), was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006. In 2006 (for the 2007 model year) the fourth-generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight-speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system. In 2007, V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h/LS 600h L sedans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Attempts {{have made}} to {{characterize}} the antioxidant potential of the early phase of bronchial asthma. An experimental model trying to mimic allergic bronchial asthma was immunologically induced with ovalbumin (OA) in guinea pigs which were then treated with a NO donor (ammonium salt of N- nitrosophenyl-N-hydroxilamine) at a concentration of 0, 1 mg/Kg (1 / 400 of DL 50) for 2 weeks. The animals were killed afterwards, for assessing the presence of cellular oxidative stress and free radicals (FR). The changes in the activity of superoxide-dismutase (SOD), glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malon-dialdehide (MDA), were followed in the heparinized blood of guinea pigs series (5 - 6 animals in <b>series)</b> : <b>L</b> 1 = nebulized with OA; L 2 = hypersensitized with OA; L 3 = hypersensitized with OA and treated intraperitoneal for 2 weeks with NO donor; L 4 = controls, healthy guinea pigs.

2500|$|In 1936–1939, Goddard {{began work}} on the K and <b>L</b> <b>series</b> rockets, which were much more massive and {{designed}} to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624lbs.in February 1936. [...] This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around {{the outside of the}} combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Returning to a smaller design, the L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7mi; 8,900ft), the highest of any of Goddard's rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.|$|E
