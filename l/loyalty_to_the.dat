5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government {{on the need to}} reform, they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience of the Church to government and tended to be influenced by Ultramontanism which emphasised <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Papacy over <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> civil powers.|$|E
5|$|Béla was {{the oldest}} son of King Andrew II of Hungary by his first wife, Gertrude of Merania. He {{was born in the}} second half of 1206.

50|$|As such, {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the above-mentioned factors and conditions, by 1941, the morale of the Indian Army troops was very low and this set up the stage for many soldiers <b>to</b> switch <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese in 1942.|$|R
50|$|During World War I, the Progressives {{strongly}} promoted Americanization programs, designed <b>to</b> modernize <b>the</b> {{recent immigrants}} {{and turn them}} into model American citizens, while diminishing <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old country. These programs often operated through the public school system, which expanded dramatically.|$|R
5|$|The {{politics}} {{within the}} poem emphasizes the problems within British politics and expresses Coleridge's views that the conservatives were warmongering {{and that there}} was corruption within the government. Although he feels this way, he still feels <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country and wants the British to be safe regardless of their problems.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons, rather than <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Union. One way that he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E
5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. Although the Drapier constantly asserts his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him {{in response to the}} third and fourth letters.|$|E
25|$|In August 1863, {{he sought}} {{a job in}} the paymaster's {{department}} in the United States Department of War, but his application caused federal agents to be suspicious about his family's <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Union. On November 17, 1863, he was dismissed as postmaster for disloyalty.|$|R
50|$|Ky Tung is a {{military}} history expert from Brazil, Earth. He commanded <b>the</b> Triumph prior <b>to</b> its capture during the Tau Verde war, by the Dendarii.

50|$|However, {{throughout}} the 1980s {{and until the}} Labour landslide victory of 1997, many voters in the area transferred their <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party.

5|$|As of March 2011, BS had yet {{to receive}} any attorney's fees from the tribe. On July 11, 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York ruled that BS was {{entitled}} to $5,174.54 in fees; the district court reduced the fees to that number after finding that BS had breached its duty of <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oneida's by also representing the Canadian claimants.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British.|$|E
5|$|During the 812–813 {{siege of}} Baghdad, Tahir had {{established}} {{close ties with}} the abnaʾ, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, and {{when he died in}} October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.|$|E

50|$|However, {{a portion}} of the Legitimists, still resentful of the revolutionary {{credentials}} of the House of Orléans, transferred their <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carlist heirs of the Spanish Bourbons, who represented the most senior branch of the Capetians even though they had renounced their claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French throne <b>to</b> obtain Spain in 1713.|$|R
50|$|In 1861 he {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky legislature, but was {{expelled}} by Judge Bland Ballard on December 21, 1861 for giving aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Confederate States of America.

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|Every {{city in the}} {{territory}} of modern Argentina other than Córdoba endorsed the Primera Junta. The cities of the Upper Peru, however, did not take a position, owing to the recent outcomes of the Chuquisaca and La Paz Revolutions. Asunción del Paraguay rejected the Junta and swore <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council of Regency. The Banda Oriental, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear unconditional <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King {{but with the}} crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general and his failure to understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the factors affecting joint venture employees 2 ̆ 7 <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor in <b>the</b> People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China. The trust framework and justice framework are employed to develop two competing models {{for studying the}} antecedents and consequences of <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor in <b>the</b> context of Chinese joint ventures. The direct effect model proposes {{that there is a}} direct effect of employees 2 ̆ 7 perception of interactional justice and of trust in supervisor on their <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor, while <b>the</b> mediation model considers trust in supervisor as a mediating variable between interactional justice and <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor. Additionally, <b>the</b> two models suggest that <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor affects <b>the</b> in-role job performance and organizational citizenship behaviour of workers. The results showed that the mediation model was better supported than the direct effect model. It has been found that trust in supervisor mediates the relationships between interactional justice and <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor. In addition, <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> supervisor has significant effects on both employees 2 ̆ 7 performance and organizational citizenship behaviour. Practically, the findings of the present study provide considerable implications for managing Chinese workers in joint ventures...|$|R
40|$|For historical, cultural, {{and ideological}} reasons, Chinese rulers have always placed great stress on unity and cohesiveness. A major {{concern of the}} Chinese {{authorities}} since 1949 has been <b>to</b> bind together <b>the</b> strands of regional interests and <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Communist Party (CCP) while, at the same time, allowing for {{a certain degree of}} local initiative and policy adaptation. ...|$|R
50|$|Payments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saffarids {{lasted until}} the mid-10th century at the latest. In 971 the Buyid amir 'Adud al-Daula, who had {{recently}} conquered the bordering province of Kerman from the Banu Ilyas, compelled <b>the</b> Ma'danids <b>to</b> recognize Buyid suzerainty. Soon after this, however, the Ma'danids switched their <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Turkish ruler of Ghazni, Sebük Tigin, beginning nearly a century of allegiance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ghaznavid dynasty.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{recording}} process, Duane {{was invited to}} join Eric Clapton and his new group Derek & the Dominos on {{the recording}} of their debut album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.

5|$|In 608, Heraclius the Elder renounced his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Phocas, who had overthrown Maurice {{six years}} earlier. The rebels issued coins showing both Heraclii dressed as consuls, though {{neither of them}} {{explicitly}} claimed the imperial title at this time. Heraclius's younger cousin Nicetas launched an overland invasion of Egypt; by 609, he had defeated Phocas's general Bonosus and secured the province. Meanwhile, the younger Heraclius sailed eastward with another force via Sicily and Cyprus.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{prolific}} writer, {{for twenty years}} {{was one of the}} foremost Catholic apologists in the United States. In this field he was orthodox, noted for his <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> magisterium of the Church and his agreement with the opinions of the most approved theologians. He wrote nothing that could be styled original; he simply aimed to explain and popularize the teaching of the doctors and saints of the Church.|$|R
50|$|No major battles were {{fought in}} or near the city, but the Mississippi River was a vital highway during <b>the</b> war. Divided <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Union and Confederacy caused rifts in some {{families}} in St. Louis. This divide remained consistent throughout the entirety of the war. Though many believed in the cause of abolition, others were concerned about the economic response and potential destruction of critical infrastructure in the blossoming city.|$|R
5|$|Little factual {{information}} survives about Vespasian's government during {{the ten years}} he was emperor, his reign {{is best known for}} financial reforms following the demise of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

For example, much money was spent on public works and the restoration and beautification of Rome: a new forum, the Temple of Peace, the public baths and the Colosseum.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{received}} a personal letter from General George Washington in 1777 appointing him a lieutenant colonel in {{a battalion of}} Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment {{under the command of}} Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston.

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War, Bagdad {{was but a}} {{recreational}} destination for the residents of Matamoros.

However, Bagdad continued on as a destination for recreation {{for the people of}} both cities.|$|R
25|$|The Ajuran State had a {{standing}} army {{with which the}} Garen imams and the governors ruled and protected their subjects. The bulk of the army consisted of mamluke soldiers, {{who did not have}} any <b>loyalties</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional Somali clan system, thereby making them more reliable. The soldiers were recruited from the inter-riverine area; other recruits came from the surrounding nomadic region. Arab, Persian and Turkish mercenaries were at times employed as well.|$|R
