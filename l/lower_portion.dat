5|$|As of 2003, {{there were}} 581 water rights {{recorded}} in the watershed, with 394 of them related to irrigation. Four hundred sixty-six water diversions were also recorded. In the summer, many streams are over-appropriated, leading to frequent water shortages along the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Low-level jet streams. When a nocturnal {{low-level}} jet forms overnight {{above the}} Earth's surface {{ahead of a}} cold front, significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the low level jet. This {{is also known as}} nonconvective wind shear since it is not due to nearby thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the trails}} in the {{watershed}} are biking and equestrian trails {{located in the}} <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the watershed, in the immensely popular Aliso Canyon and its tributary, Wood Canyon. Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail, the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek (Wood Canyon Creek). There is also a bikeway along Sulphur Creek and along parts of English Canyon.|$|E

5|$|Stela 3 {{is badly}} damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found {{somewhere on the}} San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
5|$|Failed {{oxygen and}} {{ethylene}} glycol pipes near the fire's origin point continued burning an intense secondary fire which melted through the cabin floor. By the time firefighters {{were able to}} open the hatch, the fire had extinguished itself. The back of Chaffee's couch {{was found in the}} horizontal position, with the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> angled towards the floor. His helmet was closed and locked, his restraints were undone, and the hoses and electrical connections to the suit remained connected. As he was farthest from the origin of the fire, he suffered the least burn and suit damage.|$|E

The <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E
5|$|Stela 12 {{is located}} near Structure11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into {{fragment}}s, of which two remain. The largest fragment {{is from the}} <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are {{the remains of a}} glyph that appears to be a number in the bar-and-dot format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{a broken}} {{monument}} that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper {{portion of the}} stela is missing but the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling {{the figure of a}} bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text {{on the back of the}} monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E

5|$|The American Revolutionary War {{broke out}} in April 1775. The city of New York was already an {{important}} center of business but had not yet become a sprawling metropolis. It occupied only the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the island of Manhattan and had a population of approximately 25,000. Before the war began, the Province of New York was politically divided, with active Patriot organizations and a colonial assembly that was strongly Loyalist. After the battles of Lexington and Concord, Patriots seized control {{of the city and}} began arresting and expelling Loyalists.|$|E
5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering {{a panoramic view of}} the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new residential building partially blocked the view from the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E
5|$|The {{brick wall}} around the {{platform}} is in a considerably preserved state as well, although parts of it have broken off. It is quite thickand was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides. There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings. Its <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design. Below the wall, {{the side of the}} upper platform itself is decorated with carvings, as is the side of the lower platform.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} the wall is vertical (perpendicular to the base) and the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the walls inclines outwards at the base and the upper parts are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E
5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} {{recovered}} from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the <b>lower</b> <b>portion</b> of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E

5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the <b>lower</b> <b>portion.</b> The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} cornices and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the back wall because restoration of the building only rebuilt the <b>lower</b> <b>portion.</b> It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
