25|$|The major {{modifications}} were to allow Admiral Gorshkov {{to operate as}} a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian service, {{as opposed to the}} STOVL configuration the ship was built as.

40|$|Background. Physical therapists' {{recommendations}} to patients to avoid daily physical activity can {{be influenced by}} the therapists' kinesiophobic beliefs. Little is known about the amount of influence of a physical therapist's kinesiophobic beliefs on a patient's actual <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> during a <b>lifting</b> test. Objective. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of physical therapists' kinesiophobic beliefs on <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> in healthy people. Design. A blinded, cluster-randomized cross-sectional study was performed. Methods. The participants (n = 256; 105 male, 151 female) were physical therapist students who performed a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> test. Examiners (n = 24) were selected from second-year physical therapist students. Participants in group A (n = 124) were tested in the presence of an examiner with high scores on the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia for health care providers (TSK-HC), and those in group B (n = 132) were tested in the presence of an examiner with low scores on the TSK-HC. Mixed-model analyses were performed on <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> to test for possible (interacting) effects. Results. Mean <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> was 32. 1 kg (SD = 13. 6) in group A and 39. 6 kg (SD = 16. 4) in group B. Mixed-model analyses revealed that after controlling for sex, body weight, self-efficacy, and the interaction between the examiners' and participants' kinesiophobic beliefs, the influence of examiners' kinesiophobic beliefs significantly reduced <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> by 14. 4 kg in participants with kinesiophobic beliefs and 8. 0 kg in those without kinesiophobic beliefs. Limitations. Generalizability to physical therapists and patients with pain should be studied. Conclusions. Physical therapists' kinesiophobic beliefs negatively influence <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of healthy adults. During everyday clinical practice, physical therapists should be aware of the influence of their kinesiophobic beliefs on patients' functional ability...|$|R
