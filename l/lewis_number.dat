40|$|A simple {{a priori}} {{model for the}} {{effective}} <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> in a premixed turbulent flame is presented. This a priori analysis is performed using data {{from a series of}} direct numerical simulations (DNS) of lean (φ = 0 : 4) premixed turbulent hydrogen flames, with Karlovitz number ranging from 10 to 1562. Those simulations were chosen such that the transition from the thin reaction zone to the broken reaction zone is captured. The conditional mean of various species mass fraction () vs temperature profiles are evaluated from the DNS and compared to equivalent unstretched laminar premixed flame profiles. The turbulent flame structure is found to be different from the laminar flame structure. However, the turbulent flame can still be mapped onto a laminar flame with an appropriate change in <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers.</b> Those effective <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> were obtained by minimizing the error between the DNS results and predictions from unstretched laminar premixed flames. A transition from “laminar” <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> to unity <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> as the Karlovitz number increases is clearly captured - equivalently, as the turbulent Reynolds number increases, given that the ratio of the integral length scale to the laminar flame thickness is fixed throughout the series of DNS. Those results suggest the importance of using effective <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> that are neither the “laminar” <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> nor unity in tabulated chemistry models without considering the impact of the turbulent Reynolds number or Karlovitz number.

For definiteness, the case of a strained reactive mixing layer is considered. The fuel and oxidizer that are fed to the mixing layer are allowed to have different initial temperatures.

A lean premixed flame kernel was taken for a number of studies, investigating the application of the FGM technique. To that end the laminar mass burning rate was assessed {{in the context of the}} influence of stretch. Also a theoretical stretch model was involved in this test.

40|$|Viewed on a {{hydrodynamic}} scale, flames {{in experiments}} are often thin {{so that they}} may be described as gasdynamic discontinuities separating the dense cold fresh mixture from the light hot burned products. The original model of a flame as a gasdynamic discontinuity was due to Darrieus and to Landau. In addition to the fluid dynamical equations, the model consists of a flame speed relation describing the evolution of the discontinuity surface, and jump conditions across the surface which relate the fluid variables on {{the two sides of the}} surface. The Darrieus-Landau model predicts, in contrast to observations, that a uniformly propagating planar flame is absolutely unstable and that the strength of the instability grows with increasing perturbation wavenumber so that there is no high-wavenumber cutoff of the instability. The model was modified by Markstein to exhibit a high-wavenumber cutoff if a phenomenological constant in the model has an appropriate sign. Both models are postulated, rather than derived from first principles, and both ignore the flame structure, which depends on chemical kinetics and transport processes within the flame. At present, there are two models which have been derived, rather than postulated, and which are valid in two non-overlapping regions of parameter space. Sivashinsky derived a generalization of the Darrieus-Landau model which is valid for <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> (ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity of the deficient reaction component) bounded away from unity. Matalon & Matkowsky derived a model valid for <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> close to unity. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. Under appropriate conditions the Matalon-Matkowsky model exhibits a high-wavenumber cutoff of the Darrieus-Landau instability. However, since the <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers</b> considered lie too close to unity, the Matalon-Matkowsky model does not capture the pulsating instability. The Sivashinsky model does capture the pulsating instability, but does not exhibit its high-wavenumber cutoff. In this paper, we derive a model consisting of a new flame speed relation and new jump conditions, which is valid for arbitrary <b>Lewis</b> <b>numbers.</b> It captures the pulsating instability and exhibits the high-wavenumber cutoff of all instabilities. The flame speed relation includes the effect of short wavelengths, not previously considered, which leads to stabilizing transverse surface diffusion terms...|$|R
