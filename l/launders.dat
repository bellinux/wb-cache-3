40|$|Money <b>laundering</b> {{has been}} studied for many years, but mainly by lawyers and criminologists. This {{dissertation}} presents {{a number of ways}} on how an economist – mainly in a multidisciplinary fashion – can contribute to this field of research. This dissertation answers four important questions about money laundering: Why should we fight money <b>laundering?</b> How is money <b>laundered?</b> In which sectors is money <b>laundered?</b> And how can we fight money <b>laundering?</b> The literature mentions 25 effects of money <b>laundering</b> that can hurt or enrich our society. This dissertation analyses one of these effects, of which the conclusion is that anti-money <b>laundering</b> policy can not only reduce the amount of money <b>laundering,</b> but also crime in general. There are multiple ways to <b>launder</b> money. This dissertation analyses the behavior of money launderers that use the relatively new method of trade-based money <b>laundering.</b> Trade-based money <b>laundering</b> is a specific type of money <b>laundering</b> where import and export prices are falsified. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} money <b>laundering</b> flows can be explained with a model based on the gravity equation of Isaac Newton. Trade-based money <b>laundering</b> flows increase when the mass (measured in GDP) of a country increases and when the distance between the countries decrease. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that money launderers that want to send their money to countries that fiercely fight money <b>laundering</b> in the financial sector, use trade-based money <b>laundering</b> as an alternative. With the potential size of money <b>laundering,</b> all this <b>laundered</b> money should appear in certain sectors in our economy. The real estate sector with its size and money <b>laundering</b> possibilities is one of the potential candidates. This dissertation analyses the real estate sector and concludes that money <b>laundering</b> happens significantly more often with real estate that has the following properties: price fluctuations, the involvement of just-established companies and foreign owners of real estate. At the moment there is international policy that basically forces countries to fight money <b>laundering.</b> This dissertation shows that countries can pretend to fight money <b>laundering,</b> without actually doing it, because the effectiveness of their policy is measured with statistics that are not uniformly collected and have vague definitions. Therefore countries are able to produce high statistics without exerting any additional effort. This dissertation suggest an alternative audit policy...|$|R

Sees money <b>laundering</b> and anti-money <b>laundering</b> as coupled activities, subsystems each of which stimulates the other to expand its own powers within its particular domain, so that the harder that anti-money <b>laundering</b> pushes, money <b>laundering</b> pushes back.

40|$|How should conspiracies {{to commit}} money <b>laundering</b> {{that rely on}} stale {{evidence}} be handled by the federal government? Marusarz argues that {{an amendment to the}} Money <b>Laundering</b> Control Act is needed to preserve a defendant’s interest in having a conspiracy prosecution based on evidence proving the existence of a money <b>laundering</b> conspiracy long after the actual conspiracy to <b>launder</b> money has ended. The Money <b>Laundering</b> Control Act is widely applicable and implies that prosecutors have an unlimited amount of time to bring an indictment for conspiracy to <b>launder</b> money due to the complexity of money <b>laundering</b> crimes. Marusarz proposes amendments to the Money <b>Laundering</b> Control Act that provide temporal limits on conspiracy charges brought under the Act.

40|$|Money <b>laundering</b> and {{especially}} its sub-division trade based money <b>laundering</b> {{have been identified}} as increasing threats to the international economy. Money <b>laundering</b> harms the entire global economy however the knowledge about the nature of money <b>laundering</b> and therefore the actions to prevent it is still at a low level. Trade based money <b>laundering</b> abuses the international trade system and the parties involved in it such as importers, exporters and financial institutions. In the money <b>laundering</b> process the banks {{can be used as a}} remittance system and thereby as means to make the illegal money deriving from a criminal act appear clean. Not only the trade finance products but also the other banking products are under the risk of being used in the money <b>laundering</b> process by the criminals. The research tries to find out what are the perceptions of people working closely with anti-money <b>laundering</b> on why, how and what –aspects of trade based money <b>laundering</b> and anti-money <b>laundering.</b> Moreover, the aim was to increase the awareness of trade based money <b>laundering</b> and fill the existing gap within the research on trade based money <b>laundering</b> and anti-money <b>laundering.</b> The research was conducted as interviews with four experts working either in trade finance, compliance, national crime investigation or banking supervision. The aim was to include views from different stages from the anti-money <b>laundering</b> chain.

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the independent variable}} Exposure, <b>laundering</b> had a different influence than light exposure on color compositions of mordanted and nonmordanted dyed specimens. For black walnut, mordanted and nonmordanted specimens were greener (a*) and bluer (b*) when subjected to <b>laundering</b> (Table  3). Mordanted specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted specimens but only before <b>laundering.</b> After <b>laundering,</b> b* value became similar for both mordanted and nonmordanted. For Osage orange, mordanted specimens were redder (a*) than nonmordanted before <b>laundering,</b> but a* of both became similar after <b>laundering.</b> Mordanted Osage orange was also yellower (b*) and nonmordanted Osage orange was bluer (b*) after <b>laundering.</b> For eastern redcedar, specimens turned lighter, redder, and bluer after <b>laundering</b> both for mordanted and nonmordanted. When visually inspecting the specimens, mordanted and <b>laundered</b> Osage orange was a brighter and clearer yellow when compared to nonmordanted.
