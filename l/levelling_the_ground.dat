The heavens are not yet drained over their sources, but the Mountains of the Moon still send their annual tribute to the Pasha without fail, as they did to the Pharaohs, though he must collect the rest of his revenue at the point of the sword. Rivers must have been the guides which conducted the footsteps of the first travellers. They are the constant lure, when they flow by our doors, to distant enterprise and adventure, and, by a natural impulse, the dwellers on their banks will at length accompany their currents to the lowlands of the globe, or explore at their invitation the interior of continents. They are the natural highways of all nations, not only <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and removing obstacles from the path of the traveller, quenching his thirst and bearing him on their bosoms, but conducting him through the most interesting scenery, the most populous portions of the globe, and where the animal and vegetable kingdoms attain their greatest perfection.|$|E
6000|$|... ยง VIII. Now, let {{the reader}} simply ask himself how, {{on such a}} surface, he would set about {{building}} a substantial wall, that {{should be able to}} bear weight and to stand for ages. He would assuredly look about for the largest stones he had at his disposal, and, rudely <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> he would lay these well together over a considerably larger width than he required the wall to be (suppose as at a, Fig. II.), in order to equalise the pressure of the wall over a large surface, and form its foot. On the top of these he would perhaps lay a second tier of large stones, b, or even the third, c, making the breadth somewhat less each time, so as to prepare for the pressure of the wall on the centre, and, naturally or necessarily, using somewhat smaller stones above than below (since we supposed him to look about for the largest first), and cutting them more neatly. His third tier, if not his second, will probably appear a sufficiently secure foundation for finer work; for if the earth yield at all, it will probably yield pretty equally under the great mass of masonry now knit together over it. So he will prepare for the wall itself at once by sloping off the next tier of stones to the right diameter, as at d. If there be any joints in this tier within the wall, he may perhaps, for further security, lay a binding stone across them, e, and then begin the work of the wall veil itself, whether in bricks or stones.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has been}} written [...] "the coup d'oeil of the {{castellated}} Palace of Boondi, from whichever side you approach it, {{is perhaps the most}} striking in India. Whoever has seen the Palace of Boondi can easily picture to himself the hanging gardens of Semiramis." [...] This is true--and more too. To give on paper any adequate idea of the Boondi-ki-Mahal is impossible. Jeypore Palace may be called the Versailles of India; Udaipur's House of State is dwarfed by the hills round it and the spread of the Pichola Lake; Jodhpur's House of Strife, grey towers on red rock, is the work of giants, but the Palace of Boondi, even in broad daylight, is such a Palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreams--the work of goblins more than of men. It is built {{into and out of the}} hillside, in gigantic terrace on terrace, and dominates the whole of the city. But a detailed description of it were useless. Owing to the dip of the valley in which the city stands, it can only be well seen from one place, the main road of the city; and from that point looks like an avalanche of masonry ready to rush down and block the gorge. Like all the other Palaces of Rajputana, it is the work of many hands, and the present Raja has thrown out a bastion of no small size on one of the lower levels, which has been four or five years in the building. No one knows where the hill begins and where the Palace ends. Men say that there are subterranean chambers leading into the heart of the hills, and passages communicating with the extreme limits of Taragarh, the giant fortress that crowns the hill and flanks the whole of the valley on the Palace side. They say that there is as much room under as above ground, and that none have traversed the whole extent of the Palace. Looking at it from below, the Englishman could readily believe that nothing was impossible for those who had built it. The dominant impression was of height--height that heaved itself out of the hillside and weighed upon the eyelids of the beholder. The steep slope of the land had helped the builders in securing this effect. From the main road of the city a steep stone-paved ascent led to the first gate--name not communicated by the zealous following. Two gaudily painted fishes faced each other over the arch, and there was little except glaring colour ornamentation visible. This gate gave into what they called the chowk of the Palace, and one had need to look twice ere realising that this open space, crammed with human life, was a spur of the hill on which the Palace stood, paved and built over. There had been little attempt at <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> The foot-worn stones followed the contours of the ground, and ran up to the walls of the Palace smooth as glass. Immediately facing the Gate of the Fish was the Quarter-Guard barracks, a dark and dirty room, and here, in a chamber hollowed out in a wall, were stored the big drums of State, the nakarras. The appearance of the Englishman seemed to be the signal for smiting the biggest of all, and the dull thunder rolled up the Palace chowk, and came back from the unpierced Palace walls in hollow groaning. It was an eerie welcome--this single, sullen boom. In this enclosure, four hundred years ago, if the legend be true, a son of the great Rao Bando, who dreamed a dream as Pharaoh did and saved Boondi from famine, left a little band of Haras to wait his bidding while he went up into the Palace and slew his two uncles who had usurped the throne and abandoned the faith of their fathers. When he had pierced one and hacked the other, as they sat alone and unattended, he called out to his followers, who made a slaughter-house of the enclosure and cut up the usurpers' adherents. At the best of times men slip on these smooth stones; and when the place was swimming in blood, foothold must have been treacherous indeed.|$|E

After further employment on other defence works, in April 1868 he was appointed secretary of Sir Frederick Grey's committee to report on the fortifications under construction, and in September 1869 he accompanied Sir William Jervois on a tour of inspection of the defence works at Halifax and Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|At the 1938 Annual General Meeting, the Southern Railway stated that, {{in their}} opinion, {{the cost of}} <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and {{providing}} the necessary infrastructure associated with an airport, {{was something that was}} beyond a private company. They were of the opinion that it should be met partly by the state and partly by the County Council. It was stated that there would not be sufficient return on expenditure under the conditions then current to justify the expenditure necessary to construct the airport. The Southern Railway's option to purchase the land had expired by February 1939. It was reported that negotiations between the landowners and the Air Ministry were ongoing at that time. It was reported at that time that completion was then three years off.|$|E
5000|$|Baptism had {{a history}} in Abercarn that dated back to 1750 when a local ironmaster, John Griffiths, converted. Regular {{meetings}} began in 1808 in various places and the congregation was formally established in 1847. Construction of the church began in 1856 to a design by Ebenezer Rogers and it was completed the following year for a cost of almost ยฃ1,000. Initially there was no pastor, but only Revivalist preaching until 1862. A daughter chapel was built in 1873 that had Welsh-language services, while the original church used English and {{was known as the}} Lower Baptist Chapel Abercarn. The chapel's pastor, Rev. Probert, led the local response to the Abercarn colliery disaster in 1878. The chapel was extensively remodelled beginning in 1882 that included <b>levelling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor, the insertion of galleries, a new pulpit and seating and the addition of a harmonium. A new external vestibule was also added; the total cost coming to ยฃ1,050. The addition of a pipe organ in 1917 by J.J. Binns required further modifications {{to the front of the}} building. The chapel was Grade II-listed on 17 December 1998 [...] "as a prominent mid C.19 chapel with later C.19 remodelling retaining almost all its historic fabric.
