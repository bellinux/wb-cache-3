40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} content-aware image {{resizing}} method which simultaneously preserves both salient image features and important <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties: parallelism, collinearity and orientation. When there are prominent <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> in the image, image resizing methods without explicitly taking these properties into account could produce <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> distortions in their results. Since the human visual system is {{very sensitive to}} <b>line</b> <b>structures,</b> such distortions often become noticeable and disturbing. Our method couples mesh deformations for image resizing with similarity transforms for line features. Mesh deformations are used to control content preservation while similarity transforms are analyzed in the Hough space to maintain <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties. Our method strikes a good balance between preserving content and maintaining <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> properties. Experiments show the proposed method often outperforms methods without taking <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> into account, especially for scenes with prominent <b>line</b> <b>structures.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{large-scale}} indoor model test with water pressure is conducted {{in order to}} investigate the stress and deformation properties of reinforced concrete <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> with circular cross-sections. After <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> cracks, the stress and deformation of reinforcement in <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> tend to decrease. Although the interaction force between <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> and surrounding rock increases {{with the increase of}} water pressure, but the ratio of interaction force and water pressure decreases, which reveals that the load-bearing capacity of <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> decreases, and surrounding rock gradually performs as the primary load-bearing body. The internal water pressure carried by <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is about 20 %~ 40 % of water pressure before cracking and less than 30 % after cracking. Test results illustrate that surrounding rock and inner water seepage significantly influence the stress and deformation properties of <b>lining</b> <b>structure,</b> and inner water seepage is the main reason for the reduction of load-bearing capacity of <b>lining</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

Tłumaczenie z jęz. niemieckiego mgr Arkadiusz NiewiadomskiNa podstawie badań przeprowadzonych w środkowej Hesji Autor dokonał podziału typologicznego linearnych struktur trawiasto-zielnych, przedstawił charakterystykę ekologiczną miedzy typowej i miedzy podlegającej sukcesji oraz wykazał związki między liczebnością gatunków roślin a intensywnością zagospodarowania powierzchni sąsiadujących z różnymi formami miedz. Praktycznym aspektem przeprowadzonych badań jest określenie minimalnej szerokości miedzy, przy której występuje jeszcze znacząca liczba gatunków roślin. Grass and herbal {{dominated}} small <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> possess high {{significance for}} the conservation of species and biotopes in the actual cultural landscape of Germany. This paper categorizes and specifies herbal ridges, central stripes of lanes and pasture fences. These biotope-types are then differentiated to herbaceous seams. The floristic and vegetational composition of herbal <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> elements is analysed at four different levels, which are: species inventory, floristic types, phytocoenoses and nano vegetation complexes. Each level is characterized by its species and biotope conservation value. While floristic types are useful for ecohabitat aspects and species conservation, nano vegetation complexes are advised for work on large areas. The ecological significance of a herb-dominated small line biotope depends decisively on the production intensity of the land use above it (uplier), its cultivation state and its breadth. <b>Line</b> <b>structures</b> serve as refugial habitats. Starting from here the recolonization of adjacent grasslands and arable ground takes place. In order to perform this function in the future, preservation of these <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> is needed. An extensivation in agriculture over large areas will secure these efforts. Biotope-binding measures without large area extensivation of agriculture will only delay the destruction of the line biotopes left. Care should be spent on the methods used to maintain <b>line</b> <b>structures,</b> especially whether they are realistic. The effective shelter of herb-dominated small <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> is difficult because information on their composition lacks. Agriculture {{plays an important role in}} the management of these structures. Central demandments to an effective conservation of herb-dominated small <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> are: Reduction of nutrient flow into these structures (reduction of production intensity on 6 kologische Bedeutung und Naturschutzpotential [...] . 111 adjacent fields, buffer strips), guarantee of <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> management and keeping a minimum breadth of <b>line</b> <b>structures</b> (depending on the nature area between 2. 5 and 3 m). The joining of Poland to the European Union causes several problems to agriculture and biodiversity. There will be exist less linear structures after this change. There are two steps to conserve linear biotopes; fIrst to investigate the status quo of biodiversity and second to initiate conservation of linear structures...|$|R

In order to describe strain rate dependence and fatigue damage of concrete material under cyclic loading, a dynamic constitutive model for concrete lining considering tension and shear anisotropic damage is presented, {{and the evolution}} equations of damage variables are derived. The proposed model is of simple form and can be programmed into finite element procedure easily. In order to describe seismic interaction characteristics of the surrounding rock and lining, an explicit dynamic contact analysis method considering bond and damage characteristics of contact face between the surrounding rock and lining is proposed, and this method can integrate directly without iteration. The proposed method is applied to seismic stability calculation of Yingxiuwan Underground Powerhouse, results reveal that the amplitude and duration of input seismic wave determine the damage degree of <b>lining</b> <b>structure,</b> the damage zone of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is mainly distributed in its arch, and the contact face damage has great influence on {{the stability of the}} <b>lining</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Palmprint {{is a new}} {{biometric}} method to recognize a person. The features in a palmprint include principal lines, wrinkles and ridges, etc. <b>Line</b> <b>structure</b> feature, which includes principal lines and wrinkles, {{is one of the}} most popular methods in palmprint recognition. However, the <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> feature does not contain the thickness and width information of principal lines and wrinkles, which are very important to discriminate palmprints. Ridges are not included in <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> feature either. So these methods cannot distinguish different palmprints with similar <b>line</b> <b>structure.</b> Furthermore, the <b>line</b> extraction is a difficult task. The fact that principal lines, wrinkles and ridges have different resolutions motivates us to analyze the palmprint using multi-resolution analysis method. A novel palmprint feature, named wavelet energy features, is defined employing wavelet, which is a powerful tool of multi-resolution analysis, in this paper. WEF can reflect the wavelet energy distribution of the principal lines, wrinkles and ridges in several directions at different wavelet decomposition level (scale), so its ability to discriminate palms is very strong. Easiness to compute is another virtue of WEF. The very high recognition rates obtained in experiments shows the effect of the proposed method.

Driven by the requirements of earthquake resistance, line profile modifications, and corrosion resistance, double-layer lining has been adopted. It was applied early in Japan in high-speed railway tunnels, urban arterial road tunnels, metro tunnels, and water transfer tunnels [24]. Double-layer lining will soon be used in China because the diameter and buried depth of underwater highway tunnels continue to increase. Consequently, determining when to choose double-layer lining and the forces between the assembled lining and inner lining must be carefully studied. A new kind of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> between the single lining and double-layer lining is proposed {{to deal with the}} riverbed scouring problem posed by river-crossing highway shield tunnels in the Yangzi River region, which has high water pressure and permeable stratum [46].
