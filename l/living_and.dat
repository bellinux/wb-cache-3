5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, {{which has}} resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, <b>living</b> <b>and</b> extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering <b>living</b> <b>and</b> extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved.

Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of <b>living</b> <b>and</b> planning urban sites.

40|$|Background: Household living arrangement, {{whether an}} {{individual}} lives alone, with family, or with unrelated persons, may predict {{quality of life}} in adults with mental illness, as it influences social interactions and availability of immediate resources. Objective: To assess the relationship between <b>living</b> arrangement <b>and</b> {{quality of life in}} adults with mental illness. Design: Secondary analysis of 294 community-dwelling adults with mental illness. Linear regression was used to estimate the association between <b>living</b> arrangement <b>and</b> quality of life. Results: Initially, linear regression analysis did not suggest a strong association between quality of life <b>and</b> <b>living</b> arrangement; however, further analysis suggested that social support mediates the relationship between <b>living</b> arrangement <b>and</b> quality of life in adults with mental illness. Conclusion: Future research should address the limitations of the current study to advance the understanding of the association between <b>living</b> arrangement <b>and</b> quality of life in this population...|$|R
