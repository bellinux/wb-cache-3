6000|$|Q. Did you--However, we {{can never}} get this matter straight. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>about</b> {{something}} else. What was the date of your birth? ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{must have}} been at Marseilles, I think, that I wrote you before; {{so that there is}} an hiatus in my {{biography}} to fill up. I went from Marseilles to Nice, which I found more than usually detestable, and pervaded, to an intolerable pitch, with a bad French carnival, which set me on the road again till I reached San Remo, which you may know, and which if you don't you ought to. I spent more than a fortnight there, among the olives and the oranges, between a big yellow sun and a bright blue sea. The walks and drives are lovely, {{and in the course of}} one of them (a drive) I called upon our friends the George Howards, who have been wintering at Bordighera, a few miles away. But he was away in England getting himself elected to Parliament (you may have heard that he has just been returned for East Cumberland,) and she was away with him, helping him. The idea of leaving the oranges and olives for that! I saw, however, a most delightful little maid, their eldest daughter, of about 15, who had a mixture of shyness and frankness, the softness of the papa and the decision of the mother, with which I quite fell in love. I didn't fall in love with Mrs. William Morris, the strange, pale, livid, gaunt, silent, and yet in a manner graceful and picturesque, wife of the poet and paper-maker, who is spending the winter with the Howards; though doubtless she too has her merits. She has, for instance, wonderful aesthetic hair. From San Remo I came along the rest of the coast to Genoa, not by carriage however, as I might have done, for I was rather afraid of three days [...] "on end" [...] of my own society: that is, not on end, but sitting down. When I am tired of myself in common situations I can get up and walk away; so, in a word, I came in the train, and the train came in a tunnel--for it was almost all one--for five or six hours. I have been going to Venice--but it is so cold and blustering that I think to-morrow, when I depart from this place, the idea of reaching the southernmost point will get the better of me, and I shall make straight for Rome. I will write you from there--where I first beheld you: that is, familiarity (if I may be allowed the expression). Enough meanwhile about myself, my intentions and delays: let me hear, or at least <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>about</b> your own circumstances and propensities.... You must have felt spattered, like all the world, with the blood of the poor Russian Czar! Aren't you glad you are not an Empress? But you are. God save your Majesty!--Mrs. Greville sent me Swinburne's complicated dirge upon her poor simple mother, and I thought it wanting in all the qualities that one liked in Mrs T. I should like very much to send a tender message to Mrs Gordon: indefinite--but very tender! To you I am both tender and definite (save when I cross).|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] I {{said after}} a pause, [...] "that momentous things have {{happened}} since my time. I wish you would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>about</b> it all systematically, and would {{explain it to me}} bit by bit. First, {{what do you mean by}} saying that there is no work?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In one storyline dates Zach Armstrong's (Stephen Phillips) father Paul Armstrong (Geoff Morrell) {{even though}} she is {{attracted}} to Zach. Gay told Clare Rigden from TV Week that Frances spends time with Zach in a dark setting while they drink wine. In the scenes Frances is having [...] "conflicting impulses" [...] in which she thinks [...] "Hey, let's be intimate...but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you questions <b>about</b> your father." [...] Gay told Yahoo!7's writer that Paul [...] "treats Frances like a lady and I think that's quite a new sensation for her". She finds being taken out [...] "by a man of the world quite beguiling" [...] because she is used to being in control. Frances is [...] "innocent in the face of his worldliness".|$|R
60|$|I {{had half}} {{a mind to}} ask him point blank whether he, at least, didn't know why Falk, a {{notoriously}} unsociable man, had taken to visiting his ship with such assiduity. After all, I reflected suddenly, it was a most remarkable thing. I wonder now what Hermann would have said. As {{it turned out he}} didn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask.</b> Forgetting all <b>about</b> Falk apparently, he started a monologue on his plans for the future: the selling of the ship, the going home; and falling into a reflective and calculating mood he mumbled between regular jets of smoke about the expense. The necessity of disbursing passage money for all his tribe seemed to disturb him in a manner that was the more striking because otherwise he gave no signs of a miserly disposition. And yet he fussed over the prospect of that voyage home in a mail boat like a sedentary grocer who has made up his mind to see the world. He was racially thrifty I suppose, and for him {{there must have been a}} great novelty in finding himself obliged to pay for travelling--for sea travelling which was the normal state of life for the family--from the very cradle for most of them. I could see he grudged prospectively every single shilling which must be spent so absurdly. It was rather funny. He would become doleful over it, and then again, with a fretful sigh, he would suppose there was nothing for it now but to take three second-class tickets--and there were the four children to pay for besides. A lot of money that to spend at once. A big lot of money.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you a question...: {{the first}} time you fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you another question: how do you think she got that way? ...|$|R
60|$|And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> your {{attention}} {{to two or three}} closing remarks.|$|R
6000|$|Sir John. These are rogues, sir, I plainly {{perceive}} it; pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> him one question--Which way did {{you come}} home, sir? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Amy! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you,' said Laura, {{a little}} entreatingly, yet {{as if she}} must needs put the question--'surely, you never thought Guy had faults?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, boy, {{you found}} words to make {{yourself}} very plainly comprehended. But, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?" ...|$|R
60|$|If {{any such}} shall {{chance to see}} these words, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> them to {{consider}} with me that one word Hero, and what it means.|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
