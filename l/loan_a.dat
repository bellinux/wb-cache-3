5|$|An 86th-minute {{equaliser}} from McBreen gave York a 1–1 draw {{at home to}} Salisbury City, which {{maintained the}} team's unbeaten record at Bootham Crescent. Parslow signed a new contract with the club, and Rotherham midfielder Peter Holmes joined on a one-month <b>loan.</b> <b>A</b> second defeat of the season came after losing 2–0 away to Kidderminster, Brian Smikle and Justin Richards scoring for the home team. Beadle was released by the club {{towards the end of}} his loan spell at Whitby, due to him looking for regular first-team football. This was followed by the departure of Bore, who returned to Grimsby from his loan spell early. A 3–3 draw away against Stevenage was achieved after the team were 2–0 down after 19 minutes, with the York goals coming from Sodje, Holmes and Farrell. Sodje picked up a hamstring injury during this match, meaning he would be out of action for four to six weeks.|$|E

Rangers manager Ian Holloway, {{who had received}} promising reports about Miller from scouts, was sufficiently impressed to sign the player after watching him in person. Although the exact amount was undisclosed, the transfer fee was the highest ever received by Aldershot Town. Miller made his Football League debut on 4 December 2004 in a 2–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest, and played {{in more than half}} of the team's remaining league matches that season. By late September 2005, he had made just one league appearances since the start of the season, and was sent to Peterborough United on what was originally intended to be a three-month <b>loan.</b> <b>A</b> month later he was recalled to Loftus Road, but he was not to feature again in the Rangers team.

A firefight ensued in which the target was killed, but at the loss of a LRR operator who got shot in the neck.
