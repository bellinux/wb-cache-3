The underlying framework is the DAT Network, the first electronic freight posting service, acquired in 2001 from the Jubitz Corporation. DAT Solutions began as Dial-A-Truck, a <b>load</b> <b>board</b> operated at the Jubitz Truck Stop in Portland, Oregon. It evolved {{to become the}} original and largest internet <b>load</b> <b>board,</b> a matchmaking service for 100 million freight loads and trucks per year. DAT Solutions offers several <b>load</b> <b>board</b> products including: DAT Power, DAT Express and TruckersEdge. Other products, such as DAT RateView, DAT CarrierWatch, and DAT Keypoint are industry-leading offerings that help transportation professionals create greater efficiencies in their business.|$|E

50|$|The wire chute {{was a big}} {{improvement}} over the gravity chutes. They could load an entire sling of lumber at one time while the apron chutes could only <b>load</b> <b>board</b> by board. The wires {{could be used to}} discharge, and load, cargo. Chutes were a West Coast innovation because of the high cliffs along the coast and the lack of harbors. Where prevailing weather conditions permitted, shippers built wharves allowing the ships to come alongside and load directly from the dock. The wire chutes permitted ships with deeper drafts to load since they did not need to approach so close to shore. The wires continued in use until after World War I and were discontinued by the start of World War II.|$|E
50|$|Most {{long-haul}} tractors have sleeping berths, {{and many}} truck drivers keep their diesel engines running for heating or cooling {{for the sake}} of comfort. Because idling diesel engines make considerable noise (and are a source of pollution) they are often banned from such use near residential areas. Truck stops (along with public rest stops) are the main places where truck drivers may rest peacefully, as required by regulations. Modern innovations, such as truck heaters and auxiliary power units, are becoming more common, and some truck stops now provide power, air conditioning, and communications through systems such as IdleAir. Many truck stops have <b>load</b> <b>board</b> monitors for truck drivers to find real time information on loads, jobs, weather and news. Most chain truck stops also have WLAN Internet access in their parking areas. Idle reduction — reducing the amount of fuel consumed by truck fleets during idling — is an ongoing economical and environmental effort.|$|E

These factors help keep the freight rate down for small businesses and the individual with a shipping need. In the commercial trucking industry, many shippers tender loads to freight brokers {{whose job it is to}} find qualified carriers to move the freight at an acceptable price for all parties. Brokers have access to a suite of technological tools to help determine the most cost-effective way to move cargo, including access to <b>load</b> <b>boards.</b> The best <b>load</b> <b>boards</b> provide rate analysis tools based on actual transactions on every lane in North America, since their databases hold a wealth of pricing information. For example, DAT Solutions offers RateView for carriers, brokers and shippers, providing access to shippers’ contract rates and spot market (broker buy) rates. This allows brokers to analyze market demand and capacity to assure competitive pricing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{presence}} of digital drivers in a mixed-signal circuit {{such as an}} A/D converter causes simultaneous switching noise or ground bounce noise on the <b>load</b> <b>board.</b> Coupling of this noise to the sensitive analog lines causes inaccuracy in the measurement of A/D converter linearity specifications. Unlike, the other sources of noise, the ground bounce noise is not a Gaussian distributed random noise. Rather, {{it depends on the}} drivers that switch their logic state during a code transition. In this paper, a methodology to reduce the inaccuracy in the measurement of linearity specifications of an A/D converter in the {{presence of}} ground bounce noise is presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{asynchronous}} {{timing and}} arbitration asyn-chronous designs may behave nondeterministically. For {{the test of}} such systems, this means that an exact timing, i. e. a tester cycle, of a test response cannot be guaranteed. This behav-ior makes functional tests of asynchronous designs relatively complex or even impossible. Therefore, this paper presents a concept for structurally and functionally test asynchronous designs using a test processor infrastructure. To this end, we propose a low-cost 16 -bit microprocessor solution with special support of asynchronous handshake signalling that can either {{be integrated into the}} device-under-test (DUT), mounted on the <b>load</b> <b>board</b> of the tester or a combination of both.

40|$|An {{integrated}} off-chip I DDQ {{measuring unit}} (IOCIMU) {{is described in}} this paper. The semi-digital current monitor is designed for the use with standard automatic test equipment (ATE). Simulations of the monolithic monitor implemented in a 2 -m BiCMOS technology show an accuracy better than 1 % for currents {{in the range from}} 0 to 1 mA and a test rate up to 10 kHz. Introduction The effectiveness of the I DDQ tests depends mostly on the test rate and accuracy of the current measurement. Off-chip monitors offer more versatility and they are preferably used in combination with ATE. The development of I DDQ monitors has attracted serious attention from industry as well as academia since ITC 93 '.

40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{levels of}} {{integration}} and high speeds of operation {{have made the}} problem of testing complex systems-on-packages very difficult. Testing packages with multi-gigahertz RF and optical components is even more difficult as external tester costs tend to escalate rapidly beyond 3 GHz. The {{extent of the problem}} can be gauged by the fact that test cost is approaching almost 40 % of the total manufacturing cost of these packages. To alleviate test costs, various solutions relying on built-off test (BOT) and built-in test (BIT) of embedded high-speed components of SOPs have been developed. These migrate some of the external tester functions to the tester <b>load</b> <b>board</b> (BOT) and to the package and the die encapsulated in the package (BIT) in an “intelligent ” manner. This paper provides a discussion of the emerging BOT and BIT schemes for embedded high-speed RF/analog/mixed-signal circuits in SOPs. The pros and cons of each scheme are discussed and preliminary available data on case studies are presented.

40|$|Abstract — Production test {{costs for}} today's RF and {{high-speed}} analog circuits are rapidly escalating. Two factors {{are responsible for}} this cost escalation: (a) {{the high cost of}} high-speed ATEs and (b) long test times required by elaborate performance tests. In this paper, we propose a low-cost signature test methodology for accelerated production testing of analog and RF circuits. As opposed to prior work, the proposed algorithm directly tracks the ability to predict the test specification values from the observed test response in the presence of measurement noise. The test methodology is applied to low cost signature test of RF circuits using modulation of a baseband test stimulus and demodulation of the obtained response. The demodulated response of the DUT is used as a "signature " from which all the performance specifications are predicted. The applied test signal is optimized {{in such a way that}} the error between the measured DUT performances and the predicted DUT performances is minimized. The proposed low-cost solution can be easily built into a <b>load</b> <b>board</b> that can be interfaced to an inexpensive tester.

40|$|With {{increase}} in frequency and convergence toward mixed signal systems, supplying stable voltages to integrated circuits and blocking noise coupling in the systems are major problems. Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures {{have been in}} the limelight for power/ground noise isolation in mixed signal applications due to their capability to suppress unwanted electromagnetic mode transmission in certain frequency bands. The EBG structures have proven effective in isolating the power/ground noise in systems that use a common power supply. However, while the EBG structures have the potential to present many advantages in noise suppression applications, there is no method in the prior art that enables reliable and efficient synthesis of these EBG structures. Therefore, in this research, a novel EBG synthesis method for mixed signal applications is presented. For one-dimensional periodic structures, three new approaches such as current path approximation method, border to border radius, power loss method have been introduced and combined for synthesis. For two-dimensional EBG structures, a novel EBG synthesis method using genetic algorithm (GA) has been presented. In this method, genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized as a solution-searching technique. Synthesis procedure has been automated by combining GA with multilayer finite-difference method and dispersion diagram analysis method. As a real application for EBG structures, EBG structures have been applied to a GHz ADC <b>load</b> <b>board</b> design for power/ground noise suppression. Ph. D.

40|$|How an owner-operator {{chooses a}} {{specific}} load {{is a relatively}} unstudied field in transportation literature. Stakeholders in the decisions, such as freight brokers, stand to benefit from {{a better understanding of}} the selection process. Using <b>load</b> <b>board</b> data from a freight brokerage, we identified four parameters available to a carrier when a load is presented: length of haul, revenue per mile (RPM), the probability of finding an onward load from the destination, and the required mileage to reposition to the shipment origin. We also identified preferences of the owner-operators based on experience, literature, and the data, such as owner-operators' preference for long haul routes. We tested selection strategies that disintegrated the four load parameters and incorporated owner-operator preferences in a computerized simulation. We found that strategies combining two or more of the identified parameters provide better results in terms of revenue and utilization (% loaded) maximization. Furthermore, we found that including consideration of the empty repositioning distance was critical to success. Our simulated carriers outperformed peers in the dataset by up to 16 %. Carriers can apply these insights to improve their operating strategies. Freight brokerages can apply the quantitative approach to advise their carrier clients and optimize the matching of freight with available carrier capacity. by Paul Jeffrey R. Leopando and Kyle A. C.
