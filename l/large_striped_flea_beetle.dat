Appearance and Biology <b>Flea</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are small oval-shaped beetles (2 - 3 mm) with enlarged hind femurs. The common name reflects their habit of jumping or hopping when disturbed. There are three main species that attack canola in western Canada 1, 2. A European introduction, the crucifer <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Phyllotreta cruciferae (Goeze) was first found in North America in British Columbia in 19213, 4. The beetles are black with a bluish sheen (Figure 1 a) and are the most common species in central and southern regions of canola production. The <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta striolata (Fab.), was introduced to North America from Eurasia at a very early date.

50|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> overwinter among {{debris in}} and around fields. Emerging early in spring, they attack {{seedlings}} and young plants. Eggs are deposited in tiny crevices gnawed out of the base of host plant stems. About ten days later, the grubs hatch from the eggs and move into the soil to attack roots. After feeding {{for three or four}} weeks, the larvae pupate for seven to ten days. A new generation of beetles then emerges. Generations can be continual in warmer climates, recurring at least twice a year.|$|R
40|$|The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae MA 05 - 169 is a {{transformant}} {{strain that}} has been metabolically engineered to express dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin biosynthesis genes. In contrast to the wild type strain, the transformant displays a greater resistance to environmental stress and a higher virulence toward target insect host. However, the underlying mechanisms for these characteristics remain unclear; hence experiments were initiated to explore the possible mechanism(s) through physiological and molecular approaches. Although both transformant and wild type strains could infect and share the same insect host range, the former germinated faster and produced more appressoria than the latter, both in vivo and in vitro. The transformant showed a significantly shorter median lethal time (LT 50) when infecting the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and the <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (Phyllotreta striolata), than the wild type. Additionally, the transformant was more tolerant to reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced 40 -fold more orthosporin and notably overexpressed the transcripts of the pathogenicity-relevant hydrolytic enzymes (chitinase, protease, and phospholipase) genes in vivo. In contrast, appressorium turgor pressure and destruxin A content were slightly decreased compared to the wild type. The transformant's high anti-stress tolerance, its high virulence against five important insect pests (cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora, diamondback moth Pl. xylostella, <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Ph. striolata, and silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii) and its capacity to colonize the root system are key properties for its potential bio-control field application...|$|R

40|$|Three {{insecticide}} {{active ingredients}} (cyfluthrin, indoxacarb, and zetacypermethrin) were evaluated for their efficacy on several insects found in fall alfalfa {{in the low}} desert. Both liquid and wettable formulations were included for both cyfluthrin and zetacypermethrin, and four rates of indoxacarb were applied. Insect pressures were fairly low throughout the study. Pyrethroid chemistries (cyfluthrin, zetacypermethrin) provided excellent control of threecornered alfalfa hoppers for seven days after application while cyfluthrin applications resulted in lowest numbers of pale <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> {{during the same time}} period. All chemistries resulted in excellent control of the South American bean thrips (Caliothrips phaseoli). Indoxacarb treatments resulted in significantly increased levels of spotted alfalfa aphid, thought due to a reduction of big eye bugs noted with usage of this chemistry. Wettable formulations of both cyfluthrin and zetacypermethrin resulted in significant hay yield increases (0. 1 tons/acre) when compared with their liquid formulations. An inverse yield trend was noted with indoxacarb rate. Usage of the liquid cyfluthrin chemistry also resulted in an unexplained quality decrease in this experiment...|$|R

40|$|Olfactory {{transduction}} is {{a process}} by which olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) transform odor information into neuronal electrical signals. This process begins with the binding of odor molecules to receptor proteins on olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) dendrites. The major molecular components involved in olfaction include odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), chemosensory proteins (CSPs), odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs). More importantly, as potential molecular targets, chemosensory proteins are used to identify novel attractants or repellants for environmental-friendly pest management. In this study we analyzed the transcriptome of the <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of Brassicaceae crops, {{to better understand the}} molecular mechanisms of olfactory recognition in this pest. The analysis of transcriptomes from the antennae and terminal abdomens of specimens of both sexes identified transcripts from several key molecular components of chemoreception including 73 ORs, 36 GRs, 49 IRs, 2 SNMPs, 32 OBPs, 8 CSPs, and four candidate odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs) : 143 cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs), 68 esterases (ESTs), 27 glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and 8 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Bioinformatic analyses indicated {{that a large number of}} chemosensory genes were up-regulated in the antennae. This was consistent with a potential role in olfaction. To validate the differential abundance analyses, the expression of 19 genes encoding various ORs, CSPs, and OBPs was assessed via qRT-PCR between non-chemosensory tissue and antennae. Consistent with the bioinformatic analyses, transcripts for all of the genes in the qRT-PCR subset were elevated in antennae. These findings provide the first insights into the molecular basis of chemoreception in the <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta striolata (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an {{economically}} important pest on crucifer vegetables worldwide. Twenty isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) were evaluated against soil-dwelling {{stages of the}} <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> in the laboratory. The corrected mortalities and reproduction rates at a concentration of 36 infective juveniles (IJs) cm- 2 surface area of sand against third instars of the pest greatly differed among the tested isolates, ranging from 6. 7 % to 100 %. When tested over a range of temperatures from 15 °C to 35 °C, 25 °C {{was found to be}} the optimal tmperature for four selected nematode isolates (Steinernema carpocapsae All, Steinernema pakistanense 94 - 1, Heterorhabditis indica LN 2 and H. indica 212 - 2) to infect the third instar and reproduce in the cadavers. S. pakistanense 94 - 1 and H. indica 212 - 2 showed markedly greater heat-tolerance compared to S. carpocapsae All and H. indica LN 2. Corrected mortalities and reproduction rates increased as the concentration of IJs increased from 4 to 36 IJs cm- 2. The LC 50 values of S. carpocapsae All, S. pakistanense 94 - 1, H. indica LN 2 and 212 - 2 were 17. 1, 15. 5, 6. 5 and 5. 9 IJs cm- 2, respectively. The third instars larvae and pupae of P. striolata were more susceptible to the four nematode isolates than the first and second instars. Higher pathogenicity and greater heat tolerance and reproduction potential makes H. indica 212 - 2 the most promising candidate for the biological control of P. striolata under the field conditions of South China...|$|R
40|$|Aggregations of the <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Phyllotreta striolata {{on their}} {{crucifer}} host plants are mediated by volatiles emitted from feeding males. The male-specific sesquiterpene, (6 R, 7 S) -himachala- 9, 11 -diene (compound A), was shown previously to be physiologically and behaviorally active, but compound A was attractive only {{when combined with}} unnaturally high doses of the host plant volatile allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in field trapping experiments. This indicated that {{our understanding of the}} chemical communication in this species is incomplete. Another male-specific sesquiterpenoid, (3 S, 9 R, 9 aS) - 3 -hydroxy- 3, 5, 5, 9 -tetramethyl- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 a-hexahydro- 1 H-benzo[7]annulen- 2 (3 H) -one (compound G), has been reported from an American P. striolata population. We confirmed the presence of compound G, and investigated its interaction with compound A and AITC in a P. striolata population in Taiwan. Compound G was attractive to Taiwanese P. striolata in laboratory bioassays, but significantly more beetles were attracted to a blend of compounds A and G. Under the same conditions, P. striolata showed no preference for the blend of A and G combined with a range of doses of AITC over the sesquiterpenoid blend alone. The sesquiterpenoid blend was tested further in field trapping experiments and attracted significantly more beetles than traps baited with compound A and ecologically relevant amounts of AITC. We conclude that A and G are components of the male-specific aggregation pheromone of P. striolata in Taiwan, and that the attractiveness of the pheromone is not reliant on the presence of AITC. Our results further indicate that the male-specific sesquiterpenoid blends differ qualitatively between the Taiwanese and American populations of P. striolata...|$|R
40|$|Companion {{planting}} is a small-scale intercropping practice {{often associated}} with organic or biodynamic gardening. Two garden-scale studies tested popular companion planting claims by comparing garden beds devoted entirely {{to one of three}} or more test crops (monocultures) to all possible two-crop mixtures (dicultures) of the same species. A third study evaluated effects of planting density and crop ratio in three dicultures using a novel experimental design to create gradients in both factors. All studies incorporated basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), Brussels sprout (Brassica oleracea L.), and tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.). A preliminary study also included snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.) before Brussels sprout, and dicultures of tomato and Brussels sprout with a white clover (Trifolium repens L.) living mulch. Double blind taste tests over three years showed no consistent preference for tomatoes grown with companions over those grown in monoculture. An apparent inhibitory effect of companion planting on some pests of Brussels sprout (e. g. imported cabbageworm, Pieris rapae L.; <b>striped</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phylollotreta striolata Fab.) in the first study was reversed in the second study when earlier planting of Brussels sprout allowed it to compete more effectively with its companions. Relative yield indices calculated for a range of densities (1. 1 - 47. 2 plants/square meter) and crop ratios indicated advantages (mean = 20 %) to planting either tomato or Brussels sprout with basil companions, but no advantage to planting tomato and Brussels sprout together. The highest yields in tomato, basil, and Brussels sprout monocultures occurred at inter-plant spacings of 25, 25 and 40 cm respectively, suggesting advantages to high-density planting. Yield advantages to diculture were most pronounced at the highest densities tested, and in dicultures incorporating the highest proportions of basil. Canopy light absorption and soil moisture content were inversely correlated, and the use of light and water resources was correlated with plant density and biomass production. I conclude that garden-scale intercropping can offer advantages over monoculture, but these are not achieved simply by combining certain compatible companion species. Crop densty, ratio, and relative planting times all affect the way that companion species interact with one another and their environment...|$|R

40|$|Three <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> species (Aphthona spp.), first {{introduced}} into North America in 1988, {{have come to}} be regarded as effective biological control organisms for leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). The black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> (Aphthona lacertosa and A. czwalinae) in particular have been shown to cause reductions in leafy spurge stem counts in the northern Great Plains, while the brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (A. nigriscutis) has persisted and spread, but has not been found to be as effective at controlling leafy spurge. The ability of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to control leafy spurge in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> herbivory on leafy spurge, we monitored stem counts of leafy spurge and numbers of black and brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006. Brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> numbers were observed to be negligible on these sites.

40|$|The <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta nemorum L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an {{intermediate}} specialist feeding {{on a small}} number of plants within the family Brassicaceae. The most commonly used host plant is Sinapis arvensis L., whereas the species is found more rarely on Cardaria draba (L.) Desv., Barbarea vulgaris R. Br., and cultivated radish (Raphanus sativus L.). The interaction between <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> and Barbarea vulgaris ssp. arcuata (Opiz.) Simkovics seems to offer a good opportunity for experimental studies of coevolution. The plant is polymorphic, as it contains one type (the P-type) that is susceptible to all <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> genotypes, and another type (the G-type) that is resistant to some genotypes. At the same time, the <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> is also polymorphic, as some genotypes can utilize the G-type whereas others cannot. The ability to utilize the G-type of B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata is controlled by major dominant genes (R-genes). The present investigation measured the frequencies of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> with R-genes in populations living on different host plants in 2 years (1999 and 2003). Frequencies of beetles with R-genes were high in populations living on the G-type of B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata in both years. Frequencies of beetles with R-genes were lower in populations living on other host plants, and declining frequencies were observed in five out of six populations living on S. arvensis. Selection in favour of R-genes in populations living on B. vulgaris is the most likely mechanism to account for the observed differences in the relative abundance of R-genes in <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> populations utilizing different host plants. A geographic mosaic with differential levels of interactions between <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> and their host plants was demonstrate...|$|R
