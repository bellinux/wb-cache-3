The director, Geoff Davis, was criticised for this decision. Politician Bill O'Chee, a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee, said, [...] "When a person dies, all that is left is their story, and you can’t take a person’s name and not tell the truth about their story." [...] Davis has said, [...] "Whatever [...] genetic background, his culture was Australian. To me, he's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here. ... A lot of people are sitting at the back of this bus attacking the driver. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> they own the story of Billy Sing.

40|$|The female {{interviewee}} is a {{woman from}} northwest Bosnia, born in 1960. She was two years old when her family moved to Kostrići. In 1979 she went to Zagreb {{in order to work}} as a nurse. She got married and lived a quiet life with her husband and children until she noticed that things were changing at work. All of a sudden it was relevant if another nurse was Serbian, for example. This never was an issue before. She describes more examples of this segregation, from a personal perspective. When the war started, her parents wanted to stay in Kostrići. It was here that they were killed during the war. She herself continued working and took care of their two young children, while her husband joined the army. It was a difficult and scary time, because she never knew whether her children were safe during the air raids, when she had to stay in the hospital. After Operation Storm she went to search for her family in Kostrići, together with her brother {{who had been in the}} army. They found the remains of their parents.

[...] Preece added [...] "Disregarding the backpedalling {{that has gone}} on since the EzrA reveal, {{the second half of}} the season was stronger than the show has been in a while but, with promises not delivered on and satisfying answers dropped in as red herrings with alarming frequency, it’s hard not to assume that the writers are just making it up as they go along at this point." [...] Nick Campbell of TV.com gave it a negative review, saying [...] "It was disappointing to see such a weak ending to an episode that was essentially created for fan service. I know a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> will <b>feel</b> cheated because A wasn't unmasked, but the episode was truly dedicated to providing clarification, if not answers, to many a question. At the very least, it cleared up the timeline and helped narrow down the field as to who A is. The problem with a show like this is that there's a general impatience with knowing the answers, and that frustration often gets conflated with a malaise concerning the show in general. Pretty Little Liars isn't perfect. God help us, we can enumerate the actual problems with the series for hours. But how it reveals the core tenet of the show isn't one of them. Someday, Pretty Little Liars will get to the point like Bones or Chuck did, where the main serial conceit will wear itself out so much that A will have to be unmasked because that premise gets old. But not just yet".|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about if race has an {{impression}} on how <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> on politically issues. Using different magazines and newspaper such as {{but not limited to}} Chicago Tribune, also my research through a survey conducted on the Quad of the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign will show the reason behind the critics on Obama???s comment. After conducting my surveys and collecting data I {{have come up with a}} few opinions to my question. In the beginning my question came from a situation from MTV???s video music awards that took place two months ago. The situation consisted of Kanye West coming up on stage while Tyler Swift was receiving her award for Best Video of the Year. While Swift was on stage West comes up on stage in the middle of her acceptance speech and states that he does not agree with Swift winning the award and that he feels that Beyonce had the best video of the year and then walks off. Swift was left standing on stage speechless not only in front of the audience but on national television as well. After the statement was said President Obama stated off the record during an interview that West was an ???asshole??? for his actions. After this statement was made media attacked Obama immediately and many felt was blown out of proportion. This made me think if President Bush was to make the same statement would the outcome be the same. Was it because the President is African American that his every word and action criticized. Do <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> certain ways about politics because of their ethnicity? I then decided to conduct my research by using surveys. After collecting and filing the data I found out some answers but also new questions as well. Most people thought that many people can effect one???s political beliefs sometimes. These results tell me that if you are with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that <b>feel</b> one way about a subject instead of standing up about what they feel are right they will conform in fear of being different. But this also beings up the question that if someone else feels the same way will you fight for what you feel is right and voice your opinion even if you are outnumbered...|$|R
5000|$|.....that song is a {{response}} to the way we saw the U.S. government try to reframe the conflicts of the world. Particularly when the Soviet Union had collapsed, {{there was no way to}} subject the country to the kind of fear needed to justify what I consider to be an ill distribution of wealth. After 9/11 you could see that reframing taking place. The specter of Communism no longer haunted the U.S., justifying its actions in Latin America and all over the world. What filled that void were Al Qaeda and the Muslim world in general. That song is, in an abstract way, addressing the way the Right has distracted people from this huge rush of wealth from the bottom to the top.Beyond that, I’m speaking toward a deeper sentiment that I feel and I know a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel.</b> Most of the songs have to do with redemptive moments that come in the face of some real indignity. And that’s the current that I’m trying to tap into, because I think that for a lot of people — for the real participants who live in the shadows and work at car washes and are forced to cross the border and are struggling and facing the real economic consequences — they’re often left out off the debate because of the language they speak or even the terminology that they use.So it stems from my own frustration. It stems from seeing how things have been developing politically, and watching so much dissatisfaction and people very upset about the way the country is going. And watching all of that frustration steered back into a more traditional political process.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the success}} of her urban {{crossover}} album Daydream, Carey began exerting {{more control over the}} creative aspects of her career. In doing so, she began pursuing a more hip-hop oriented sound, something very different from anything she had recorded previously. However, she was still writing ballads with Afanasieff, but began looking for more hip-hop/R&B producers to helm part of her new project. The song was recorded in February 1997. After Carey began working on the song with Q-Tip, they brought the lyrics, samples and melody over to Puff Daddy, who as a producer, had just earned his second number one single on the Hot 100 with [...] "Mo Money Mo Problems."

I'm trying to work on that, I'm such a perfectionist, sometimes I don't give people the chance to breathe. So I've been banned from a lot of studios. Mariah [...] "Honey" [...] until she thought it was perfect, like a hundred times. She gave me like a hundred tracks to choose from.Puffy expressed his respect for Mariah and her craft, mentioning that she re-did her vocals many times until she felt they were perfect. After they had the vocals, Carey and Puffy began working on the song's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus. After the song was completed, Combs was very confident with the song, calling it [...] "slammin'," [...] but because of its heavy hip-hop influence, he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song's commercial success. On a more personal note, [...] "Honey" [...] served as Carey's first single after her separation from estranged husband, Tommy Mottola, who also lead her current record label, Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|On April 17, 2008, {{during the}} top of the eighth inning of a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Brennaman made {{comments}} about Cubs fans and the Cubs team. This occurred after then-Reds player Adam Dunn connected for a home run. Cubs fans customarily throw the opposing player's ball back onto the field. In this case, the field was littered with multiple balls thrown by fans onto the field, resulting in a game delay as the field crew recovered the debris. Brennaman's statements were aired over the Reds Radio Network broadcast of the game."This is the kind of thing, quite honestly, right now, that makes {{you want to see the}} Chicago Cubs team lose. Among all baseball fans, and I can't attest to the Yankees or Red Sox, because we don't see them with any degree of regularity unless it's inter-league play, but far and away the most obnoxious fans in baseball, in this league, are those who follow this team right here. Throwing 15 or 18 balls onto the field, there's absolutely no excuse for that, and that is so typical of Chicago Cubs fans. It's unbelievable.""You simply root against 'em. Y'know, I've said all winter they talked about this team winning the division, and my comment is they won't win it, because at the end of the day, they still are the Chicago Cubs, and they will figure out a way to screw this whole thing up."On April 18, 2008, Brennaman appeared in an interview on Chicago sports radio station WMVP-AM 1000 in which he reinforced his position on Cubs fans, and compared Chicago Cubs fans to rival St. Louis Cardinals fans. [...] "If they can't understand what happened Wednesday night was completely over the top, then I'm sorry", Brennaman said. [...] "I said how tough it is to root for the Cubs. I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> the same way I do, but they won't articulate it. I'm not afraid to say what I think.""to Cubs fans Cardinals fans are hands down the best in baseball. They respect the game. They don't go to the game to do stupid stuff.""The Cubs have some great baseball fans. But the ones who act like idiots (ruin) it for people like me."On February 5, 2010, Brennaman was chastised for commenting that Marshall University's president must be [...] "queer" [...] for softball at the university's baseball banquet and fundraiser. Brennaman stated, [...] "I probably could have made a better choice of words, but in no way does that reflect my opinion about gays at all. It's just a comment I made about the president of the university." ...|$|E
