5|$|All six <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> {{attached}} to the mesosoma ("thorax") and terminate in a hooked claw.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a pair of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5|$|Frog <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> {{eaten by}} humans {{in many parts}} of the world. French cuisses de grenouille or frog legs dish is a {{traditional}} dish particularly served in the region of the Dombes (département of Ain). The dish is also common in French-speaking parts of Louisiana, particularly the Cajun areas of Southern Louisiana as well as New Orleans, United States. In Asia, frog <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> consumed in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Chinese edible frog and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China. Frog <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> part of Chinese Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. In Indonesia, frog-leg soup is known as swikee or swike. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.|$|E

50|$|The first semi-final <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> {{played on}} 28 February and 1 March {{and the second}} <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> played on 4 and 5 April 2017. First <b>leg</b> times <b>are</b> CET (UTC+1) and second <b>leg</b> times <b>are</b> CEST (UTC+2).|$|R
5|$|In Mexico and Thailand, {{the heads}} and <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> removed, and the {{remainder}} may be boiled, sauted, grilled, dried or diced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The {{three pairs}} of <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> sturdy, with large coxae and five claws each. They are {{attached}} {{to each of the}} three thoracic segments. The front <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> the shortest and the hind legs the longest, providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs. The spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory, but observations of the insect's gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain. The structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legs.|$|E

5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> known as true legs and the abdominal <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|If the {{majority}} of the fetal remains are in the pelvic cavity of the adult, yet the <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> extended and/or the cranium lies among the ribs, then the infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of the mother's torso prior to burial. As both bodies skeletonized, the infant's bones would have settled among the mother's ribs and vertebrae.|$|E
