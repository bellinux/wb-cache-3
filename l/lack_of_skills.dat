5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro was {{developed}} by Dinosaur Polo Club, a two-man independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, {{which was founded in}} 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised {{that he would have to}} restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on audio content, due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most of their potential game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles.|$|E
25|$|Some {{emotional}} and behavioral problems that can result due to domestic violence include increased aggressiveness, anxiety, and changes in how a child socializes with friends, family, and authorities. Depression, emotional insecurity, and mental health disorders can follow due to traumatic experiences. Problems with attitude and cognition in schools can start developing, along with a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> such as problem-solving. Correlation has been found between the experience of abuse and neglect in childhood and perpetrating domestic violence and sexual abuse in adulthood.|$|E

30|$|Other {{causes of}} delays include the {{installation}} of additional crash prevention networks for safety, changes in material quantity, and worker composition because {{of changes in the}} plan area, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> <b>of</b> operators, and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> understanding of the design drawings by field managers.|$|R

25|$|Due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the informal economy, inside the slum or in developed urban areas near the slum. This can sometimes be licit informal economy or illicit informal economy without working contract or any social security. Some of them are seeking jobs {{at the same time}} and some of those will eventually find jobs in formal economies after gaining some professional skills in informal sectors.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills,</b> limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena. This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people move}} to urban areas {{primarily}} because cities promise more jobs, better schools for poor's children, and diverse income opportunities than subsistence farming in rural areas. For example, in 1995, 95.8% of migrants to Surabaya, Indonesia reported that jobs were their primary motivation for {{moving to the}} city. However, some rural migrants may not find jobs immediately because of their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> and the increasingly competitive job markets, which leads to their financial shortage. Many cities, on the other hand, do not provide enough low-cost housing for {{a large number of}} rural-urban migrant workers. Some rural–urban migrant workers cannot afford housing in cities and eventually settle down in only affordable slums. Further, rural migrants, mainly lured by higher incomes, continue to flood into cities. They thus expand the existing urban slums.|$|E

500|$|As Soviet foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko {{noted in}} his memoirs that working with Nikita Khrushchev was not always an easy task. As Gromyko tells it, [...] "Khrushchev would {{constantly}} throw new ideas back and forth." [...] His ideas were not always supported, but, as Gromyko noted, Khrushchev had {{a positive impact on}} Soviet foreign policy. Leonid Brezhnev, according to Gromyko, was a man much easier to do business with because he compensated for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> by discussing subjects openly within the Politburo. While he was easier to do business with in some areas, Brezhnev's slowness and lack of knowledge in certain fields made him hard to discuss foreign policy with. However, Gromyko noted that his disease should be taken in consideration. Mikhail Gorbachev's [...] "new thinking" [...] led to friendlier foreign relations with the Western countries, but his domestic policies destabilised the country, and in 1991 the Soviet Union dissolved. In 1991, before the country's dissolution, the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of External Relations. The ministry was succeeded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in 1992 after Russia declared itself the legal successor to the USSR.|$|E
500|$|As a {{composer}} Holst was frequently inspired by literature. He set poetry by Thomas Hardy and Robert Bridges and, a particular influence, Walt Whitman, whose words he set in [...] "Dirge for Two Veterans" [...] and The Mystic Trumpeter (1904). He wrote an orchestral Walt Whitman Overture in 1899. While on tour with the Carl Rosa company Holst had {{read some of}} Max Müller's books, which inspired in him {{a keen interest in}} Sanskrit texts, particularly the Rig Veda hymns. He found the existing English versions of the texts unconvincing, and decided to make his own translations, despite his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> as a linguist. He enrolled in 1909 at University College, London, to study the language. Imogen commented on his translations: [...] "He was not a poet, and there are occasions when his verses seem naïve. But they never sound vague or slovenly, for he had set himself the task of finding words that would be 'clear and dignified' and that would 'lead the listener into another world'". His settings of translations of Sanskrit texts included Sita (1899–1906), a three-act opera based on an episode in the Ramayana (which he eventually entered for a competition for English opera set by the Milan music publisher Tito Ricordi); Savitri (1908), a chamber opera based on a tale from the Mahabharata; four groups of Hymns from the Rig Veda (1908–14); and two texts originally by Kālidāsa: Two Eastern Pictures (1909–10) and The Cloud Messenger (1913).|$|E
2500|$|The Trade Boards Act 1909 created {{boards to}} set minimum wage {{criteria}} that were legally enforceable. [...] The main provision was to set minimum wages in certain trades {{with the history}} of low wages, because of surplus of available workers, the presence of women workers, or the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills.</b> [...] At first it applied to four industries: chain-making, ready-made dresses. paper-box making, and the machine-made lace and finishing trade. [...] About 70 per cent of their 200,000 workers were women. [...] It was later expanded to coal mining and then to other industries with preponderance of unskilled manual labour by the Trade Boards Act 1918, and by 1924 to farm labourers.|$|E

2500|$|The unnamed, {{oblivious}} {{manager of}} the engineering division of Dilbert's company. Scott Adams states that he never named him {{so that people can}} imagine him to be their boss. In earlier strips he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls; it was not until later that he developed his signature [...] "pointy hair" [...] and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies which rarely bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that [...] "He's not sadistic, just uncaring". His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. [...] His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named [...] "Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light", and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devils' horns.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1882, Bernhardt {{opened in}} Victorien Sardou's Fédora and again {{received}} excellent reviews. Sardou {{had written the}} play specifically for her, but had refused to allow Damala to act in it. Bernhardt appointed her husband manager of her theatrical company on tour ("Head of the Tour"), a decision that proved disastrous, given Damala's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> in managing. Bernhardt was eventually forced to remove him from his post and reduce him to Prince Consort. This development, combined with Damala's frustration over the way his career developed provoked him to continue the habit of humiliating Bernhardt {{in front of her}} friends and openly criticizing her. His increasingly deeper addiction to drugs, particularly morphine, created even greater problems in their marriage. Damala's drug-influenced behaviour became frequently scandalous. On one occasion, while on stage with Bernhardt, a drug-induced Damala tore down her dress and exposed her bare buttocks to the audience. On 12 December 1882, Bernhardt lashed out against Damala, refusing to cover his expenses on women and drugs anymore, to which Damala responded equally explosively with his own accusations. The next morning Damala left, without notice, for North Africa. Realizing he would never be seen as something more than [...] "Mr Sarah Bernhardt", he decided to enlist for service in the spahi troops in Algeria. Bernhardt was left behind to settle for the debts arising from Damala's addiction to drugs and prostitutes as well as her son's gambling.|$|E
