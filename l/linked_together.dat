5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E

5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E

5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's energy {{infrastructure}} sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers {{are connected to}} electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> by approximately 11,000km of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts. In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity generation was 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize {{belief in}} an afterlife, instead stressing {{the importance of}} behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet <b>linked</b> <b>together.</b> It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels {{to the realm of}} the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|E

5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> by a chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he {{was then}} known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and {{assistant}} cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's What Price Glory? in 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being {{given an opportunity to}} act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, The Cradle Snatchers. After the success of The Cradle Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls Gone Wild.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27–28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines <b>linked</b> <b>together</b> with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had said that when they called out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E
