25|$|Artificially raised {{planting}} mounds {{were separated}} by shallow canals filled with water. The canals supply moisture for growing crops, but they also absorb heat from solar radiation during the day. This heat is gradually emitted during the bitterly cold nights and provided thermal insulation against the endemic frost in the region. Traces of similar <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> {{have been found in}} the Llanos de Moxos region (Amazonian flood plains of the Moxos). Over time, the canals also were used to farm edible fish. The resulting canal sludge was dredged for fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s a Bicentennial Heritage Grant made {{possible}} {{the restoration of the}} Cemetery Lodge and the basic repair of many broken monuments. This followed in the 1990s with donations from the New South Wales Institution of Surveyors for the restoration of the tomb of Sir Thomas Mitchell and from the Andrews family for the restoration of their family memorial. A conservation strategy for monuments was created, a <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> plan was commenced and several individual studies focussed on aspects of the cemetery such as inscriptions, trees, native flora and the Dunbar tomb. Since 2001, the gateposts have been repositioned and the original gates restored. The vandalised gravestone of one of the cemetery's best-known inhabitants, Eliza Emily Donnithorne, a jilted bride whom many believe inspired Charles Dickens' creation of Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, has been restored.|$|E

25|$|The Program {{supports}} {{the educational and}} horticultural missions of the Arnold Arboretum by providing students in the plant sciences with on-the-job training during the summer months. Interns work directly with the Arboretum's historic landscape and world-renowned scientific collection, gaining practical experience in public horticulture, collections and <b>landscape</b> <b>management,</b> and the arboreal sciences. Working alongside Arboretum staff, interns receive valuable mentoring opportunities and engage in a formal program of instruction, both {{in the classroom and}} in the field. A series of field trips scheduled throughout their summer experience offers participants valuable networking opportunities and exposure to the operations of many other botanical institutions. Fundamentally, the program provides essential support to horticulture staff in caring for the Arboretum's 281-acre landscape and living collection of more than 15,000 woody plants. The program helps identify exceptional talent, and many interns extend their terms through apprenticeships, fellowships, and full-time positions.|$|E
2500|$|By the Neolithic Revolution, {{during the}} {{introduction}} of grain-based agriculture, {{people all over the}} world used fire as a tool in <b>landscape</b> <b>management.</b> These fires were typically controlled burns or [...] "cool fires", as opposed to uncontrolled [...] "hot fires", which damage the soil. Hot fires destroy plants and animals, and endanger communities. This is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops. Cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn. They clear undergrowth, burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense. They provide a greater variety of environments, which encourages game and plant diversity. For humans, they make dense, impassable forests traversable. Another human use for fire in regards to <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> is its use to clear land for agriculture. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical Africa, Asia and South America. [...] "For small farmers, it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil," [...] said Miguel Pinedo-Vasquez, an ecologist at the [...] However this useful strategy is also problematic. Growing population, fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth's surface more prone to ever-larger escaped fires. These harm ecosystems and human infrastructure, cause health problems, and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere–and thus feed back into more fires. Globally today, as much as 5 million square kilometers–an area more than half the size of the United States–burns in a given year.|$|E
2500|$|Landscape ecology {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape limnology. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape integrated <b>landscape</b> <b>management.</b> [...] Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.|$|E
