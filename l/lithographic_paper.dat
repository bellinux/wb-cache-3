60|$|At the Botanic Gardens I {{received}} every {{assistance from}} Dr. McLelland,* [Dr. Falconer's locum tenens, then in temporary {{charge of the}} establishment.] who was very busy, superintending {{the publication of the}} botanical papers and drawings of his friend, the late Dr. Griffith, for which native artists were preparing copies on <b>lithographic</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pure tonal vocalizations, or 2 ̆ 2 {{whistles}} 2 ̆ 2, {{from five}} species of dolphins {{native to the}} western North Atlantic were examined and compared. The five species of dolphins were Tursiops truncatus, Lagenorhynchus acutus, Stenella plagiodon, Stenella longirostris, and Globicephala melaena. ^ Recordings made from 1964 - 1977 in locations ranging from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean were scrutinized {{for the presence of}} whistle vocalizations and all such whistles with suitable signal/noise levels were selected and re-recorded. Whistles were spectrographically analyzed and printed on <b>lithographic</b> <b>paper.</b> Each whistle was then individually measured and quantified using a minicomputer and graphic board. Six parameters were measured: beginning frequency, ending frequency, maximum frequency, minimum frequency, total duration in seconds, and number of inflection points. Comparisons within and between species were made with the use of discriminant analysis. ^ The generalized pattern for each species 2 ̆ 7 whistle repertoire was described using parameter means and coefficients of variation (C. V.). All five species exhibited a consistent pattern in the relative values for C. V. Maximum frequency had the lowest C. V. for all five species, while duration and number of inflection points had the highest C. V. for all five species. Recording samples from all species contained rhythmic repetitions of identical whistles. These repeated whistles may be a form of signature whistles. ^ Comparisons within and between species 2 ̆ 7 whistle patterns indicated significant species-specific differences. T. truncatus and G. melaena whistles were both highly distinctive from other species and from one another. The whistles of L. acutus, S. plagiodon, and S. longirostris were less distinctive, but still different enough to be discriminable. The relative degrees of species distinctiveness were broadly correlated with taxonomic and zoogeographic relations. Differences among sympatric species were greater then differences among allopatric species. ...|$|E
5000|$|It is an {{important}} ingredient in shoe polish, {{and can be used}} in making homemade incense cones. It is also used as a lickable adhesive, for example on postage stamps, envelopes, and cigarette <b>papers.</b> <b>Lithographic</b> printers employ it to keep the non-image areas of the plate receptive to water. [...] This treatment also helps to stop oxidation of aluminium printing plates in the interval between processing of the plate and its use on a printing press.|$|R
25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He {{was at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on <b>lithographic</b> transfer <b>paper</b> of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.|$|R
40|$|Lithographic {{masks are}} an {{important}} and increasingly complex part of systems for advanced optical and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. They introduce polarization and phase effects with {{a significant impact on}} the entire system performance. Rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) modeling of the mask is indispensable for a predictive simulation of <b>lithographic</b> processes. This <b>paper</b> describes several alternative mask models and their integration into a lithography simulation framework. Several examples demonstrate the relevance of an accurate mask diffraction modeling for the prediction of the lithographic process performance...|$|R
50|$|Max Brödel is {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the carbon dust technique for medical and scientific illustrations. He had been looking for an acceptable medium able to show the vividness and detail characteristic of living tissue, and made the breakthrough using clay-surfaced <b>lithographic</b> transfer <b>paper.</b> Using a wide variety of media, realistic multi-dimensional representations of complex anatomical structures are able to be constructed. The dust is made by shaving carbon pencils against abrasive surfaces, and then applying this fine dust onto textured, calcium-coated paper with dry brushes. Increasing the depth and dimension of the image, the carbon dust technique was able to add highlights, shadows, and texture to Brödel's work. Due to the limitations of the black and white printing era, the relative ease of reprinting artwork created with carbon dust made this a highly suitable technique {{for a wide variety of}} scientific illustrations. Popularized in the 1900s, this method is still used today because of its ability to capture a remarkable amount of fine visual detail.|$|R
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} quest for smaller details on computer chips requires increasingly accurate <b>lithographic</b> machinery. This <b>paper</b> discusses {{part of the}} design of a permanent magnet based vibration isolation system to be used within such machinery. In such system, the passive permanent magnets provide the gravity compensation and active electromagnets the accurate positioning. Flux-focusing materials may be incorporated for structural support, flux focussing and magnetic shielding. This paper investigates the feasibility of analytical surface charge modeling combined with the method of images for accurate force prediction in a suspension system with soft magnetic materials. More specifically, it is researched to what extent finite support lengths reduce the analytical model accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper delineates a {{comprehensive}} and successful application of decision tree induction to 1054 records of production lots {{taken from a}} lithographic process with 45 processing steps. Complex interaction effects among manufacturing equipment that lead to increased product variability have been detected. The extracted information has been confirmed by the process engineers, and used to improve the <b>lithographic</b> process. The <b>paper</b> suggests that decision tree induction may be particularly useful when data is multidimensional, and the various process parameters and machinery exhibit highly complex interactions. Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the manufacturing process (e. g., closed-loop critical dimensions control) using data mining may be highly effective.

50|$|Before the Model A, {{in order}} to make a <b>paper</b> <b>lithographic</b> master for a lithographic press like the Multigraph 1250, one had two choices: Type up a new master using wax-coated carbon paper on a special master sheet, or use a metal plate coated with a {{modified}} silver halide photographic emulsion. If retyping the document was not feasible, the photographic method could be used, but it was slow, expensive, and messy. Because the Model A's toner repelled water but attracted oil-based inks, a lithographic master could be made easily by simply making a copy of the document with the Model A onto a blank paper master. It reduced the cost of creating a lithographic master for an existing document from three dollars to less than forty cents. Ford saved so much money by using the Model A that the savings were specifically mentioned in one of Ford's annual reports.|$|R

40|$|Block {{copolymers}} (BCPs) {{are seen}} as a possible cost effective complementary technique to traditional lithography currently used in the semiconductor industry. This unconventional approach has received increased attention in recent years as a process capable of facilitating the ever decreasing device size demanded. Control over microdomain orientation and enhancing long range order are key aspects for the utility of BCPs for future <b>lithographic</b> purposes. This <b>paper</b> provides an efficient route for the fabrication of highly ordered nanostructures suitable for such application. We investigate the significant effect of surface treatment regarding the self-assembly process of polystyrene-block-poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P 4 VP) by employing an ethylene glycol layer, producing well defined perpendicular P 4 VP cylinders with long range order over large surface areas. Nanopores are generated through surface reconstruction using a preferential solvent, which allows for the incorporation of an inorganic moiety. Treatment of this pattern with UV/Ozone leads to formation of well-ordered iron oxide nanodots with a pitch of [similar] 26 nm. Furthermore, high aspect ratio silicon nanopillars result following pattern transfer (using Ar/O 2) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that circuit {{interconnects}} and various passive components can be fabricated on a variety of flexible substrates using the offset <b>lithographic</b> process. This <b>paper</b> reports on a feasibility study investigating the manufacture of voltaic cells deposited via offset lithography. The Leclanche´ cell, an established battery chemistry, was chosen as an appropriate technology for adaptation to the offset lithographic process. Development of inks with appropriate rheological properties for lithographic printing was undertaken. Zinc and carbon electrodes were fabricated with silver-based current collectors. Electrolyte composition was investigated along with separator materials. Zinc and carbon-based inks have been produced which result in deposited material appropriate for use as electrodes. A separator material soaked in electrolyte has been combined with these electrode structures and an MnO 2 paste to form a voltaic cell. A printed battery, made up of these voltaic cells, with a capacity greater than 8 mAh at 6 V has been produced. The fabrication of voltaic cells via offset lithography facilitates the production of electronic systems with power sources provided by the same printing process. This paper provides information of interest to all those involved in the developing industry of printed and flexible electronics...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{printing}} {{is dominated by}} studies of mechanical typography. In this thesis the role of lithography in modernising printing is presented as an alternative path. The conventional explanation of how different printing processes work is generally made by dividing them into relief, intaglio and planographic processes. This explanation is of questionable value now, {{in a world where}} digital pre-press and offset printing hold sway. It is an outmoded idea to think that different ways of delivering ink under pressure {{is at the core of}} printing. Instead, it is more useful to focus our attention on the role played by direct and indirect image transfer. The similarities between the uses made by Gutenberg and Senefelder of direct and indirect image transfer has a greater importance than has the simplified division of printing processes into classes based upon depth of impression which is, essentially, a mechanical idea grounded in the typographic tradition. The idea presented here is that Gutenberg's application of indirect image transfer in his invention of moveable type provoked changes of greater importance than did the alternative invention of printing illustrations directly from metal plates or wooden blocks. Similarly, direct lithography was transformed by Senefelder into a vehicle for indirect image transfer by the invention of <b>lithographic</b> transfer <b>paper.</b> This invention had important ramifications for the future of lithography and for the preservation of photographic images. The combination of chemical printing and indirect image transfer made the capture of photographic images possible for the first time. In the nineteenth century, lithography also provided the first means by which photographs could be reproduced with printing ink in books - typography following here rather than leading the way. These issues have not been clearly recognised by many. The widely acknowledged superiority of typography to print economically, sharply, and at speed, was not surpassed by lithographers (who tended to concentrate on technical illustration and decorative printing) for many years. It was not until indirect image transfer was applied to the lithographic press that this barrier to progress was overcome, and, at last, text and image were efficiently transferred photographically to the rotary offset press...|$|R
2500|$|Since 1971, Serra {{has made}} {{large-scale}} drawings on handmade Hitomi paper or Belgian linen using various techniques. In the early 1970s he drew primarily with ink, charcoal, and <b>lithographic</b> crayon on <b>paper.</b> His primary drawing material {{has been the}} paintstick, a wax-like grease crayon. Serra melts several paintsticks to form large pigment blocks. The drawings do not function as preparatory studies but typically come after a sculpture has been completed, {{as a form of}} notating its spatial relationships. Drawings After Circuit (1972), for instance, followed an installation for documenta of four huge steel plates (8 by 24 feet each) jutting in from the corners of a room, stopping short of meeting in the center. In the mid-1970s, Serra made his first [...] "Installation Drawings" [...] — monumental works on canvas or linen pinned directly to the wall and thickly covered with black paintstick, such as Abstract Slavery (1974), Taraval Beach (1977), Pacific Judson Murphy (1978), and Blank (1978). The drawings Serra has executed since the 1980s continue the experiments with innovative techniques but are less monumental physically. In the late 1980s he explored how to further articulate the tension of weight and gravity by placing pairs of overlapping sheets of paper saturated with paintstick in horizontal and vertical compositions, often working on the floor and using a mesh screen as an intermediary between the gesture and the transfer of pigment to the paper.|$|R
40|$|The {{drive to}} sustain the {{improvements}} in productivity that derive from following Moore’s law has led the semiconductor industry to explore new technologies that enable production of smaller and smaller features on semiconductor device. Pitch division techniques and double exposure lithography are approaches that print features beyond the fundamental resolution limit of state-of-art lenses by modifying the <b>lithographic</b> process. This <b>paper</b> presents a new technique that enables pitch division in the printing of gratings using only a single exposure that is fully compatible with the current manufacturing tools. This technique employs a classical photoresist polymer together with a photoactive system that incorporates both a photoacid generator (PAG) and a photobase generator (PBG). The PBG {{is added to the}} resist formulation in higher molar concentration than the PAG, but has a base production rate that is slower than the acid production rate of the PAG. The PBG functions as a dose-dependent base quencher, which neutralizes the acid in high dose exposure regions but not in the low dose regions. This photoactive system can be exploited in the design of both positive tone and negative tone resist formulations that provide a developed image of a grating that is twice the frequency of the grating on the mask. A simulation of this process was performed for a 52 nm line and space pattern using PROLITH and customized codes. The results showed generation of a 26 nm half pitch relief image after development. Through this new technique, a 45 nm half pitch line and space pattern was experimentally achieved with...|$|R
