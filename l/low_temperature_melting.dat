P 407 can be utilized for a relatively simple, quick, inexpensive, reproducible and potentially scalable manner in the <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>melting</b> method. CoQ 10 solubility and dissolution increased with increasing concentrations of P 407 in SDs. Comparison of the enhanced dissolution of CoQ 10 from different poloxamers suggested that the preparation of CoQ 10 SDs using P 407 as a meltable hydrophilic polymer carrier could be a promising approach to improve its dissolution.

40|$|Upgraded {{biofuels}} as pellets, briquettes {{and powder}} are today {{commonly used in}} small as well as large scale appliances. In order to cover a great fuel demand new materials as bark, whole tree assortments and peat are introduced. These materials have higher ash content why they are potentially more problematic compared with stem wood. Ash related problems in the combustion device, e. g. fouling, slagging and corrosion may occur from the incombustible leftover i. e. the fuel ash. The objective of the present work {{was to determine the}} effect on slagging characteristics when co-pelletizing peat into woody biomass. In this project woody biomass (pine and spruce 50 / 50) has been co-pelletized with three different mixtures (low, medium and high) of peat; peat A with high ash and high Si content and peat B with low ash and a relatively high Ca/Si content. There were totally 6 mixed assortments in which softwood sawdust and energy wood each represented the biomass in 3 samples respectively. The experiments were carried out in a commercial underfed pellet burner (20 kW) installed in a reference boiler. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the phase composition and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS) were utilized in order to characterize the elemental distribution and morphology of the collected slag deposits and bottom ashe. The slagging tendency showed an obvious increment when adding peat into the woody biomasses. Especially the ash- and relatively Ca-poor sawdust fuel was generally more sensitive for the different peat assortments. Co-firing of peat A (high ash- and Si content) resulted in the most severe slagging tendency, where four out of six experiments led to a total shut down of the burner due to the slagging. The slagging tendency was significantly lower when adding peat B (ash poor and relatively high (Ca/Si ratio) into the woody biomass fuels. A significant increment of the Si, Al and Fe content and a significant decrement of the Ca content could be seen when increasing the mixing content of peat A in both woody biomasses. The slag from the peat B mixtures had a slightly higher Ca content compared with the Si content and a clearly higher Ca content compared with the peat A mixtures. When introducing the relatively silicon rich Peat A to the woody biomasses the slagging tendency increased because high temperature melting Ca-Mg oxides reacts to form more <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>melting</b> Ca-Al-K silicates.

It describes the seam welding of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets. The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod (CP Mo or AISI 304) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure. As {{soon as the}} distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet, an axial force was applied. After an initial dwell time, the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length, thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets. Multi-track and multi-metal seam welds of high temperature metallic sheets, AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloys, Cp Cu, Ti 6 Al 4 V and low temperature metallic sheets, AA 6061 were obtained.

Tensile- shear testing showed that the seam welds of AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA 6061 was weaker due to softening.

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, {{the authors}} employ tailor welded {{aluminum}} alloy pipes for lateral extrusion process with a lost core {{to perform a}} hollow light-weight-part. Design/methodology/approach: The pipe is welded longitudinally by YAG-laser. “The lateral extrusion process with a lost core (LELC) ” consists of lateral extrusion of pipes with a soluble solid core, called the “lost core”, {{which serves as a}} plastic mandrel. The process proceeds as follows. First, the pipe cavity is filled with the liquid <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>melting</b> material composing the lost core. The liquid is then solidified to form the soluble core of the pipe. The material is compressed longitudinally as a composite billet as well as forging, and extruded in the lateral direction. After the pipe is deformed, the lost core is melted and removed. s. The bulge by the LELC is carried out by extruding the material for the lateral direction, however the simple bulge by hydro-forming is done by internal pressure. Findings: The LELC process can make a hollow product having uneven wall thickness without the deformation concentrating on a thinner part of the material, because the circumferential deformation of the material will be performed by its meridian strain. Practical implications: The authors have developed LELC process in which the lost core consists of low-temperature melting alloys and have tried to apply the process to perform bulge process with a tailor-welded pipe having two different wall thickness.

40|$|International audienceWe present {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{models of}} plate subduction and collision {{inspired by the}} Scandinavian Caledonian orogeny to investigate the possible impact of continental crust partial melting on the exhumation of ultra-high pressure metamorphic rocks. Three possible reactions were tested: low temperature solidus representing H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting, and two end-member reaction curves for dehydration melting. Thermo-mechanical effects of partial melting were implemented as (1) a viscosity decrease as a determined rheologically critical melt percentage was reached (here 0. 1), (2) a change in effective heat capacity and adiabatic heating/cooling accounting for a latent heat term in the heat equation. Among the 3 tested reactions, only H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting drastically modifies the collision dynamics from the non-melting reference model holding all other parameters constant. A substantially low general viscosity truncation (here 1017 Pa[*]s) is needed to properly resolve the effect of partial melting on deep collision processes. <b>Low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>melting</b> indeed induces {{the development of a}} low viscosity buoyant plume prior to slab detachment, where migmatites exhume from UHP conditions at rates and with pressure–temperature paths similar to the natural values acknowledged for the Norwegian Caledonides. High temperature melting has no drastic influence on early collision dynamics. While positive buoyancy remains the first order driver for the exhumation of buried continental rocks, exhumation initiates in these cases with eduction subsequent to slab detachment. Melting and formation of a migmatite plume can later occur along decompression path while continental crust undergoes thermal reequilibration at temperatures above 900 [*]°C. Some of the partially molten material can also relaminate in the overriding plate rather than exhume within the collision zone. Even if minor in terms of amount of magma produced, H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting at UHP conditions could therefore have a dramatic rheological effect and actually limits continental rocks subduction and facilitates their exhumation...|$|E

A new dual-edge seal (<b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>melt</b> 186 ˚C) consists of Cerasolzer CS 186 alloy as a main and J-B Weld epoxy steel adhesive as a support seal is developed and the triple vacuum glazing (area of 300 x 300 mm) samples are fabricated, in which the vacuum pressure of 4. 8 x 10 - 2 Pa is achieved. A 3 D FEM of the fabricated triple vacuum glazed is developed and the centre-of-pane and overall U-value of 0. 33 Wm- 2 K- 1 and 1. 05 Wm- 2 K- 1, respectively, are predicted...|$|R
