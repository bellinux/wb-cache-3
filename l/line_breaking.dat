Around dawn the next day, the Germans launched a severe counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's <b>line.</b> <b>Breaking</b> through, they forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, {{which was to}} the right of Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on each bank.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a four-day}} reprieve {{away from the}} frontline, the 12th Battalion {{relieved}} the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the following day, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's <b>line.</b> <b>Breaking</b> through the Australian line, the Germans forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, which was {{to the left of}} Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on both banks. Establishing his platoon in position, Whittle noticed a group of Germans moving a machine gun into position to enfilade the road. As the gunners began to set up the weapon, Whittle, under heavy rifle fire, jumped from the road and single-handedly rushed the crew. Using his bombs, he succeeded in killing the entire group before collecting the gun and taking it back to A Company's position.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with manual typesetting, {{the problem of}} justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX, which, provided that good points for <b>line</b> <b>breaking</b> have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words {{to fill in the}} line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many <b>line</b> <b>breaking</b> algorithms use a first-fit approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it will have on the following lines. In comparison, the total-fit <b>line</b> <b>breaking</b> algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.|$|E

500|$|Oxford retraced {{his steps}} {{through the fog}} back to the fight. His group arrived, unexpectedly, at Montagu's rear. Obscured by the fog, Oxford's [...] "star with rays" [...] badge was mistaken by Montagu's men, who {{believed}} it was Edward's [...] "sun in splendour". They assumed their allies were Edward's reserves and unleashed a volley of arrows. Oxford and his men immediately cried treachery; as staunch Lancastrians, they were wary of Montagu's recent defection. They struck back and began withdrawing from the battle. Their shouts of treason were taken up and spread quickly throughout the Lancastrian <b>line,</b> <b>breaking</b> it apart as men fled in anger, panic and confusion. As the fog started to dissipate, Edward saw the Lancastrian centre in disarray and sent in his reserves, hastening its collapse. Cries of Exeter's demise from a Yorkist axe resounded across the battlefield from the Lancastrian left, and amidst the confusion, Montagu was struck in his back and killed by either a Yorkist or one of Oxford's men.|$|E
2500|$|Drag {{systems are}} a {{mechanical}} means of applying variable {{pressure to the}} line spool or drive mechanism in order {{to act as a}} friction brake against it.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the attacking team {{to break through the}} {{defensive}} line is a key indicator of success as it creates opportunities to score tries. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> and identify the associated skills and playing characteristics. The 2013 Super Rugby season (125 games) was analysed, in which 362 <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> were identified and coded using variables that assessed team patterns and non-contact attacking skills in the phases preceding the <b>line</b> <b>break.</b> There was an average of 3 <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> per game, with 39 % of <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> resulting in a try. <b>Line</b> <b>breaks</b> occurred when the ball-carrier was running fast [61 %, x 2 (4) = 25. 784, p = 0. 000, Cramer’s v = 0. 1922, weak]. At a moderate distance, short lateral passes (19 %) and skip passes (15 %) attributed to the highest percentage of <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> [x 2 (26) = 50. 899, p = 0. 036, Cramer’s v = 0. 2484, moderate]. Faster defensive line speeds resulted in more <b>line</b> <b>breaks</b> [x 2 (12) = 61. 703, p < 0. 001, Cramer’s v = 0. 3026, moderate]. <b>Line</b> <b>breaks</b> are associated with overall team success and try scoring opportunities. Awareness of the defenders line speed and depth, fast running speed when receiving the ball and quick passing between attackers to the outside backs creates <b>line</b> <b>break</b> opportunities. During training, coaches should emphasise the movement speed of the ball between attackers and manipulate the speed and distance of the defenders...|$|R

2500|$|Officially, the purge was {{centered}} on accusations regarding Luca's {{opposition to the}} monetary reform of the Romanian leu, a measure ordered by the Soviet Union and carried out on 28 January 1952. He had been charged, through the voice of Miron Constantinescu, with [...] "grave deviations" [...] and taking a [...] "right wing opportunistic <b>line,</b> <b>breaking</b> away from the working classes" [...] (see Right Opposition); in addition to sharing the blame, Pauker was accused of having taken a [...] "left wing opportunistic line" [...] (see Left Opposition) on various issues. Upon witnessing the attack on him during the Plenary meeting of May (immediately amplified by the interventions of Alexandru Moghioroş, Iosif Rangheţ, Ion Vincze and others), Luca fainted. He was arrested in the same month, some days after his deposition and political indictment.|$|E
2500|$|Formally, the {{algorithm}} defines a value called badness {{associated with each}} possible line break; the badness is increased if the spaces on the line must stretch or shrink too much to make the line the correct width. Penalties are added if a breakpoint is particularly undesirable: for example, if a word must be hyphenated, if two lines in a row are hyphenated, or if a very loose line is immediately followed by a very tight line. The algorithm will then find the breakpoints that will minimize the sum of squares of the badness (including penalties) of the resulting lines. If the paragraph contains [...] possible breakpoints, the number of situations that must be evaluated naively is [...] However, by using the method of dynamic programming, the complexity of {{the algorithm}} can be brought down to [...] (see Big O notation). Further simplifications (for example, not testing extremely unlikely breakpoints such as a hyphenation in the first word of a paragraph) lead to an efficient algorithm whose running time is almost always of order [...] A similar algorithm is used to determine the best way to break paragraphs across two pages, in order to avoid widows or orphans (lines that appear alone on a page {{while the rest of the}} paragraph is on the following or preceding page). However, in general, a thesis by Michael Plass shows how the page breaking problem can be NP-complete because of the added complication of placing figures. TeX's <b>line</b> <b>breaking</b> algorithm has been adopted by several other programs, such as Adobe InDesign (a desktop publishing application) and the GNU fmt Unix command line utility.|$|E
