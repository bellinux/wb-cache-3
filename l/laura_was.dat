5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, <b>Laura</b> <b>was</b> still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and <b>Laura</b> <b>was</b> on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. <b>Laura</b> <b>was</b> re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
