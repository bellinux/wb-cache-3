Typically these combine the councillors from two council wards with representatives of community councils. Neighbourhood partnerships are tasked with dealing with issues that are specific to their local area and influencing the delivery of key council services including street cleaning, urban parks, libraries, <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> <b>road</b> maintenance, traffic and parking issues.

30|$|These {{lines of}} argumentation {{do not follow}} {{organizational}} boundaries, but rather coincide with specific responsibilities and mandates. For example, general traffic planners in the respective organizations tend to prioritize mobility, while traffic safety engineers in various organizations are predominantly concerned with issues of traffic safety. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that public actors who have a mandate to monitor both regional and <b>local</b> <b>development</b> and <b>road</b> safety—i.e. leading municipal politicians, officials in the regional development council, and planners in the former SRA—share the strongest commitment to regional development and economic growth, even though these goals might be attained {{at the expense of}} a higher rate of road accidents. In other words, the strong commitment to high speeds, as well as the explicit resistance to lowering speed limits in many cases, detracts from other policy efforts to reach national road safety targets at the regional and local level where decisions about speed limits on particular roads are made.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} barriers that prevent local governments from applying PPPs in their <b>road</b> <b>development</b> projects. Design/methodology/approach – Based on insights from a literature review, interviews were held with relevant staff to identify barriers. These were verified and their relative significance was determined through the use of a questionnaire, before being reflected upon and compared with literature findings. Findings – The research identified 37 barriers to local governments using PPPs in <b>road</b> <b>development</b> projects and showed that four barriers consistently stand out. First, the application of PPPs requires local governments to adapt their current working methods, which amounts to a large impediment to local governments applying PPPs. Second, local government employees believe that applying PPPs might effectively exclude local contractors from involvement in projects. Finally, local governments experience the whole PPP approach (the third barrier) and the PPP contract (the fourth) as overly complicated. Practical implications – To increase the use of PPPs for infrastructure provision at the local level, one has to focus on removing dominant local barriers as identified in this research. Originality/value – Although local-level PPPs have seen increasing interest, this is one of the first studies paying attention to the barriers to using PPPs for <b>local</b> <b>road</b> <b>development</b> project...|$|R

40|$|As Romania {{became a}} member of the European Union and bank credits more {{accessible}} to numerous citizens, the number of vehicles registered a remarkable increase. However, <b>local</b> <b>development</b> of the <b>road</b> and parking infrastructure did not register the same ascendant tendency, and, consequently, cities, including Craiova, presently confronts with numerous traffic problems. The Geographic Information System allows the interpretation of statistical data referring to the values registered by urban road traffic on different time intervals (daily, seasonally, and multi-annually) through the achievement of thematic layers that may suggestively render the intervals and perimeters where traffic jams frequently occur. It also allows the estimation of the movement speed of the auto vehicles on different road portions and the impact traffic lights or roundabouts have upon the speed distances are covered, which may eventually lead us to a better management of an integrated system of the urban road traffic. By applying the index of the probability of traffic jam occurrence, one may give some recommendations with regard to the necessity of one way roads and/or traffic lights and roundabouts, also integrating the variables offered by alternative means of transport (public transportation, bicycle tracks). According to the analysis achieved in GIS, the sustainability capacity of the road traffic in Craiova city is overtaken in terms of road infrastructure quality and quantity, lack of cycling tracks, insufficiency of parking places, and inadequate offer of public transportation. Besides the initial analysis, the utilization of GIS also allows th...|$|R

The basic hypotheses of a systemic model for <b>local</b> <b>development</b> are synthesized in emphasizing three main subsystems, representing three levels of public management. At the same time, a <b>local</b> <b>development</b> system is composed by the convergence of two cybernetic systems, namely an administrative and an economic one, each with specific missions. Consequently, the paper aims a model for an economic-administrative system of <b>local</b> <b>development</b> (SEADL), whose self-regulation mechanisms are based on qualitative assessments, concerning the relevance or usefulness/sustainability of a <b>local</b> <b>development</b> policy as well as quantitative assessments, referring to efficiency or effectiveness.
