50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Acanthis cabaret) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. It is the smallest, brownest, {{and most}} streaked of the redpolls. It is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the common redpoll (Acanthis flammea) but has recently been split from that species by the British Ornithologists' Union. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to New Zealand.

50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies A. f. flammea, the mealy redpoll, breeds {{across the}} northern parts of North America and Eurasia. There {{is also an}} Icelandic subspecies, the Icelandic redpoll (A. f. islandica), and one that breeds in Greenland and Baffin Island called the Greenland redpoll (A. f. rostrata). Many taxonomic authorities consider the <b>lesser</b> <b>redpoll</b> a subspecific form of the common redpoll. Together the Iceland and Greenland forms are sometimes known as 'northwestern redpolls'. All forms migrate south into Canada, northern USA, or Eurasia. These birds are remarkably resistant to cold temperatures and winter movements are mainly driven by the availability of food. There are two distinct populations (one lighter, one darker) united in islandica, the relationships of which are unresolved.|$|E

50|$|Nanjizel {{is within}} the Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{designated}} in 1977 for its granite cliffs and maritime heath. The valley is a constant effort site (CES) for the West Cornwall Ringing Group which monitors the birds in the valley. Breeding birds include common chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), common whitethroat (Sylvia communis), dunnock (Prunella modularis), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Other birds found include brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), common grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) <b>lesser</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Acanthis cabaret) and subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans). Rareties ringed {{in the autumn of}} 2014 were aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), barred warbler (Sylvia nisoria) and paddyfield warbler (Acrocephalus agricola). A first for Britain occurred on 8 October 2008 with the trapping, and the measuring of biometric data, of an alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum). A first for Cornwall occurred on 2 September 2015, when a Blyth's reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum) was ringed. There have been six Isles of Scilly records and one from Devon so it was considered long overdue for Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of the nature reserve is very rich. In the Kaiser Mountains there are about 940 {{different}} flowering plants, 38 different species of fern and over 400 different mosses. The colonies of fungi and lichen are very rich, with 100 and 236 different species respectively being represented. The forest region comprises mainly mixed forest with beech, fir and spruce. In the submontane area there are also ash and sycamore maple, and, in sunny areas, alder. Hay meadows, poor grassland and pastures are typical of the alpine meadows. In the subalpine region we find the typical dwarf shrub types such as mountain pine and alpenrose, and the rare dwarf alpenrose. Alpine polsterrasen ("cushion grasslands") are found {{all the way up}} to the summit areas. There are various wetlands also stocked with typical plants. As a product of ice age processes the Kaiser is also home to a number of rare, partly endemic invertebrates, such as Allobobophora smaragdina (a yellow-green earthworm), a door snail, and a number of spiders and butterflies. Typical vertebrates are the alpine and fire salamanders, smooth snake, viper (unusual color variants), edible dormouse, hazel dormouse and bank vole. In higher regions there are chamois, stoat, snow vole and mountain hare. Typical birds are wood warbler, the red-breasted flycatcher (for North Tyrol endemic), alpine chough, raven, crag martin, alpine willow tit, <b>lesser</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Carduelis linaria rufescens), alpine accentor, alpine wallcreeper and black grouse - capercaillie and rock ptarmigan. Raptors occurring in the Kaiser are the northern goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, tawny owl, pygmy owl and Tengmalm's owl.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} estimated {{national and}} regional changes in numbers of breeding woodland birds in predominantly broadleaved woodland in Britain between the mid 1980 s and 2003 – 04, derived from the Repeat Woodland Bird Survey (RWBS). A total of 405 sites across Britain for which historical data on bird populations were available were re-surveyed by BTO and RSPB fieldworkers during the RWBS. Changes were estimated separately for sites surveyed by the RSPB (n = 252) and BTO (n = 153) because of {{differences between the two}} groups in the field methods used in the original surveys. Changes between the 1960 s and 1970 s and 2003 – 04 were also estimated with the BTO data set only. The BTO and RSPB sites provide geographically complementary coverage of Britain and together provide much more widespread coverage than did the Common Bird Census (CBC), the former national monitoring scheme. Nationally, between the 1980 s and 2003 – 04, six species declined significantly and three increased significantly based on the RSPB data, whereas eight declined and 13 increased according to the BTO data, with good correspondence between the changes recorded by the two data sets (only seven of 34 species showing trends differing in direction). Eight species showed large national declines (> 25 %) according to both data sets: Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Redpoll</b> Carduelis cabaret, Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor, Spotted Flycatcher Muscicapa striata, Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis, Willow Tit Poecile montanus, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus and Wood Warbler P. sibilatrix. Eleven species showed large national increases (> 25 %) in both data sets: Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus, Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, Coal Tit Periparus ater, Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Great Tit Parus major, Green Woodpecker Picus viridis, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, European Robin Erithacus rubecula, Eurasian Treecreeper Certhia familaris and Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes. Analysis of the longer-term changes using the BTO data set showed significant declines between the 1960 s and 2003 – 04 in seven species and increases in 12 species. The large declines detected by the national monitoring schemes (CBC/BBS) for Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Redpoll,</b> Spotted Flycatcher, Tree Pipit, Willow Tit, Willow Warbler and Wood Warbler were all confirmed by the RWBS but the declines of the Common Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, Marsh Tit Poecile palustris and Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus were not clearly supported. The declines detected by the RWBS for Garden Warbler, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca and Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus were not evident from the national monitoring schemes. Most of the increases detected by the monitoring schemes were confirmed by the RWBS. However, the large increases detected by the RWBS for Coal Tit, Goldcrest, Great Tit and Eurasian Treecreeper were unexpected. All long-distance migrants have declined whilst medium-distance migrants (Blackcap and Common Chiffchaff) have increased. Also, rare and specialist woodland species have fared less well than common and generalist species...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} of supplementary food for wild birds in gardens {{during the winter}} months is common in the UK, but it is possible that it may precipitate infectious diseases in the birds. This paper describes the results of postmortem examinations of 116 wild finches carried out over a period of four years. The two commonest causes of death in areas where high mortality had been reported were infections with the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium DT 4 o and Escherichia coli 086. Coccidia of the gen-era Atoxoplasma or Isospora were found in several of the birds but were considered to be incidental. Megabacteria were also identified in some of the birds, {{for the first time in}} flocks of wild birds in the UK, but they were not considered to be significant. BIRDS of the order Passeriformes, family Fringillidae, usually referred to as finches, are small seed-eating birds with strong bills; the males have a well developed song and colourful plumage (Flegg 1990). Their natural habitats include hedgerows, woods, farmlands, orchards, commons and waste-lands, and seven species are included in the list of the 50 bird species most commonly recorded feeding in British gardens (Glue 1982). In order of fre-quency these are the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), greenfinch (Carduelis chloris), bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), bramblefinch or brambling (F montifringilla), siskin (C spinus), goldfinch (C carduelis), and <b>lesser</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Acanthis flammea). Since the early 1960 s, large numbers of greenfinches have been attracted into gardens by the {{provision of}} peanuts which can constitute a high proportion of the diet of the birds (Newton 1967). Siskins have also acquired the habit of feeding on peanuts in gardens (Spencer and Gush 1973) resulting in large flocks of siskins at some feeding stations. However the congregation of large numbers of birds in relatively small areas may increase their vulnerability to infectious diseases. This paper describes the causes of death of 1 1...|$|E
