For these performances, Thompson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. The following year, she wrote and starred in her own sketch comedy series for BBC, Thompson, but this was poorly received. In 1989, she and Branagh—who had formed a romantic relationship—starred in a stage revival of <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Anger, directed by Judi Dench and produced by Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company. Later that year, the pair starred in a televised version of the play.|$|E

25|$|John James Osborne (Fulham, London, 12 December 1929 – 24 December 1994) was an English playwright, screenwriter and actor, {{known for}} his excoriating prose and intense {{critical}} stance towards established social and political norms.

25|$|Oliver did {{numerous}} TV {{shows in}} 1957, and appeared on stage.

That same year, Oliver replaced Mary Ure as the female lead in the Broadway production of John Osborne's play <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Anger.|$|E
25|$|This was in {{the summer}} of 1955 and Osborne spent much of the next two years before their divorce hoping they would reconcile. In 1956, after <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Anger had opened, Osborne met her at the railway station in York, at which meeting she told Osborne of her recent {{abortion}} and enquired after his relationship with Mary Ure, of which she was aware. In April 1957, Osborne was granted a divorce from Lane, on the grounds of his adultery.|$|E
25|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} {{deck chair}} on Morecambe Pier, <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> Anger was a {{strongly}} autobiographical piece based on Osborne's unhappy marriage to actress Pamela Lane and their life in cramped accommodation in Derby. While Osborne aspired towards a career in theatre, Lane was more practical and materialistic, not taking Osborne's ambitions seriously while cuckolding him with a local dentist. It also draws from Osborne's earlier life; for example, the wrenching speech of witnessing a loved one's death was a replay {{of the death of}} his father, Thomas.|$|E

25|$|After school, Osborne {{went home}} to his mother in London and briefly tried trade journalism. A job {{tutoring}} a touring company of junior actors {{introduced him to the}} theatre. He soon became involved as a stage manager and acting, joining Anthony Creighton's provincial touring company. Osborne tried his hand at writing plays, co-writing his first, The Devil Inside Him, with his mentor Stella Linden, who then directed it at the Theatre Royal in Huddersfield in 1950. Around this time he also married Pamela Lane. His second play Personal Enemy was written with Anthony Creighton (with whom he later wrote Epitaph for George Dillon staged at the Royal Court in 1958).

The play was written by Andrew Davies and directed by Doctor Whos James Hawes for the digital television channel BBC Four. Hoggart's son, Simon, praised Tennant's performance in The Guardian newspaper.|$|E

Segal wrote that it is a [...] "disappointing" [...] song that when [...] "looked at in the sober light of day, it's nothing but a lachrymose slur through the Big Noel Book Of Emotional Cliches and some truly shameless piano, but you just know that come closing time, it could make a breeze block cry".
