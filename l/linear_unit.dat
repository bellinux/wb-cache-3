We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task.

Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart.

40|$|We present QuickNet, a {{fast and}} {{accurate}} network architecture {{that is both}} faster and significantly more accurate than other fast deep architectures like SqueezeNet. Furthermore, it uses less parameters than previous networks, making it more memory efficient. We do this by making two major modifications to the reference Darknet model (Redmon et al, 2015) : 1) The use of depthwise separable convolutions and 2) The use of parametric rectified <b>linear</b> <b>units.</b> We make the observation that parametric rectified <b>linear</b> <b>units</b> are computationally equivalent to leaky rectified <b>linear</b> <b>units</b> at test time and the observation that separable convolutions {{can be interpreted as}} a compressed Inception network (Chollet, 2016). Using these observations, we derive a network architecture, which we call QuickNet, that is both faster and more accurate than previous models. Our architecture provides at least four major advantages: (1) A smaller model size, which is more tenable on memory constrained systems; (2) A significantly faster network which is more tenable on computationally constrained systems; (3) A high accuracy of 95. 7 percent on the CIFAR- 10 Dataset which outperforms all but one result published so far, although we note that our works are orthogonal approaches and can be combined (4) Orthogonality to previous model compression approaches allowing for further speed gains to be realized.
