25|$|Petter {{believed}} that a compact and simplified fighter would offer the advantages of low purchase and operational costs, and that the Gnat should be capable of being manufactured both cheaply and easily. The emergence of new <b>lightweight</b> <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines,</b> several of which were well advanced in their own development process, also enabled the envisioned light fighter concept to be realised. The Gnat was initially intended to be powered by a Bristol BE-22 Saturn <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine,</b> capable of generating 3,800lbf (16.9kN 1,724 kgp) of thrust. However, development of the Saturn was cancelled; in its place, the more capable but not immediately available Bristol Orpheus <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> was adopted instead.|$|R
5000|$|The Midge and Gnat {{were the}} {{creation}} of W.E.W. [...] "Teddy" [...] Petter, a British aircraft designer who had gained wide recognition for his design of the English Electric Canberra bomber and Lightning supersonic interceptor. Petter had grown suspicious of the trend towards bigger and more expensive combat aircraft, and he felt that a small, simple fighter would offer the advantages of low purchase and operational costs. New <b>lightweight</b> <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines</b> were being developed that {{would be able to}} power such small fighters.|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce RB162 was a simply {{constructed}} and <b>lightweight</b> British <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> produced by Rolls-Royce Limited. Developed {{in the early}} 1960s, it was specially designed {{for use as a}} lift engine for VTOL aircraft but was also used in a later variant of the Hawker Siddeley Trident airliner as an auxiliary boost engine. A smaller related variant, the RB181 remained a design project only, as did a turbofan version designated RB.175.|$|R
50|$|From 1960, the Yakovlev Design Bureau {{began work}} on a VTOL system, using the compact and <b>lightweight</b> Tumansky RU-19-300 <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine,</b> {{drafting}} a proposal for the Yak-104, a converted Yak-30 jet trainer with two vertically mounted Ru-19 engines between the inlet ducts of the standard Yak-30 powerplant. Work on the Yak-104 was terminated in favour of an aircraft with a single lift/cruise engine with rotating nozzles, similar to the Hawker Siddeley P.1127, which was nearing completion in England. Unable to find a suitable engine or convince the government to order the development of one, the Yakovlev bureau was forced to follow a different course.|$|R

40|$|Component and over-all {{performance}} characteristics of several <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines</b> investigated in the altitude facilities of the NACA Lewis Laboratory {{during the last}} several years are summarized to indicate the effects of altitude on <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> performance. Data presented show that failure of <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> performance to generalize for all altitudes can be traced to reductions in compressor efficiency, corrected air flow, and combustion efficiency at altitude. In addition, it is shown that although engines of different design may have equal thrusts at sea level, the thrusts at altitude may vary widely because of differences in compressor {{performance characteristics}} from one engine to another...|$|R

At cruise, the ducted fan obtains lowest thrust specific fuel consumption. For equal maximum thrusts, the ducted fan obtains cruising flight duration and range appreciably greater than <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R

Taking into account the characteristics of the fuel for <b>turbojet</b> <b>engines,</b> the software used allows to study the optimal shape of the combustion chamber, position of injectors, outlet section (which represents the inlet section of turbine) and also, allows to study the optimal control law for a certain type of <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine</b> (monorotor, birotor, turbofan, etc). The main conclusion is represented by the link between the performance of burned process which takes place in the combustion chamber and implication upon optimal control law and programme for a <b>turbojet</b> <b>engine.</b> Even if the combined control laws have more parameters, the most important of them is the fuel rate...|$|R
