Some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league's news but more extensive coverage remains minimal.

5|$|The Flames {{would not}} raise their Western Conference {{championship}} banner for nearly 15 months, as the 2004–05 season was {{wiped out by}} a labour dispute. During the <b>lock-out,</b> team owner {{and chairman of the}} board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden. While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.|$|E

The season total of 362,227 fans smashed the old record by over 45,000.

He was also chosen to participate in the 2005 AHL All-Star Game for the Canadian team. With the NHL set to resume in 2005–06, the Predators re-signed Hamhuis to a one-year contract on August 16, 2005. Returning to Nashville, he went on to record a career-high seven goals, 31 assists and 38 points in 82 games. He led all Predators players in ice time and ranked second in plus-minus with a +11 rating.|$|E
5|$|Looking to fill extra {{dates in}} the Saddledome, the Flames {{agreed to a}} lease deal with the {{expansion}} Calgary Hitmen of the junior Western Hockey League who began play in 1995 and were partly owned by Theoren Fleury. Two years later, in 1997, the Flames bought the team for $1.5million. During the 2004–05 NHL <b>lock-out,</b> the Flames heavily marketed the Hitmen, and as a result, the team led all professional or junior hockey teams in North America in attendance, averaging over 10,000 fans per game.|$|E

Tavares was also named a finalist for the 2013 Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL's most valuable player, on May 10, 2013. Tavares scored his first career NHL playoff goal against Pittsburgh goaltender Marc-André Fleury in Game 3 of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs. He would finish with three goals and five points in six games as the Islanders were ultimately eliminated by the Penguins.|$|E

5|$|The 2004–05 <b>lock-out</b> {{ensured that}} several players who would {{otherwise}} have been playing in the NHL, including Getzlaf, were available to return to the national team for the 2005 World Junior Championship. One of 12 players with previous experience at the tournament for Canada, Getzlaf was a leading player for what many observers have called the greatest team in the tournament's history. With 12 points in 6 games, Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron's 13. He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6–1 score; it was the nation's first title in eight years at the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs {{and the members of}} the BNL.

Results in these crossover games would count towards a team's points tally. The NHL <b>lock-out</b> also saw a number of NHL players join British clubs. Coventry won a Grand Slam of all three titles, winning the Championship with an overtime victory over the Nottingham Panthers.|$|E

The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a <b>lock-out</b> of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

5|$|Phaneuf {{established}} himself as the junior hockey team's top player following the draft, earning the Bill Hunter Memorial Trophy as the top defenceman in the WHL. He was also named an Eastern Conference All-Star by the WHL, and a First Team All-Star by the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). He was considered a candidate to join the Flames in 2004. The 2004–05 NHL <b>lock-out,</b> however, forced Phaneuf to play one final year of junior hockey. He scored 56 points in 55 games to finish his junior career with 146 total points. He repeated as the WHL's Defenceman of the Year, and was again named to both WHL and CHL All-Star Teams. Prospects Hockey rated Phaneuf as the top player in the CHL in both 2004 and 2005, ahead of Sidney Crosby, naming {{him one of the}} best junior defencemen of the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson {{made his}} Sabres debut {{two days after}} the trade, {{registering}} four shots on goal and 16 minutes of ice time in a 2–0 win against the Anaheim Ducks. After going pointless in his first ten games with Buffalo, Hodgson recorded two assists in a 7–3 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 19. Two nights later, he scored his first two goals as a Sabre in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. Leaving Vancouver gave Hodgson a larger on-ice role, earning nearly five minutes more ice time per game as a Sabre. Completing his first NHL season with the Sabres, he finished with 41 points (19 goals and 22 assists) over 83 games. He ranked fifth in League rookie scoring and first in power play goals (7), despite earning less ice time than his first-year peers (his 13 minutes and 49 seconds per game averaged the least among the top 14 rookie scorers). As a team, the Sabres then failed to qualify for the 2012 playoffs, finishing ninth in the Eastern Conference. Hodgson was assigned to the AHL's Rochester Americans immediately before the 2012–13 NHL <b>lock-out</b> took effect.|$|E
5|$|The Mighty Ducks {{returned}} Getzlaf to the Hitmen for the 2003–04 season. He recorded 75 {{points in}} just 49 games {{and was named}} to the WHL's first all-star team. Due to the 2004–05 NHL <b>lock-out,</b> Getzlaf was again returned to Calgary for his fourth season of junior hockey. He was named team captain, but was briefly stripped of the title by the coaches after earning several misconduct penalties for arguing with the officials. The captaincy was restored after a couple weeks, and Getzlaf moderated his interactions with referees. He also missed time during the season after suffering a concussion {{as a result of a}} hit by Dion Phaneuf of the Red Deer Rebels. Getzlaf finished the regular season with 54 points in 51 games, and after the Hitmen were eliminated from the WHL playoffs, was assigned to the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League (AHL) for their own playoff run. Getzlaf appeared in 10 post-season games for Cincinnati in his professional debut. He recorded one goal and four assists.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 1994–95 NHL lockout, Anderson went to Europe to play hockey. He {{played with}} the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany and the Lukko Rauma of the SM-liiga in Finland, {{as well as the}} Canadian National Team. After the <b>lock-out</b> was resolved, Anderson {{signed as a free agent}} with the St. Louis Blues and played 42 regular season and playoff games combined. At the end of the season, Anderson did not re-sign with the Blues. After playing part of the next season with Augsburger and the National Team again, Anderson signed with the Canucks as a free agent. His reasons for joining the team were because of former Oiler {{teammate}} Esa Tikkanen already playing there, and a desire to finish his career in his hometown. However, Anderson never played for the Canucks as the Oilers picked him up on re-entry waivers. Anderson expressed his disappointment at these turn of events, as he wanted to play in Vancouver instead. He spent 17 games with the Oilers, before being put on waivers that same season. The Blues claimed him, and he spent his last days in the NHL with them. The 1996–97 season saw Anderson return to Europe and play with HC La Chaux-de-Fonds of the National League A in Switzerland and with Bolzano HC of the Alpenliga in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 <b>lock-out.</b> The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E
