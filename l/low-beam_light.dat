2500|$|Current-production burner {{categories}} are D1S, D1R, D2S, D2R, D3S, D3R, D4S, and D4R. The D stands for discharge, {{and the number}} is the type designator. The final letter describes the outer shield. The arc within an HID headlamp bulb generates considerable short-wave ultraviolet (UV) light, {{but none of it}} escapes the bulb, for a UV-absorbing hard glass shield is incorporated around the bulb's arc tube. This is important to prevent degradation of UV-sensitive components and materials in headlamps, such as polycarbonate lenses and reflector hardcoats. [...] "S" [...] burners – D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S – have a plain glass shield and are primarily used in projector-type optics. [...] "R" [...] burners – D1R, D2R, D3R, and D4R – are designed for use in reflector-type headlamp optics. They have an opaque mask covering specific portions of the shield, which facilitates the optical creation of the light/dark boundary (cutoff) near the top of a <b>low-beam</b> <b>light</b> distribution. Automotive HID burners do emit considerable near-UV light, despite the shield.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of discomfort glare on driving behavior. Participants (old and young; U. S. and Europeans) were exposed to a simulated <b>low-beam</b> <b>light</b> source mounted {{on the hood of}} an instrumented vehicle. Participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban, rural, and highway stretches. The results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads. Older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most. The results indicate that the deBoer rating scale, the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare, is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance. Furthermore, the maximum U. S. headlamp intensity (1380 cd per headlamp) appears to be an acceptable upper limit. © 2002, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) The potential glare from rearview mirrors was quantified in simulated encounters {{using data}} on the locations of mirrors and headlamps, and on the photometric output of low-beam headlamps. This was done for two classes of vehicles (passenger cars, and light trucks and vans [LTVs]) in {{the roles of the}} vehicle subject to the glare and the vehicle producing the glare. The results indicate that, in many encounters with glare vehicles to the rear, there will be a substantial disparity in glare, both among vehicles of different classes and among different mirror locations on a single vehicle. The main reason for this is the strong role of mirror height in determining how much a mirror is exposed to the lower, and therefore stronger, portion of a <b>low-beam</b> <b>light</b> pattern. There is substantially greater potential for high glare values on the mirrors of passenger cars versus LTVs. and on the driver-side mirror versus the center rearview mirror on all vehicles. With upward misaim of headlamps, these disparities are increased, as is the absolute level of potential glare. The relatively low potential for glare on the center mirrors of LTVs will often be compounded by the low transmittance of privacy glass on those vehicles. The present results have implications for where glare light should be sensed in order to control automatic anti-glare mirrors. However, specific recommendations should incorporate two additional considerations: (1) the geometry of a given vehicle, including the actual heights of the rearview mirrors and how the potential fields of view of those mirrors are affected by opaque parts of the vehicle, and (2) quantification of the exposure to glare that vehicles experience in actual traffic, including the frequencies at which glare vehicles are encountered in the fields of view of the individual mirrors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{design for}} a {{projector}} headlamp that does not use a screen for <b>low-beam</b> <b>lighting</b> is proposed in this paper. The design not only enhances the light source utilization rate but also {{the elimination of the}} screen element prevents heat accumulation. The surface of the headlamp reflector is partitioned into six zones and, since there are no steps between reflectors, the zones are smoothly connected. A design equation for the reflector that combines varied lengths for both the circumference and optical axis is proposed and utilized for the surface design of each zone. Thus the reflector has the built-in ability to control light distribution in both the circumference and optical axis directions; consequently, it is able to create a very flexible light pattern, and is able to control all light rays to be below the cut-off line. As a result, the proposed projector headlamp can create a light distribution that meets the low-beam requirements of the ECE R 112 standard...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{at night}} is not {{possible}} without traffic lighting. Usually one assumes that <b>low-beam</b> head <b>lighting</b> is adequate for cars {{to take part in}} traffic. However, the night time accident rates are considerably higher than the corresponding day time rates. Improving the lighting, e. g. by public lighting is a road safety measure. The effectiveness of public lighting as an accident countermeasure is usually assessed by means of before-and-after accident studies. One may conclude that good public lighting results in a reduction of some 25 % to 35 % of the night time injury accidents...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} reviews {{various sources}} {{of evidence in}} an effort to evaluate the safety potential of current and improved front fog lamps. Crash data are reviewed to identify the specific safety consequences of fog, and studies of the visual effects of front fog lamps are reviewed. Finally, there is a discussion of the likely effects of current and improved front fog lamps on driver behavior and on overall safety. The conclusions are that there is very little evidence for a safety benefit from current front fog lamps relative to low beams, that there is little reason to expect {{that there would be a}} safety benefit even from improved lamps, and that, in terms of vehicle lighting, the most promising approach to improving safety in fog would be the use of rear fog lamps. In spite of a lack of evidence for safety benefits in fog, fog lamps are a popular optional form of forward lighting that many drivers apparently value. It may be that their main value is more as supplements to <b>low-beam</b> <b>lighting</b> for all conditions, rather than specifically in fog. Given the uncertainties in our present knowledge about how current fog lamps, and potential new fog lamps, affect vision and safety, it would be beneficial to learn more about those issues before adopting new standards for fog lamps, or retiring the current standards. One approach that seems particularly important would be studies that examine the possibly complex reactions of drivers to fog and fog lamps in terms of steering behavior, speed control, and decisions about where and when to risk driving in fog. A second area would be to do a more complete analysis than has yet been done of the crash data concerning fog, perhaps focusing specifically on the issue of how fog affects road-departure crashes...|$|R
25|$|Dirt buildup on {{headlamp}} lenses increases glare {{to other}} road users, even at levels {{too low to}} reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, headlamp lens cleaners are required by UN Regulation 48 on vehicles equipped with <b>low-beam</b> headlamps using <b>light</b> sources that have a reference luminous flux of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them. North America, for example, does not use UN regulations, and FMVSS 108 does not require lens cleaners on any headlamps, though they are permitted.|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} {{the potential benefits of}} applying two embodiments of adaptive lighting to the U. S. and European <b>low-beam</b> patterns: curve <b>lighting</b> that involves shifting the beam horizontally into the curve, and motorway lighting that involves shifting the beam vertically upward. The curve lighting simulations paired 80 -m radius left and right curves with a horizontal beam shift of 15 °, and 240 -m radius curves with a shift of 10 °. The motorway lighting simulations involved upward aim shifts of 0. 25 ° and 0. 5 °. For both curve and motorway lighting, changes in both visibility and glare illuminance were considered. Marketweighted model year 2000 U. S. and European beam patterns were used. We conclude that curve lighting, as simulated here, would substantially improve seeing performance on curves for both types of beams. On left curves (but not on right curves) there would be an increase in disability glare for oncoming traffic. No major discomfort glare problems would be expected. Although the shifted U. S. beams were found to perform slightly better overall than the shifted European beams, the main difference in performance is between the shifted and nominally aimed beams. Motorway lighting, as simulated here, would also substantially improve seeing performance, with the benefits already present at an upward shift of 0. 25 °. Because the increases in glare illuminance would be minor, and because motorways often incorporate median barriers or wide separations between lanes of opposing traffic, we do not expect substantial problems with increased glare. The European beams benefit more from this embodiment of motorway lighting than do the U. S. beams. (This is the case because under nominal aim the European beams provide less visibility illuminance and their vertical gradient is steeper.) Nevertheless, the nominally aimed U. S. beams tend to outperform the European beams shifted upward 0. 25 °...|$|R
