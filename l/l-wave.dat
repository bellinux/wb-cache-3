40|$|We {{recently}} {{proposed that}} a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent cascade produces the bulk energization of electrons to approximately 25 keV in the impulsive phase of solar flares (LaRosa & Moore 1993). In that scenario, (1) the cascading MHD turbulence is fed by shear-unstable Alfvenic outflows from sites of strongly driven reconnection {{in the low}} corona, and (2) the electrons are energized by absorbing the energy that flows down through the cascade. We did not specify the physical mechanism by which the cascading energy is ultimately transferred to the electrons. Here we propose that Fermi acceleration is this mechanism, {{the process by which}} the electrons are energized and by which the cascading MHD turbulence is dissipated. We point out that in the expected cascade MHD fluctuations of scale 1 km can Fermi-accelerate electrons from 0. 1 keV to approximately 25 keV on the subsecond timescales observed in impulsive flares, provided there is sufficient trapping and scattering of electrons in the MHD turbulence. We show that these same fluctuations provide the required trapping; they confine the electrons within the turbulent region until the turbulence eis dissipated. This results in the energization of all of the lectrons in each large-scale (5 x 10 (exp 7) cm) turbulent eddy to 25 keV. The Fermi process also requires efficient scattering so that the pitch-angle distribution of the accelerating electrons remains isotropic. We propose that the electrons undergo resonant scattering by high-frequency plasma R-waves that, as suggested by others (Hamilton & Petrosian 1992), are generated by the reconnection. Ions are not scattered by R-waves. Provided that there is negligible generation of ion-scattering plasma turbulence (e. g., <b>L-waves)</b> by the reconnection or the MHD turbulence, the ions will not Fermi-accelerate and the cascading energy is transferred only to the electrons. We conclude that, given this situation, electron Fermi acceleration can plausibly account for the electron bulk energization in impulsive solar flares...|$|R

40|$|The {{switch from}} serum {{containing}} media to serum-free media in mammalian cell culture {{has become a}} major issue in the last years. Especially for virus vaccine production processes such as influenza, where the infection phase has to be serum-free, even when cultivating the cells in serum containing media, a complete serum-free process has many advantages. From a process engineering point of view the fact that any washing steps as well as addition of fresh media before infection could be omitted, would be a major advantage. Questions that come up are: Do we see any limiting substrates or inhibiting metabolite concentrations during cell growth and virus replication phase? Do the cells attach and grow on microcarriers as good as in serum containing medium?

40|$|Ultrasound {{has long}} been known to be capable of {{measuring}} water level. Zero-degree ultrasound transducers may be used to send an <b>L-wave</b> through the fluid and receive a reflected signal from the fluid/gas interface surface. The level of the fluid is proportional to the sound wave time of flight to traverse the water path. This approach may even be used from outside the fluid containment wall by sending the wave through the tank or pipe bottom. The approach, however, does not work well if there is only a thin layer of fluid consisting of one or two millimeters or even only a few droplets. Surface waves are also known {{to be sensitive to the}} presence or absence of fluid on a surface. A surface wave may be transmitted a significant distance by a transmitting transducer and then received by a similar transducer. If the surface along the wave path is wet with even a few droplets of fluid, the surface wave may be significantly attenuated. Generating and measuring such a surface wave from the opposite side of a tank or pipe containment wall and separating the near-wall surface wave from the far-wall surface wave, however, is more challenging. An approach for producing a surface wave on the opposite side of a steel plate to sense the presence or absence of fluid is discussed. This approach is supported by 2 -D finite element modeling of the measurement configuration and by empirical demonstration of the technique’s sensitivity. This technique was developed for measurement of a very small amount of fluid that may condense within a spent nuclear fuel canister after it cools for several years. Such small amounts of fluid are of concern for initiating stress corrosion cracking over the decades that these nuclear waste containment structures are expected to remain leak-free. Early detection of fluid would provide advance warning of potential cracks in time for mitigation or management of the waste inside that container.

The cultivation is performed in disposable cellbags, allowing faster set-up of upstream processing, leading to less requirements for process validation and low investment costs. The use of a 2 <b>L-Wave</b> bioreactor is described for the production of influenza A virus (equine and human) with MDCK cells growing on microcarriers (Cytodex 1). Cultivations with microcarrier concentrations of 2 g/L and 4 g/L in serum containing GMEM medium (SC) are compared to cultivations in serum-free Ex-Cell MDCK medium (SF). Under completely serum-free conditions washing steps and medium exchange was not needed before infection, but difficulties in cell attachment had to be overcome. Discussion of the metabolic data (glucose, lactate, glutamine, ammonia, glutamate, amino acids) from carbon and amino acid metabolism together with cell numbers and virus titers during cell growth and virus replication phase will allow the analysis of advantages and disadvantages of the presented cultivation conditions. The cell physiology is further characterized via the cell cycle distributions during cultivation and infection. For the wave cultivation maximum virus titers of 2. 3 - 2. 6 log HA units/ 100 µL were reached from infection with a moi of 0. 05, comparable to a stirred tank bioreactor process. However, in SF medium pH dropped to less than pH 6. 8 which resulted in lower HA-titers of 1. 7 log HA units/ 100 µL. For the higher microcarrier concentration medium exchange steps (500 mL) were needed for both media. High cell densities (2. 8 x 106 cells/mL for 2 g/L microcarrier and 4. 7 x 106 cells/mL for 4 g/L microcarrier) in SC medium showed, that the wave bioreactor is a good alternative to stirred tank processes and might be a good and simple production method in case of a pandemic...|$|E
