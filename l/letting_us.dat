500|$|Upon release, Prism {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy à la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always {{done a great job}} of <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> know she's in on the joke of pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same sense of humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello. When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E

[...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E

500|$|A Little More Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The album holds {{a score of}} 50 out of 100 based on 9 critical reviews, according to the music review aggregator Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying, [...] "Lindsay Lohan clearly spells out her ambition in the title to her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) -- she's going to shed the glitzy trappings of her debut, Speak, and dig down deep in her heart, letting feelings flood onto the page". Erlewine also stated that the album [...] "is far from being totally successful, it is an intriguing mash-up of heart and commerce. And it does suggest one thing that Speak never did: Lindsay Lohan may have an artistic vision as a recording artist, which is indeed a huge step forward". Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt said, [...] "like so many pop records today, Personal has {{more than its share}} of filler, and like all teenagers, Lohan contradicts herself. [...] Perhaps Personal 's vulnerability is calculated, and its rawness a misnomer, or maybe she's really opening up. We'll probably never know. Lindsay may no longer be on the edge of 17, but being 19, troubled, and ridiculously famous can cut pretty deep, so props to her for <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> see her bleed — just a little".|$|E

2500|$|In July 1960, Rivers {{suffered}} from a stroke which left him paralysed down his right side. [...] Amber was distraught and during {{the last years of}} his life she worried a lot and became depressed. She wrote to her daughter Anna-Jane, who was in Singapore at the time, [...] "If there is a Confucian temple in K.L., you might make a little offering (if he does like offerings).....I have more faith in him now than in our own deity who seems to be <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> down all round". When Rivers died on 28 March 1966, Amber was determined to keep living as normally as possible. She was visited by New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair who was writing a biography of her father, and twice by interviewers from the BBC. Although she enjoyed discussing politics and world affairs, she felt disillusioned about the socialist hopes of her youth, and supported the Conservatives in the 1970 election.

2500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a positive review. He started {{by noting that}} the episode [...] "shows us how Awake will most likely work as a series".

He stated that [...] "Awake is also showing a great ability to show the impact of Britten's decisions he makes throughout the realities, regardless of how small they are".

Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode an [...] "8.4 out of 10" [...] rating, classifying it as [...] "commendable". Caroline Preece from Den of Geek called it [...] "promising", [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "fortunate", claiming that [...] "the genre elements of Awake have received much more attention than the generic cop show trappings they're wrapped in". Despite this, she called it [...] "strange".|$|E
2500|$|When Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson, {{a former}} {{teammate}} of Paige, Paige {{realized that it}} was for the best that Paige himself was not the first black player in major league baseball. Robinson started in the minors, and had a major league team started him in its minor league affiliate, Paige would have probably seen this as an insult. Paige eventually realized that by integrating baseball in the minor leagues first with Robinson, the white major league players got the chance to [...] "get used to" [...] the idea of playing alongside black players. Understanding that, Paige said in his autobiography that, [...] "Signing Jackie like they did still hurt me deep down. I'd been the guy who'd started all that big talk about <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> in the big time. I’d been the one who'd opened up the major league parks to colored teams. I'd been the one who the white boys wanted to go barnstorming against." [...] Paige, and all other black players, knew that quibbling about the choice of the first black player in the major leagues would do nothing productive, so, despite his inner feelings, Paige said of Robinson, [...] "He's the greatest colored player I've ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|One 1996 NABI {{articulated}} bus, 9619 {{was saved}} and converted into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue service design with three interior roof mounted AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a door facing the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from {{going in and out of}} the front door, entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior roof mounted AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue.

2500|$|The series utilises several {{techniques}} {{from the}} stage and theatre and converting them to the screen. [...] The series frequently breaks the fourth wall (purposely...and, usually, at least once per episode), as well as employing other stylised, cinematic devices such as cutaway scenes shot in a different style {{from the rest of}} the show. For example, in several episodes characters appear to [...] "stop time", interacting with other actors that remain frozen in place, while key members of the cast announce their intentions to us (the audience) or further develop their [...] "con" [...] between themselves and other characters by discussing plans with either each other—or even themselves; while certain members freeze in place, others of the cast are free to move around the set and drink other peoples drinks and pilfer other peoples pockets and the like. [...] This technique serves many purposes—chiefly of which is a stylistic approach to theater, but it can also be said that it is used here as a metaphor for how the main characters of this drama can manipulate their environment at will—as opposed to average individuals who, most of the time, remain oblivious to what is going on around them. Examples of this can be seen in the pilot episode ("The Con Is On"), the first episode of the second series ("Gold Mine") and the second episode of the fourth series ("Signing Up to Wealth"). Other fourth-wall-breaking moments are more subtle – a character might smile directly at the camera as the con begins to take shape, or an actor may make an editorial comment to the viewers, or they might even wink at us...as if we are in on it with them, or they are <b>letting</b> <b>us</b> in on a secret. Some episodes insert fantasy sequences – scenes shot like a Bollywood musical or a silent movie, for example, all well-known cinematic style choices used to elicit emotions or mood from the audience in just a few steps that might, otherwise, take up pages of dialogue in order to accomplish.|$|E
