5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the <b>Local</b> <b>Group,</b> a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo Cluster. And the Virgo Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{has several}} {{satellite}} galaxies and {{is part of}} the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> of galaxies, which is a component of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.|$|E
5|$|An all-yellow bird {{lacking in}} black pigment was {{recorded}} in Wauchope, New South Wales, in December 1996, and it remained {{a part of the}} <b>local</b> <b>group</b> of cockatoos for four years. Birds with part-yellow plumage have been recorded from different areas in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Antlia {{contains}} many faint galaxies, the brightest {{of which is}} NGC 2997 at magnitude 10.6. It is a loosely wound face-on spiral galaxy of type Sc. Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs. Discovered in 1997, the Antlia Dwarf is a 14.8m dwarf spheroidal galaxy that belongs to the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the Milky Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, {{and that it could}} be the largest in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the Andromeda galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our <b>Local</b> <b>Group,</b> which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E

50|$|Friends of the Earth EWNI defines {{itself as}} a {{grassroots}} organisation, with over 200 <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> making it the largest environmental network in the UK. The <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> are largely autonomous, but most work on at least some national campaigns, especially climate change. <b>Local</b> <b>groups</b> have significant power in shaping {{the direction of the}} national organisation, for example by electing a majority of board members.|$|R
40|$|We study locally compact contractive <b>local</b> <b>groups,</b> that is, locally compact <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> with a contractive pseudo-automorphism. We {{prove that}} if such an object is locally connected, {{then it is}} locally {{isomorphic}} to a Lie group. We also prove a related structure theorem for locally compact contractive <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> which are not necessarily locally connected. These results are local analogues of theorems for locally compact contractive groups. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the <b>Local</b> <b>Group,</b> the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the <b>local</b> <b>group</b> of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> has an associated group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922 the {{organization}} {{changed its name}} to Yugnt-bund [...] "Tsukunft" [...] in poyln ('Youth Bund [...] "Tsukunft" [...] in Poland'). By 1924 only seventy active <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> remained in Tsukunft. However, by 1928 it had grown to 171 <b>local</b> <b>groups.</b> At the time of the sixth Tsukunft conference in 1936 (the last before the outbreak of the Second World War), {{the organization}} counted with 184 <b>local</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jong Groen {{has grown}} out of <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> of young Groen members, active since the late eighties and early nineties. These <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> started coordinated action in 1996. In 1998 Jong Groen was officially founded.|$|R
50|$|The network {{consists}} of its <b>Local</b> <b>Groups,</b> which function as independed entities connected to IEM study programmes at universities over Europe. The {{purpose of the}} central level is to support the <b>Local</b> <b>Groups</b> in their activities.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{strategy}} planned by Manekshaw, the army launched several preparatory operations in East Pakistan including training and equipping the Mukti Bahini (a <b>local</b> <b>group</b> of Bengali nationalists). About three brigades of regular Bangladesh troops were trained. As an additional measure, 75,000 guerrillas were trained and equipped with arms and ammunition. These forces {{were used to}} sporadically harass the Pakistani Army stationed in East Pakistan in the lead up to the war.|$|E
5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the wall at the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been {{investigated}} in recent years by at least one <b>local</b> <b>group</b> and a documentary has been made.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the <b>local</b> <b>group</b> of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{national}} groups are further subdivided into <b>local</b> <b>groups.</b> For example, American Mensa has 134 <b>local</b> <b>groups,</b> {{with the largest}} having over 2,000 members and the smallest having fewer than 100. Some members even live in Vatican City.|$|R
50|$|Rising Tide North America has active <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> in Idaho, Utah, the Pacific Northwest Cascadia, Chicago Texas, San Francisco Bay Area and Alaska.

5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the <b>Local</b> <b>Group</b> (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1991, a <b>local</b> <b>group</b> in Albany, New York, {{fought the}} government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission. In addition to that they performed a rap song, which explained {{the plot of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{municipal}} seats was expanded to 13 during the Palestinian municipal elections in 2005. A <b>local</b> <b>group,</b> the Bani Na'im Martyrs list, won the most seats: five. The Al-Aqsa list won three seats, Independent lists also won three and the Hamas-backed Reform and Change list won {{the remaining two}} seats. Gender-wise, females won two seats and males eleven. Issa Hassan al-Khdour, member of the Bani Na'im Martyrs, had the most votes (3,281), and thus became {{the head of the}} municipality. In addition, the number of municipal employees increased to 30.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} bandwidth evaluation of generic tree-based reliable multicast protocols is presented. Our analysis {{is based on}} a realistic system model, including data packet and control packet loss, asynchronous local clocks and imperfect scope-limited <b>local</b> <b>groups.</b> Two of the four considered protocol classes use aggregated acknowledgments (AAKs). With AAKs they are able to provide reliability even in case of node failures. All tree-based protocols provide good scalability for large receiver groups. Relating to protocols with aggregated acknowledgments, the analysis shows only little additional bandwidth overhead and therefore high throughput rates. Finally, we have analyzed the inuence of the branching factor on a protocol's performance. Our results show that the optimal branching factor depends mainly on the probability for receiving messages from other <b>local</b> <b>groups.</b> If <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> are assigned to a separate multicast address, the optimal branching factor is 2. On the other hand, if TTL scoping is used as in RMTP or TMTP and therefore the probability for receiving messages from other <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> is greater than zero, larger <b>local</b> <b>groups</b> provide better performance...|$|R
5|$|The {{unexpected}} November 2008 {{death of}} Rocco Cacchio prompted {{the family to}} sell the business. In November 2009, {{a real estate developer}} offered to purchase the Theatre from the Cacchios, who sought between $400,000 and $500,000 for the property. A private <b>local</b> <b>group,</b> the Rosendale Theatre Collective (RTC), had formed in October 2009 to purchase and preserve the Theatre. The RTC was advised by a committee of 17 people, which included actors Aidan Quinn, David Strathairn, Melissa Leo, Denny Dillon, Mandy Patinkin, radio personality Bruce Morrow, screenwriter Ron Nyswaner, and author Kim Wozencraft.|$|E
5|$|The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of {{apparent}} magnitudes 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form {{the base of}} the triangle and the yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. Iota Trianguli is a notable double star system, and there are three star systems with known planets located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the Triangulum Galaxy or Messier 33—a member of the <b>Local</b> <b>Group.</b> The first quasar ever observed, 3C 48, also lies within Triangulum's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Evanton has {{a number}} of public {{facilities}} including the Diamond Jubilee Hall, Chapel Road, building work started in December 1897, Major Randle Jackson of Swordale House gave 50% of the building costs and the people of Evanton (Parish of Kiltearn) raised the rest. The hall opened on 5 November 1898 with a grand concert over 500 people from the village attending. Diamond Jubilee Hall transferred from Highland Council to the Community on Thursday 29 September 2011. Evanton Sports Centre (opposite Kiltearn Primary School) is the other public facilies in the village which cateres for various sporting activities badminton, basketball, football and tennis. Evanton also has a good sized park at Teandallon. In recent years a <b>local</b> <b>group</b> of parents and young people has worked with Highland Council and various funding bodies to install a multisport area, a BMX track and a Half-Pipe ramp, a new playpark for toddlers was added in 2007 by EYE. In 2008 Highland Council upgraded the original park which was installed in the 1970s.|$|E
