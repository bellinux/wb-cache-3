40|$|The cloning and {{expression}} of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> from different luminescent bacteria including marine and terrestrial species have led to significant advances in {{our knowledge of the}} molecular biology of bacterial bioluminescence. All lux operons have a common gene organization of luxCDAB(F) E, with luxAB coding for luciferase and luxCDE coding for the fatty acid reductase complex responsible for synthesizing fatty aldehydes for the luminescence reaction, whereas significant differences exist in their sequences and properties {{as well as in the}} presence of other <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> (I, R, F, G, and H). Recognition of the regulatory genes as well as diffusible metabolites that control the growth-dependent induction of luminescence (autoinducers) in some species has advanced our understanding of this unique regulatory mechanism in which the autoinducers appear to serve as sensors of the chemical or nutritional environment. The <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> have now been transferred into a variety of different organisms to generate new luminescent species. Naturally dark bacteria containing the luxCDABE and luxAB genes, respectively, are luminescent or emit light on addition of aldehyde. Fusion of the luxAB genes has also allowed the expression of luciferase under a single promoter in eukaryotic systems. The ability to express the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and the ease and sensitivity of the luminescence assay demonstrate the considerable potential of the widespread application of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> as reporters of gene expression and metabolic function...|$|R

For these studies, fusions between the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> and the operons for naphthalene and toluene/xylene degradation were constructed.

40|$|Vibrio fischeri ES 114 is an isolate {{representing}} the specific bacterial light organ symbiont of the squid Euprymna scolopes. An interesting {{feature of this}} strain of V. fischeri {{is that it is}} visibly luminous within the light organ of the squid host but is nonluminous when grown under standard laboratory conditions. Luminescence can be restored in laboratory culture, however, by the addition of autoinducer, a species-specific inducer of the V. fischeri luminescence (<b>lux)</b> <b>genes.</b> Most other isolates of V. fischeri produce autoinducer in sufficient quantities to induce luminescence in laboratory culture. We have cloned an 8. 8 -kb DNA fragment from V. fischeri ES 114 that encodes all of the functions necessary for luminescence in Escherichia coli in the absence of exogenous autoinducer. This DNA contains both of the recognized V. fischeri <b>lux</b> regulatory <b>genes,</b> one of which (luxI) directs E. coli to synthesize autoinducer. The organization of the individual <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> within this DNA fragment appears to be the same as that in the other strains of V. fischeri studied; the restriction map of the V. fischeri ES 114 lux DNA has diverged substantially, however, from the largely conserved maps of V. fischeri MJ 1 and ATCC 7744. Although E. coli containing the V. fischeri ES 114 lux DNA synthesizes considerable amounts of autoinducer, V. fischeri ES 114 synthesizes autoinducer only in small amounts, even when transcription of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes,</b> including luxI, is activated by the addition of exogenous autoinducer. Nonetheless, transconjugants of V. fischeri ES 114 that contain multicopy plasmids bearing the ES 114 <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> synthesize sufficient autoinducer to induce luminescence. These results suggest that V. fischeri ES 11 r does not lack a functional luxl, nor is it deficient in the ability to synthesize metabolic precursors for autoinducer synthesis...|$|R

50|$|The LUX ARRHYTHMO protein encoded by the <b>LUX</b> <b>gene</b> {{participates in}} the {{regulation}} of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock.

LUX likely represses PRR9 via direct binding to a DNA sequence that has not yet been elucidated. PRR9 protein subsequently represses CCA1 and LHY, genes which express components of the Morning Complex.

Biosensors, created by placing a <b>lux</b> <b>gene</b> construct under the control of an inducible promoter, can be used to determine the concentration of specific pollutants. Biosensors are also able to distinguish between pollutants that are bioavailable and those that are inert and unavailable.

40|$|Light {{emission}} {{in marine}} bacteria {{is under the}} control of growth dependent induction. Associated with the induction is the increase in synthesis of the components of the two enzymes which catalyze the light emitting reaction, luciferase and fatty acid reductase. Large DNA fragments from three marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio harveyi and Photobacterium phosphoreum, were isolated from genomic libraries of these strains. Escherichia coli, harboring a recombinant plasmid containing a 16 kbp fragment of V. fischeri DNA, were found to express growth dependent luminescence. E. coli clones harboring analogous sequences of V. harveyi or P. phosphoreum lux DNA only expressed a low constitutive level of light which was dependent on the presence of aldehyde in the growth media. Cell extracts of E. coli expressing the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> from V. fischeri contained a fatty acid reductase activity analogous to the activity first identified in P. phosphoreum. This result showed that the genes for luciferase and fatty acid reductase were linked inV. fischeri. By differential acylation of the fatty acid reductase subunits in extracts of V. fischeri and the E. coli clone, the products of the luxC, luxD and luxE genes of V. fischeri were identified as the reductase, transferase and synthetase components, respectively. In addition, the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> from a fatty acid stimulatible dark mutant of V. harveyi were cloned and it was demonstrated that the luxD gene from this mutant synthesized a non-functional transferase polypeptide. The <b>lux</b> structural <b>genes</b> are coordinately expressed to different levels during induction of luminescence. The lux polypeptides of V. fischeri were shown to be differentially synthesized when expressed {{under the control of}} a T 7 promoter in E. coli. This result indicated that postranscriptional events were regulating the differential expression of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes.</b> A set of overlapping transcripts encoding the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> were shown to be induced during luminescence induction, suggesting that segmental differences in mRNA stability may be related to differential expression of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes.</b> The luxA and luxB genes of V. harveyi encoding the alpha and beta subunits of luciferase, respectively, were fused by site-directed mutagenesis. This fused gene synthesized a monocistronic luxAB mRNA capable of programming the synthesis of a functional single subunit luciferase enzyme in E. coli, in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This fused gene has potential applicability for studying gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems...|$|R
40|$|Past {{work has}} shown that {{transformed}} Escherichia coli is not a suitable vehicle for studying the expression and regulation of the cloned luminescence (<b>lux)</b> <b>genes</b> of Vibrio harveyi. Therefore, {{we have used a}} conjugative system to transfer <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> cloned into E. coli back into V. harveyi, where they can be studied in the parental organism. To do this, lux DNA was inserted into a broad-spectrum vector, pKT 230, cloned in E. coli, and then mobilized into V. harveyi by mating aided by the conjugative plasmid pRK 2013, also contained in E. coli. Transfer of the wild-type luxD gene into the V. harveyi M 17 mutant by this means resulted in complementation of the luxD mutation and full restoration of luminescence in the mutant; expression of transferase activity was induced if DNA upstream of luxC preceded the luxD gene on the plasmid, indicating the presence of a strong inducible promoter. To extend the usefulness of the transfer system, the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was inserted into the pKT 230 vector as a reporter. The promoter upstream of luxC was verified to be cell density regulated and, in addition, glucose repressible. It is suggested that this promoter may be the primary autoregulated promoter of the V. harveyi luminescence system. Strong termination signals on both DNA strands were recognized and are located downstream from luxE at a point complementary to the longest mRNA from the lux operon. Structural <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> transferred back into V. harveyi under control of the luxC promoter are expressed at very high levels in V. harveyi as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis: the gene transfer system is thus useful for expression of proteins as well as for studying the regulation of <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> in their native environment...|$|R

In E. coli and in V. fischeri, the autoinducer-LuxR protein-dependent induction of luxICDABEG transcription (called autoinduction) is {{delayed by}} glucose, whereas it is promoted by iron restriction, but the mechanisms for these effects are not clear. To examine in V. fischeri control of <b>lux</b> <b>gene</b> expression by autoinducer, cAMP, glucose, and iron, lux::Mu dI(lacZ) and hlu deletion mutants of V. fischeri were constructed by conjugation and gene replacement procedures.

We report here that certain strains of Photobacterium leiognathi carry multiple phylogenetically distinct copies of the entire operon that codes for luminescence and riboflavin synthesis genes, luxCDABEG-ribEBHA. Merodiploid lux-rib strains of P. leiognathi were detected during sequence {{analysis of}} luxA. To define the gene content, organization, and sequence of each lux-rib operon, we constructed a fosmid library of genomic DNA from a representative merodiploid strain, lnuch. 13. 1. Sequence analysis of fosmid clones and genomic analysis of lnuch. 13. 1 defined two complete, physically separate, and apparently functional operons, designated lux-rib 1 and lux-rib 2. P. leiognathi strains lelon. 2. 1 and lnuch. 21. 1 were also found to carry lux-rib 1 and lux-rib 2, whereas ATCC 25521 T apparently carries only lux-rib 1. In lnuch. 13. 1, lelon. 2. 1, lnuch. 21. 1, and ATCC 25521 T, lux-rib 1 is flanked upstream by lumQ and putA and downstream by a gene for a hypothetical multidrug efflux pump. In contrast, transposase genes flank lux-rib 2 of lnuch. 13. 1, and the chromosomal location of lux-rib 2 apparently differs in lnuch. 13. 1, lelon. 2. 1, and lnuch. 21. 1. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that lux-rib 1 and lux-rib 2 are more closely related to each other than either one is to the <b>lux</b> and rib <b>genes</b> of other bacterial species, which rules out interspecies lateral gene transfer as the origin of lux-rib 2 in P. leiognathi; lux-rib 2 apparently arose within a previously unsampled or extinct P. leiognathi lineage.

These results show that the luxG gene found immediately downstream of luxE in luminescent marine bacteria is missing at this location in terrestrial bacteria and raise the possibility that the lux operons are at different positions in the genomes of the X. luminescens strains. Four enteric repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) or intergenic repetitive unit (IRU) sequences of 126 bp were identified in the 7. 7 -kbp DNA fragment from the X. luminescens strain isolated from humans, providing the first example of multiple ERIC structures in the same operon including two ERIC structures at the same site.

The luxC gene can be translated into a polypeptide of 55 kDa in excellent agreement with the molecular mass of the reductase polypeptide required for synthesis of the aldehyde substrate for the bioluminescent reaction. Analyses of codon usage showed a high frequency (1. 9 %) of the isoleucine codon, AUA, in the luxC gene compared to that found in Escherichia coli genes (0. 2 %) and its absence in the luxA, B and D genes. The low G/C content of the luxC gene and upstream DNA (38 - 39 %) compared to that found in the other <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> of V. harveyi (45 %) was primarily due to a stretch of 500 nucleotides with only a 24 % G/C content, extending from 200 bp inside lux C to 300 bp upstream. Moreover, an open reading frame did not extend for more than 48 codons between the luxC gene and 600 bp upstream at which point a gene transcribed {{in the opposite direction}} started.

40|$|Abstract Background One of the puzzles in {{bacterial}} quorum sensing is {{understanding how}} an organism integrates the information gained from multiple input signals. The marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri regulates its bioluminescence through a quorum sensing mechanism that receives input from three pheromone signals, including two acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) signals. While {{the role of}} the 3 -oxo-C 6 homoserine lactone (3 OC 6 HSL) signal in activating the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> has been extensively studied and modeled, {{the role of the}} C 8 homoserine lactone (C 8 HSL) is less obvious, as it can either activate luminescence or block its activation. It remains unclear how crosstalk between C 8 HSL and 3 OC 6 HSL affects the information that the bacterium obtains through quorum sensing. Results We have used microfluidic methods to measure the response of individual V. fischeri cells to combinations of C 8 HSL and 3 OC 6 HSL. By measuring the fluorescence of individual V. fischeri cells containing a chromosomal gfp -reporter for the <b>lux</b> <b>genes,</b> we study how combinations of exogenous HSLs affect both the population average and the cell-to-cell variability of lux activation levels. At the level of a population average, the crosstalk between the C 8 HSL and 3 OC 6 HSL inputs is well-described by a competitive inhibition model. At the level of individual cells, the heterogeneity in the lux response depends only on the average degree of activation, so that the noise in the output is not reduced by the presence of the second HSL signal. Overall we find that the mutual information between the signal inputs and the lux output is less than one bit. A nonlinear correlation between fluorescence and bioluminescence outputs from lux leads to different noise properties for these reporters. Conclusions The <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> in V. fischeri do not appear to distinguish between the two HSL inputs, and even with two signal inputs the regulation of lux is extremely noisy. Hence the role of crosstalk from the C 8 HSL input may not be to improve sensing precision, but rather to suppress the sensitivity of the switch {{for as long as possible}} during colony growth. </p...|$|R
40|$|Determination of the 9. 6 kbp {{nucleotide}} sequence of Photobacterium leiognathi DNA containing the genes responsible for luminescence {{showed that the}} order of the <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> was luxCDABEG. In contrast to other Photobacterium species, the luxF gene, located between luxB and luxE, was absent. Three genes immediately downstream of luxG in P. leiognathi have also been identified and shown to correspond in sequence and organization to the second, third, and fourth genes of the riboflavin operon of Bacillus subtilis. In Photobacterium phosphoreum, four genes involved in riboflavin synthesis were also found immediately downstream of luxG and their functions identified. These rib genes code for riboflavin synthetase, 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -butanone 4 -phosphate synthetase, lumazine synthetase, and GTP cyclohydrolase II, respectively. Demonstration of the close linkage of the <b>lux</b> and rib <b>genes</b> in luminescent bacteria is of particular importance for understanding the regulation of light emission as reduced riboflavin 5 $ sp prime$-phosphate along with a fatty aldehyde and oxygen are the substrates for the bacterial luminescent reaction. Synthesis of the fatty aldehyde substrate for the bioluminescent reaction is catalyzed by a lux-specific fatty acid reductase complex coded by the luxCDE genes. For the first time, expression of the Photobacterium <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> in Escherichia coli was strong enough to detect fatty acid reductase (LuxCE) and acyl-CoA reductase (LuxC) activities in extracts. Using site specific mutagenesis, each of the three conserved cysteine residues of P. phosphoreum and P. leiognathi LuxC was converted to a serine residue, and the mutated reductase expressed in a mutant E. coli strain, 43 R. Examination of the properties of the mutant proteins resulted in the identification of Cys 286 in the acylation site of Photobacterium acyl-CoA reductases providing the basis for understanding the transfer and channelling of fatty acyl groups for reduction to fatty aldehyde for the bioluminescent reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new drugs and vaccines directed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is severely impeded by the slow growth of this organism {{and the need to}} work under stringent biosafety conditions. These difficulties pose considerable obstacles when animal studies with M. tuberculosis are performed. We investigated whether a novel approach termed luciferase in vivo expression, using an enhanced luciferase-expressing mycobacterial strain, could be used to evaluate antimycobacterial activity in mice. Vectors that expressed firefly luciferase (<b>lux</b> <b>gene)</b> at high levels in the bacillus Calmette-Gu-erin (BCG) strain of Mycobacterium bovis were constructed for use in vivo. One recombinant BCG reporter strain (rBCG-lux) was selected for high-level expression of the <b>lux</b> <b>gene</b> product and for its ability to replicate in mice. Methodology to monitor in vivo growth of the rBCG-lux reporter strain in mice by direct assay of luciferase luminescence in organ homogenates was developed. The utility of this approach for assessing the in vivo efficacies of antimycobacterial compounds was evaluated. The activities of standard antimycobacterial drugs were directly apparent in mice infected with the rBCG-lux reporter strain by statistically significant reductions in spleen luminescence. In addition, antimycobacterial immunity was also evident in BCG-immunized mice, in which suppression of rBCG-lux growth in comparison with that in naive mice was clearly observed. The use of luciferase in vivo expression for the in vivo evaluation of antimycobacterial activity compared favorably with standard CFU determinations in terms of time, labor, expense, and statistical significance but permitted the evaluation of antimycobacterial drugs and immunity in mice in 7 days or less. Thus, the use of this technology can greatly accelerate the process of evaluation of antibiotics and immunogens in animal models for the slowly growing pathogenic mycobacteria...|$|E
40|$|Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) systems possess several {{benefits}} {{over their}} fluorescent counterparts, including negligible interference from target tissues, {{and are therefore}} prevalently used in cellular and molecular research. Furthermore, a recently created human cell line expressing the bacterial luciferase (<b>lux)</b> <b>gene</b> cassette has resulted in autonomous bioluminescent production without the addition of exogenous substratrate or cell lysis. This BLI’s ability to monitor cellular events on an extended basis and a notable deep tissue detectability may prove particularly applicable for evaluating previously difficult to image systems such as 3 D tissue culturing techniques. These platforms attempt to mimic natural in vivo conditions, facilitating cell-to-cell contact and extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. In this research, several 3 D culture techniques signifying a diverse coverage of available varieties were evaluated, ranging from magneti...|$|E
40|$|Populations of Escherichia coli Z 905 /pPHL 7, a {{transgenic}} microorganism, were heterogenic in {{the expression}} of plasmid genes when adapting to the conditions of water microcosms of various mineralization levels and structure of microbial community. This TM has formed two subpopulations (ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive) in every microcosm. Irrespective of mineralization level of a microcosm, when E. coli Z 905 /pPHL 7 alone was introduced, the ampicillin-resistant subpopulation prevailed, while introduction of the TM together with indigenous bacteria led to {{the dominance of the}} ampicillin-sensitive subpopulation. A high level of <b>lux</b> <b>gene</b> expression maintained longer in the freshwater microcosms than in sterile saline lake water microcosms. A horizontal gene transfer has been revealed between the jointly introduced TM and Micrococcus sp. 9 /pSH 1 in microcosms with the Lake Shira sterile water. c 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Considerable {{emphasis}} is {{being placed on}} quantitative risk assessment modelling {{as a basis for}} regulation of trade in food products. However, for models to be accurate, information about the behaviour of potential pathogens in foods needs to be available. The question is how to obtain this knowledge in a simple and cost effective way. One technique that has great potential is the use of reporter bacteria which have been genetically modified to express a phenotype that can be easily monitored, such as light production in luminescent organisms. Bacteria carrying these (<b>lux)</b> <b>genes</b> can easily be detected using simple luminometers or more sophisticated low light imaging equipment...|$|R
50|$|All bioluminescent {{bacteria}} share {{a common}} <b>gene</b> sequence: the <b>lux</b> operon characterized by the luxCDABE gene organization. LuxAB codes for luciferase while luxCDE codes for a fatty-acid reductase complex {{that is responsible for}} synthesizing aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction. Despite this common gene organization, variations, such as the presence of other <b>lux</b> <b>genes,</b> can be observed among species. Based on similarities in gene content and organization, the lux operon can be organized into the following four distinct types: the Aliivibrio/Shewanella type, the Photobacterium type, theVibrio/Candidatus Photodesmus type, and the Photorhabdus type. While this organization follows the genera classification level for members of Vibrionaceae (Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, and Vibrio), its evolutionary history is not known.|$|R
40|$|The <b>lux</b> <b>genes</b> of Xenorhabdus luminescens, a {{symbiont}} of the nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, were cloned {{and expressed}} in Escherichia coli. The expression of these genes in E. coli was qualitatively {{similar to their}} expression in X. luminescens. The organization of the genes {{is similar to that}} found in the marine luminous bacteria. Hybridization studies with the DNA that codes for the two subunits of luciferase revealed considerable homology among all of the strains of X. luminescens and with the DNA of other species of luminous bacteria, but none with the nonluminous Xenorhabdus species. Gross DNA alterations such as insertions, deletions, or inversions {{do not appear to be}} involved in the generation of dim variants known as secondary forms...|$|R
