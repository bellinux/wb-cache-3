6000|$|He {{made her}} {{more and more}} wonder; she almost {{felt as if he}} were showing her visions while he spoke; and strangely enough, though it was visions that had drawn her on, she hadn't seen them in connection--that is in such {{preliminary}} and necessary connection--with such a face as Lord Mark's, such eyes and such a voice, such a tone and such a manner. He had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself if she were after all going to be afraid; so distinct was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over her. There they were again--yes, certainly: Susie's overture to Mrs. Lowder had been their joke, but they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that continued to sound. Positively, while she sat there, she had the loud rattle in her ears, and she wondered, during these moments, why the others didn't hear it. They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear in her that I speak of was but her own desire to stop it. That dropped, however, as if the alarm itself had ceased; she seemed to have seen in a quick, though tempered glare that there were two courses for her, one to leave London again the first thing in the morning, the other to do nothing at all. Well, she would do nothing at all; she was already doing it; more than that, she had already done it, and her chance was gone. She gave herself up--she had the strangest sense, on the spot, of so deciding; for she had turned a corner before she went on again with Lord Mark. Inexpressive, but intensely significant, he met as no one else could have done the very question she had suddenly put to Mrs. Stringham on the Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she did have, that question had been, for long? [...] "Ah, so possibly not," [...] her neighbour appeared to reply; [...] "therefore, don't you see? I'm the way." [...] It was vivid that he might be, in spite of his absence of flourish; the way being doubtless just in that absence. The handsome girl, whom she didn't lose sight of and who, she felt, kept her also in view--Mrs. Lowder's striking niece would, perhaps, be the way as well, for in her too was the absence of flourish, though she had little else, so far as one could tell, in common with Lord Mark. Yet how indeed could one tell, what did one understand, and of what was one, for that matter, provisionally conscious but of their being somehow together in what they represented? Kate Croy, fine but friendly, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as really with a guess at Lord Mark's effect on her. If she could guess this effect what then did she know about it and in what degree had she felt it herself? Did that represent, as between them, anything particular, and should she have to count with them as duplicating, as intensifying by a mutual intelligence, the relation into which she was sinking? Nothing was so odd as that she should have to recognise so quickly in each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs of a relation; and this anomaly itself, had she had more time to give to it, might well, might almost terribly have suggested to her that her doom was to live fast. It was queerly a question of the short run and the consciousness proportionately crowded.|$|E
40|$|Susan {{packed up}} her laptop, {{stuffing}} {{all of the}} papers she had been reading into the case. She looked around her. The library was nearly empty—typical for a Saturday evening. Still, she was happy to have made so much progress on her paper, which was due the following week. She picked up her belongings and began walking toward {{the steps to the}} main floor of the library. As she descended the staircase, she saw her friend Steve sitting at his usual table. She paused a moment {{at the foot of the}} stairs. Steve looked up from his computer just as Susan walked over to his table. “Hi, Steve, what are you working on? ” she asked quietly as she sat down at his table. “Oh, it’s that research paper we have to write for Seminar, ” he replied, shaking his head. “There is just so much information to write about; I’m having trouble getting it organized. I think I’m getting tired, too. ” He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> “What about you? Have you made much progress on yours?” Susan smiled. “Yes, I think I have a pretty good draft, but I have to let it rest for a while. I’ll work on editing it tomorrow. ” “Yeah, I think it’s time for a break. Want to go check out the basketball game for a bit? ” Steve asked. “That sounds great! A basketball game is just what I need to clear my head. ” The two friends headed off to the field house to see the game. When they got there, the Biology Clu...|$|E

We passed her water bottle back and forth again, and I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, studying it for longer than a comfortable second. She had a placid look, almost like she was finally {{at a place where}} she felt comfortable. I suddenly felt an intense urge to say something to her. I felt the words bubbling up my throat; I wanted her to know that I appreciated her working so hard at ajob she hated for my education, I wanted to tell her that it was okay we didn't say everything to each other, I wanted to tell her I care. At the last minute, when I thought the words were going to spill out of my mouth, I swallowed hard and bit them back. Maybe too much time had passed for my empty words to change anything; maybe it just wasn't worth it. For a few more moments we sat and took all the scenery in, and after a while, my mother suggested we start heading back down the trail to the car. She didn't want me to have to waste my whole day out hiking when I could be doing something fun with friends. I quietly tried to protest, but I just held my tongue. I took one last look out over Rattlesnake Ridge and hoped that maybe my mom and I didn't need to talk things over. I hoped that I didn't need to say all those things for her to know them. Regardless of what I said or didn't say, I thought that our yearly reunions on Rattlesnake meant something. The annual pilgrimage I made for my mother teetering to the ledge looking over the plummeting abyss was a testament of our bond together. I know this feeble gesture isn't the same, but maybe, hopefully, it's enough...|$|E
50|$|Mark calls Kevin, then invites Debbie, Kevin's girlfriend, to his home. Once Debbie shows up, Mark orders her to undress, then {{lie on the}} bed {{and close}} her eyes. After she has done that, he brings Wendy (Leslie Thane) and Louis (David Sanders) over to her. Wendy {{performs}} cunnilingus on Debbie until Mark tells her to open her eyes. Mark has sex with Wendy, while Debbie does Louis, until they switch partners. Excited by the encounter, Debbie calls Lannie and tells her that she is breaking up with Kevin, whom she dismisses as “a boy,” in favor of going steady with “a man” like Mark. Lannie decides that she knows what gets her hot. She hangs up and <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> friend Cheryl lying beside her.|$|R

50|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley and was released on September 30, 2010. It opens with Shontelle walking alone next to an old building before cutting to {{a black and white}} scene of her singing in darkness. A man is shown working out in a gym and footage is shown of Shontelle interacting with him after he is finished. In the next scene, Shontelle can be seen standing in front of bright yellow lights and four other woman, who begin to dance as the song's beat picks up. Between takes of Shontelle singing in front of these women, the man can again be seen working out but this time with a different woman. Next, Shontelle is shown entering the gym and crouching in front of a row of lockers, flailing around as she sings. In the final scene, a fight is taking place between the man and another boxer as the other woman watches. Shontelle is shown {{standing in front of a}} wall that separates the boxing ring from the locker room, and finally steps around the wall entering into plain sight of the man. He <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> concerned, and as he does his opponent punches him in the head, knocking him down.|$|R
60|$|Have we not {{all such}} closets, my jolly friend, {{as well as}} the noble Marquis of Carabas? At night, when all the house is asleep but you, don't you get up and peep into yours? When you in your turn are slumbering, up gets Mrs. Brown from your side, steals downstairs like Amina to her ghoul, clicks open the secret door, and looks into her dark depository. Did she tell you of that little affair with Smith long before she knew you? Psha! who knows any one save himself alone? Who, in showing his house to the closest and dearest, doesn't keep back the key of a closet or two? I think of a lovely reader laying down the page and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{unconscious}} husband, asleep, perhaps, after dinner. Yes, madam, a closet he hath: and you, who pry into everything, shall never have the key of it. I think of some honest Othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage, and stealthily gazing at Desdemona opposite to him, innocently administering sandwiches to their little boy--I am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke, you see--I feel it is growing too dreadful, too serious.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kingdom fidgeted, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> piteously <b>at</b> <b>her</b> niece; Mrs. Kybird, with a {{satisfied}} sniff, sat bolt upright and meditated further assaults. There {{were at least}} a score of things she could have said about her adversary's cap alone: plain, straightforward remarks which would have torn it to shreds. The cap fascinated her, and her fingers itched as she gazed at it. In more congenial surroundings she might have snatched at it, but, being a woman of strong character, she suppressed her natural instincts, and confined herself to more polite methods of attack.|$|R
60|$|While she {{strained}} away, {{she longed}} to move nearer to him. He bent <b>over,</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> knowingly. She glanced down at his left hand as it touched her knee. She sprang up, started noisily and needlessly to wash the dishes. He helped her. He was too lazy to adventure further--and too used to women in his profession. She {{was grateful for the}} impersonality of his talk. It enabled her to gain control. She knew that she had skirted wild thoughts.|$|R

[...] The mother bore without reply the ingratitude and injustice {{that she knew}} were from the child's pain and not from her will. [...] "Where is his letter? Give me his letter!" [...] She nervously twitched it from her mother's hand and ran it into her pocket. She turned away to go and put off her hat, which she still wore from coming in with Lottie; but she stopped and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother.

50|$|The missing {{head was}} reconstructed in the 16th century. The restorer {{decided to have}} the figure <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own buttocks, a choice that gave the Venus its distinctive pose and {{had a significant effect}} on later interpretations of the work. The statue was acquired by the Farnese family and was in the Palazzo Farnese by 1594; it may be the draped Venus described as being in the palace by visitors earlier that century. In the 17th century it is known to have been kept in the palace's Sala dei Filosophi, where it stood surrounded by statues of eighteen ancient philosophers. In 1731 the Farnese estate was inherited by Charles of Bourbon, who moved some of the marbles, including the Venus, across the Tiber River to the Villa Farnesina.|$|R
60|$|Miss Lynde laughed provokingly, and he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and <b>at</b> Jeff, who felt his injury increased by the disadvantage {{this young man}} put him at. Jeff was as correctly dressed; he wore a silk hat of the last shape, and a long frock-coat; he was properly gloved and shod; his clothes fitted him, and were from the best tailor; but at sight of this young man in clothes of the same design he felt ill-dressed. He was in like sort aware of being rudely blocked out physically, and coarsely colored as to his blond tints of hair and eye and cheek. Even the sinister something in the young man's look had distinction, and there was style in the signs of dissipation in his handsome face which Jeff saw with a hunger to outdo him.|$|R
60|$|He went ahead, {{the rustle}} of her white skirt {{following}} him into the shades of the forest, along the path of their usual walk. Though the air lay heavy between straight denuded trunks, the sunlit patches moved on the ground, and raising her eyes Lena saw far above her head the flutter of the leaves, the surface shudder on the mighty limbs extended horizontally in the perfect immobility of patience. Twice Heyst <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Behind the readiness of her answering smile there was a fund of devoted, concentrated passion, burning {{with the hope of}} a more perfect satisfaction. They passed the spot where it was their practice to turn towards the barren summit of the central hill. Heyst held steadily on his way towards the upper limit of the forest. The moment they left its shelter, a breeze enveloped them, and a great cloud, racing over the sun, threw a peculiar sombre tint over everything. Heyst pointed up a precipitous, rugged path clinging {{to the side of the}} hill. It ended in a barricade of felled trees, a primitively conceived obstacle which must have cost much labour to erect at just that spot.|$|R
60|$|As for the palace, it {{shook and}} trembled with the thunders of applause, still {{led by the}} Giant, who couldn't be stopped. The people about him were all struck deaf in the ear nearest him, but the ear-doctors cured them all for nothing, when they got outside, so full of charity was every one. At last, when every one, the Giant and all, were hoarse with shouting, the Prime Minister offered {{his hand to the}} Queen, and led her down from the throne. Then she motioned to the Prince to give her his arm; and {{at the head of the}} procession, he led her to the royal apartments, at the door of which he left her. The {{multitude}} then dispersed, and they spent the rest of that day in putting right the wrongs they had committed, and in making provision for future virtue. When the Queen had taken some refreshment, she put on an every-day crown, and repaired to the audience chamber to receive the visits of the various dignitaries of the kingdom, who came before her, and brought her their keys, and papers, and account-books. Giving each one back his keys, and ordering the papers and accounts to be deposited in a great pile on one side, where she might <b>look</b> <b>over</b> them <b>at</b> <b>her</b> leisure, she reappointed every man to the office he held before, and sent them away rejoicing. Then she called for writing materials and slaves, and commenced writing notes to the Prince. She would write one on gilded vellum, and, folding it, would hand it to the slave next to her, who dipped it in frankincense, and handed it to the next one, who sprinkled it with attar of roses, and passed it to the next, who ran with it as hard as ever he could to the Prince. For in that kingdom it was not considered proper for lovers to visit much.|$|R
