First, three-exchange crossover heuristic operators are used to produce more optimal offsprings for getting more information than with the traditional two-exchange crossover heuristic operators in the improved genetic algorithm. Second, double-path constraints of both minimizing the total <b>path</b> <b>distance</b> of all AGVs and minimizing single <b>path</b> <b>distances</b> of each AGV are exerted, gaining the optimal shortest total <b>path</b> <b>distance.</b> The simulation {{results show that the}} total <b>path</b> <b>distance</b> of all AGVs and the longest single AGV <b>path</b> <b>distance</b> are shortened by using the improved genetic algorithm...|$|R

Our approach (right) achieves much higher quality than bidirectional path-tracing {{on the left}} for the same computation time (~ 8. 4 min) [...] Abstract Bidirectional path tracing (BDPT) with Multiple Importance Sampling {{is one of the}} most versatile unbiased rendering algorithms today. BDPT repeatedly generates sub-paths from the eye and the lights, which are connected for each pixel and then discarded. Unfortunately, many such bidirectional connections turn out to have low contribution to the solution. Our key observation is that we can importance sample connections to an eye sub-path by considering multiple light sub-paths at once and creating connections probabilistically. We do this by storing <b>light</b> <b>paths,</b> and estimating probability mass functions of the discrete set of possible connections to all <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> This has two key advantages: we efficiently create connections with low variance by Monte Carlo sampling, and we reuse <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> across different eye paths. We also introduce a caching scheme by deriving an approximation to sub-path contribution which avoids high-dimensional <b>path</b> <b>distance</b> computations. Our approach builds on caching methods developed in the different context of VPLs. Our Probabilistic Connections for Bidirectional Path Tracing approach raises a major challenge, since reuse results in high variance due to correlation between paths. We analyze the problem of path correlation and derive a conservative upper bound of the variance, with computationally tractable sample weights. We present results of our method which shows significant improvement over previous unbiased global illumination methods, and evaluate our algorithmic choices...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} reconstructing an arbitrarily-shaped specular scene (refractive or mirror-like) cameras from one or more viewpoints. By reducing shape recovery {{to the problem of}} reconstructing individual 3 D <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> that cross the image plane, we obtain three key results. First, we show how to compute the depth map of a specular scene mirror reference point <b>light</b> <b>path</b> from a single viewpoint, when the scene redirects incoming light just once. Second, for scenes where incoming <b>light</b> <b>light</b> <b>path</b> undergoes two refractions or reflections, we show that three viewpoints are sufficient to enable reconstruction in the general case. Third, we show {{that it is impossible to}} recon-camera water reference point struct individual <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> when <b>light</b> is redirected more than twice. Our analysis assumes that, for every point on the image plane, we know at least one 3 D point on its <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> This leads to reconstruction algorithms that rely on an “environment matting ” procedure to establish pixel-to-point correspondences along a <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> Preliminary results for a variety of scenes (mirror, glass, etc) are also presented...|$|R

40|$|As known, it is {{difficult}} for the multiple constraints QoS routing to get a polynomial-time solution. Currently, many heuristic algorithms based on the <b>path</b> <b>distance</b> have been proposed to solve this problem. However, most of them are based on linear <b>path</b> <b>distance,</b> which has the greatest shortcoming, i. e., the search of feasible solutions is inefficient. Besides, they don’t also consider the link sharing interference and load balancing. To improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel QoS routing based on the nonlinear <b>path</b> <b>distance,</b> which is called MIS-LB. At first, the additive and multiplicative QoS metrics are represented by a uniform metric, i. e. the nonlinear <b>path</b> <b>distance.</b> Then, the link sharing and load balancing are integrated into the uniform metric. Based on the shortest-first criterion, MIS-LB can not only find feasible paths as the normal routing algorithm (e. g., Dijkstra algorithm), but also adjust the link sharing, and balance the network loads between multiple feasible paths. So compared with TAMCRA and H_MCOP, the simulation results show that MIS-LB can further improve network performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe study traffic {{grooming}} in {{optical network}} design, where {{the goal is}} to aggregate low-bandwidth traffic streams to utilize efficiently high-bandwidth media such as wavelength channels. More precisely, given traffic demands to be routed in a network, the design problem is to define a collection of <b>light</b> <b>paths</b> such that each demand can follow a sequence of consecutive <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> Each <b>light</b> <b>path</b> has a unit-wavelength bandwidth, and multiple sub-wavelength demands may share a common <b>light</b> <b>path.</b> Traffic must enter and depart from a <b>light</b> <b>path</b> at its two endpoints only. Most previous work on grooming focused on the ring topology and typically involved only uniform bandwidth demands, whereas we deal with more general settings. Two objectives are considered. One is to minimize the total cost of equipment necessary to support the light paths; the other is simply to minimize the number of <b>light</b> <b>paths.</b> Even for the extremely restricted special case of a line topology and traffic demands that request half wavelength bandwidth, we show that both objectives are APX-hard to optimize, which means we cannot approximate the optimum arbitrarily closely. On the other extreme of generality, for arbitrary network topologies and traffic demands that request arbitrary amounts of bandwidth, we show a logarithmic approximation for cost minimization and a 2 -approximation for minimizing <b>light</b> <b>path</b> counts. Furthermore, we discover that the special case of half-wavelength demands has rich combinatorial properties, closely related to graph problems such as cycle packing and pattern matching problems such as interchange distance in strings. We show how to approximate both objectives up to small constant factors in this case, while similarly improving the approximation and hardness of the interchange distance problem as well...|$|R
