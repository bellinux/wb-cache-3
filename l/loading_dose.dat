5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg <b>loading</b> <b>dose</b> followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} {{clinical use}} of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, {{there is a}} low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation {{is all that is}} required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of early an appropriate therapy for the outcomes of severe infections in critically ill patients, there is still little understanding of dose optimization during the most important phase of the treatment, the initial phase. Disease-driven variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics may compromise the therapeutic success of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, dose adjustments that account for these variations are paramount for improving antibiotic use in critically ill patients. Compelling evidence shows significant increases in the Vd of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs in critically ill patients {{as a consequence of}} patient pathology and from clinical interventions. These increases in the Vd can lead to lower than expected plasma concentrations during the first day of therapy, which may result in sub-optimal achievement of antibiotic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic targets, resulting in inappropriate treatment.

40|$|Background: There is a {{link between}} high on-treatment {{platelet}} reactivity (HPR) and adverse vascular events in stroke. This study aimed to compare multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA), in healthy subjects and ischaemic stroke patients, and between patients naive to antiplatelet drugs (AP) and those on regular low dose AP. We also aimed to determine prevalence of HPR at baseline and at 3 – 5 days after <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> of aspirin. Methods: Patients with first ever ischaemic stroke were age and sex-matched to a healthy control group. Three venous blood samples were collected: on admission before any treatment given (baseline); at 24 h and 3 – 5 days after standard treatment. MEA was determined using a Mutliplate® analyser and agonists tested were arachidonic acid (ASPI), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen (COL). Results: Seventy patients (mean age 73 years [SD 13]; 42 men, 28 women) were age and sex-matched to 72 healthy subjects. Thirty-three patients were on antiplatelet drugs (AP) prior to stroke onset and 37 were AP-naive. MEA results for all agonists were significantly increased in AP-naive patients compared to healthy subjects: ADP 98 ± 31 vs 81 ± 24, p < 0. 005; ASPI 117 ± 31 vs 98 ± 27, p < 0. 005; COL 100 ± 25 vs 82 ± 20, p < 0. 005. For patients on long term AP, 33 % (10 / 30) of patients were considered aspirin-resistant. At 3 – 5 days following <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> of aspirin, only 11. 1 % were aspirin resistant based on an ASPI cut-off value of 40 AU*min. Conclusions: Many patients receiving low dose aspirin met the criteria of aspirin resistance but this was much lower at 3 – 5 days following <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> of aspirin.

A total of 10 patients with complex partial seizures following stroke were treated with <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> of CBZ. Motor evoked potential (MEP) was recorded from the thenar eminence (TE) muscles of the unaffected arm. In all patients, we studied rest and active motor threshold (rMT, aMT), MEP amplitude and cortical silent period (CSP).

40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) using 2 different treatment regimens in which patients were assessed clinically at up to 12 -week intervals. DesignRandomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. ParticipantsA total of 331 patients with nAMD. MethodsPatients were treated with 1. 25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab and followed up to 92 weeks. They were randomized into 2 arms. All patients received 3 <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> 4 weeks apart and thereafter were assessed every 12 weeks {{until the end of}} the study. One arm received a routine treatment at each 12 -week assessment, and the other arm was treated at these assessments on an as-needed basis. After the <b>loading</b> <b>doses,</b> patients in either arm who showed signs of disease activity had an additional assessment after 6 weeks and at that visit had top-up treatments on an as-needed basis. Main Outcome MeasuresMean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 92 weeks. ResultsAt 92 weeks, patients who had treatments every 12 weeks had superior BCVA to those treated on an as-needed basis every 12 weeks (P = 0. 008), with the regular treatment arm gaining a mean BCVA of 5. 5 letters and the as-needed treatment arm gaining 0. 6 letters. The regular treatment arm of the study showed significantly improved outcomes with respect to 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -letter changes in BCVA from baseline compared with the as-needed treatment arm, as well as superior reading speed. In patients who completed the study, up to but not including week 92, the mean number of treatments was 10. 8 for the regular treatment arm and 9. 1 for the as-needed treatment arm. ConclusionsA treatment regimen with regular bevacizumab injections every 12 weeks after <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> supplemented with as-needed top-up treatments produced a stable improvement in BCVA from baseline.

40|$|AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} validate an individually planned treatment regimen for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), termed, observe and plan. This regimen was based on the predictability of an individual's need for retreatment and aimed to reduce the clinical burden, while obtaining good functional results. METHODS: This was a prospective case series that included 104 patients (115 eyes) with treatment-naive nAMD. Following three <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> of ranibizumab, monthly observation visits allowed the disease recurrence interval to be determined. The recurrence interval was reduced by 2 weeks to give the retreatment interval for the next three injections. Periodical control visits (at least every 6 months) allowed the effectiveness of the treatment to be assessed and individual intervals adjusted. RESULTS: Mean visual acuity (VA) improved by 8. 7 and 9. 8 letters in months 3 and 12, respectively. The mean number of injections during the 12 -month study was 7. 8, while the mean number of ophthalmic examinations between months 3 and 12 was 3. 97. The mean treatment interval after the <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> was 1. 97 months. CONCLUSIONS: The observe-and-plan regimen significantly improved VA. This was obtained with fewer clinic visits compared with other regimens, which could ease the burden of nAMD treatment.

40|$|Vancomycin is {{currently}} recommended as first-line therapy for many meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recent guidelines have advocated <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> (25 - 30 mg/kg) in critically ill patients {{in order to}} achieve therapeutic concentrations rapidly. However, weight-based <b>loading</b> <b>doses</b> are still not widely practised. A drug use evaluation was performed to improve the appropriateness of vancomycin initial doses in a population of critically ill adults. An educational intervention incorporating a vancomycin dosing protocol was carried out. Data were collected pre and post intervention. Vancomycin exposure [area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ] in the first 24 h was determined using serum concentrations and the Bayesian software TCIWorks. Initial vancomycin doses and exposures were compared between the pre- and post-intervention groups using chi(2) and Mann-Whitney tests. A total of 111 vancomycin courses were analysed in the pre-intervention (n = 80) and post-intervention (n = 31) groups. Patients in the post-intervention group had significantly higher median weight-based initial doses (20. 0 mg/kg vs. 12. 5 mg/kg; P = 400) in the first 24 h of therapy. A vancomycin dosing protocol improved the initial dosing of vancomycin and the proportion of patients who rapidly achieved optimal vancomycin exposures. However, subtherapeutic exposures were still prevalent and may warrant more vigilant promotion of the dosing protocol to ensure that recommended vancomycin doses are used in this population.
