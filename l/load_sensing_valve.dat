50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{increase}} in power brought by the new engine, the rest of the driveline was upgraded to be able to withstand the extra torque. The gearbox and differential were replaced by a version of those fitted to the TR and 2000 series cars, albeit with a close ratio gearset in the gearbox. The brakes were upgraded with new pad materials at the front, and the fitment of larger drums and a <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> at the rear. Other changes over the standard Dolomite included the option of a limited slip differential. The optional overdrive and automatic transmission from the 1850 model were also offered as options on the Sprint. Initial models were only offered in [...] "Mimosa Yellow", although further colours were available from 1974 on.|$|E
50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a brake booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the Braking Assist system.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining wheel cylinder pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on CitroÃ«n vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used). One such vehicle is the Jeep Comanche. The Comanche can automatically send more {{pressure to the}} rear drums {{depending on the size}} of the load.

5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding caliper inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>valve</b> for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} displacement axial piston pump with Pressure compensator and Load Sensing control is coupled to a diesel engine. The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit.

Although both the Hydraulic Component Design library as well as the Planar Mechanical library were used extensively in the process of modelling the entire circuit, some simplifications became necessary and are detailed in the paper. As the modelling phase was developing, a number of field experiments on the vehicle were also performed: these served the purpose of providing reference data to the end of progressing with the validation phase of the AMESim model. Regarding predictive simulation results, these are appropriately consistent with gathered experimental outcomes.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the energy {{dissipation}} related to the hydraulic circuit which controls the remote auxiliary utilities of an agricultural tractor. This circuit is a typical hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> multi actuators system. This kind of system provides a good control strategy but it is characterized by quite high energy dissipation, especially when several actuators are working together under different variable loads. In this paper, the traditional <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> system is modelled using a lumped parameter approach, and theenergy dissipations are evaluated with reference to an actual duty measured on an agricultural tractor. Then, an alternative and more energy saving circuit architecture is introduced, based on an independent metering concept: in this architecture the single spool auxiliary valve is substituted with two electronically controlled proportional valves. The system has been also equipped with an electronically controlled variable pump; twostrategies to control both the pump and the proportional valves are introduced. The energetic analysis is performed also for the alternative architecture using the same duty cycle, with the aim to identify the advantages, disadvantages and the critical features of this system {{with respect to the}} original one. Significant energy saving percentage characterizes the independent metering architecture, which seems to be a promising alternative to the standard hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies an {{innovative}} working hydraulic system design for mobile applications. The {{purpose is to}} improve the energy efficiency and the dynamic characteristics compared to <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems without increasing the complexity or adding additional components. The system analysed in this thesis is referred to as flow control. The fundamental difference compared to <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems is that the pump is controlled based on the operatorâs command signals rather than feedback signals from the loads. This control approach enables higher energy efficiency since the pressure difference between pump and load is given by the system resistance rather than a prescribed pump pressure margin. High power savings are possible especially at medium flow rates. Furthermore, <b>load</b> <b>sensing</b> systems suffer from poor dynamic characteristics since the pump is operated in a closed loop control mode. This might result in an oscillatory behaviour. Flow control systems have no stability issues attached to the load pressure feedback since there is none. Pressure compensators are key components in flow control systems. This thesis addresses the flow matching problem which occurs when using conventional compensators in combination with a flow controlled pump. Flow sharing pressure compensators solve this problem since the pump flow will be distributed between all active functions. A novel control approach where the directional valve is controlled without affecting the cylinder velocity with the objective of optimizing the damping is proposed. In this research, both theoretical studies and practical implementations demonstrate the capability of flow control systems. Experiments show a reduced pump pressure margin and energy saving possibilities in a short loading cycle for a wheel loader application...|$|R
