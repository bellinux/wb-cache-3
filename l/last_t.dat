50|$|Milgrom made a {{fundamental}} {{contribution to the}} theory of repeated games. When players’ actions are hidden and noisy signals about their actions are observable (i.e., in the case of imperfect monitoring), there are two general ways to achieve efficiency. One way is to transfer future payoffs from one player to others. This is a way to punish a potential deviator without reducing the total future payoffs. The classical folk theorem result under imperfect monitoring is built on this idea. The second general method is to delay the release of information. Under the second method, the outcomes of the noisy signals are released in every T periods, and upon the release of information players “review” the signals in the <b>last</b> <b>T</b> periods and decide to push or reward each other. This is now widely known as the “review strategy”, and Milgrom’s paper with D. Abreu and D. Pearce (Abreu, Milgrom and Pearce, 1991) was the first to show the efficiency of review strategy equilibrium in discounted repeated games. The review strategy turns out to be useful when players receive private signals about each other’s actions (the case of private monitoring), and the folk theorem for the private monitoring case is built on the idea of the review strategy.|$|E

30|$|The third {{approach}} {{based on}} signal strength is ATRA.

It is difficult to decide at this point without any further evaluation which technique is the best.|$|E

The outcome of this discussion was a consensus by the working group that the TR did not adequately address issues necessary to ensure interoperability of SSMs across network interfaces. As a result, the group agreed to review these issues in upcoming meetings. This contribution proposes that the work on SSMs be developed into a T 1 Standard that adequately addresses the interoperability of SSMs across network interfaces.
