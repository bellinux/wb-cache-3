40|$|Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate is {{a concept}} from the mining {{industry}} that reflects the ongoing acceptance or approval for a development granted by local stakeholders. It is now being applied by wind farm developers. Using the Australian wind industry as a case study, this discourse analysis examined how Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate is perceived and operationalised, and the key themes in this conceptual and applied discourse. Discourse analysis acknowledges that language choices are not accidental and discourse reflects power relationships. The wind industry representatives interviewed considered power over the Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate was shared with community stakeholders. They recognised the stakeholders' power to delay or prevent projects, but rejected the notion that every stakeholder group should have veto power. Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate is seen by the wind industry through a business-oriented perspective, {{with an emphasis on}} business risk, and they describe the opposition to wind farms by invoking a metaphor of "battle". The industry respondents described Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate as incorporating the values of trust, transparency and participation—which all contribute to creating "authentic" relationships. These findings can inform Social <b>Licence</b> <b>to</b> Operate research, engagement practices, and also encourage reflection by industry representatives on their implicit intentions for stakeholder engagement...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the ‘social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate’ concept reflects increasing awareness by industries {{of the need to}} negotiate with communities and other stakeholders regarding the costs and benefits associated with industrial development. It has been assumed that all industries understand and apply the social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate concept in a similar way, as previous research has tended to adopt a single-industry focus. This article {{is one of the first}} known cross-industry examinations of social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate, comparing the use of this concept in four Australian energy industry contexts: mining, wind, carbon dioxide capture and storage, and geothermal. Semi-structured interviews with industry representatives were conducted to provide a comparison of views on the understanding and application of social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate in these industries. The findings identified shared expectations of increasing stakeholder engagement in energy project development, and a view that a social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate could guide this engagement. Yet the duration of use, the maturity of the industry, and the ways in which the industries related to the concept influenced the understanding and application of this concept. This research provides evidence of how the meaning and application of social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate does vary between industries. Further exploration of community and government perspectives on social <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> operate is recommended in order to broaden the findings of this research. Such research will provide an emerging platform for encouraging discerning use of the concept by industries, and also practitioners who may be engaged across multiple industries...|$|R
