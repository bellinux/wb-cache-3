She created Maudegone Theater also in 2010, an online-video project under which she releases short and musical features directed by herself. Eight videos have been premiered under the moniker as of 2013. During an interview with Keba Robinson, of Hook and Line magazine, Sossamon explained hat her initiative for creating Maudegone was about having [...] "some sort of control and do creative things and feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that I started.

5000|$|Julie Hesmondhalgh, who {{was delighted}} {{to be part of}} the storyline, said 'It was {{completely}} different from anything I've ever done before. I'm not often an action hero, strangely enough, but it was really exciting. It was great. I did feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> special.' Samia Smith returned from maternity leave especially to film the siege episodes. She said 'It didn't feel like we were filming Corrie. Because the set was purposely made it felt like we were on a drama as the pace was a lot slower.' James Fleet, best known for his role in The Vicar Of Dibley, said about playing a villain 'I was born for this stuff. It was a huge privilege to be on Team Corrie. I was humbled by the people I worked with. It was quite easy to tap into my inner criminal!' King commented that it was [...] "fantastic" [...] to have Gray O'Brien back, saying [...] "We enjoy working with each other and we have a set way of working together - reading the scripts three times, rehearsing and doing everything in advance. There was a lot of pressure filming these scenes and he was just brilliant. We had to get it done in the time we had and because of that, we had to lean on each other quite a lot." [...] Hesmondhalgh joked that she had to tell King to stop groping her while she was tied to a chair, commenting [...] "It was absolutely hysterical because Ali's so funny, and she's not at all what she looks like. She looks so polished and like a film star - but she's just a dirty old bitch really! She couldn't stop feeling me up when I was tied up. I was shouting, 'Get off me!' So many people would have paid so much money to be in my position, but I was like, 'Get off me - stop feeling me boobs!'" ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{excerpt from}} Hawthorne's [...] "Starchitecture High" [...] states:"What…the school has taught {{students}} about the architecture {{is not so much}} what they like and dislike about the design, or about what works and what doesn't, but rather the surprising and ultimately thrilling ways in which their high school campus reminds them of themselves and their peers. <b>Like</b> them <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of a proud outcast: gangly, dreamy, and beautiful at the same time, trying to make its way in a culture that prizes familiarity over strangeness and sameness over individuality. For a teenager who dreams of becoming an artist or a dancer, and has maybe not always found that ambition popular or easily understood by others in his family or neighborhood, what kind of campus could be better?" ...|$|R

500|$|Tolkien {{begins by}} noting that the {{original}} book has almost been lost under the extensive [...] "'literature'" [...] (his inverted commas) on the subject. He explains that Beowulf had mainly been quarried as [...] "an historical document", and {{that most of the}} praise and censure of the poem was due to beliefs that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "something that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not – for example, primitive, pagan, Teutonic, an allegory (political or mythical), or most often, an epic;" [...] or because the scholar would have <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else, such as [...] "a heathen heroic lay, a history of Sweden, a manual of Germanic antiquities, or a Nordic Summa Theologica." [...] Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall.

5000|$|The {{album was}} also the centre of controversy, {{particularly}} in the United States, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Eddie controlling Satan like a puppet, while Satan is also controlling a smaller Eddie. Smallwood explains that the concept was to ask [...] "who's the really evil one here? Who's manipulating who?" [...] According to Riggs this {{was inspired by a}} Doctor Strange comic book [...] "which had some big villain with Doctor Strange dangling on some strings <b>like</b> a puppet, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I read as a child back in the 1960s I think", while the images of hell were [...] "taken from my knowledge of medieval European Christian art which was full of such scenes." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Courtney Love for Dazed magazine, Del Rey revealed that [...] "Lust for Life" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album and got an assist from Max Martin for it. She traveled to his Sweden compound where he encouraged her to turn what had previously been a verse into the song's chorus. Upon returning to her main producer Rick Nowels' place, she realized the one extra element she needed for the track. That's when she felt she [...] "really wanted" [...] to hear Canadian singer The Weeknd sing the chorus, so he came down and [...] "rewrote {{a little bit of}} it," [...] but then she stated she felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> missing <b>something,</b> so she went back for a fourth time and layered it up with harmonies. [...] "Lust for Life" [...] was first registered at ASCAP under Del Rey's name during March 2017, with The Weeknd credited as a co-writer under his real name Abel Tesfaye. Later, Del Rey teased the collaboration on March 26, 2017 via Twitter, with Tesfaye's signature logo. The logo, which is also the logo of his record label XO, was also included in the Lust for Life album trailer.|$|R

50|$|Disciplining {{children}} {{is important to}} create a safe and fun learning environment. Discipline requires knowledge, skill, sensitivity and self-confidence; <b>like</b> any art, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that one will acquire through training and experience; it becomes easier with practice. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. Discipline can also have {{a positive influence on}} both the individual and classroom environment. Utilizing disciplinary actions can be an opportunity to reflect and learn about consequences, instill collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques. Promoting positive correction of questionable behavior within the classroom dynamic, as opposed to out-of-class punishments like detention, suspension, or expulsion, can encourage learning and discourage future misbehavior. Learning to own one’s bad behavior can also contribute to positive growth in social emotional learning.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{recorded}} Quirk Out at Rockfield Studios, Monmouthshire with prolific post-punk producer Hugh Jones in July 1986. Lynch {{recalled that}} Jones {{had been asked}} to look at a band called the Wolfhounds that Stump were supporting, but Jones said to his manager that he wanted to produce Stump. As a result, Jones' manager took the band on and signed them a management deal. The band then [...] "went away" [...] and recorded demos, and Jones began [...] "touting it around" [...] to record companies, but other labels were not interested, so Jones decided to [...] "throw the money in" [...] himself. The album was recorded on Jones' budget of £10,000. Jones recalled that he [...] "really loved Stump; they just didn’t sound like anything else so we financed Quirk Out and we went down to Rockfield Studios and recorded it down there. We weren’t really expecting hit singles or anything like that. You have to remember that Quirk Out was done very, very cheaply and we were using Rockfield which was sort of like my home base at that time. So at that point there were no major record companies in sight or anything <b>like</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that we did independently." [...] Nonetheless, the album's production was seen by some as unusual, as the booklet write-up for the Glastonbury Festival of 1987 said the production on the album was [...] "expensive by independent standards." ...|$|R
6000|$|This communication, let me, {{without a}} shred of coyness, {{instantly}} declare, much interests and engages me--to the degree even that I think I find myself prepared to post {{you on the spot}} a round, or a square, Rather! I won't go through any simpering as to the goodness of your [...] "having thought of me"--nor even through any frank gaping (though there might be, for my admiration and awe, plenty of that!) over the wonder of your multiform activity and dauntlessly universal life. Basta that I will write anything in life that anyone asks me in decency--and a fortiori that you so gracefully ask. I can only feel <b>it</b> to <b>be</b> enough for me that you have a hand in the affair, that you are giving a book yourself and engaging yourself otherwise, and that I am in short in your company. What I understand is that my little novel shall be of fifty thousand (50,000) words, neither more, I take it, nor less; and that I shall receive the sum mentioned in the prospectus [...] "down," [...] in advance of royalties, on such delivery.

But that I shall be clear about when the work is done; I only glance at this now as probable.) It so happens that I can get at the book, I think, almost immediately and do it within the next three or four months.

60|$|These are {{wonderful}} truths, {{the more so}} because the zoologist finds them to be of universal application. The investigation of a polype, of a snail, of a fish, of a horse, or of a man, would have led us, though by a less easy path, perhaps, to exactly the same point. Unity of plan everywhere lies hidden under the mask of diversity of structure--the complex is everywhere evolved out of the simple. Every animal has at first {{the form of an}} egg, and every animal and every organic part, in reaching its adult state, passes through conditions common to other animals and other adult parts; and this leads me to another point. I have hitherto spoken as if the lobster were alone in the world, but, as I need hardly remind you, there are myriads of other animal organisms. Of these, some, such as men, horses, birds, fishes, snails, slugs, oysters, corals, and sponges, are not in the least like the lobster. But other animals, though they may differ a good deal from the lobster, are yet either very <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> or <b>are</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> that <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> The cray fish, the rock lobster, and the prawn, and the shrimp, for example, however different, are yet so like lobsters, that a child would group them as of the lobster kind, in contradistinction to snails and slugs; and these last again would form a kind by themselves, in contradistinction to cows, horses, and sheep, the cattle kind.|$|R
