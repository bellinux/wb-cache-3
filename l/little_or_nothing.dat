5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} {{far away from the}} imperial capital, {{but one of the most}} important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing.</b> Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> could be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E

30|$|Thus, in {{alliances with}} {{symmetrical}} power relation, information sharing has only <b>little</b> <b>or</b> even <b>nothing</b> {{to add to}} the potentials created via joint action in PM, and thus, joint action will be substantially more effective in mitigating conflict in this context.|$|R
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> to do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Without fully {{endorsing}} the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published {{versions of the}} ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously {{been published in the}} second, small print-run, edition of An Adventure in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.|$|E

50|$|Caelius {{was found}} not guilty, and after the trial <b>little</b> <b>or</b> {{possibly}} <b>nothing</b> is heard of Clodia, and the date of her death is uncertain. Cicero refers to a Clodia in 44 BC, {{but the lack of}} female personal names (praenomina) in Latin makes it difficult to specify whether this refers to the infamous Clodia or a sister.|$|R

5|$|Six {{months after}} The Inquirer was founded, with {{competition}} from eight established daily newspapers, {{lack of funds}} forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette associate editor Jesper Harding. After Harding acquired The Pennsylvania Inquirer, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, The Inquirer moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The Inquirer again was moved, this time to its own building {{at the corner of}} Third Street and Carter's Alley. Harding expanded The Inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> for the rights of foreign authors' works.|$|E
25|$|During 19th-century {{epidemics}} {{of diseases}} such as cholera, death rates in homeopathic hospitals were often lower than in conventional hospitals, where the treatments used {{at the time were}} often harmful and did <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> to combat the diseases.|$|E

His abduction fueled more opposition against the Japanese government's plans to send JSDF forces to Iraqi soil, believing that their presence would make them a terror target.|$|E
50|$|Between 1973 and 2012, Jong-il {{accumulated}} {{no fewer}} than 54 titles, most of which had <b>little</b> to do <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> at all with real political or military accomplishments since he never had any military training.|$|R
60|$|J. M.—It {{is true that}} Germany has nothing, save Goethe, Schiller, Heine, that’s {{her whole}} list.

3000|$|... “Rare disease” {{is merely}} a {{statistical}} classification (see Huyard 2009 a {{on the history of}} the concept of “rare diseases”). Within the EU, a rare disease is defined as one by which no more than 5 in 10, 000 persons are affected. In principle, these diseases have <b>little</b> <b>or</b> even <b>nothing</b> in common with respect to etiology, symptoms, or therapies, although many of them, yet not all, have a genetic origin, appear during childhood, and take a lethal course. However, the term “rare disease” should not hide the fact that, with an estimated number of 5, 000 – 7, 000 rare diseases, about 30 million people are affected only in the EU.|$|R

50|$|The {{window into}} Margaret O’Neal’s life during the {{interview}} was very small and mentioned <b>little</b> <b>or</b> said <b>nothing</b> about her childhood, siblings or family, her nine years of schooling, and lastly the crops that the McNair’s or the O’Neal’s grew and cultivated despite that being a constant throughout her whole life. With only one interview being conducted by the Federal Writer’s Project, only a small bit of information about her life was gathered, bringing to question how effective the Federal Writers' Project was in completing the goal of showing how life was for many people during the Great Depression and New Deal era, as more questions become raised from the blind spots within each interview.|$|R

60|$|<b>Little,</b> <b>or</b> even <b>nothing,</b> of {{fighting}} there is: why should there be? The military operations are a dead-lock, and require no word. Thirty thousand, {{half of the}} Prussian Force, lie, vigilant as lynxes, blockading here; other half, 32,000, under Marshal Keith, have marched forward to Aussig, to Nollendorf on the Bohemian frontier, to clear the ways, and look into any Austrian motion thereabouts,--with whom, with some Pandour detachment of whom, Duke Ferdinand, leading the vanguard, has had a little brush among the Hills; smiting them home again, in his usual creditable way (September 13th); and taking Camp at Peterswalde, he and others of the Force, that night.

25|$|A {{charitable}} {{view of the}} Japanese {{system of}} divorce is that it favors a ‘clean break’ so that the divorced parties have <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> {{more to do with}} each other after the divorce. A less generous interpretation is that it permits the spouse with economic assets (usually the husband) to keep most of his assets, avoid payment of alimony and provide little or no child support, but the price he pays is the abandonment of any relationship with his children, while the other spouse is punished economically, but keeps her children.|$|E
25|$|An {{inventory}} of the coastal towers produced by the Genoese authorities in 1617 lists 86 towers. Two additional towers were constructed before the building program was abandoned.

Of these 88 towers, <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> survives for twenty of them.

They have been named for mythological figures, including Titans in general (titanium) and Prometheus in particular (promethium); Roman and Greek gods (uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) and their descendents (tantalum for Tantalus, a son of Zeus, and niobium for Niobe, a daughter of Tantalus); and Norse deities (vanadium for the goddess Vanadis and thorium for the god Thor).|$|E
40|$|Self-insurance {{is often}} {{permitted}} {{as a means}} of satisfying regulatory requirements imposed on operators to evidence capability to bear their environmental liabilities. Its hallmark is that operators or their parent companies prove their financial strength rather than dedicate specific assets/funds to cover these costs. This article examines whether self-insurance can ensure that adequate funds are available when required. It is argued that if a self-insuring operator and/or its parent enter into liquidation then the protection afforded to their creditors under insolvency law may result in an environmental regulator recovering <b>little</b> <b>or,</b> indeed, <b>nothing</b> in respect of the costs associated with any requisite preventive, remedial or restorative works. This protection includes a liquidator’s ability to disclaim ‘onerous property’ and challenge certain payments made to the regulator as a voidable ‘preference’. Whilst commentators have highlighted a general insolvency risk with the measure, neither its extent nor precise source has been appreciated fully...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out in which way the {{education}} about climate in school is taught and how the students experience the world situation today. There are various theories about the greenhouse effect and its origin and these theories should be addressed to ensure that students get a broader understanding of how climate change occurs. This includes the natural phenomena and also the human impact on climate change. Students in school are a source of concern that only human are the cause of global warming, and know <b>little</b> <b>or</b> almost <b>nothing</b> about the natural phenomena of global warming.   I will mention what has emphasized in the national steering documents in the case of environmental education at school.
