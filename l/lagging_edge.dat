5000|$|Increased HA {{production}} by cancer cells increases invasive capacity. HA's interaction with CD44 activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an important molecule {{in the process}} of cell motility by coordinating dissolution of the focal adhesions at {{the leading edge of the}} cell and formation at the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge.</b> [...] Another signaling pathway activated by HA's interaction with CD44 is the Akt pathway which leads to expression of osteopontin, a molecule which can stimulate cell migration. The HA produced by HAS also has been suggested to protect the cancer cell from physical damage while in the circulatory or lymphatic systems. This role of HA has been shown in other cell types, but has not yet been researched in cancer cells. [...] The HA produced by HAS up-regulates secretion of various MMPs, proteolytic enzymes that are involved in many stages of the metastatic cascade. [...] Research has shown that the different HASs may impact the metastatic steps in different ways based on the molecular weight and amount of HA they produce.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of integrins in epithelial cell biology surprisingly {{little is known about}} their regulation. It is known that they form hemidesmosomes (HDs), are actively involved in cell contacts during cell migration/invasion, and are key signaling molecules for survival and growth. However, there has been a distinct lack of understanding about what controls the dynamic integrin localization during cell activation and movement. Growth factors, such as EGF, are elevated during wound healing and carcinoma invasion leading to phosphorylation of ITGβ 4 and the disassembly of the HD and mobilization of ITGβ 4 to actin-rich protrusions. More recently the phosphorylation of a novel site on ITGβ 4 (S 1424) was found to be distinctly enriched on the trailing edge of migrating cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the dissociation of ITGβ 4 from HDs. Arrestin family member proteins are involved in the regulation of cell surface proteins and vesicular trafficking. In this study, we find that over-expression of arrestin family member ARRDC 3 causes internalization and proteosome-dependent degradation of ITGβ 4, while decreased levels of ARRDC 3 stabilizes ITGβ 4 levels. These results lead us to a new mechanism of ITGβ 4 internalization, trafficking and degradation. During migration, ARRDC 3 co-localizes with ITGβ 4 on the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge</b> of cells but has a distinct distribution on the leading edge of cells. Additional immuno co-precipitation experiments demonstrate that ARRDC 3 preferentially binds to ITGβ 4 when phosphorylated on S 1424. Using confocal microscopy, we show that the expression pattern of ARRDC 3 on the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge</b> of a migrating cell is identical to the expression pattern of ITGβ 4 -pS 1424. We demonstrate that ARRDC 3 expression represses cell proliferation, migration, invasion, growth in soft agar and tumorigenicity. Collectively, our data reveals that ARRDC 3 is a negative regulator of β 4 integrin and demonstrates how this new pathway impacts biologic processes in stem cell and cancer biology. Additionally, as ARRDC 3 is highly expressed in several tissues and conserved across species, our results are likely to be translated to other models...|$|E
40|$|Phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5) -triphosphate (PtdInsP 3) mediates {{intracellular}} signaling for directional sensing and pseudopod extension at {{the leading}} edge of migrating cells during chemotaxis. How this PtdInsP 3 signal is translated into remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, using a proteomics approach, we identified multiple PtdInsP 3 -binding proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum, including five pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins. Two of these, the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B and the PH domain-containing protein PhdA, were previously characterized as PtdInsP 3 -binding proteins. In addition, PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI were identified as previously undescribed PH domain-containing proteins. Specific PtdInsP 3 interactions with PhdB, PhdG, and PhdI were confirmed using an in vitro lipid-binding assay. In cells, PhdI associated with the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on both the PH domain and PtdInsP 3. Consistent with this finding, PhdI located to {{the leading edge}} in migrating cells. In contrast, PhdG was found in the cytosol in WT cells. However, when PtdInsP 3 was overproduced in pten− cells, PhdG located to the plasma membrane, suggesting its weak affinity for PtdInsP 3. PhdB was found to bind to the plasma membrane via both PtdInsP 3 -dependent and -independent mechanisms. The PtdInsP 3 -independent interaction was mediated by the middle domain, independent of the PH domain. In migrating cells, the majority of PhdB was found at the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge.</b> Finally, we deleted the genes encoding PhdB and PhdG and demonstrated that both proteins are required for efficient chemotaxis. Thus, this study advances our understanding of the PtdInsP 3 -mediated signaling mechanisms that control directed cell migration in chemotaxis...|$|E

If Rτ(A,B) includes τ= 0, the edge is represented as undirected. If Rτ(A,B) includes only positive <b>lags,</b> the <b>edge</b> is directed from A to B meaning that A’s signal precedes B’s by the given lag range; otherwise, we associate the opposite direction with that edge.

40|$|The thesis mainly {{focuses on}} {{structural}} study of proteins in membrane attack complex- perforin/cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (MACPF/CDC) superfamily, in particular, Astrotactins from human and perforin-like proteins (PLPs) from Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Both of these subfamily proteins are implicated in human diseases and structurally uncharacterised before. Astrotactins (ASTNs) {{have been shown}} to {{play a crucial role in}} enabling neural migration along glial fibres. While ASTN 1 directly forms contacts between the neuron and the fibre, ASTN 2 is responsible for extracting ASTN 1 from contacts at the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge</b> of the cell and recycling them to the leading edge. ASTN 2 is associated with endosomes, with the majority of its structure (at the C-terminus) projecting into their lumen, anchored by a pair of transmembrane â-helices. Here we present the structure of this "endodomain" region of ASTN 2, and find it to consist of a unique combination of polypeptide folds comprising a membrane attack com- plex/perforin (MACPF) domain, an EGF-like domain, a previously-unobserved form of fibronectin type III (Fn(III)) domain and an annexin-like domain. Taken together, the structural characterisation provides a framework for better understanding the mechanism of the ASTNs and related proteins in neural and other forms of vertebrate development. Perforin-like proteins from Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (TgPLP 1 and PPLPs) are critical for normal life cycle progression of these parasites, and knockout out of any of them results in significant defects in their life cycle, entrapping the parasites within the host cells and thus limiting their ability to egress. Here we present the crystal structures of Tg PLP 1 MACPF domain and C-terminal domain at 2. 0 Ã and 1. 1 Ã, respectively. We also presents the MACPF domain assembled in helical and hexameric ring form, which indicates the possibility of pore-formation by 6 subunits. This is the first structure of perforin-like protein from Apicomplexan parasites and provides a structural basis to elucidate the function of PLPs in toxoplasmosis and malaria pathogenesis. The final section is a continuation of a previous study in our lab on pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of kindlins. We determined the crystal structure of kindlin- 3 PH domain and characterised its lipid and membrane binding properties. Using nanodiscs incorporated with different lipids as model membrane system to study the interaction between inositol phosphate lipids and kindlin- 3 PH domain, together ï¿¼with molecular dynamic simulation studies (in collaboration with Mark Sansomâs group, University of Oxford), we propose that a subset of PH domains is able to bind to multiple inositol phosphates simultaneously and so via an avidity effect have its interaction with target membranes strengthened. </p...|$|E
40|$|The voltage-sensing {{phosphatase}} (VSP) {{has changed}} {{the way we think about}} both cellular electrical activity and PIPs (phosphatidylinositol phosphates). Originally discovered in 1999 (Chen et al., 1999), these proteins were not recognized as electrically-controlled enzymes until 2005 (Murata et al., 2005). They constitute the first, and so far the only, example of an enzyme linking electrical signals at the plasma membrane to the catalysis of PIPs (Murata et al., 2005), a ubiquitous family of intracellular signaling molecules (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006; Balla, 2013). Before the discovery of VSP, there were no known direct links between the two. Textbook examples would represent this connection with arrows, alluding to indirect or “yet-to-be-defined” signaling pathways. Now we know that VSP serves as a direct connection between the electrical nature of the cell and PIPs, lipid second messengers that are critical for cell survival. However, many questions remain unanswered regarding VSP and its electrical regulation of cellular processes. With the discovery of VSP, the membrane potential must now be considered when studying PIP regulators. PIPs are involved in almost all aspects of cell physiology from survival, proliferation, and migration to pre-programed cell death (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006; Logothetis et al., 2010; Koch and Holt, 2012; Balla, 2013). For example, PIP concentrations are actively polarized in migrating cells with phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PI(3, 4, 5) P 3) on the leading edge and phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P 2) on the <b>lagging</b> <b>edge</b> (Leslie et al., 2008). These gradients in the concentration of PIPs are necessary for activation of Rac and Rho leading to cell motion. PIPs are also crucial for cell growth: PI(3, 4, 5) P 3 activates the mTor cascade leading to increased protein, membrane, and nucleic acid production (Dibble and Manning, 2013). Many human diseases have been associated with altered homeostasis of PIPs, including cancer, developmental disorders, and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (Simpson and Parsons, 2001; McCrea and De Camilli, 2009; Hakim et al., 2012). Though the physiological relevance of VSP is not yet defined, it is still crucial to human health to understand how PIPs are regulated and that now includes VSP. All cells have an asymmetric composition of ions across their plasma membrane, which, combined with selective permeabilities for these ions, results in a difference in the electrical potential across their plasma membrane. This difference, called the membrane potential, constitutes a form of cell signaling and a source of energy, both driving many biological processes. This electrical potential difference powers neuronal excitability as well as more general processes like proliferation, migration, and development (Levin, 2007; Sundelacruz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2011). Regulation by the membrane potential has long been the sole purview of ion channels and transporters and that has influenced what questions are asked regarding the changing potential. With our new knowledge of VSP, the changing membrane potential can directly signal the cell by modulating mTor and cell growth pathways, leading to abnormal growth or the M-current in sympathetic ganglion, leading to hyperexcitability. The articles in this Special Topic highlight several features of VSP including its unique activation, its similarities to other enzymes and its use as a versatile tool to study other proteins. In the review article by Hobiger and Friedrich (2015, p. 20), the authors compare the structural similarities and differences between the broader family of protein tyrosine phosphatases and one of its newest members, VSP. They suggest a catalytic mechanism based on this comparison. Castle et al. (2015, p. 63) investigate the activation mechanism of VSP by probing the C 2 domain, the C-terminal domain of VSP that has been largely unrecognized before the recent crystal structures showed a direct contribution of the C 2 residue Y 522 into the active site. The work by Mavrantoni et al. (2015, p. 68) explores the techniques that are used to test VSP and address some of their limitations including the need for expensive electrophysiology equipment as well as the limitations of using channels as functional reporters. They take their methods and apply them to a chimera between the Ciona intestinalis VSP and human PTEN and show how the chimera allows for the investigation of PTEN using standard techniques but with the advantage of regulated activation, voltage. Beyond the molecular mechanism underlying VSP activity, Mori et al. (2015, p. 22) review the use of VSP as a relatively simple tool for manipulating PI(4, 5) P 2 concentrations in cells. They have used VSP to study the PI(4, 5) P 2 regulation of transient receptor potential canonical channels involved in receptor-operated calcium currents. Along the same lines, Rjasanow et al. (2015, p. 127) use VSP as a tool that gives them precise control over the PI(4, 5) P 2 concentrations in the membrane. These authors compared the relative PIP affinities between several ion channels. They also point out an important limitation that the channels must already have a known specificity for a particular PIP because VSP does not destroy PIPs in contrast to phospholipase C; instead, it generates multiple PIPs. All together, these articles underscore the features of VSP and expand our understanding of its function and utility. Though VSP remains relatively unknown to many, this nascent field has shown fast initial growth. The unique nature of these enzymes has inspired many to investigate their properties as well as take advantage of them. Many questions remain unanswered regarding VSP such as how the voltage sensor couples to the enzyme and whether the phosphatase domain is brought to the membrane for activation or whether a conformational change within the active site determines activation. We look forward to the studies that will address these and the many other questions that persist in this exciting field...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} model to infer from live cell images of actin {{filament}} (F-actin) flow intracellular force variations during protrusion-retraction cycles of epithelial cells in a wound healing response. To establish mechanistic relations between force development and cytoskeleton dynamics, force fluctuations were correlated with fluctuations in F-actin turnover, flow, and F-actin-vinculin coupling. Our analyses suggest that force transmission at focal adhesions (FA) requires binding of vinculin to F-actin and integrin (indirectly), which is modulated at the vinculin-integrin but not the vinculin-F-actin interface. Force transmission at FAs is co-localized in space and synchronized in time with transient increases of the boundary force at the cell edge. Surprisingly, the maxima in adhesion and boundary forces <b>lag</b> maximal <b>edge</b> advancement by ∼ 40 s. Maximal F-actin assembly is observed ∼ 20 s after maximal edge advancement.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death and illness in the United States and worldwide. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) {{migration}} and secretion of extracellular matrix materials are key components of adverse vascular remodeling which is associated with this disease pathology. Cell attachment mediates adherent cell migration and is largely dependent upon integrin binding, matrix metalloprotease balance, and extracellular matrix expression at the leading and <b>lagging</b> <b>edges</b> of migrating cells. Intracellular Smad 3 is an important signaling factor that is associated with pro-growth phenotypes and that is involved in a number of vascular growth disorders including atherosclerosis and fibrosis. Because uncontrolled SMC migration and deposition of extracellular matrix are critical components of CVD, the broad purpose of this project is to determine Smad 3 as a possible key mediator of growth factor-stimulated vascular fibrosis. Early findings from our lab using the pharmacologic cyclic GMP agonist BAY 41 - 2272 (BAY) have led us to theorize a promising mechanism through which pathologic vascular SMC growth can be regulated. Preliminary data in rat primary vascular SMCs suggest that BAY not only decreases migration but also decreases total and active Smad 3 expression. In light of these findings, in the current proposal my hypothesis is that BAY induces vascular protection in the form of preventing cell migration and by altering matrix balance and that this occurs in a Smad 3 -dependent fashion. To test this hypothesis, I used two genetic approaches to overexpress or knock-down intracellular Smad 3 and then performed cell migration assays and attachment assays in the presence or absence of BAY. Using this approach, we will be able to accurately determine if Smad 3 is responsible for our observed BAY-mediated growth protective phenotype. Results displayed that overexpression of Smad 3 significantly enhanced vascular SMC attachment after 1 hour and does not appear to impact cell diameter as a function of cell attachment. Early wound healing experiments failed to produce net positive percent recoveries after 10 hours, so further investigation of the role Smad 3 plays in BAY 41 -mediated cell migration protection is necessary. Conclusions from this study will increase our understanding of vascular biology and will also highlight a potential therapeutic target in Smad 3 as capable of combating cell migration as a foundation of CVD...|$|R

For instance, in the case of the first triangle of Fig.  3 f, the triangle is lag-consistent if the edge from Q to F has a lag of 8 months and the edge between E and F has lag - 2 months (meaning that the direction would be from F to E); several other values would make this triangle lag-consistent. We have verified the lag-consistency of every triangle in the climate network. One exception is the triangle between domains (C,D,G), shown at the bottom of Fig.  3 f. However, the large <b>lag</b> in the <b>edge</b> from C to G can be explained with the triangle between domains (C,E,G), which is lag-consistent. We emphasize that the temporal ordering that results from these lag relations should not be misinterpreted as causality; we expect that several of the edges we identify are only due to indirect correlations, not associated with a causal interaction between the corresponding two nodes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhile poleward species {{migration}} {{in response to}} recent climatic warming is widely documented, {{few studies have examined}} entire range responses of broadly distributed sessile organisms, including changes on both the trailing (equatorward) and the leading (poleward) range edges. From a detailed population census throughout the entire geographical range of Aloe dichotoma Masson, a long-lived Namib Desert tree, together with data from repeat photographs, we present strong evidence that a developing range shift in this species is a 'fingerprint' of anthropogenic climate change. This is explained at a high level of statistical significance by population level impacts of observed regional warming and resulting water balance constraints. Generalized linear models suggest that greater mortalities and population declines in equatorward populations are virtually certainly the result, due to anthropogenic climate change, of the progressive exceedance of critical climate thresholds that are relatively closer to the species' tolerance limits in equatorward sites. Equatorward population declines are also broadly consistent with bioclimatically modelled projections under anticipated anthropogenic climate change but, as yet, {{there is no evidence of}} poleward range expansion into the area predicted to become suitable in future, despite good evidence for positive population growth trends in poleward populations. This study is among the first to show a marked <b>lag</b> between trailing <b>edge</b> population extinction and leading edge range expansion in a species experiencing anthropogenic climate change impacts, a pattern likely to apply to most sessile and poorly dispersed organisms.
