A well-hodded bird is placed in it, and the assistant holds up a second, waving it to and fro and provoking No. 1 to take his exercise by springing to the attack.

The notion is one of popular nationalism, in a style as exposed by Benedict Anderson (1983), who creates imagenery and mostly uses the Chilean Armada as flagship of this imagery.
