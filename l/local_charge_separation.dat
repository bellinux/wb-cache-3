40|$|The {{rate of the}} {{photoinduced}} charge-separation in C 60 -terminated butadiyne-linked porphyrin oligomers Pn (n = 4, 6) {{is strongly}} influenced by their molecular conformation. In these systems, {{the presence of the}} butadiyne linkers gives rise to a broad distribution of conformations in the ground state, due to an almost barrierless rotation of individual porphyrin units in the oligomer chain. The conformational states of these oligomers, either twisted or planar, could be selected by varying the excitation wavelength, thereby providing different initial excited states for <b>charge</b> <b>separation.</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> in the different conformers was followed using both steady-state and 2 D time-resolved emission using a streak camera system. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis applied on streak camera data provides here a powerful tool to study the conformational dependence of the <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> in long PnC 60 systems. Both the kinetics and spectral changes accompanying <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> could be analyzed for different populations of conformation. From this analysis we show that, for both systems studied, twisted conformations undergo faster <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> than planar conformations. This disparity in <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> rates was ascribed mainly to the difference in driving force for <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> between twisted and planar conformations. <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> was also studied in oligomers P nC 60 coordinated to an octadentate ligand T 8 that hinders the rotation of porphyrin subunits. The semicircular complexes P nC 60 -T 8 show dramatic changes in their spectral properties, as well as slow excitation wavelength independent rate of <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> and corresponding low efficiency compared to their linear counterparts.

40|$|Antagonistic salts are {{composed}} of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions. In a mixture solvent (water-oil) such ion pairs are preferentially attracted to water or oil, giving rise to a coupling between the charge density and the composition. First, they form a large electric double layer at a water-oil interface, reducing the surface tension and producing mesophases. Here, the cations and anions are loosely bound by the Coulomb attraction across the interface {{on the scale of}} the Debye screening length. Second, on solid surfaces, hydrophilic (hydrophobic) ions are trapped in a water-rich (oil-rich) adsorption layer, while those of the other species are expelled from the layer. This yields a solvation mechanism of <b>local</b> <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> near a solid.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of the self energy of the mobile ions in {{electrolyte}} solutions within a general Gaussian renormalized fluctuation theory using a field-theoretic approach. We introduce the Born radii of the ions {{in the form of a}} charge distribution allowing for different Born radii between the cations and anions. The model thus automatically yields a theory free of divergences and accounts for the solvation of the ions at the level of continuous dielectric media. In an inhomogeneous dielectric medium, the self energy is in general position dependent and differences in the self energy between cations and anions can give rise to <b>local</b> <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> in a macroscopically neutral system. Treating the Born radius a as a smallness parameter, we show that the self energy can be split into an O(a^(− 1)) nonuniversal contribution and an O(a^ 0) universal contribution that depends only on the ion concentration, valency, and the spatially varying dielectric constant. For a weakly inhomogeneous dielectric medium, the nonuniversal part of the self energy is shown to have the form of the Born energy with the local dielectric constant. This self energy is incorporated into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation as a simple means of including this local fluctuation effect in a mean-field theory.

40|$|We {{study the}} bulk {{thermodynamics}} and interfacial properties of electrolyte solution mixtures by accounting for electrostatic interaction, ion solvation, and inhomogeneity in the dielectric medium in the mean-field framework. Difference in the solvation energy between the cations and anions {{is shown to}} give rise to <b>local</b> <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> near the interface, and a finite Galvani potential between two coexisting solutions. The ion solvation affects the phase equilibrium of the solvent mixture, depending on the dielectric constants of the solvents, reflecting the competition between the solvation energy and translation entropy of the ions. Miscibility is decreased if both solvents have low dielectric constants and is enhanced if both solvents have high dielectric constant. At the mean-field level, the ion distribution near the interface is determined by two competing effects: accumulation in the electrostatic double layer and depletion in a diffuse interface. The interfacial tension shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the salt concentration: it increases linearly with the salt concentration at higher concentrations and decreases approximately as the square root of the salt concentration for dilute solutions, reaching a minimum near 1 mM. We also find that, for a fixed cation type, the interfacial tension decreases as the size of anion increases. These results offer qualitative explanations within one unified framework for the long-known concentration and ion size effects on the interfacial tension of electrolyte solutions...|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} {{feature of}} efficient photo-initiated <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> is sequential electron transfer. <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> is initiated by photoexcitation of an electron donor followed by rapid electron transfer {{steps from the}} excited donor {{through a series of}} electron acceptors, so that, after one or two successive steps, <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> is stabilized by the physical separation between the oxidized donor and reduced acceptor.

The work presented in this Thesis investigates the effects of conformational flexibility on the photophysical properties {{of a series of}} conjugated porphyrin oligomers Pn (n = 1 - 4, 6, 8). First the influence of temperature on the conformational distribution displayed by these systems has been explored. At low temperature, these porphyrins spontaneously form highly-ordered planar aggregates resulting in characteristic changes in their spectral properties. The observed spectral changes could be explained by a planarization of the oligomers accompanying the aggregate formation. Further the influence of conformation on the electron transfer reactions in long fullerene-appended porphyrin oligomers PnC 60 (n = 4, 6) was studied thoroughly. The rate of <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> could be tuned by selective excitation of different populations of conformations. Twisted conformations showed faster <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> rates and higher efficiencies than planar conformations. The disparity in <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> rates was ascribed to the differences in driving force for <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> between twisted and planar conformations. The conformational distribution of PnC 60 systems could also be restrained and controlled by means of coordination to an octadentate ligand T 8, thus providing simpler model systems to investigate the influence of conformation on the <b>charge</b> <b>separation.</b> The semi-circular complexes PnC 60 -T 8 showed significant differences in their spectral properties compared to their linear counterparts that were attributed to their planarity and higher rigidity. <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> was also investigated in these semi-circular complexes.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns techniques {{for the formation of}} periodic structures in optical fibres. Two different methods of producing such structures are studied in detail. The first of these involves a breakdown mechanism (known as the 'fibre fuse') that permanently damages the core glass in a periodic manner leaving it unable to guide light. The dynamics of this mechanism are studied, with a view to controlling it for the production of interactive grating structures. It is determined that, due to a sharp rise in fibre absorption with temperature, a thermal shock-wave, with a typical thermal gradient of several hundred degrees Kelvin per micron, forms and travels along the fibre, heating the core glass {{to such an extent that}} damage occurs. The periodicity of the resultant damage arises from thermal focusing and de-focusing of light in the region of this shock-wave. The second method makes use of the photorefractivity observed in certain germanosilicate fibres on exposure to moderate intensity blue light of wavelength ~ 480 nm or UV light ~ 240 nm. A single-mode fibre transmission filter is demonstrated for the first time, produced by exposing a fibre Sagnac loop mirror to 488 nm holographic fringes. Average index changes are shown to occur if such fibres are exposed to spatially uniform blue or UV light, indicating that grating formation is by a different mechanism to the <b>local</b> <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> which occurs in photorefractive crystals. The various characteristics of these average index changes are measured and analysed, with the conclusion that they result from defect centre formation, driven by two photon absorption with blue light, or single photon absorption with UV light. Associated birefringence changes are also measured and are exploited in a hi-bi fibre to periodically perturb the birefringence axes, producing a narrow-line transmission filter...|$|E
40|$|Although {{numerous}} theoretical {{efforts have}} been put forth, a systematic, unified and predictive theoretical framework that is able to capture all the essential physics of the interfacial behaviors of ions, such as the Hofmeister series effect, Jones-Ray effect and the salt effect on the bubble coalescence remain an outstanding challenge. The most common approach to treating electrostatic interactions {{in the presence of}} salt ions is the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory. However, there are many systems for which the PB theory fails to offer even a qualitative explanation of the behavior, especially for ions distributed in the vicinity of an interface with dielectric contrast between the two media (like the water-vapor/oil interface). A key factor missing in the PB theory is the self energy of the ion. In this thesis, we develop a self-consistent theory that treats the electrostatic self energy (including both the short-range Born solvation energy and the long-range image charge interactions), the nonelectrostatic contribution of the self energy, the ion-ion correlation and the screening effect systematically in a single framework. By assuming a finite charge spread of the ion instead of using the point-charge model, the self energy obtained by our theory is free of the divergence problems and gives a continuous self energy across the interface. This continuous feature allows ions on the water side and the vapor/oil side of the interface to be treated in a unified framework. The theory involves a minimum set of parameters of the ion, such as the valency, radius, polarizability of the ions, and the dielectric constants of the medium, that are both intrinsic and readily available. The general theory is first applied to study the thermodynamic property of the bulk electrolyte solution, which shows good agreement with the experiment result for predicting the activity coefficient and osmotic coefficient. Next, we address the effect of local Born solvation energy on the bulk thermodynamics and interfacial properties of electrolyte solution mixtures. We show that difference in the solvation energy between the cations and anions naturally gives rise to <b>local</b> <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> near the interface, and a finite Galvani potential between two coexisting solutions. The miscibility of the mixture can either increases or decreases depending on the competition between the solvation energy and translation entropy of the ions. The interfacial tension shows a non-monotonic dependence on the salt concentration: it increases linearly with the salt concentration at higher concentrations, and decreases approximately as the square root of the salt concentration for dilute solutions, which is in agreement with the Jones-Ray effect observed in experiment. Next, we investigate the image effects on the double layer structure and interfacial properties near a single charged plate. We show that the image charge repulsion creates a depletion boundary layer that cannot be captured by a regular perturbation approach. The correct weak-coupling theory must include the self-energy of the ion due to the image charge interaction. The image force qualitatively alters the double layer structure and properties, and gives rise to many non-PB effects, such as nonmonotonic dependence of the surface energy on concentration and charge inversion. The image charge effect is then studied for electrolyte solutions between two plates. For two neutral plates, we show that depletion of the salt ions by the image charge repulsion results in short-range attractive and long-range repulsive forces. If cations and anions are of different valency, the asymmetric depletion leads to the formation of an induced electrical double layer. For two charged plates, the competition between the surface charge and the image charge effect can give rise to like- charge attraction. Then, we study the inhomogeneous screening effect near the dielectric interface due to the anisotropic and nonuniform ion distribution. We show that the double layer structure and interfacial properties is drastically affected by the inhomogeneous screening if the bulk Debye screening length is comparable or smaller than the Bjerrum length. The width of the depletion layer is characterized by the Bjerrum length, independent of the salt concentration. We predict that the negative adsorption of ions at the interface increases linearly with the salt concentration, which cannot be captured by either the bulk screening approximation or the WKB approximation. For asymmetric salt, the inhomogeneous screening enhances the charge separation in the induced double layer and significantly increases the value of the surface potential. Finally, to account for the ion specificity, we study the self energy of a single ion across the dielectric interface. The ion is considered to be polarizable: its charge distribution can be self-adjusted to the local dielectric environment to minimize the self energy. Using intrinsic parameters of the ions, such as the valency, radius, and polarizability, we predict the specific ion effect on the interfacial affinity of halogen anions at the water/air interface, and the strong adsorption of hydrophobic ions at the water/oil interface, in agreement with experiments and atomistic simulations. The theory developed in this work represents the most systematic theoretical technique for weak-coupling electrolytes. We expect the theory to be more useful for studying a wide range of structural and dynamic properties in physicochemical, colloidal, soft-matter and biophysical systems. </p...|$|E

Qualitatively, these results agree with some of the theoretical predictions for local parity violation in heavy-ion collisions. However, a study using reaction-plane-dependent balance functions shows an alternative origin of this signal. The balance function, which measures the correlation between oppositely charged pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges. The reaction-plane-dependent balance function measurements can be related to STAR's charge-dependent azimuthal correlations. We report reaction-plane-dependent balance functions for Au+Au collisions at √(s_ NN) = 200, 62. 4, 39, 11. 5, and 7. 7 GeV using the STAR detector.

40|$|Dendrimers {{have been}} {{previously}} shown to provide significant advantages in both excited-state energy transfer and charge transfer. However, this architecture causes {{one of the}} charges to be encapsulated and thus not available for <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> over long distances. We conceived dendron−rod−coils as scaffolds that could have the architectural advantage of the dendrimers, while still providing a possible conduit for <b>charge</b> <b>separation.</b> In this study, we have designed and synthesized dendron−rod−coil-based donor−chromophore−acceptor triads and have compared these with dendron−rod and rod−coil diads. We have then evaluated the relative abilities of these molecules in photoinduced charge transfer. Our studies reveal that dendron−rod−coil could indeed be the ideal architecture for efficient photoinduced <b>charge</b> <b>separation...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> {{behaviour}} {{inside a}} microscale {{drop of water}} suspended in oil is studied using a novel elec-trokinetic model [1], which allows for conduction, convection and diffusion of ions inside the drop. The interfacial tension and electric field are varied {{and its effects on}} <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> studied. It is shown that the concentration of charge varies inside the drop as ions redistribute in response to electrical forces. The <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> measured at the centre is similar for the stable and unstable cases considered. For the unstable drops, a significant proportion of the charge collects near the interface of the drop and is ejected as the drop breaks...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of an {{electrical}} generator, a time-varying magnetic field inside the generator creates an electric field via electromagnetic induction, which in turn creates a voltage difference between the generator terminals. <b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> takes place within the generator, with electrons flowing away from one terminal and toward the other, until, in the open-circuit case, sufficient electric field builds up to make further <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> impossible. Again the emf is countered by the electrical voltage due to <b>charge</b> <b>separation.</b> If a load is attached, this voltage can drive a current. The general principle governing the emf in such electrical machines is Faraday's law of induction.|$|R
30|$|The basic {{mechanism}} of the degradation process is depending upon electron-hole (e-h) <b>charge</b> <b>separation.</b> Irradiation of visible light that corresponds to the band gap energy of the composite nanofibers leads the valence band electron to be excited to the conduction band while creating {{a hole in the}} valence band. This e- h <b>charge</b> <b>separation</b> initiates the radical-generated oxidation-reduction reaction of organic dyes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Charge</b> <b>separation</b> {{is a major}} {{property}} of dyad and triad assemblies. Some nanomaterials employed are fullerenes (such as carbon nanotubes), a strategy that explores the pi-bonding properties of these materials. Diverse modifications (covalent and non-covalent) of carbon nanotubes have been attempted {{to increase the efficiency}} of <b>charge</b> <b>separation,</b> including the addition of ferrocene and pyrrole-like molecules such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines.|$|R
