5|$|Wilfrid {{was born}} in Northumbria in about 633. James Fraser argues that Wilfrid's family were aristocrats from Deira, {{pointing}} out that most of Wilfrid's early contacts were from that area. A conflict with his stepmother {{when he was about}} 14 years old drove Wilfrid to leave home, probably without his father's consent. Wilfrid's background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king's retainers were frequent guests at his father's house, and on <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
5|$|Tambellini {{was born}} in Calgary, Alberta. His father Steve Tambellini, a retired ice hockey player and former {{general manager of the}} Edmonton Oilers, was playing for the Calgary Flames at the time. Steve also played in the NHL with the New York Islanders, Colorado Rockies, New Jersey Devils and Vancouver Canucks. Tambellini's grandfather, Addie Tambellini, {{was a member of the}} Trail Smoke Eaters who were the last Canadian amateur team to win the World Championships in 1961. While his father became {{involved}} with the Canucks first as a player, then as an executive later in his career, Jeff lived in suburban Port Moody, British Columbia, gaining exposure to the NHL environment. After <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> to begin his own hockey career, Jeff returned to Vancouver in the off-seasons, residing in the downtown Coal Harbour neighbourhood.|$|E

40|$|The way {{in which}} young people <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> {{has changed over the}} last twenty years due to massive {{enrolment}} in higher education and unemployment fluctuations. The increase in coresidence with parents from 1984 to 1996 was due mainly to the development of higher education. Coresidence decreased with the drop in unemployment from 1996 to 2002. However, there is still little known about how parental income influences young adults decisions to <b>leave</b> <b>home.</b> Using the 2002 Housing survey, we deem that the children from the poorest and the richest families are most likely to <b>leave</b> <b>home.</b> Yet the quality of the parental housing is an important factor. Its location is key. Less space encourages children to <b>leave</b> <b>home,</b> as does the lack of privacy due to the presence of a stepparent. Given an equal quality of parental housing, children are more likely to <b>leave</b> <b>home</b> when their parents can assist them.

5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and he felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. <b>Leaving</b> <b>home</b> for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics.

25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of the situation for women in such situations, it has been a task for every generation of halakhic authorities to try to find halakhically acceptable means to permit such women to remarry. In the past it was not uncommon, due to the danger of travel and primitive means of communication, for people <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> never to be heard of again; consequently rabbis often had had to deal with this issue. Over the past few centuries, thousands of responsa have been written to deal with cases of agunot.|$|E

Of the 50,000 people in India that are officially reported as <b>leaving</b> <b>home</b> annually, 45 percent are under 16; this number, though, is likely very low. Various studies have formulated estimates of certain cities. In the late 1980s, for instance, {{it was estimated that}} there were at least 100,000 street children in both Kolkata and Bombay. Overall, estimates for the total number of street children in India range from 400,000-800,000.|$|E
