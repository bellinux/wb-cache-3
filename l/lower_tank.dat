5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the <b>lower</b> <b>tank</b> to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{produces}} around 4,500tonnes {{of solid}} waste daily, which is transported from collection units in Imlibun, Yousufguda and <b>Lower</b> <b>Tank</b> Bund to the dumpsite in Jawaharnagar. Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. Ground water around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only ground water but also river and lake levels. This shortage is further exacerbated by inadequately treated effluent discharged from industrial treatment plants polluting the water sources of the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at <b>lower</b> <b>tank</b> pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
25|$|The tank at {{the head}} of the small road from Pumsaint to Caio was thought to be modern since it still holds water. However, when the level of the water was low in 1970, it yielded large {{quantities}} of Roman pottery which show that it is of Roman origin and built early during their exploitation of the mines. The section shows that it was connected to a smaller tank just below the modern road by a drystone culvert in a cascade. The <b>lower</b> <b>tank</b> also holds water but is in an advanced state of eutrophication. The collection of fragments included Samian ware and coarse ware from over 100 separate pots, and must have fallen into the reservoir when the mines were in full operation. Analysis of the pottery fragments showed a distribution of ages from the late 1st century AD through to the end of the 4th century. Since the fort and fortlet under the present village of Pumsaint ends in the middle of the 2nd century, it shows that mining continued for a long time after the military evacuation.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the <b>lower</b> <b>tank</b> and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high anti-knock value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high anti-knock value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E

The model is examined and improvedstep by step. The model, M 3, {{expected to be the}} best form is composed of three tanks. Theupper tank of the model has three runoff holes, each of which corresponds to surface runoff of theManning's type, prompt and delayed subsurface runoff of linear type, respectively.

In low energy casualties where only the outside hull is penetrated, {{this will be the}} case. However, in high energy casualties both hulls are penetrated. As the tanks of a double hull tanker are larger than those of MARPOL-tankers and preMARPOL-tankers and the height of the cargo above the water line is higher, the resulting spill can be much larger than these single hull designs. In the Coulombi Egg design spillage is greatly reduced, possibly to zero.|$|E
