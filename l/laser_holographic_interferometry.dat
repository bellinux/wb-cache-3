40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of light {{deflection}} during diffusion studies of ethanol into agarose gel using <b>holographic</b> <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry</b> is presented. Furthermore it also demonstrates how a diffusive flux could give rise to a convective flux in <b>holographic</b> <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry</b> experiments. The convective and diffusive mass transfer is also theoretically compared in both a liquid phase and a gel phase for the ethanol-agarose system used. The current study shows that errors due to light deflection in <b>holographic</b> <b>laser</b> <b>interferometry</b> are extremely small and can be neglected. It also shows the importance of designing the diffusion experiments to avoid natural convection. In gels the convective flow is cancelled by the friction forces between the liquid and the polymer network.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the intrastromal corneal ring, a device developed to reduce myopia, on corneal asphericity in a large set of eye bank eyes. METHODS: Forty-one deturgesced eye bank eyes were implanted with intrastromal corneal rings of five different thicknesses, ranging from 0. 25 mm to 0. 45 mm. Corneal asphericity, before and after implantation, was examined using two different metrologies. Corneal asphericity profiles were produced from dioptric power data collected from videokeratography. To statistically assess the corneal asphericity differences between exam times for each intrastromal corneal ring thickness, dependent sample confidence intervals (95 %) were calculated for the mean differences between preoperative and postoperative measures for each topographic diameter zone. <b>Laser</b> <b>holographic</b> <b>interferometry</b> was used to inspect corneal asphericity in one eye bank eye case study for four intrastromal corneal ring sizes.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>holographic</b> <b>interferometry</b> {{was tried}} as a nonintrusive {{diagnostic}} tool for studying unsteady two dimensional flows. A NACA 0012 airfoil was tested, while undergoing dynamic stall, over {{a range of}} Mach numbers of 0. 3 to 0. 5, Reynolds number of 0. 5 x 10 to the 6 th power to 2 x 10 to the 6 th power, and at reduced frequencies of 0. 015 to 0. 15. It was found that both quantitative and qualitative data could be obtained by the technique. Surface pressures on the airfoil can be measured to within 1 % of those measured with orifices and pressure transducers when the flow is attached. Velocity profiles were measured near the wake region, and they compared very well with laser velocimeter data for attached flows. For separated flows with large scale vortices, densities can be measured, but pressures and velocities cannot be deduced with the assumption of constant pressure gradient in the normal direction.
