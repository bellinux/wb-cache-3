50|$|CDMA {{spectral}} efficiency {{refers to the}} system {{spectral efficiency}} in bit/s/Hz/site or Erlang/MHz/site {{that can be achieved}} in a certain CDMA based wireless communication system. CDMA techniques (also known as spread spectrum) are characterized by a very <b>low</b> <b>link</b> spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz as compared to non-spread spectrum systems, but a comparable system spectral efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Low</b> <b>link</b> {{spectral}} efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz {{does not necessarily}} mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system {{spectral efficiency}} point of view. As an example, consider Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA) spread spectrum, which is not a particularly spectral efficient encoding scheme when considering a single channel or single user. However, the fact that one can [...] "layer" [...] multiple channels on the same frequency band means that the system spectrum utilization for a multi-channel CDMA system can be very good.|$|E
50|$|The data {{transfer}} capacity the DSL modem therefore reports {{is determined by}} the total of the bits-per-bin allocations of all the bins combined. Higher signal-to-noise ratios and more bins being in use gives a higher total link capacity, while lower signal-to-noise ratios or fewer bins being used gives a <b>low</b> <b>link</b> capacity. The total maximum capacity derived from summing the bits-per-bin is reported by DSL modems and is sometimes termed sync rate. This will always be rather misleading, as the true maximum link capacity for user {{data transfer}} rate will be significantly lower; because extra data are transmitted that are termed protocol overhead, reduced figures for PPPoA connections of around 84-87 percent, at most, being common. In addition, some ISPs will have traffic policies that limit maximum transfer rates further in the networks beyond the exchange, and traffic congestion on the Internet, heavy loading on servers and slowness or inefficiency in customers' computers may all contribute to reductions below the maximum attainable. When a wireless access point is used, low or unstable wireless signal quality can also cause reduction or fluctuation of actual speed.|$|E

Assuming only social value, the pairwise stable set includes many nonstandard networks under high and particular combinations of complete components under <b>low</b> <b>link</b> specificity.

40|$|The power {{consumption}} of Internet is increasing year by year. How {{to decrease the}} consumption is of interest for both the research community and the public. Current network has poor efficiency because of the <b>low</b> <b>link</b> utilization and high path redundancy. The <b>low</b> <b>link</b> utilization and high path redundancy lead to high energy consumption. In order to decrease the energy consumption and improve the efficiency, this paper proposes an EAR algorithm called TM-EAR which is combined with the traffic matrix to improve the link utilization and {{reduce the number of}} path redundancy. TM-EAR can find a spanning tree which all traffic data are routed on. And we can switch off the links that are not contained in the spanning tree. The experiments show {{that it is possible to}} switch off about 50 - 20 % of links. The TM-EAR has a good performance...|$|E
40|$|Multicast avoids sending {{repeated}} packets {{over the}} same network links and thus offers the promise of supporting multimedia streaming over wide-area networks. Previously, two opposite multicast schemes – forward-path forwarding and reverse-path forwarding – have been proposed on top of structured peer-to-peer (p 2 p) overlay networks. This paper presents Borg, a new scalable application-level multicast system built on top of p 2 p overlay networks. Borg is a hybrid protocol that exploits the asymmetry in p 2 p routing and leverages the reverse-path multicast scheme for its <b>low</b> <b>link</b> stress on the physical networks. Borg has been implemented on top of Pastry, a generic, structured p 2 p routing substrate. Simulation results based on a realistic network topology model shows that Borg induces significantly lower routing delay penalty than both forward-path and reversepath multicast schemes while retaining the <b>low</b> <b>link</b> stress of the reverse-path multicast scheme...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} model on {{strategic}} formation of communication networks with (i) link specificity: the more direct links somebody maintains, the less she can specify her attention per link, the lower her links’ value, while this negative externality was previously {{ignored in the}} communication context, and (ii) value transferability via indirect links for informational but not for social value from communication, while this positive externality was modeled uniformly before. Assuming only social value to isolate the impact of link specificity, the pairwise stable set includes many nonstandard networks under high or particular combinations of fully connected components under <b>low</b> <b>link</b> specificity. Allowing for social and informational value, the joint effect of link specificity and value transferability reduces the stable set to certain fragmented networks under high or the complete network under <b>low</b> <b>link</b> specificity.

30|$|From the {{comparison}} of TMR-Ana and NCMR-Ana, NCMR achieves higher successful delivery ratio. For normalized energy consumption of the network model, if there are few or no errors which occur in the channels, {{it is found that}} energy consumption in TMR is lower. While NCMR consumes more energy since more redundant bits such as encoding coefficients and group ID are transmitted. If BER becomes larger, the normalized energy consumption of NCMR becomes lower than that of TMR. The results show that NCMR provides higher reliability and lower energy consumption in the network with <b>low</b> <b>link</b> quality which is a character of WSNs.|$|E

During the Neptune flyby, in addition to then 70-m antenna, two 34-m antennas and the twenty-seven 25-m antenna were used to increase the gain by 5.6 dB, allowing this additional link margin to be used for a 4x increase in bitrate.|$|R
