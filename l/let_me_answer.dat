60|$|OLIVER. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer,</b> then.--Because it's worse, perhaps, to be bullied {{by three}} {{thousand}} men than by one man.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you mean, Miss Havisham, {{what have}} you done to injure me, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer.</b> Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is she married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Am I content, then, {{that the}} general {{interior}} chyle of our republic should be supplied and nourish'd by wholesale from foreign and antagonistic sources such as these? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> that question briefly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> in,' <b>answered</b> Maria. 'I have quarrelled with my eldest sister, and as I do {{not want}} to fight any more, I have come to beg you to allow me to sleep with you.' ...|$|R
50|$|Quayle: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> try to <b>answer</b> the {{question}} one more time. I {{think this is}} the fourth time that I've had this question.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{neither of}} us get on by complaining;--shall we, Mr. Finn? You can <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have an <b>answer</b> perhaps by this time to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|McCOMAS (stopping her). <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> that, Mrs. Clandon. The {{answer will}} {{surprise}} you considerably. He {{lives in this}} town. (Mrs. Clandon rises. She and Gloria {{look at one another}} in the greatest consternation.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will not}} {{hesitate}} any longer, Mr Wrayburn. I {{hope you will}} not think the worse of me for having hesitated at all. For myself and for Jenny--you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> for you, Jenny dear?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince," [...] he declared, [...] "I {{speak in}} your own interests. You have not chosen to answer my question. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> it for you. The money to pay your debts, and I know not how much besides, was {{to come from the}} Government of a country with whom none of your name or {{nationality}} should willingly have dealings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if I can do {{anything}} at all, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know," [...] <b>answered</b> Songbird's uncle. [...] "I am rather busy now, {{but as soon as}} I am at leisure, I will call and talk the matter over with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Frank," [...] says I, [...] "I can't {{have any}} sentimentality {{mixed up with}} {{business}} matters. You please to stop talking, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ask questions. <b>Answer</b> in the fewest words you can use. Nod when nodding will do instead of words." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{youngest}} son marched boldly {{up to his}} father and said to him, 'My brothers would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know what <b>answer</b> you had given to their question. But now, do tell me why your right eye always laughs and your left eye always weeps.' ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{a letter}} from Bologna from Jessie, which threw me into a terror lest the Mazzinians should come to Italy {{just in time to}} ruin us. The letter (not unkind to me) was as {{contrary}} to facts and reason as possible. I was too ill to write at the time, and Robert would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> it afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> in English," [...] said March, [...] "I {{should say}} about five {{thousand}} dollars a year. I name that figure because it's my experience that I never could earn more; but the experience of other men may be different, and if they tell me they can earn ten, or twenty, or fifty thousand a year, I'm not prepared to say they can't do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young friend," [...] he said, [...] "have you {{forgotten}} {{that on a}} far more important occasion to YOU, I showed no desire to pry into your secret?" [...] Hurlstone made a movement of deprecation. [...] "Nor have I any such desire now. But {{for the sake of}} our coming to an understanding as friends, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> the question for you. You are here, my dear fellow, as a messenger from the Mission of Todos Santos to the Ecclesiastical Commission from Guadalajara, whose ship touches here every three years. It is now due. You have mistaken this vessel for theirs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good sir,' said he, 'pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get an <b>answer.</b> This is {{the sixth}} time I have been here. I was here five times yesterday. My house is {{threatened}} with destruction. It {{is to be}} burned down to-night, and {{was to have been}} last night, but they had other business on their hands. Pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> get an answer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maning?--what's {{the good}} of maning? Anyways, Anty, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have an <b>answer,</b> for I'll not be making a fool of myself any longer. Somehow, all the boys here, every sowl in Dunmore, has it that you and I is to be married--and now, afther {{promising}} me as you did--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, {{and asked}} me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be {{perfectly}} splendid, if Mother only <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> go," [...] <b>answered</b> Meg, cheering up at the thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Fentolin," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am glad to}} {{have you}} speak so plainly. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> you in the same spirit. I am leaving this house mainly because I have {{conceived}} certain suspicions with regard to Mr. Fentolin. I do not like him, I do not trust him, I do not believe in him. Therefore, I mean to remove myself from the burden of his hospitality. There are reasons," [...] he went on, [...] "why I do not wish to leave the neighbourhood altogether. There are certain investigations which I wish to make. That is why I have decided to go to the Tower." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{to do is}} horrible; but mayest thou {{not judge}} amiss in this matter? How can I judge amiss, when I judge as I feel? Poor soul! Thou mayest judge amiss for all that. Why, saith the sinner, I think that these {{questioning}}s come from my heart. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer.</b> That which comes from thy heart, comes from thy will and affections, from thy understanding, judgment, and conscience, for these must acquiesce in thy questioning, if thy questioning be with thy heart. And how sayest thou, for to name no more, dost thou with thy affection and conscience thus question? Answ. No, my conscience trembles when such thoughts come into my mind; and my affections are otherwise inclined.|$|E
6000|$|Eve. [...] Hold thy wrath, [...] Beloved Adam! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> him; [...] For {{this time}} he speaks truth, which we should hear, [...] And asks for mercy, which I most should grant, [...] In like wise, as he tells us--in like wise! [...] And {{therefore}} I thee pardon, Lucifer, [...] As freely as the streams of Eden flowed [...] When we were happy by them. So, depart; [...] Leave us to walk the remnant of our time [...] Out mildly in the desert. Do not seek [...] To harm us any more or scoff at us, [...] Or ere the dust be laid upon our face, [...] To find there the communion of the dust [...] And issue of the dust,--Go! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{will have}} time to write to me by this evening's post. I shall stop at Zeeland to-morrow, on my way back, {{and ask for a}} letter at the post office. I forbid {{explanations}} and excuses. I forbid heartless allusions to your duty. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> have an <b>answer</b> which does not keep me for a moment in suspense.|$|R
60|$|DEAR SIR,--The {{inclosed}} bill [1] will {{convince you}} how anxious I {{must be for}} the payment of Claughton's first instalment; though it has been sent in without due notice, I cannot blame Mr. Davies who must feel very anxious {{to get rid of}} the business. Press C., and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have an <b>answer</b> whenever you can to this Place.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} shriek, and another, {{and then a}} shrill voice cried, 'Is Simmun below!' At the same moment a lean neck was {{stretched}} over the parapet, and Miss Miggs, indistinctly seen in the gathering gloom of evening, screeched in a frenzied manner, 'Oh! dear gentlemen, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hear Simmuns's <b>answer</b> from his own lips. Speak to me, Simmun. Speak to me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment," [...] he said, [...] "before {{we bring}} a {{stranger}} on the scene. It must be borne {{in mind that}} he is not to know what you know now, that the lamps were the objects of a prolonged and difficult and dangerous search. All I can tell him, all that he must know from any source, is that some of my property has been stolen. I must describe some of the lamps, especially one, for it is of gold; and my fear is lest the thief, ignorant of its historic worth, may, in order to cover up his crime, have it melted. I would willingly pay ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand times its intrinsic value rather than have it destroyed. I shall tell him only what is necessary. So, please, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> any questions he may ask; unless, of course, I ask you or refer to either of you for the answer." [...] We both nodded acquiescence. Then a thought struck me and I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{thankful that}} you are not one of the Privy Council, Otto," [...] {{returned}} Pauline, with a laugh. [...] "You put several questions, and a string of commentary and suggestion in the same breath! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> you in detail, beginning with your last remark. Joe is a gentleman in the highest sense of that word. He is gentle as a lamb by nature, and a man every inch of him. But, more than this, I have noticed that he is a peculiarly wise man, with a calm, pool head on all occasions, and not too ready to use his great physical power in the settlement of disputes. I have observed, too, that when asked for his advice, he usually thinks well before he gives it, and when his advice is followed things almost always go well. Still further, Joe has the thorough confidence of the people, and I am not so sure that Dom has. Besides, if I had appointed Dom, some of the ungenerous among them might have said it was done from mere favouritism. Then as to the people making up their minds that I would appoint Dom," [...] continued Pauline, [...] "what have I to do with that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Good-morrow again, dear sirrahs; one cannot {{rise for}} your play.--At night. I went {{this morning to}} visit Lady Kerry and Lord Shelburne; and they made me dine with them. Sir Andrew Fountaine is better. And now let us come and see what this saucy, dear letter of MD says. Come out, letter, come out from between the sheets; here it is underneath, {{and it will not}} come out. Come out again, I say: so there. Here it is. What says Presto to me, pray? says it. Come, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> for you to your ladies. Hold up your head then, like a good letter. There. Pray, how have you got up with Presto, Madam Stella? You write your eighth when you receive mine: now I write my twelfth when I receive your eighth. Do not you allow for what are upon the road, simpleton? What say you to that? And so you kept Presto's little birthday, I warrant: would to God I had been at the health rather than here, where I have no manner of pleasure, nothing but eternal {{business}} upon my hands. I shall grow wise in time; but no more of that: only I say Amen with my heart and vitals, that we may never be asunder again ten days together while poor Presto lives.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "perhaps {{you are right}} and perhaps you ain't. Right or wrong, you always talk like Solomon in all his glory. Anyway, be off with that note and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have the <b>answer</b> {{as soon as you}} get back. Mind you don't go loafing and jawing about down in Boisingham, because I want my answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Court of Chancery may perhaps put in Force your Threat. I have [...] always {{understood}} it formed a Sanction for legal plunderers to [...] protract the Decision of Justice {{from year to}} year, till weary of [...] spoil it at length condescended to give Sentence, but I never yet [...] understood even its unhallowed Hands preyed upon the Orphan it was [...] bound to protect. Be it so, only <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have your <b>answer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{hear your}} <b>answer,</b> and be it what it may, I will accept {{it without a}} murmur, for least of all things do I desire to force myself upon you in marriage. Still I pray you, speak to me plainly once and for all, for if I must lose you I would know the worst; nor can I bear, when you have smiled upon me, to see you turn away. Nay, I would sooner die." ...|$|R
60|$|Bun. Sir, said I, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> {{you in a}} similitude: Set {{the case}} that, at such a wood corner, there did usually come forth thieves, to do mischief; must there {{therefore}} a law be made that every one that cometh out there shall be killed? May there not come out true men as well as thieves out from thence? Just thus {{it is in this}} case; I do think there may be many that may design the destruction of the commonwealth; but it does not follow therefore that all private meetings are unlawful; those that transgress, let them be punished. And if at any time I myself should do any act in my conversation as doth not become a man and Christian, let me bear the punishment. And as for your saying I may meet in public, if I may be suffered, I would gladly do it. Let me have but meeting enough in public, and I shall care the less to have them in private. I do not meet in private because I am afraid to have meetings in public. I bless the Lord that my heart is at that point, that if any man can lay anything to my charge, either in doctrine or practice, in this particular, that can be proved error or heresy, I am willing to disown it, even in the very market place; but if it be truth, then to stand to it to the last drop of my blood. And, Sir, said I, you ought to commend me for so doing. To err and to be a heretic are two things; I am no heretic, because I will not stand refractorily to defend any one thing that is contrary to the Word. Prove anything which I hold to be an error, and I will recant it.|$|E
6000|$|... ... <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> your {{questions}} concerning Non Pio V.E. Se non vero, ben trovato. Very happy, and I hope true. Probably enough {{it may be}} true, though I never heard it but from you. There was a banner with 'Viva Pio IX.' on one side, and 'Viva V.E. re d'Italia' on the other--that's true. And various devices we have had, miraculous rains of revolutionary placards among the rest. The French have taken to 'protect' our demonstrations here, half by way of keeping them under, perhaps--although the sympathy between {{the people and the}} troops (Gorgon apart) has been always undeniable. You know there was to be a gigantic demonstration to meet the declaration in the North. It was fixed to spread itself over three days. The French politely begged the 'papalini' to keep out of sight, and then they marched with the Roman demonstration for two days--twenty thousand Romans gathered together, I hear from those who were there, the greatest order observed--tricolors insinuated into the costume of all the women. After a certain time, French officer turns round and addresses the populace 'Gioventù Romana, basta cosí. Adesso bisogna andare a casa, poichè mi farebbe grandissimo dispiacere d' aprire ad alcuno la strada delle carceri.' The last words said smiling--as words to the wise. 'Grazie, grazie, grazie' were replied on all sides, and the people dispersed in the best humour possible. Yesterday (San Giuseppe) we were to have had it repeated, but it rained hard, which was fortunate, perhaps; and I hear something of cannons being placed in evidence, and of Gorgon saying 'de haute voix' that he couldn't allow it to go on. But everybody understands Gorgon. He has certainly, up to a point, Papal sympathies, and is as tender as he dares be to the Holy Father, and the irritation and wrath of the priestly party is naturally great. On the other hand, the whole body of French troops and their officers are as much vexed by Gorgon as Gorgon can vex me, and there's fraternisation with the Romans to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
5000|$|... "Given what I've said {{elsewhere}} about a deed {{having the}} same or even higher consequences when acted out on the virtual as opposed to literal level, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>answer</b> {{the question of how}} we Neo-Sabbatians practice this antinomianism by saying that everything Sabbatai and Frank taught and practiced, we teach and practice also -- but, unlike them, we teach and practice it through the Gates of Imagination rather than the gates of the body. Again, {{this is one of the}} principles that puts the [...] "neo" [...] into Neo-Sabbatian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, surely, Mr. de la Molle," [...] {{said the}} younger man with some irritation, for the old gentleman's {{somewhat}} magnificent manner rather annoyed him, which under the circumstances was not unnatural. [...] "Surely {{you do not want}} to consult a legal adviser to make up your mind as to whether or no you will allow a foreclosure. I offer you the money at four per cent.

6000|$|... "I {{can not let}} you {{continue}} in this way. Either change your conduct, and labor to make yourself worthy of the succession, or else take upon you the monastic vow. I can not rest satisfied with your present behavior, especially as I find that my health is declining. As soon, therefore, as you shall have received this my letter, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have your <b>answer</b> in writing, or {{give it to me}} yourself in person. If you do not, I shall at once proceed against you as a malefactor.--(Signed) PETER." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One minute, Miss Hazleden," [...] {{he went on}} passionately; [...] "one minute, {{and then}} I will be silent for ever. Remember, we might live in England, far away from all these unmeaning barriers. I do not ask you to take me now, and as I am; I will do all I can to make myself more worthy of you. Only <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hope; don't <b>answer</b> <b>me</b> no without {{considering}} it. I know how little I deserve such happiness; but if you will take me, I will live all my life for no other purpose than to make you see that I am striving to show myself grateful for your love. Oh, Miss Hazleden, do listen to me." ...|$|R
