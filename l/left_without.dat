5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Ernesto moved across southern Ontario, dropping moderate rainfall {{of up to}} 2.1inches (54mm). Wind gusts reached 37mph (60km/h) near Toronto, and the winds {{in combination with the}} rainfall caused power outages when lines snapped. Hundreds were <b>left</b> <b>without</b> power, though the outages were quickly restored.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the city}} of La Paz, damage to roads was {{estimated}} at MX$200million (US$15.5million).

5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are <b>left</b> <b>without</b> shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Between 1906 and 1908, the Pentecostal message {{had spread}} among Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA) churches and conferences. At first, it was greeted {{positively}} by the CMA leadership, but {{the doctrine of}} initial evidence divided the organization. Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were <b>left</b> <b>without</b> oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions.|$|E
5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was <b>left</b> <b>without</b> power and phone service. The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam <b>left</b> <b>without</b> water service following the storm. Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake.

The majority of Martinique's population were <b>left</b> <b>without</b> electricity, water, telephone, or food, and 600 Martiniquans were left homeless. The storm destroyed Martinique's entire banana crop, and 70% of the island's sugar cane plantations. The damage to these two agricultural sectors accounted {{for the majority of}} the island's €400million damage.|$|E

The woman and twelve-year-old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so, without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground, they spent the night on the tower until 10am the following morning. They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and <b>left</b> <b>without</b> giving their names to officials.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, winds {{from the}} {{precursor}} extratropical storm produced moderate damage, primarily to {{power lines and}} marine interests. Over 2/3 of the island's power subscribers were <b>left</b> <b>without</b> power during {{the worst of the}} storm, and several boats sank or ran aground from the high winds. Damage on Bermuda totaled to over $1.4million (2001USD; $1.7million 2008USD). In Atlantic Canada, Tropical Storm Karen produced light winds and rain, but caused minimal damage.|$|E
