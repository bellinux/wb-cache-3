For LCD-TV and multimedia applications, TFT-LCD panels become larger and usually have heavy loads in scan/data {{lines on the}} array. In order to enhance driving capability of the buffer, two comparators which sense the rising and falling edges of the input waveform were used {{to turn on the}} auxiliary driving transistors to enhance charging/discharging of the output load. When the buffer is at steady-state, it consumes no extra power. On the other hand, it needs a <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> to reach the high color depth. The replica-gain circuit could reduce the offset voltage and minimize affection of the mismatch transistors. The offset voltage of the novel buffer amplifier I was reduced to 4. 99 mV. In the second part, based on the buffer amplifier I, the buffer amplifier II with the improved offset voltage and output swing were proposed. The active load was adds in the replica-gain stage which could effectively reduce the offset voltage. In this part, two type buffers were designed and simulated. Type A is with the pure offset cancellation in the circuit. Type B is with the offset cancellation and slew rate enhancement functions. The output swing of the buffer amplifier II is from 0. 0 to 4. 9 V. The offset voltage of the type A and type B can be reduced and controlled within 0. 07 mV and 0. 19 mV, respectively. Therefore, the proposed high slew rate and <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> buffer has a potential to be applied to the source driver for LCD-TVs and large-size TFT-LCD monitors with high color depth and high resolution.

Moreover, the proposed offset calibration technique improves the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> from 11. 6 mV to 533 µV at 1 sigma. A prototype of the comparator is implemented in 90 nm 1 P 8 M CMOS with experimental results showing 320 µV input referred noise at 1. 5 GHz with 1. 2 V supply. I...|$|R
40|$|For the <b>lowest</b> <b>offset</b> {{and drift}} performance, chopper-stabilized (auto-zero) {{amplifiers}} {{may be the}} only solution. The best bipolar amplifiers offer <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> of 25 µV and 0. 1 µV/ºC drift. <b>Offset</b> <b>voltages</b> less than 5 µV with practically no measurable offset drift are obtainable with choppers, albeit with some penalties. A basic chopper amplifier circuit is shown in Figure 1 below. When the switches are in the "Z" (auto-zero) position, capacitors C 2 and C 3 are charged to the amplifier input and output <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> respectively. When the switches are in the "S " (sample) position, VIN is connected to VOUT through the path comprised of R 1, R 2, C 2, the amplifier, C 3, and R 3. The chopping frequency is usually between a few hundred Hz and several kHz, and {{it should be noted that}} because this is a sampling system, the input frequency must be much less than one-half the chopping frequency in order to prevent errors due to aliasing. The R 1 -C 1 combination serves as an antialiasing filter. It is also assumed that after a steady state condition is reached, there is only a minimal amount of charge transferred during the switching cycles. The output capacitor, C 4, and the load, RL, must be chosen such that there is minimal VOUT droop during the auto-zero cycle...|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} architecture for {{the design}} of low-noise, <b>low</b> <b>offset</b> instrumentation amplifiers is described. The amplifier, based on a modified indirect current feedback structure, exploits chopper modulation to reject input <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> and <b>low</b> frequency noise. The key features of the proposed topology are: (i) embedding of the chopper modulation scheme into a 2 nd order Gm-C low pass filter to obtain intrinsic chopper ripple rejection; (ii) equalization of the input and feedback common mode voltages for improved gain accuracy; (iii) biasing of the input devices in deep subthreshold region, to improve noise vs. power consumption efficiency. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of accurate electrical simulations...|$|R
40|$|Usually Anisotropic Magnetoresistance angle sensors are {{configured}} {{with two}} Wheatstone bridges, but an undesirable <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> {{included in the}} sensor output affects its accuracy. The total <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> combines a voltage due to resistance mismatches during manufacturing and a voltage from inequalities in the magnetic sensitivity. This paper focuses on identifying a consistent trend between the bridges' <b>offset</b> <b>voltages.</b> Compared with previous studies that focus on lifetime tests using high temperatures, this research uses temperature cycling to study <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> and sensitivity variations due to aging effects. A consistent trend between the bridges' <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> could not be found. The two offset components can add to or subtract {{from each other and}} their interaction can change over time due to variations in the sensor's material properties. To achieve a precise angle measurement, the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> must be compensated continuously over the entire sensor lifetime...|$|R
