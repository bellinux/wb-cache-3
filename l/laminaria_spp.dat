40|$|Dietary fibres {{consist of}} edible plant polysaccharides that are {{resistant}} to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine but undergo complete or partial fermentation in the colon. Seaweeds, notably <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp,</b> are particularly rich in polysaccharides resistant to hydrolysis in the upper gastrointestinal tract and are, in consequence, considered as dietary fibres. Most of the carbohydrates from <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp</b> {{are thought to be}} indigestible by humans. The main storage polysaccharide of these algae is laminarin, a beta-polymer of glucose. The aims of this work were, on the one hand, to compare various methods of extraction of laminarin by partial characterisation of the product obtained and, on the other hand, to study the fate of this polysaccharide and its effects in the gastrointestinal tract in order to determine its potential as a dietary fibre in human nutrition. Among four methods tested to extract laminarin, the best appeared to be a hot HCl-based method. Human digestive enzymes did not hydrolyse laminarin, so this polysaccharide can be considered as a dietary fibre. After ingestion by rats, this polysaccharide was not found in faeces of these animals. It did not increase the intestinal transit and stool output in vivo, but it increased the contractile response of the stomach to acetylcholine in vitro. (C) 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|The Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida (‘Wakame’) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} invasive non-native species in coastal marine habitats and is fast approaching cosmopolitan status, yet its interactions with native species are poorly understood. Within the Plymouth Sound (UK) Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Undaria has become a conspicuous and important component of assemblages in shallow rocky reef habitats, where it co-exists with native canopy-forming brown macroalgae. We examined the hypothesis that rocky reef habitats supporting dense macroalgal canopies will have more biotic resistance to the invasion of Undaria compared with reef habitats supporting disturbed or sparse native canopies. Field surveys were completed at two spatial scales and sampling resolutions, and a short-term field-based canopy removal experiment was conducted to examine the influence of native macroalgal assemblages on the abundance, cover, biomass and morphology of Undaria. Field surveys indicated that Undaria was negatively related to the cover of macroalgal ‘competitors’, particularly <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.</b> However, multiple, large Undaria sporophytes were observed within dense native canopies, suggesting that disturbance to, or the absence of, canopies is not a prerequisite for Undaria colonisation. The short-term canopy removal experiment indicated that Undaria functions primarily as a pioneer species in this system. Where native canopies were left intact, Undaria sporophytes were far less abundant and were generally smaller with lower biomass compared with those in disturbed patches. The spread of Undaria into natural habitats is inhibited by the presence of native competitors, particularly large perennial species such as <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.,</b> although the persistence of intact dense canopies does not completely prevent assimilation of Undaria into native assemblages...|$|E

40|$|Human activities, {{including}} overfishing {{and species}} introductions, {{have had a}} dramatic impact on benthic communities in the Gulf of Maine within the past two decades. Prior to the 1970 s, the climax community in the shallow subtidal was composed of <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.</b> kelp beds with an understory of arborescent red algae. In the 1980 s, a population explosion of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, created an alternate community state, urchin barrens. Recently, a new community has been observed in former urchin barrens and kelp beds. This assemblage is principally composed of the introduced species: Codium fragile subsp. tomentosoides (green alga), Membranipora membranacea (bryozoan), Diplosoma listerianum (tunicate), Bonnemaisonia hamifera (red alga) and the opportunistic species Mytilus edulis (mussel) and Desmarestia aculeata (brown alga). In addition to changes in relative abundance, many of these species have greatly expanded their distribution and habitat selection.

40|$|Two {{species of}} seaweed fly, Coelopa frigida (Fabricius) and Coelopa pilipes (Halliday) (both Diptera: Coelopidae: Coelopini), compete for {{resources}} within deposits of marine algae washed ashore on British beaches. Previous studies report that adult flies exhibit algal-specific behaviour {{that may influence}} interspecific interactions. It is predicted that coelopid larvae may also demonstrate algalspecific dietary preferences. Larval dietary preferences are investigated by comparing the ratios of 13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N in both wild flies and macroalgae to those of laboratory-reared flies. Results showed only a small difference between the stable isotope ratios of the most abundant algae, <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.</b> (Laminariaceae) and Fucus spp. (Fucaceae), although {{there were significant differences}} between wild adult coelopids. This result illustrates different metabolic processes in two closely related species. The stable isotope ratios of wild-caught coelopids were found to differ significantly from laboratory-reared coelopids. This is either the result of red algae in the diet of natural populations or a difference in bacterial communities. We suggest that experiments with laboratory-reared flies/specimens can greatly increase the utility of stable isotope analysis in the investigation of animal food webs, even where potential diets are isotopically similar. However, this approach is dependent on re-creations that accurately mimic natural conditions...|$|E
40|$|Recruitment and {{temporal}} variation in abundance of co-occurring species provide a non-equilibrial mechanism allowing their coexistence. Kelp blades (<b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> with colonies of the hydroid Obelia geniculata (L.) were collected over a 28 -month period from a subtidal study {{site in the}} southern Gulf of Maine (USA). Temporal and size frequency distribu-tions of nudibranchs (Dendronotus frondosus (Asca-nius), Doto coronata (Gmelin), Eubranchus exiguus (Alder & Hancock) and Tergipes tergipes (Forskal) coexisting on hydroid colonies were documented. Regression analyses correlated nudibranch abund-ances with habitat characteristics. In general, nudi-branchs were common and their abundances were highest in spring and summer, which coincided with peaks in abundance of O. geniculata. Denser and taller hydroid colonies had higher abundances of nudibranchs. Population growth of nudibranchs in O. geniculata occurred {{as a result of}} only recruitment processes. Increases in populations were not attribut-able to immigration of adult nudibranchs. Recruitment of juveniles was continuous throughout the census period. Each nudibranch population was dominated by juveniles and population structure was not consist-ent between generations. Equilibrium conditions in the present community are unlikely to occur or to persist significantly long for competitive exclusion to result. Therefore, the assemblage of nudibranchs appears to be structured by non-equilibrium pro-cesses perhaps similar to populations of phytopha-gous insects...|$|E

40|$|The {{non-native}} kelp, Undaria pinnatifida, {{is considered}} one of the world’s worst invasive species. The northeast Atlantic is a hotspot of Undaria invasion, yet there is limited knowledge on its invasion dynamics. In the UK its distribution is strongly associated with artificial structures, primarily marina and harbour pontoons, with relatively few records of Undaria on natural substrates. Here, the southwest UK is used as a case region, to explicitly link Undaria distribution-abundance patterns in artificial marina habitats with those in natural rocky reef habitats. Using a mixture of in situ recording and video survey techniques, Undaria was found at all thirteen marina sites surveyed; but in only 17 of 35 rocky reef sites, all of which were in 2 of the 5 larger systems surveyed (Plymouth Sound and Torbay). The distribution-abundance patterns of Undaria at reef sites were analysed using zero-inflated models. The probability of finding Undaria on rocky reef increased with increasing proximity to marinas with high abundances of Undaria. Total propagule pressure from marinas also increased the probability of occurrence, and was positively related to Undaria abundance and cover at reef sites. Increases in the cover of native kelps, <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.,</b> and wave exposure at reef sites were linked to a reduced probability of Undaria occurrence, and lower abundance and cover. Identifying high risk areas, natural boundaries and factors affecting the spread and abundance of non-native species in natural habitats is key to future management prioritisation. Where Undaria is confined to artificial substrates management may be deemed a low priority. However, the results of this study suggest that controlling the abundance and propagule pressure in artificial habitats may limit, to some extent, the spillover of Undaria into natural rocky reef habitats, where it has the potential to interact with and influence native communities...|$|E

Kelps (<b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.)</b> are one of the numerous species of brown seaweeds, a popular marine vegetable, which has been used as a source of iodine and minerals for centuries. Kelps contain anionic polysaccharides called fucoidans heteroglycans with L-fucose units. Their monosaccharide composition, physicochemical and bioactive properties vary between seaweed species. The objective of this work was to evaluate the bioactive properties of laminaria fucoidan (L. digitata and L. hyperborea) toward THP- 1 macrophages, a human macrophage like cell line, and investigate its potential antioxidant and immunomodulatory characteristics. Methods: THP- 1 macrophages were incubated with five fucoidan concentrations. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay was determined for cell lysates and for the fucoidan extract, in addition to Total Polyphenol Content (TPC). Cytotoxicity of fucoidan was assessed by light microscopy, followed by XTT proliferation assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) were performed to determine concentrations of the secreted tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and interleukin 10 (IL- 10). Results: Fucoidan did not affect macrophage ability to scavenge oxygen radicals (ORAC) confirming its antioxidant properties toward activated macrophages. The laminaria fucoidan extract at 100 mu g/ml concentration lowered macrophage viability. Lower concentrations of laminaria fucoidan did not have impact on cell viability. Very low concentration of fucoidan at 0. 1 mu g/ml triggered secretion of TNF-alpha. However, IL- 6 and interleukin IL- 10 were expressed when concentration of applied fucoidan was 10 mu g/ml indicating bioactivity of laminaria fucoidan through immunomodulatory actions. Conclusions: The study demonstrated how laminaria fucoidan may have bioactive properties towards THP- 1 macrophages. Changes in cytokine secretion between pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, and IL- 6) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokines confirmed bioactivity of the laminaria fucoidan extracts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to see the {{applicability}} of using brown edible seaweeds as a sole source of nutrition for the growth of lactic acid bacteria. Growth kinetics of lactic acid bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus plantarum) was studied using three species of edible Irish brown seaweeds Himanthalia elongata, Laminaria digitata and Laminaria saccharina. As part of the screening process, growth of the LAB was carried out on raw and heat treated forms of seaweeds. The seaweed species in their raw state could not support the growth of L. plantarum. Heat treatment resulted in almost 4 times increase in the total sugar content in L. digitata and L. saccharina broth which allowed the growth of L. plantarum for 24 h after which the cell number started decreasing. The <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.</b> contains a high content of laminaran polysaccharide which can be fermented by LAB. In case of H. elongata, neither raw nor heat treated forms could be fermented; even though the total sugar content increased 4. 6 times upon the application of heat. Kinetics of cell growth, lactic acid and acetic acid production was evaluated at different agitation rates in heat treated seaweeds. A maximum log CFU/ml of 10 was achieved at the end of 16 h to 24 h of fermentation for L. saccharina and L. digitata, respectively. The cell growth increased and lactic acid accumulation decreased as the agitation speed was increased from 0 to 100 rpm. Maximum lactic acid accumulation of 2. 5 g/l was achieved under static (0 rpm) conditions. The production of acetic acid was very minimal during the entire course of fermentation. Experimental data was mathematically modelled to optimize the cell growth and lactic acid production with respect to the different rotation conditions. The results of this study present an indication of the potential of fermentation of seaweeds using LAB with a possibility towards the development of a range of functional foods...|$|E
30|$|The pyrograms, {{and where}} relevant, {{identification}} of the peaks within them, {{may be used to}} differentiate between the formulations and provide information on their compositions. The major peaks found in Rygex occur in two regions of the pyrogram, the majority containing nitrogen consistent with the high nitrogen content of the sample. At less than 10  min, peaks correspond to carbon dioxide at retention times of 2.53  min, pyrrole 6.15  min., toluene 7.74  min and ethyl pyrrole, 7.74  min. In the region of 30 – 45  min, the peaks found were 2, 5 -diketopiperazines (DKPs) which are cyclic dipeptides, products obtained from thermal treatments of amino acids and proteins [49]. Major peaks included two isomers of cyclo(Pro-Ala) at retention times of 32.20 and 33.76  min; cyclo(Pro-Gly), 34.34  min; cyclo(Pro–Pro), 37.95  min; and two isomers of cyclo(Pro-Hyp), 41.65 and 42.58  min identified by their elution profiles from the analytical column and their mass spectra as reported in Fabbri et al. [50]. Extraction of ion current m/z 70 which {{can be attributed to the}} pyrrolidinium ion indicated the presence of minor amounts of other Pro-derived DKPs. Another component of the sample is seaweed extract from A. nodosum, Fucus spp. and <b>Laminaria</b> <b>spp.,</b> and the four main carbohydrates in these species alginic acid, fucoidan, laminarin and mannitol produce characteristic pyrolysis products which can be used to predict their presence [12, 43, 51]. No evidence was found for the presence of seaweed extract in this sample, with the exception of diannhydromannitol indicating the presence of mannitol, possibly due to seaweed extract being a minor component of the formulation. The peaks of the highest abundance produced upon pyrolysis of Algavyt are the early-eluting compounds CO 2 and acetaldehyde. The mass spectra of the broad peak centred at 20  min and other minor peaks identified as nitrogen-containing compounds are consistent with the high N content of the sample, 9.1  % p/p (Table  2). The broad peak was identified as urea which is present in manufacturer’s description of the formulation. The peak at 20.43  min dianhydromannitol is indicative of mannitol present as either free mannitol or laminarin [43]. Other pyrolysis products characteristic of polysaccharides were present but in low abundance. There is little diagnostic information to be obtained from the pyrogram of Algavit Zn/Mn. CO 2 is again the pyrolysis product of the highest abundance. However, there is no evidence of urea, despite the relatively high nitrogen content, and only traces of diannhydromannitol in the formulation. There are present minor amounts of pyrrole and other nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. For Ryzoset, the presence of several furan derivatives, such as 2 methylfuran, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran, furfural, Ethanone 1 -[2 -furanyl] and 5 -methyl- 2 -Furancarboxaldehyde, are good indicators for the pyrolysis of polysaccharides suggesting that polysaccharides are major components of the sample. The major peaks arising from pyrolysis of Manek are late eluters with retention time of > 35  min. The identity and high abundance of the volatiles produced are consistent with the pyrolysis of a product obtained from vegetable oil with a high fatty acid content. The mass spectra of these compounds are generally nonspecific due to the fragmentation of long hydrocarbon chains present in the compounds. The high abundance of these peaks can also be expected as this sample has the highest carbon content among those examined. Trimethylamine, acetaldehyde, indole and a series of substituted pyroles and other nitrogen heterocyclics comprise the majority of the peaks found in Ecoryg. The presence of numerous nitrogen-containing products is consistent with the manufacturers’ description of the product as being a mixture of amino acids peptides and proteins.|$|E
