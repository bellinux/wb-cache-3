5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance with as little weight as possible, tempered by the amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E

25|$|The term Triple Crown {{was first}} used when Gallant Fox won the three races in 1930, but the term did not enter {{widespread}} use until 1935 when his son Omaha repeated the feat. Sir Barton was then honored retroactively. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes. The date of each event is now set by the Kentucky Derby, which is always held on the first Saturday in May. The Preakness Stakes is currently held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held {{three weeks after the}} Preakness (five weeks after the Derby). The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is thus June 5, and the <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> June 11.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1885 the Malta Post Office was {{separated}} from the British Post Office after this had been consented back in 1883. The first definitives were issued with the values up to 1/-, with the colours reflecting Malta joining the UPU. The halfpenny {{was the same as}} the 1860 stamp except it was green. The stamps were designs of Queen Victoria like most British colonies, but also used the Maltese cross as a heraldic device. British stamps were no longer valid from this date except for mail from British military zones, where British stamps were used until 1979. A large format 5-shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911. Also in 1886, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio in Merchants Street, Valletta. Police stations in several villages began to sell stamps around 1891. Bollo personale, or postmen's personal handstamps, were used to indicate which postman delivered a particular letter. The earliest recorded use is 16 August 1888 while the <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> 29 September 1949.|$|E

Peter Guralnick, the magazine's reviewer, described it as [...] "great...

It is his involvement after all which comes as the surprise."

500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} declared [...] "s {{princess of}} America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself {{in charge of}} her life, as she did on Control (1986), or {{commander in chief of}} a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (Rhythm Nation 1814, from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, Janet, it's a cultural moment." [...] Claiming the album should bring her critical praise, the magazine concludes its review with the statement [...] "he princess of America's black royal family has announced herself sexually mature and surrendered none of her crown's luster in the process. Black women and their friends, lovers and children have a victory in Janet." [...] Robert Christgau originally gave the album an [...] "honorable mention" [...] in consumer guide for The Village Voice, wherein he complimented its erotic songs and cited [...] "Funky Big Band", [...] "Throb", and [...] "Be a Good Boy" [...] as highlights. Billboard magazine gave a positive review, stating [...] "estined to be an instant smash, Ms. Jackson's <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> a glamorous assortment of styles—pop, dance, R, rock, jazz, rap—each delivered with consummate skill and passion.

500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E

USA Today Edna Gundersen felt that [...] "Blink-182 bravely adheres to a single sober theme — a disintegrating romance — through 14 songs that adhere to its pop punk principles without recycling cartoonish accessories. Blink-182 is growing up, not growing stale." [...] Nick Catucci of The Village Voice called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and compared Blink-182 to fellow pop punk band Green Day's 2000 effort, Warning, writing, [...] "Let it be noted, however, that Warning searches for subject matter where Blink-182 searches for meaning." [...] Greg Kot of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Despite their newfound earnestness, [...] seem incapable of pretension. And in a career littered with songs about awkward moments, their <b>latest</b> <b>is</b> a dork classic." [...] Scott Shelter of Slant gave the album four stars, stating [...] "Giving up the fart jokes is risky business for Blink—but Blink-182 might just be the band's best album to date." [...] Among the more negative reviews, Jason Arnopp of Q felt the majority of material forgettable but commended it as [...] "some of their most imaginatively constructed work." [...] The A.V. Club Stephen Thompson believed [...] "The disc [...] meander in spots, and its most achingly sincere love songs become cloying." ...|$|E
