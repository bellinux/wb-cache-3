40|$|The present paper compares three {{different}} kinds of semiconductor gas sensing materials: metal oxides (MOX), hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). Whereas in MOX materials oxygen is the chemically reactive surface species, HD and a-Si:H are covalently bonded semiconductors with hydrogenterminated surfaces. We demonstrate that these dissimilar semiconductor materials exhibit {{the same kind of}} <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gas</b> response. This low-temperature response-mechanism is mediated by a thin layer of adsorbed water with the semiconductor materials themselves acting as pH sensors. In this adsorbate-limited state the gas sensitivity is limited to molecular species that can easily dissolve in H 2 O and subsequently undergo electrolytic dissociation. At higher temperatures, where a closed layer of adsorbed water can no longer exist, the gas response is limited by direct molecule-semiconductor interactions. In this latter mode of operation, MOX gas sensors respond to adsorbed gases according to their different oxidising or reducing properties. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), on the other hand, exhibits a significantly different cross sensitivity profile, revealing that gas-surface interactions may largely be restricted to analyte molecules with lone-pair and electron-deficient three-centre orbitals...|$|E

Third, a formula for <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gases</b> is given in a simpler and more convenient form than the previous one.

30|$|The {{variation}} of the CO 2 /SO 2 ratio {{is associated with a}} large {{variation of}} the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio from 3 to 300 (Fig.  8). A large SO 2 /H 2 S ratio is a common feature of high-temperature fumarolic gases and a small ratio is that of <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gases.</b> These features are commonly considered as a result of temperature dependence of sulfur redox reaction equilibrium (Giggenbach 1987; Symonds et al. 1994). Under an oxygen fugacity controlled by a solid-state buffer, such as QFM, temperature dependence of the H 2 /H 2 O ratio in the gas phase is small (Giggenbach 1987) and the large temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant of the reaction (1) results in a large SO 2 /H 2 S variation with temperature (Fig.  10 in de Moor et al. 2016). The decrease in SO 2 /H 2 S ratios from 300 to 3 can be caused by temperature decrease in an equilibrium magma degassing from 1000 to 770  °C under an oxygen fugacity buffer of ∆QFM[*]+[*] 1.3. The estimated temperature range agrees with the range of the apparent equilibrium temperatures (Table  1), and the highest temperature is a reasonable temperature of the erupting basaltic andesite magma.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of a Chandra observation of the galaxy cluster A 133, which has a cooling flow core, a central radio source, and a diffuse, filamentary radio source that has been classified as a radio relic. The X-ray image shows that the core has a complex structure. The most prominent feature is a "tongue" of emission that extends from the central cD galaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. Spectral analysis shows that the emission from the tongue is thermal emission from relatively cool gas at a temperature of 1. 3 keV. One possibility is that this tongue is produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities through {{the interaction between the}} cold gas around the cD galaxy and hot intracluster medium. We estimate the critical velocity and timescale for the KH instability to be effective for the cold core around the cD galaxy. We find that the KH instability can disrupt the cold core if the relative velocity is > 400 km s- 1. We compare the results with those of clusters in which sharp, undisrupted cold fronts have been observed; in these clusters, the <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gas</b> in their central regions has a more regular distribution.

40|$|We {{carry out}} {{high-resolution}} adaptive mesh refinement simulations of a cool core cluster, resolving the flow from Mpc scales down to pc scales. We do not (yet) include any AGN heating, focusing instead on cooling {{in order to}} understand how gas gets to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) {{at the center of the}} cluster. We find that, as the gas cools, the cluster develops a very flat temperature profile, undergoing a cooling catastrophe only in the central 10 - 100 pc of the cluster. Outside of this region, the flow is smooth, with no local cooling instabilities, and naturally produces very little <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gas</b> (below a few keV), in agreement with observations. The gas cooling in the center of the cluster rapidly forms a thin accretion disk. The amount of cold gas produced at the very center grows rapidly until a reasonable estimate of the resulting AGN heating rate (assuming even a moderate accretion efficiency) would overwhelm cooling. We argue that this naturally produces a thermostat which links the cooling of gas out to 100 kpc with the cold gas accretion in the central 100 pc, potentially closing the loop between cooling and heating. Isotropic heat conduction does not affect the result significantly, but we show that including the potential well of the brightest cluster galaxy is necessary to obtain the correct result. Also, we found that the outcome is sensitive to resolution, requiring very high mass resolution to correctly reproduce the small transition radius. 1...|$|E
40|$|A finite-volume based {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed for modeling hydrogen production by a tubular cell of solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE), {{taking into account the}} electrochemical reactions and heat/mass transfer effects. The model is composed of three systems of nonlinear equations that govern the electric current density, energy balance in the solid SOSE cell, and energy balance in the flow of steam and hydrogen. The simulated hydrogen production rate proportional to the applied potential agreed well with the experimental measurements published in the literature. The intermediate modeling results indicated that the activation effect dominate the overall cell overpotential due to low exchange current density through the SOSE cell electrodes. Thus, higher electrode activity was identified as an important factor for enhancing cell performance. Parametric modeling analyses were conducted to gain better understanding of the SOSE characteristics. It was found that <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gas</b> intake would cause a high temperature gradient in the tubular cell material at the inlet, possibly leading to a thermal expansion problem. The risk could be reduced by increasing the gas inlet temperature. It was also found that energy-efficient SOSE hydrogen production can be achieved by reducing the hydrogen content in the steam intake and regulating the steam intake flow rate to an optimum that minimizes the overall electrical and thermal requirements. More parametric modeling results are discussed in this paper.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} detector technologies to directly detect weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter are time projection chambers (TPCs) filled with dual-phase (liquid and gaseous) xenon. The hypothetical WIMP could scatter with atoms in the liquid and the transferred recoil energy would lead to a prompt light signal (S 1) and, after a drift time of ionisation electrons into the gas phase, to a secondary signal (S 2). Only a detection of a dark matter particle interaction can provide evidence beyond doubt for its existence and could potentially solve a puzzle that combines astroparticle physics and cosmology. To date, even the most sensitive detectors (filled with more than 100 kg of liquid xenon) could not produce indisputable proof of dark matter. In order to improve the sensitivity of future dual-phase xenon TPCs this thesis investigated the GridPix detector as an alternative for the detection of the S 2 signal. Unlike the typically used photomultiplier tubes, GridPix offers a lower radioactive content. This could reduce the intrinsic background of the TPC, hence making it more sensitive to small energy deposits. However, the studies showed that GridPix does not operate stably enough at the challenging conditions of high-purity, <b>low-temperature</b> <b>gas.</b> To test other detector technologies as well as to study xenon properties and data acquisition techniques, a small-scale dual-phase xenon TPC was built and commissioned at Nikhef: XAMS, a xenon facility at Amsterdam.

After different exposure times, the cells were harvested for RNA extraction and enumeration. The RNA was used to perform whole-transcriptome profiling using DNA microarrays. The transcriptome profile showed a large overlap with profiles obtained from conditions generating reactive oxygen species in B. cereus. However, excess radicals such as peroxynitrite, hydroxyl and superoxide could not be detected using radical-specific fluorescence staining. Lack of UV-specific responses including factors involved in DNA damage repair is in line with the absence of UV-specific emission in the afterglow of the nitrogen gas plasma as analysed using optical emission spectroscopy (OES).
