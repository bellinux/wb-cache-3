2500|$|The Berlin U-Bahn uses 750-volt DC {{electric}} trains {{that run}} on standard gauge ( [...] ) tracks. [...] The first trains were based on trams; they have a width of , and take their power from an upward facing third rail. [...] To accommodate greater passenger numbers without lengthening the trains—which would require costly extended platforms—trains that ran on lines built after World War I were required to be wider. [...] The original trains and lines, which continued to operate, were designated Kleinprofil (small profile), and the newer, wider trains and lines were designated Großprofil (<b>large</b> <b>profile).</b> [...] Großprofil trains are [...] wide, and take their power from a downward facing third rail. This is related to New York City's A Division and B Division systems, where the B Division trains are wider than A Division trains.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{information}} processing technologies are often applied to <b>large</b> <b>profiles</b> {{and result in}} detailed behavior analysis. Moreover, under the pretext of increased personalization and strong accountability, organizations exchange information to compile even <b>larger</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, the user is unaware about the amount and type of personal data kept in profiles, partially due to advanced interactions between multiple organizations during service consumption. In this paper, a formal approach to inspect privacy and trust in advanced electronic services is presented. It allows to express access and privacy policies of service providers. Also, the privacy properties of multiple authentication technologies are formally modeled. From this, meaningful privacy properties can be extracted based on varying trust assumptions. Feedback is rendered through automated reasoning, useful for both users and system designers. To demonstrate its practicability, the approach {{is applied to the}} design of a travel reservation system. status: publishe...|$|R

These were primarily contested between local-level clubs or regions/states. Elite domestic competitions did not emerge until the late twentieth century. These competitions have usually involved franchises rather than club or representative teams, and have focused on gaining a <b>larger</b> <b>profile</b> for the sport, as well as attracting greater sponsorship, investment and media coverage.|$|R

Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its <b>large</b> <b>profile</b> and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night.|$|E

5000|$|Line 10 of the Madrid Metro is {{the product}} of two lines, the former line 8 from Fuencarral to Nuevos Ministerios and the former Suburbano (also known as Line S) from Alonso Martínez to Aluche, this section being named line 10 in the 1980s, and {{formerly}} operated by FEVE until the management of Line S was transferred to the Community of Madrid. In the 1990s, Madrid planned for these two lines to become one, but there was a problem. Line 8 was <b>large</b> <b>profile</b> and Line S was Small profile, so Madrid decided it was going to rebuild the Suburbano section to fit <b>large</b> <b>profile</b> rolling stock, a feat that took five years to complete. During this process, all island platforms were demolished, tunnels were widened, platforms cut back and stations modernised. Also a new section between Alonso Martinez and Nuevos Ministerios had to be built, with an intermediate station at Gregorio Marañón. Finally once this was all finished, the whole line could use large rolling stock and the line was extended from the New Casa de Campo to Colonia Jardín. The section between Casa de Campo and Aluche was handed over to line 5 which now terminates at Casa de Campo.|$|E
