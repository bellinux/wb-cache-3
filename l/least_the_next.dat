5|$|In 1845, local {{members of}} the Church of England, {{as part of a}} {{petition}} calling for funding, stated that they had established a new school. By 1848 there was also a Wesleyan Sunday School with 20 students. By 1867 there was a secular state school in the town, though funding was inconstant and the school was closed for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two years. This school never grew large; as of 1903 it had an average attendance of 20 students.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 2–3 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 1.1 billion years.|$|E

25|$|There {{were reports}} of looting of Iraq's archaeological treasures, {{mostly from the}} National Museum of Iraq; up to an alleged 170,000 items, worth billions of U.S. dollars: these reports were later {{revealed}} to be vastly exaggerated.

25|$|Once the faulty {{stage is}} found, further probing can usually tell a skilled {{technician}} exactly which component has failed.

Exhibition at the Salon de Paris was essential for any artist to achieve success in France for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 200 years.

25|$|The {{area around}} Elsenborn Ridge became a {{collection}} point for ragtag groups of American troops whose units been broken and scattered {{at the start}} of the enemy offensive. With so many troops from different units arriving in every kind of condition, organizing a coherent defense was a huge task, but one that occurred with surprising speed under the circumstances. Intelligence about the attack that reached the Americans was spotty and contradictory. General Lauer, commanding officer of the 99th, ordered Col. Robertson at Wahlerscheid to stay put until at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning when more orders would be forthcoming. Robertson told his men to hold and he also prepared them for an orderly withdrawal in the morning.|$|E

25|$|Dean {{was criticized}} during his 2004 presidential {{campaign}} for another decision related to civil unions. Shortly before leaving office, {{he had some}} of his Vermont papers sealed for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade, a time frame longer than most outgoing governors use, stating that he was protecting the privacy of many gay supporters who sent him personal letters about the issue. On the campaign trail, he demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including Democratic Senator and failed 2004 presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{fear that}} the Americans might again attempt to conquer Canada {{remained}} a serious concern for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half century, and was the chief reason for the retention of a large British garrison in the colony. From the 1820s to the 1840s, there was extensive construction of fortifications, as the British attempted to create strong points around which defending forces might centre {{in the event of}} an American invasion; these include the Citadels at Quebec City and Halifax, and Fort Henry in Kingston. The Rideau Canal was built to allow ships in wartime to travel a more northerly route from Montreal to Kingston; the customary peacetime route was the St. Lawrence River, which constituted the northern edge of the American border, and thus was vulnerable to enemy attack and interference.|$|E
25|$|The 1996–97 {{season was}} a year of {{transition}} for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward Samaki Walker remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A. C. Green. By far {{the most important of}} these acquisitions was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near 20 ppg for at <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004–05 season.|$|E
