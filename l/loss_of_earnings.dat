On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane.

The current {{practice}} of Malaysian courts in calculating the award <b>of</b> damages for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> future <b>earnings</b> in personal injury and fatal accidents claims is the conventional multiplier-multiplicand approach without admitting any actuarial evidence.

This article attempts to develop actuarial models using the concept of human life value that {{can be used as a}} guide to determine the amount <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> future <b>earnings.</b> We believe this is where actuarial scientists need to play a role in developing a new scientific model in order to acquire an appropriate amount of award, which is relevant and satisfy both plaintiff and defendant...|$|R

25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} 1,000 {{households}} in rural Bangladesh found that direct payments to {{formal and informal}} healthcare providers and indirect costs (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> because of illness) associated with illness were deterrents to accessing healthcare from qualified providers. A community survey of 6,183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment than to men. The use of skilled birth attendant (SBA) services, however, rose from 2005 to 2007 among women from all socioeconomic quintiles except the highest. A health watch, a pilot community-empowerment tool, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh to improve the uptake and monitoring of public-health services.|$|E
25|$|This {{period was}} marked by a partial loss of Lisbon's {{economic}} vitality when Brazil became independent and its gold and other products no longer flowed into the capital. During the Cabralismo, the period from 1842 to 1846 when António Bernardo da Costa Cabral dominated Portuguese politics, noble titles were assigned {{to many of the}} more important bourgeoisie, as a compromise with the Conservative Party that had some success. With the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> from Brazil, dependence on the state became attractive for the leisure class, who feared competition from the neo-aristocrats and supported traditionally rigid social divisions. It was at this time that titles of 'Baron' and 'Viscount' multiplied among the landed property owners, many of them hereditary, but many others being limited {{to the life of the}} beneficiary receiving rents from the state or engaged in the corrupt politics of the time. The territorial aristocracy acquired the habit of spending the winters in Lisbon, staying in their manor houses (solars) only in summer. However, it was the common people who suffered most from the wars and the loss of Brazil, as the city's economy stagnated and it lost its international influence, going from the fifth most populous city in Europe to the tenth and continuing downward. Employment opportunities became more precarious and poverty again increased.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} examines whether, {{by virtue}} of the assumed commitments relative to information disclosure, the public companies differentiation, carried out by the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) according to distinct levels of corporate governance, provokes distinction in the conditional conservatism degree (identified by the asymmetric anticipation <b>of</b> economic <b>losses)</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> reported in the respective accounting statements. The premise adopted by Bovespa isthat the acceptance of differentiated information disclosure practices and ownership protection corporate rules would lead to accounting information of higher quality, with consequent: (i) risk reduction; and (ii) return increment for investors. The statements quality measurement is carried out employing measurement models of the conditional conservatism present in the accounting reports, based on the reversion of transitory components in profits and in the association of accruals with cash flows, assessed by regression using panel data. The research results confirm the raised hypothesis that there is not any differentiation in the conditional conservatism patterns <b>of</b> reported <b>earnings,</b> not evidencing timely asymmetric anticipation <b>of</b> economic <b>losses</b> in the balance sheets of public companies listed at Bovespa in any of the groups...|$|R

A British prize crew sailed her to Portsmouth where she was purchased by the Admiralty on 29 April for a sum of £4,258 (...) [...] This purchase price caused dissent among Tartars crew as Portsmouth's merchants had made a counter-offer of more than £5,000, the acceptance of which would have increased the prize money.
