5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the <b>lacrimal.</b> This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the <b>lacrimal</b> in Tarbosaurus. The <b>lacrimal</b> was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, <b>lacrimal,</b> frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the <b>lacrimal</b> and postorbital bones, {{projected}} {{into the}} eye socket {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly outwards in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing some degree of binocular vision. The <b>lacrimal</b> and postorbital also met above the eye socket, to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the <b>lacrimal</b> bone. The <b>lacrimal</b> horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E
5000|$|... eleven {{bones of}} the viscerocranium—, two nasal bones, two maxillae, two <b>lacrimals,</b> two palatines, two {{inferior}} nasal conchae, and the vomer.|$|R
50|$|Galesaurus has large, {{pentagonal}} shaped <b>lacrimals</b> {{with a flat}} outer surface. A fossa {{is present}} medial to the crista lacrimalis. This fossa is connected by two canals, one above the other, to the lacrimonasal canal that opens into the nasal cavity. The prefrontals extend halfway along {{the border of the}} <b>lacrimals</b> until they meet the postorbitals at the middle of the upper border of the orbits, forming the upper orbital margin. As in other cynodonts, the frontal is excluded from the orbital margin by the prefrontal and postorbital.|$|R
50|$|The {{orbits of}} Dissorophus are {{relatively}} large, circular, and oriented dorsally than laterally. As DeMar describes, the orbits are {{large enough to}} intersect with the frontals, palatines, post orbitals, <b>lacrimals,</b> and jugals.|$|R
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and <b>lacrimal</b> bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Maxillae and a <b>lacrimal</b> (the main tooth-bearing {{bones of}} the upper jaw, and the bone that forms the {{anterior}} margin of the eye socket, respectively) recovered in 1999 by the Sino-Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to Velociraptor, {{but not to the}} type species V. mongoliensis. Pascal Godefroit and colleagues named these bones V. osmolskae (for Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska) in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include <b>lacrimal,</b> parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
50|$|The nasals of Thrinaxodon are pitted with a {{large number}} of foramina, giving the {{impression}} that this synapsid had whiskers. The nasals narrow anteriorly and expand anteriorly and articulate directly with the frontals, pre-frontals and <b>lacrimals,</b> however, there is no interaction with the jugals or the orbitals. The maxilla of Thrinaxodon is also heavily pitted with foramina.|$|R
5000|$|The name Eosuchus {{was first}} used in 1907 to {{describe}} a single specimen found from northern France near the Belgian border, assigned to the type species E. lerichei. A second species, E. minor, was named in 2006 from material found from the United States, having been referred {{in the past to}} several different genera of crocodilians. E. minor differs from E. lerichei {{on the basis of a}} noticeably wider nasal and prefrontals positioned anteriorly further up the skull than the <b>lacrimals</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Using karyotypic, morphological, and {{molecular}} data, we compared Hynobius yunanicus with a sympatric species, Pachyhynobius shangchengensis. Similar to P. shangchengensis, H. yunanicus has a {{diploid chromosome number}} of 64, with five large pairs, six medium pairs, and 21 microchromosome pairs. In both H. yunanicus and P. shangchengensis, the vomerine teeth are arranged in two arched series, the <b>lacrimals</b> do not reach the orbits but are {{in touch with the}} external nares, and a gap between the pterygoid and maxillary is always present. The two species not only clustered together on a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data but also share an identical haplotype. Therefore, H. yunanicus is not a valid species but a synonym of P. shangchengensis...|$|R
5|$|The <b>lacrimal</b> fossa, a {{depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (eye socket) in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader. The ridge on the <b>lacrimal</b> bone is better developed, the palate is broader, the frontal bones contain a depression and are swollen at the sides, the mastoid bones are smaller, and the coronoid and angular processes of the mandible (lower jaw) are more prominent.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Acrocanthosaurus, {{like most other}} allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening {{in front of the}} eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, {{more than a quarter of}} the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they {{continued}} onto the <b>lacrimal</b> bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike Allosaurus, there was no prominent crest on the <b>lacrimal</b> bone in front of the eye. The <b>lacrimal</b> and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in Giganotosaurus, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.|$|E
50|$|On {{the skull}} roof of Thrinaxodon, the fronto-nasal suture {{represents}} an arrow shape {{instead of the}} general transverse process seen in more primitive skull morphologies. The prefrontals, which are slightly anterior and ventral to the frontals exhibit a very small size and {{come in contact with}} the post-orbitals, frontals, nasals and <b>lacrimals.</b> More posteriorly on the skull, the parietals lack a sagittal crest. The cranial roof is the narrowest just posterior to the parietal foramen, which is very nearly circular in shaped. The temporal crests remain quite discrete throughout the length of the skull. The temporal fenestra have been found with ossified fasciae, giving evidence of some type of a temporal muscle attachment.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the <b>lacrimals,</b> and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|R
50|$|Tetanurans {{have two}} basic skull morphologies. The first skull type, typical in large theropods such as Allosaurus, is common within ceratosaurs {{and may be}} {{primitive}} for tetanurans. In this type, the skull is about three times longer than tall, with a blunter snout and frequent elaborations such as horns or spikes along the <b>lacrimals,</b> nasals, and frontals. In the second skull type, the skull is lower and longer, with a less elaborated skull roof and a more elongated snout. Shared tetanuran features include the maxillary fenestra (an opening in the antorbital fossa), a pneumatic excavation in the jugal, and {{the position of the}} maxillary teeth anterior to the orbit. The posterior skull is little modified in tetanurans, except within Spinosauridae.|$|R
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the <b>lacrimal</b> on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the <b>lacrimal</b> bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Inside the <b>lacrimal</b> {{bones were}} {{depressions}} {{that may have}} held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as Ceratosaurus and Marshosaurus; {{they may have been}} related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.|$|E
50|$|Arbour also {{provided}} a list of traits in which P. grangeri and P. mephistocephalus differed from each other. P. grangeri has a notch in the snout armour just above the innermost nostril opening. P. mephistocephalus has squamosal horns extending to behind beyond {{the rear of the}} skull roof, their points representing the widest point of the skull, instead of the upper rims of the eye sockets. P. mephistocephalus also has a clear transverse narrowing of the skull roof at level of the <b>lacrimals,</b> {{just in front of the}} eye sockets. It had been suggested that the rear skull roof of P. mephistocephalus was more convex but Arbour concluded it essentially had the same curvature. The holotype of P. mephistocephalus has very long cheek horns but a juvenile specimen, MPC 100/1344, found as part of a P. grangeri group, shows a similar elongation.|$|R
50|$|The holotype YPM VPPU 022404 {{consists}} of an incomplete skull which includes postorbital horns, parts of the frontals, prefrontals, and <b>lacrimals,</b> parts of the right squamosal and parietals, the occipital condyle {{and parts of the}} supraoccipital. Several other specimens are known which have similar squamosal bones, but all are very incomplete. Judiceratops shows a distinctive combination of characters, not seen in any previously described ceratopsid. Its frill (parietal bone) has a broad midline bar, a rounded caudal margin, and highly reduced osteoderms (bony projections) on the rear edge of the frill, the epiparietals. The osteoderms which project {{from the side of the}} frill and formed by the squamosal (episquamosals), are enlarged forward but decrease in size towards the back. The postorbital (located above the eyes) horns are moderately elongate, inclined forward and outwards, and have an unusual teardrop-shaped cross section.|$|R
50|$|A fifth species, S. shunanensis, was {{described}} in 2005 from the Middle Jurassic of Zigong in Sichuan, China. Skulls were collected from the Dashanpu Dinosaur Quarry in 1983, having {{been found in the}} Lower Shaximiao Formation. S. shunanensis has a longer snout than other species, being around three times the length of the postorbital region, or the portion of the skull behind the eyes. It also has a wider skull table than other species. The skull is widest at the back rather than between the eyes, a feature only seen in S. shunanensis. Near the back of each maxilla there is a distinct depression. There are unique ridges {{across the surface of the}} skull, one pair at the front of the eye socket on the <b>lacrimals,</b> and a second along the sides of the bacioccipitals and the undersurfaces of the exoccipitals at the base of the skull.|$|R
5|$|The false potto {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small potto, {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the humerus, or upper arm bone), a <b>lacrimal</b> fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The <b>lacrimal</b> bone is relatively large. At it is a single <b>lacrimal</b> canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and <b>lacrimal</b> bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the <b>lacrimal</b> bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
50|$|Rukwasuchus {{is known}} from its holotype, RRBP 08630, a well-preserved rear {{part of the}} skull {{including}} the cranial table, braincase, and interorbital region lacking the rostrum, the front portion of the palate, both <b>lacrimals,</b> jugals, and quadratojugals, {{as well as the}} mandible. RRBP 08630 was collected during 2008 at Namba 2 locality (also known as RRBP 2007-02), together with the titanosaurian Rukwatitan bisepultus which is exclusive to this locality. Material referred to Rukwasuchus includes four isolated teeth, which came from the neighboring localities RRBP 2007-01 yielding the 3 teeth RRBP 07351, 07369, 09362, and RRBP 2009-01 yielding the tooth RRBP 09367. All specimens came from approximately 25 km south of Lake Rukwa in the Galula Study Area, Rukwa Rift Basin of southwestern Tanzania, belonging to the Namba Member of the Galula Formation which dates to the late Aptian or possibly early Cenomanian stage of the middle Cretaceous, approximately 100 mya.|$|R
50|$|The skulls of the {{earliest}} tetrapods closely resembled those of their ancestors amongst the lobe-finned fishes. The skull roof is formed {{of a series of}} plate-like bones, including the maxilla, frontals, parietals, and <b>lacrimals,</b> among others. It is overlaying the endocranium, corresponding to the cartilaginous skull in sharks and rays. The various separate bones that compose the temporal bone of humans are also part of the skull roof series. A further plate composed of four pairs of bones forms the roof of the mouth; these include the vomer and palatine bones. The base of the cranium is formed from a ring of bones surrounding the foramen magnum and a median bone lying further forward; these are homologous with the occipital bone and parts of the sphenoid in mammals. Finally, the lower jaw is composed of multiple bones, only the most anterior of which (the dentary) is homologous with the mammalian mandible.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the <b>lacrimals,</b> and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|R
5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; and the relatively limited contact between the <b>lacrimal</b> and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the <b>lacrimal</b> and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and <b>lacrimal</b> bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E
50|$|Kryostega {{is a large}} temnospondyl {{amphibian}} {{from the}} Early or Middle Triassic of Antarctica. The genus {{is based on a}} single specimen collected in 1986 by a team led by paleontologist William H. Hammer of Augustana College, and now housed in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 24419). The holotype consists of an incomplete snout, including portions of both the right and left premaxilla, a partial left maxilla, both <b>lacrimals,</b> {{a small portion of the}} left nasal, the vomer, and a fragment of the palatine. Many partial teeth are preserved, though most have been broken away at their bases. The preserved part of the skull measures 27 cm long and 21 cm wide, from which a total skull length on about one meter has been inferred (Sidor et al., 2008; p. 657). Total body length has been estimated at 4.57 meters. The specimen suffered some damage during excavation, and the ventral surface is better preserved than the dorsal side of the fossil. Presently, only a single species is recognized, K. colllinsoni, named in honor of Antarctic scientist Jim Collinson.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Acristavus, MOR 1155, was recovered at the Two Medicine Formation, in Teton County, Montana. The specimen was collected in 1999 by C. Riley Nelson in well-indurated tan colored calcareous sandstone that was deposited during the Campanian {{stage of the}} Cretaceous period, approximately 79 million years ago. [...] MOR 1155 consists of an almost complete skull with associated postcrania including eleven cervical vertebrae, three incomplete dorsal vertebrae, a proximal caudal vertebra, several dorsal ribs, the left humerus, the left ulna, the right sternal, the left pubis, the left femur, the left tibia, two left metatarsals, five left pedal phalanges and one right pedal phalanx. A second specimen UMNHVP 16607 assigned to Acristavus in 2011, was excavated from the Smokey Mountain Road locality in Middle Mudstone Member of the Wahweap Formation in Utah. It was collected by C. R. Nelson in 2000, in lithified, yellow sandstone believed {{to be from the}} same time period as the type specimen. UMNHVP 16607 consists of a partial articulated skull, including both <b>lacrimals,</b> a complete braincase, and a cervical vertebra.|$|R
2500|$|Nearly all {{external}} skull bones {{have been}} preserved among Europasaurus specimens, except the prefrontals. Some additional bones are only represented by very fragmented and uninformative fossils, {{such as the}} <b>lacrimals.</b> Eight premaxillae are known, with a generally rectangular snout shape as found in Camarasaurus. The anterior projection of the premaxilla identified in Sander et al. (2006) was re-identified as a preservational artifact in Marpmann et al. (2014), similar to the anatomy found in Camarasaurus and Euhelopus to a lesser degree. The dorsal projection of the premaxilla, the one which contacts the nasal bone, begins as a postero-dorsal projection, before becoming straight vertical {{at the point of}} the subnarial foramen, until it reaches the nasal. This weak [...] "step" [...] is seen in Camarasaurus and Euhelopus, and is present more strongly in Abydosaurus, Giraffatitan and a possible skull of Brachiosaurus. These latter taxa also have a longer snout, with more distance from the first tooth until the nasal process of the premaxilla. As well, Europasaurus shares with the basal camarasauromorphs (brachiosaurids, Camarasaurus, Euhelopus and Malawisaurus) a similarly sized orbit and nasal fenestra, whereas the nasal opening is significantly reduced in derived titanosaurs (Rapetosaurus, Tapuiasaurus and Nemegtosaurus).|$|R
