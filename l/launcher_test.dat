40|$|The EPS stage, {{the second}} upper {{stage of the}} Ariane 5 launcher, was tested in the <b>launcher</b> <b>test</b> stand in Lampoldshausen, Germany {{during the second half}} of 1994. The precalculations of its {{structural}} dynamic behaviour revealed the possibility of the occurrence of severe so-called POGO vibrations. In order to monitor and control the occurrence of these unstable variations, a so-called "red-line" system was developed based on modal data. Structural identification tests were performed by DLR to acquire a reliable data basis for POGO risk control. The tests comprised frequency response functions and free decay measurements.

40|$|During {{atmospheric}} {{ascent of}} launcher configurations, a massively separated flow {{environment in the}} base region of the launcher can generate strong low frequency wall pressure fluctuations. The nozzle structure can be subjected to dynamic loads resulting from these pressure fluctuations. The loads are usually most severe during the high dynamic pressure phase of flight at transonic speeds and the aerodynamic excitation can induce a response of the structural modes called buffeting. In order to obtain a deeper insight into base buffeting related to the Ariane 5 launch vehicle, a set of experiments was performed in the DNW HST wind tunnel in close cooperation with the utilization of modern CFD tools (hybrid RANS/LES). During the test campaign a 1 / 60 scale Ariane 5 <b>launcher</b> <b>test</b> article was utilized, and detailed unsteady pressure measurements in the base region of the model were {{for the first time}} performed in conjunction with time resolved velocity field measurements using PIV.

50|$|After {{the failure}} to launch of Britain’s Blue Streak Missile, Britain wished to use its {{finished}} space launch parts in order to cut losses. In 1961, Britain and France announced {{that they would be}} working together on a launcher that would be capable of sending a one-ton satellite into space. This cooperation was later drafted into the Convention of the European Launcher Development Organization, which Italy, Belgium, West Germany, the Netherlands and Australia would join. Australia, although not a part of Britain, {{as a member of the}} British Commonwealth and wartime ally, provided a sparsely populated missile <b>launcher</b> <b>testing</b> and development site at Woomera, South Australia.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present some aspects {{regarding}} the computational model and technical solutions for multistage suborbital <b>launcher</b> for <b>testing</b> (SLT) used to test spatial equipment and scientific measurements. The computational model consists in numerical simulation of SLT evolution for different start conditions. The launcher model presented will be with six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) and variable mass. The results analysed will be the flight parameters and ballistic performances. The discussions area will focus around the technical possibility to realize a small multi-stage launcher, by recycling military rocket motors. From technical point of view, the paper is focused on national project “Suborbital <b>Launcher</b> for <b>Testing</b> ” (SLT), which is based on hybrid propulsion and control systems, obtained through an original design. Therefore, while classical suborbital sounding rockets are unguided and they use as propulsion solid fuel motor having an uncontrolled ballistic flight, SLT project is introducing a different approach, by proposing the creation of a guided suborbital launcher, which is basically a satellite launcher at a smaller scale, containing its main subsystems. This is why the project itself can be considered an intermediary step in the development of a wider range of launching systems based on hybrid propulsion technology, which may have a major impact in the future European launchers programs. SLT project, as it i...|$|R

The analyses were conducted with the present configuration of the VLM- 1 Carrier, which is close to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the Vehicle. VLM- 1 is a three-staged solid propellant rocket, capable of scientific suborbital and microsatellite launches. The first two stages feature identical S 50 solid rocket motors with thrust vector control and a fixed-nozzle, spin stabilized S 44 solid rocket motor in third stage on top. Its maiden flight will take place at Alcantara launch site (Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara) in Brazil. VLM- 1 unites flightproven, robust sounding rocket heritage technology and hardware, newly developed motors and structures, and advanced control systems in order to provide efficient launch services.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, studies of flat or pancake type electromagnetic launcher systems are described. The studies involved the development of several numerical models, and are supported throughout by experimental investigation. The models {{were based on a}} coaxial filamentary division technique, and the results they provided were compared with those from a commercial electromagnetic finite element modelling package. They were used to investigate some of the many possible launcher structures and power supply arrangements, as part of a wide-ranging parametric study. The aim of this thesis was to gain an insight into the factors that affect the performance of the launchers. Several different techniques were implemented to reduce the computation time. Practical experimentation provided a clear demonstration of the launcher technology, and supplied valuable model validation data. To aid the experimental work new projectile speed and yaw measurement systems were developed, and these were supported by results from a high-speed camera. A novel dual projectile <b>launcher</b> was <b>tested,</b> and was shown to improve the launch efficiency and to operate at higher energies, due to the reduction in drive coil recoil.

50|$|Sasamoto's team {{then moved}} to Valencia, Spain where they visited a {{fireworks}} factory and built and tested a full-scale Prometeo prototype. It was {{at this stage of}} development that the flame-throwers were calibrated and the firework <b>launchers</b> were <b>tested.</b> After completing testing, Sasamoto returned to Japan and oversaw construction of the show-use Prometeo, which was manufactured by a firm specializing in precision machinery. After manufacturing, the show-use Prometeo was tested for 2 months in water conditions and installed in a 6-meter deep pit, which was constructed in the Mediterranean Harbor lagoon. The crucial difficulties worked out at this stage were ensuring that the electronics, flame-throwers, and fireworks could function even when underwater. Corsini also traveled to Japan, where he spent 1 month working out the lighting with the Japanese staff. Due to the park remaining open during this time, testing the light and water controls, as well as training the crew to use them, was conducted after the park closed each night at 11 pm. The size of the show-use Prometeo was 14 meters tall and 32 meters wide; the show-use Bellisea was 11 meters tall. The final development and production cost of BraviSEAmo! was 3 billion yen (nearly $37 million in 2011 dollars).|$|R
5000|$|The {{prototype}} <b>launcher</b> was <b>tested</b> aboard [...] in 1941, {{but there}} were no submarine kills until November 1942, after it had been installed aboard one hundred ships. Initial success rates - of about 5% - were only slightly better than depth charges. Swells and spray frequently covered the launcher during heavy North Atlantic weather, and subsequent attempts to launch often revealed firing circuit problems launching an incomplete pattern. The disappointment of a quiet miss discouraged crews who might otherwise assume depth charge explosions had damaged their target or at least frightened the enemy. The Royal Navy launched Hedgehog so seldom in early 1943 that a directive was issued ordering captains of ships equipped with hedgehog to report why they had not used Hedgehog on an underwater contact. The results were blamed on crew inexperience and low confidence in the weapon. However, after an officer from the DMWD was sent to Londonderry Port, where the convoy crews were based, with better training and shipwide talks on examples of successful Hedgehog attacks, the kill rate improved considerably. By the end of the war, statistics showed that on average, one in every five attacks made by Hedgehog resulted in a kill (compared to less than one in 80 with depth charges).|$|R
