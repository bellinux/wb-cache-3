5|$|March 2009 {{recommendations}} from the USPSTF {{on the use}} of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E

5|$|Long-term use of benzodiazepines {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased risk of cognitive impairment, but its relationship with dementia remains inconclusive. The association of a past history of benzodiazepine use and cognitive decline is unclear, with some studies reporting a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cognitive decline in former users, some finding no association and some indicating an increased risk of cognitive decline.|$|E
30|$|Children {{whose parents}} attain {{secondary}} or higher education have <b>lower</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> dying {{compared with those}} of parents without education. However, children whose parents possessed primary education had higher risks. Results for wealth indicator show that, compared with children from the poorest index households, those from the richest have <b>lower</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> mortality, while results for the other categories are not significant. Working women have higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> child mortality compared with those not working. Children from households with electricity, improved toilet facilities, and who source their water from a pipe and those delivered at hospitals have <b>lower</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> dying compared with their other counterparts. Results on mass media reflect that children whose mothers listen to radio {{at least once a week}} have higher <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> mortality while estimates for television and newspaper are not significant. Results for type of cooking fuel are equally not significant.|$|R

5|$|People who eat a healthy, Japanese, or Mediterranean diet have a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AD. A Mediterranean diet {{may improve}} {{outcomes}} {{in those with}} the disease. Those who eat a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk. The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that circumcision is associated with <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer. A 2015 meta-analysis found a reduced risk of prostate cancer associated with circumcision in black men. A 2016 meta-analysis found that men with prostate cancer {{were less likely to be}} circumcised.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{heart attack or}} stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested {{as a component of}} a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red wine, is associated with <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E

5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E

5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Daily {{consumption}} of green tea is {{significantly correlated with}} a <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death from any cause; an increase of one cup of green tea per day is linked with a 4% <b>lower</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> death from any cause.
