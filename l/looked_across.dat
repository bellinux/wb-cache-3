5|$|Huang Na {{went missing}} on 10 October 2004; she {{was last seen}} at a food court near the {{wholesale}} centre, barefoot and wearing a blue denim jacket and bermuda shorts. From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks, Shuying <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the island for her daughter. The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|Sir Robert McClure was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} the Northwest Passage in 1851 when he <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> McClure Strait from Banks Island and viewed Melville Island. However, this strait was not navigable to ships at that time. The only usable route linking the entrances of Lancaster Sound and Dolphin and Union Strait was discovered by John Rae in 1854.|$|E
25|$|When the Antigonish {{movement}} {{looked for}} external allies in credit union development, {{it did not}} seek them from the movement in Quebec, where Alphonse Desjardins had founded the first credit union movement in North America three decades earlier. Instead, it <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the border to the United States – to Roy Bergengren and Credit Union National of America. Bergengren drafted a credit union law for Nova Scotia that was ratified by the provincial legislature in 1932.|$|E

500|$|In the {{preceding}} weeks and hours, Ike Clanton had repeatedly threatened Doc Holliday and the Earps. The Earps {{were tired of}} the threats. Martha J. King was in Bauer's butcher shop on Fremont Street. She testified that when the Earp party passed by her location, one of the Earps {{on the outside of}} the group <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> and said to Doc Holliday nearest the store, [...] "...let them have it!" [...] to which Holliday replied, [...] "All right." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there. He said, ‘You’ve {{got to make a}} film in Antarctica. It’s just like out here, in the wasteland. It’s spectacular.’ And that always stuck in my head.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Surrey was {{incorporated}} in 1879, and encompasses land formerly {{occupied by a}} number of Halqemeylem-speaking aboriginal groups. When Englishman H.J. Brewer <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the Fraser River from New Westminster and saw a land reminiscent of his native County of Surrey in England, the settlement of Surrey was placed on the map. The area then comprised forests of douglas-fir, fir, red cedar, hemlock, blackberry bushes, and cranberry bogs. A portion of present-day Whalley (named after Harry Whalley, who owned and operated a gas bar at the bend in King George Blvd, (formerly King George Highway) at 108 Avenue, [...] "Whalley's Corner") was used as a burial ground by the Kwantlen (or Qw’ontl’en) Nation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{homes built}} in the town were streets of terraced houses with busy corner shops and public houses on almost every corner, following {{the contours of the}} headland and in the rapidly expanding Cogan area near the docks. Local grey limestone, quarried from what is now Cwrt-y-vil playing fields, gave a particular character to the surviving older buildings of the town. To the south of the town centre, imposing detached villa residences along the cliff tops <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the Channel to the Somerset coast and the islands of Flat Holm (...) and Steep Holm (...) [...] The villas were built by wealthy shipping and dock owners from Cardiff who were moving out of the industrialised city for a more genteel and sophisticated lifestyle.|$|E
2500|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> {{the great}} square, {{and could not}} believe my eyes. It was {{surrounded}} by manicured lawns, covered by flower beds on which bloomed bright red flowers. A wide street, {{which led to a}} large open area, was flanked by two rows of wooden barracks, on both sides stood rows of young trees and along the roadside ran straight flower beds {{as far as the eye}} could see. The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks (stolzierten) and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, [...] "Mama". I wondered, [...] "this is [...] a concentration camp"? ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neill {{was also}} {{put off by}} Carter's frugal {{behavior}} in cutting executive staff and reducing the scale of White House entertaining. Carter, a Southern Baptist, even ended the practice of serving alcohol other than beer and wine at the White House. As Carter's term began in early 1977, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were invited to the White House for a breakfast with the new President, where Carter served them sugar cookies and coffee. O'Neill, a man of expansive appetite, expected the until-then-traditional eggs and sausage. He <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the table at Carter and said, [...] "Mr. President... you know, we won the election." [...] Carter was a reform-minded executive who often clashed with O'Neill on legislation. The Speaker wanted to reward loyal Democrats with rewarding projects {{at a time when}} Carter wanted to reduce government spending. A continuing weak economy and the Iran hostage crisis made prospects bleak for Carter and the Democrats in the 1980 congressional and presidential elections.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, {{the series}} has {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most bitter and hateful rivalries in college sports. In the early football match ups, the sidelines would be occupied by Civil War Veterans from both sides. They once stood across from each other on the battlefield, now they <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> an athletic field. The emotions of an actual war once fought between the states became infused into the athletic contests between the 2 institutions. Overtime, even the coaches have gotten into the rivalry. Former Kansas football coach Don Fambrough, when referred to a physician across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri, for treatment, exclaimed [...] "I'll die first!" [...] Not to be outdone, Missouri's former basketball coach Norm Stewart would traditionally have his players stay in Kansas City, Missouri, before playing at Kansas, going so far as to require the team bus to buy its gasoline at a Missouri filling station and reprimanding players who ate in Kansas, as he did not want to put any money into Kansas' economy.|$|E
2500|$|Star Treks {{contributions}} to TV history include giving women jobs of respect, most notably through the casting of Nichelle Nichols, a black actress, as Uhura, the ship's communications officer. Black actresses {{at that time}} on TV were almost always cast as servants. In fact, Whoopi Goldberg recalled {{that the first time}} she saw Uhura, she excitedly told her mother: [...] "Mama, there's a black woman on television and she ain't no maid!" [...] In an interview, Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told there was a big fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I <b>looked</b> <b>across</b> the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face.
