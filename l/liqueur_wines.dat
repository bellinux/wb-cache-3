Under the {{ownership}} of Johannes Colijn Klein Constantia {{continued to be a}} standard bearer for Cape wine. In the 1770s, Groot Constantia was sold to a businessman from Stellenbosch named Hendrik Cloete, who replanted the vineyards and rebuilt the cellars in an attempt to revive the reputation of the estate. He employed nearly 100 slaves and stationed them throughout the vineyard, charged with ensuring that not a single insect landed on the vines. It was Cloete's dedication (and later that of his son, also named Hendrik) that raised the prestige of the estate and led to its prompt discovery by the invading British. In his 1816 work, Topographie de Tous les Vignobles Connus, the French oenologist André Jullien included the wines of Constantia in the highest category of his expansive quality classification of the world's wine. Ranking it just below the wines of Tokay, Jullien described the dessert wine of Constantia as [...] "...among the finest <b>liqueur</b> <b>wines</b> of the world...".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the oenological profile and antioxidant properties of selected Polish grape and fruit wines. The wines produced in Golesz Vineyard in Podkarpacie and commercially available fruit wines were the experimental material. The analysed wines, except Seyval Blanc &# 8211; the white grape wine, were charac-terized by a relatively high amount of total extract (10. 5 - 18. 8 % m/v). The ethanol concen-tration in wines was at the similar level, only the cider, as a low-alcohol beverage, con-tained 5. 7 % (v/v) of ethanol. The red wines had the higher antioxidant potential and total polyphenol content than analyzed white grape and fruit wines. The prevailing volatile compounds of wines were higher alcohols, mainly amyl alcohols and isobutanol.

40|$|Interlaboratory {{studies are}} decisive tools {{to help the}} {{validation}} of a specific analytical methodology or to assess the reproducibility {{of the use of}} different methods to analyze a given compound or compounds in certain sample matrices. In this work, homogeneous samples of two white wines (“White Wine” and “White Liqueur Wine”) and one red wine (“Red Fortified Wine”) from Portugal with different production techniques and characteristics, namely in alcohol strength (10. 5 %, 16. 0 % and 19. 0 % ethanolic content, respectively), were analyzed for their contents in ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin generated from fungal contamination. White <b>Liqueur</b> <b>Wine</b> was naturally contaminated, whereas the other two wine type were spiked with ethanolic OTA solutions. The participation of 24 laboratories from 17 countries of five continents was ensured for this study. Although with no restrictions in terms of analytical methodology to employ, 75 % of the laboratories resorted to immunoaffinity columns clean-up followed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD), most of them in accordance with the European Standard EN 14133. For White Wine samples, the general mean OTA concentration was 1. 96 μg/l (two outliers) with interlaboratorial standard deviation (sL) of 0. 53 μg/l; for White <b>Liqueur</b> <b>Wine,</b> mean of 1. 59 μg/l (one outlier), with sL = 0. 59 μg/l; and for Red Fortified Wine, mean of 2. 73 μg/l (no outliers), with sL = 0. 96 μg/l. Outliers were determined by Cochran and Grubbs tests. The Horrat index, recommended by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) for the quality assurance of the collaborative study was, on average, 1. 7.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how various drinking establishments figured in the delineation of social boundaries within Mexico City’s urban {{space in the}} long nineteenth century.

The increasing segregation of more popular drinking places such as pulquerías and vinaterías into poorer, more peripheral parts of Mexico City and of cafés, as more elite social spaces, into wealthier, more central parts of the city contributed to the demarcation of social boundaries within Mexico City and conceptual boundaries of class within the imagined Mexican nation. Moreover, this article shows how various social actors, including proprietors and customers of popular drinking places, reacted to and negotiated with the increasing regulation of Mexico City’s social space in the nineteenth century.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide some general recommendations for selecting a befitting beverage to accompany chocolates with different cocoa contents. Eighteen beverages and three chocolates with 30 %, 70 %, and 99 % cocoa solids were hedonically rated by eighty regular chocolate consumers. The beverages were then paired with each chocolate, and the consumers were asked to indicate hedonic liking of the chocolates, beverages, and chocolate and beverage pairs, and to indicate whether the chocolate or beverage flavour dominated the pair. The results of this study showed that liking of chocolate and beverage pairs significantly varied (p < 0. 001). Consumers preferred pairs with chocolate containing 30 and 70 % cocoa solids over pairs with chocolate containing 99 % cocoa solids. Beverages, such as balsamic vinegar, <b>liqueur</b> <b>wine,</b> coffee, and Port wine, generally appeared to be more proper and versatile partners for chocolate. According to the factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), the chocolate and beverage pair liking depended more on the beverage liking than the chocolate liking and the level of match. Omega squared indicated a medium effect for the beverage liking and a small effect for the chocolate liking, and the level of match. Although exploratory, this study outlined that when chocolate dominated the pair, a drop in acceptance is generally observed, whereas when the beverage dominates the chocolate a drop or a gain in acceptance can occur. Further investigations are required to complement the results with specific pieces of information on the flavour interactions that occur when chocolate and beverages are consumed according to a mixed tasting technique...|$|R
