5|$|Most aerobic Gram-negative {{bacteria}} (such as Pseudomonas, <b>Legionella,</b> Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) {{are resistant}} to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, <b>Legionella,</b> Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
25|$|Species of <b>Legionella</b> {{known to}} cause Pontiac fever include <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila, <b>Legionella</b> longbeachae, <b>Legionella</b> feeleii, <b>Legionella</b> micdadei, and <b>Legionella</b> anisa.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legionella</b> {{bacteria}} {{themselves can}} be inactivated by UV light. However, <b>Legionella</b> bacteria that grow and reproduce in amoebae or that are sheltered in corrosion particles cannot {{be killed by}} UV light alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legionella</b> jordanis is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{from the}} genus <b>Legionella</b> which was {{isolated from the}} Jordan River in Bloomington, Indiana and from the sewage in DeKalb County, Georgia. L. jordanis is a rare human pathogen and can cause respiratory tract infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legionella</b> testing {{typically}} involves collecting {{water samples}} and surface swabs from evaporative cooling basins, shower heads, faucets/taps, and other locations where warm water collects. The samples are then cultured and {{colony forming units}} (cfu) of <b>Legionella</b> are quantified as cfu/Liter.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac fever {{was named}} for Pontiac, Michigan, where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county's {{department}} of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the 1976 Legionnaires' outbreak in Philadelphia, the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila. An outbreak caused by <b>Legionella</b> micdadei in early 1988 in the UK became known as Lochgoilhead fever. Since that time, other species of <b>Legionella</b> that cause Pontiac fever have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where <b>Legionella</b> longbeachae was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also {{marked the first time}} Pontiac fever had been traced to potting soil.|$|E
25|$|The Legionellales are {{an order}} of Proteobacteria. Like all Proteobacteria, they are Gram-negative. They {{comprise}} two families, typified by <b>Legionella</b> and Coxiella, both of which include notable pathogens. For example, Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii and <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila causes Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legionella</b> {{bacteria}} {{have been}} spread through hot springs.|$|E
25|$|Another very {{important}} reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of <b>Legionella,</b> including species that cause legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease, most notably L. pneumophila, or Mycobacterium avium. The various <b>Legionella</b> species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of <b>Legionella</b> include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, domestic hot water systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} <b>Legionella</b> in 40% to 60% of cooling towers.|$|E
25|$|Chlorine dioxide is less {{corrosive}} than chlorine {{and superior}} {{for the control}} of <b>legionella</b> bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The City of Garland, Texas {{requires}} yearly {{testing for}} <b>legionella</b> bacteria at cooling towers at apartment buildings.|$|E
25|$|Frank Nicklason - Settled {{following}} written apology from Nicklason withdrawing false {{claims of}} <b>legionella</b> in woodchip piles.|$|E
25|$|Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease {{is caused}} by a {{waterborne}} bacterium <b>Legionella</b> that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of <b>Legionella</b> in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of <b>Legionella</b> in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{research}} study provided evidence that <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, can travel airborne at least 6km from its source. In 2000, ASHRAE issued guidelines to maintain water systems and {{to decrease the}} chances of Legionnaires' disease transmission. The guidelines were not valued because <b>legionella</b> multiply in such temperatures. On the other hand, a lot of states had regulations that limited temperatures in health care facilities {{in order to reduce}} scalding injuries.|$|E
25|$|The Texas Department of State Health Services has {{provided}} guidelines for hospitals {{to detect and}} {{prevent the spread of}} nosocomial infection due to <b>legionella.</b>|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all natural}} water sources contain <b>Legionella</b> and their {{presence}} {{should not be}} taken as an indication of a problem. The tabled figures are for total aerobic plate count, cfu/ml at 30°C (minimum 48 hours incubation) with colony count determined by the pour plate method according to ISO 6222(21) or spread plate method on yeast extract agar. <b>Legionella</b> isolation can be conducted using the method developed by the US Center for Disease Control using buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac fever {{does not}} spread {{from person to}} person. It is {{acquired}} through aersolization of water droplets and/or potting soil containing <b>Legionella</b> bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Newton, et al. cultured L. jordanis {{and various}} other species of <b>Legionella</b> in BCYE or ACES broth. DNA {{extraction}} and PCR amplification were done under standard conditions. However, due to low GC-content and the mismatching of base pairs, the temperature used during subtractive hybridization was adjusted to 35°C. Small amounts of biosynthetic enzymes L-cysteine synthase and acetyltransferase were detected in L. jordanis and L. pneumophila; 19 open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. jordanis, {{with a range of}} punitive functions making up around 47.5% of the 41 sequences represented by 40 ORFs. L. jordanis was found to contain the gene loci sidH, sidE, sidB, and sidG which express an Dot/Icm effector protein. This effector protein is essential for L. pneumophila to infiltrate host cells, so it is thought {{to be used as a}} virulence factor in L. jordanis, also. Both strains of L. jordanis tested positive for proteolysis and hemolysis. They did not test positive for cytotoxicity. Several species of <b>Legionella</b> “produced different proteolytic cleavage patterns on synthetic peptide substrates.” This suggests some genetic differences exist between the proteases produced by the different species of <b>Legionella,</b> despite them having some similarities. L. jordanis also appears to contain complex chains of lipopolysaccharides. <b>Legionella</b> species use amino acids as both carbon and energy sources.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Lin, Stout and Yu found Copper-Silver {{ionization}} {{to be the}} only <b>Legionella</b> control technology which has been validated through a 4-step scientific approach.|$|E
25|$|Malta {{requires}} twice yearly {{testing for}} <b>Legionella</b> bacteria at cooling towers and water fountains. Malta prohibits {{the installation of}} new cooling towers and evaporative condensers at health care facilities and schools.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legionella</b> is a {{parasite}} of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus requires conditions suitable for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for <b>Legionella</b> outbreaks in commercial buildings vary, but often include very hot water flushes (160°F; 70°C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, {{and in some}} cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventative measures include adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120°F (50°C) at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.|$|E
25|$|The order Legionellales {{comprises}} two families, Legionellaceae and Coxiellaceae. The family Legionellaceae {{includes the}} genera <b>Legionella</b> and relatives Fluoribacter and Sarcobium. The colonies that appeared around {{the third day}} in the CYE slants were grey and raised with a “ground-glass appearance". It was positive for both oxidase and catalase production. Strains of L. jordanis are thin, motile Gram-negative rods that {{range in size from}} 0.3 to 0.9µm wide by 2 to 20µm long. In addition, it is not encapsulated or nonspore-forming. After being stained with Sudan B, many of the cells did not have fat deposits. Gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry show that all known species of <b>Legionella</b> contain large amounts of branched-chain fatty acids. DNA that was unlabeled from BL-540 was tested against labeled DNAs from the six recognized <b>Legionella</b> species. When reactions were performed at an incubation temperature of 60°C, relatedness of BL-540 to the other DNAs were between 4 and 20%. When reactions were performed at a higher incubation temperature of 75°C, the relatedness ranged from 0 to 10%. The results indicated that L. jordanis was a new species. The two strains, BL-540 and ABB-9, were almost identical when DNA relatedness reactions were performed at both 60 and 75°C.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a list}} of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks; Legionnaire's is a {{potentially}} fatal infectious disease caused by gram negative, aerobic bacteria belonging to the genus <b>Legionella.</b> The first reported outbreak was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1976 during a Legionnaires Convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel.|$|E
25|$|Legionnaires' {{disease is}} a form of {{atypical}} pneumonia caused by any type of <b>Legionella</b> bacteria. Signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, and headaches. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. This often begins two to ten days after being exposed.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{governmental}} agencies, {{cooling tower}} manufacturers, and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling {{the growth of}} <b>Legionella</b> in cooling towers. However, in the US, there are no regulations requiring testing or maintaining any specified levels in these facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} {{isolates}} of L. jordanis {{were from the}} waters of the Jordan River in Indiana. The strain was designated as BL-540. This area of the river was near an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by L. pneumonphila. Another isolate was found in sewage located in DeKalb County, Georgia. This strain was designated as ABB-9. <b>Legionella</b> species are aquatic organisms and typically inhabit freshwater environments with humans being accidental hosts. Most isolates of <b>Legionella</b> have been from air-conditioning cooling towers and potable-water distribution systems, but they can also be found in other thermally polluted water sources such as air conditioners, spa equipment, fountains, humidifiers, or showers. They can also be collected on the surfaces of lakes, mud, and streams. They can grow in temperatures ranging from 5 to 63°C; optimal growth occurs between 25 and 40°C.|$|E
25|$|Although {{children}} {{older than}} one month {{tend to be}} at risk for the same microorganisms as adults, children under five are much less likely to have pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae or <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila. In contrast, older children and teenagers are more likely to acquire Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae than adults.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{identify}} the cause of CAP. Blood cultures can isolate bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream. Sputum Gram staining and culture can also reveal the causative microorganism. In severe cases, bronchoscopy can collect fluid for culture. Special tests can be performed if an uncommon microorganism is suspected, such as urinalysis for <b>Legionella</b> antigen in Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones {{can enter}} cells easily via porins and, therefore, {{are often used}} to treat {{intracellular}} pathogens such as <b>Legionella</b> pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many gram-positive bacteria. Some compounds in this class {{have been shown to}} inhibit the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA.|$|E
25|$|Originally, fecal {{contamination}} {{was determined}} {{with the presence}} of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful fecal pathogens. The presence of fecal coliforms (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia lamblia, <b>Legionella,</b> and viruses (enteric). Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{issued by}} the UK government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now recommends that microbiological monitoring for wet cooling systems, using a dipslide, should be performed weekly. The guidance now also recommends that routine testing for <b>legionella</b> bacteria in wet cooling systems be carried out at least quarterly, and more frequently when a system is being commissioned, or if the bacteria have been identified on a previous occasion.|$|E
25|$|Copper-Silver {{ionization}} is {{an effective}} industrial control and prevention process to eradicate <b>Legionella</b> in potable water distribution systems and cooling towers found in health facilities, hotels, nursing homes and most large buildings. In 2003, ionization became the first such hospital disinfection process to have fulfilled a proposed four-step modality evaluation; by then it had been adopted by over 100 hospitals. Additional studies indicate ionization is superior to thermal eradication.|$|E
