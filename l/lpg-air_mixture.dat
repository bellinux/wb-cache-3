40|$|The {{experimental}} {{results of the}} measurements of the explosion pressure and rate of explosion pressure rise {{as a function of}} propane/butane concentration in the mixture with air in the 20 L explosion chamber are tested. The research was aimed at determination of the explosion pressure and limits. The influence of initial temperature of the mixture (changing in the range of 293 – 473 K) on the fundamental explosion parameters was also investigated. The ignition source was an induction electrical spark. It was stated, that the increase of initial temperature of the <b>LPG-air</b> <b>mixture</b> causes a significant increase of the explosion range. From the experimental result, the concentration of LPG and air mixture just explodes at the range 2 % to 10 % of LPG in air. The concentration of LPG at 4 % gives the highest value of explosion pressure which at this condition, an explosion of LPG becomes very dangerous. The highest of deflagration index for LPG is 29. So, the designing of LPG tank storage should have value of deflagration index more than 29 to resist the over pressure from happen. The change of concentration of the <b>LPG-air</b> <b>mixture</b> causes a significant effect to maximum explosion pressure and maximum rate pressure rise. But it not means that the more concentration of LPG in air will increase the explosion pressure...|$|E
40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas or LPG has well acknowledged as an attractive source of fuel in these centuries {{as it has}} provided us evidence {{to be the most}} effective and environmental friendly among all other fuel existed. However,like the other fuel,LPG also has its own benefits and drawbacks at when it is inadequately treated can be destructive to us. After knowing the characteristics of LPG and recognizing suitable ways of reducing risks in storage, handling and transportation of it, an appropriately planned experiment has been carried out. Specifically,this study is conducted to study the effect of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to the Lower Flammability Limit(LFL) and Upper Flammability Limit (UFL) of LPG. LFL and UFL create a range at which explosion may occur to any flammable substance. By adding diluents (in this case isCO 2) to the LPG-air mixture,the range was predicted to be narrowed down because the role of diluents to the mixture is to reduce the concentration of oxygen(O 2) existed in the mixture to a level where explosion can be stopped. The most proper equipment to be used in order to achieve the objective of the study is the 20 -L-Explosion Vessel. Only by using this high-tech equipment-the experiments,which involving explosion, can be safely performed. In the experiment,different volume percentage of CO 2 was added in the pre-mixed <b>LPG-air</b> <b>mixture.</b> Three sets of experiments were done in order to compare the effect of CO 2 addition in the pre-mixed <b>LPG-air</b> <b>mixture</b> towards its flammability limit respectively. Fortunately, the results were moderately following the theories where the range of flammability limit of LPG - air mixture was fruitfully reduced from 4. 2 % vol. To 3 % vol. of LPG...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{advanced}} combustion modes i. e. improved low-temperature combustion (LTC) and reactivity {{controlled compression}} ignition (RCCI) {{have been achieved}} in a diesel engine. LTC mode has been improved using oxidized EGR (OEGR). Studies were carried out for a pre-optimized set of operating parameters of the engine. Reduction in NOx and PM, improved LTC, was achieved with higher OEGR percentages. Higher concentrations of CO 2 and lower concentrations of reacting species with increased OEGR created higher ignition delays, and hence, lower PM. Results also showed the importance of catalytic converter in reduction of tail-pipe HC, CO and PM. RCCI has been achieved using fuels with different reactivities. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with low reactivity was inducted along with air, and diesel with high reactivity was injected into the cylinder. Percentage of LPG was varied from 0 to 40 % with step size of 10 %. Results showed that PM, NOx and CO were reduced with increased LPG. Due {{to the possibility of}} a minor amount of <b>LPG-air</b> <b>mixture</b> being trapped in crevices during the compression stroke, HC was increased and BTE was decreased with increased LPG percentage. The results indicate that RCCI achieved with lower amount of LPG (similar to 10 %) is more beneficial for the reduction of PM, NOx and CO with acceptable change in values of HC and BTE. A reduction in premixed heat release peak and minor increase in ignition delays were observed with increased LPG percentage. It indicates that LPG slows down the reaction rate during premixed combustion...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} applications of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is its use in IC engines, particularly for automotive applications, {{as it is known}} to be a clean source of energy. Even though it is already being used in IC engines, the fundamental combustion properties such as laminar burning velocities, which is a physicochemical property of a fuel, is still not very well established, which can act as a basic input for engine modeling. The present work utilizes a few standard methods of flame speed measurement known from the literature to obtain the flame speed of <b>LPG-air</b> and LPG-air-diluent <b>mixtures</b> as a function of air-fuel ratio and diluent concentration. Variation of burning velocity obtained by two different experimental techniques, that is, orifice burner and cylindrical tube method for a <b>mixture</b> of <b>LPG-air</b> and diluent <b>mixtures</b> at different air fuel ratios is quantified. CO 2 is selected as a diluent to account for the presence of exhaust gases in the fresh charge as a consequence of exhaust gas recirculation. It was found that there is effect on burning velocity with the variation of effects of diluents on the burning velocities have been found to cause performance problems for combustion appliances using these types of fuel gases...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study on pressure explosion in 20 -L closed vessel explosion unit of <b>LPG–air</b> –hydrogen <b>mixtures</b> was performed, for systems with various pressures evacuated. The {{objective of this}} research is to determine the correlation of vacuum pressure toward flammability limits of LPG H 2 enriched. The explosion pressures and explosion times were measured in a 20 -L closed vessel, at ambient initial temperature. The influence of initial pressure, initial temperature and fuel concentration on explosion pressures and explosion times are discussed. The explosion pressure data is use to determine the flammability limits of hydrogen enriched LPG. From the result, there are fairly same in flammability limits of LPG but there are quiet different in maximum pressure explosion which is increasing the pressure can be decrease the value of pressure explosion. Increasing vacuum pressure from 0. 02 bar up to 0. 04 bar slightly increase the upper flammability limit from 8. 2 % to 8. 3 % volume of liquefied petroleum gas by volume and also decrease the maximum pressure explosion which is from 5. 8 bar to 5. 7 bar...|$|R
