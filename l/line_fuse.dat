50|$|A {{crowbar circuit}} is an {{electrical}} circuit {{used to prevent}} an overvoltage condition of a power supply unit from damaging the circuits attached to the power supply. It operates by putting a short circuit or low resistance path across the voltage output (Vo), much as {{if one were to}} drop a crowbar across the output terminals of the power supply. Crowbar circuits are frequently implemented using a thyristor, TRIAC, trisil or thyratron as the shorting device.

40|$|Abstract: In {{recent years}} {{electricity}} supply {{has played a}} very crucial part in people’s lives. However, just having access to electricity is not sufficient; the reliability of electricity supply is also important. In Africa the serious effect of an unreliable power supply is a prominent concern within electrical distribution networks. Outages in the Eskom distribution network accounted for the significant majority of the total outage duration experienced by Eskom Distribution customers. Distribution network systems constitute the greatest risk to the interruptions of electrical power supply; as it is still liable for more than 80 % of the customer reliability issues, {{with the majority of}} the faults (70 %) occurring on the Medium Voltage (MV) networks. As a result, this research study will identify, define, and quantify factors that lead to poor reliability of distribution networks, and, from the findings, alternative solutions will be proposed and discussed, based on the findings of the study. This is intended to assist electrical utilities effectively to investigate the affected network, {{and to be able to}} apply strategic reliability improvement plans to achieve optimal performance. The research methodology used to obtain and analyse the data during the research study consists of literature review and a qualitative approach. In order to conduct a full study of the research, the strategy used was a case study. The research findings within Eskom’s distribution network found that the reliability performance is poor due to defective equipment failures, overhead power line problems, maintenance or construction related failures, fuse failures, unit equipment problems and cable theft. Defective equipment posed the highest risk - particularly the cable network. Several solutions were proposed to improve the reliability of Eskom’s distribution, including investments information technology systems, smart grid technologies, capital, operational and maintenance strategies and reliability improvement strategies for defective equipment, overhead power <b>line,</b> <b>fuse,</b> unit equipment and cable theft was discussed. By applying these mitigation strategies and focusing on limiting the entire 85 % impact presented by failure root causes, the power cut can be reduced from 18. 747 hours to 2. 75 hours. Meaning an 85 % reliability improvement within Taunus’ distribution supply area in Eskom’s distribution. M. Phil. (Engineering Management...|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism of}} amylolysis of rice starch granules was investigated using isolated starch granules from wild-type, {{as well as}} SBEllb mutant and down-regulated <b>lines.</b> <b>Fused</b> granule agglomerates isolated from mutant and transgenic lines were hydrolysed at similar rates by amylases, and had similar crystalline patterns and thermal properties as individual granules. Surface pores, a feature previously only reported for A-polymorphic starch granules, were also observed in B- and C-polymorphic rice starch granules. Although the microscopic patterns of hydrolysis among granules with different crystalline polymorphs were qualitatively similar, the extent {{and the rate of}} amylolysis were different, suggesting that B-type crystalline polymorphs are intrinsically more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis than A-type in rice starch granules. It is proposed that the slightly longer branch lengths of amylopectin which leads to the formation of more stable B-type double helical structures compared to their A-type counterparts is the major parameter, with other factors such as granule size, surface pores and interior channels having secondary roles, in determining the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of rice starch granules.

40|$|The syncytiotrophoblast of {{the human}} {{placenta}} is an epithelial barrier that interacts with maternal blood and is a key for the transfer of nutrients and other solutes to the developing fetus. The syncytiotrophoblast is a true syncytium and fusion of progenitor cytotrophoblasts is the cardinal event leading {{to the formation of}} this layer. BeWo cells are often used as a surrogate for cytotrophoblasts, since they can be induced to fuse, and then express certain differentiation markers associated with trophoblast syncytialization. Dysferlin, a syncytiotrophoblast membrane repair protein, is up-regulated in BeWo cells induced to fuse by treatment with forskolin; this fusion is thought to occur through cAMP/ protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that dysferlin may also be up-regulated in response to fusion through other pathways. Here, we show that BeWo cells can also be induced to fuse by treatment with an activator of protein kinase C, and that this fusion is accompanied by increased expression of dysferlin. Moreover, a dramatic synergistic increase in dysferlin expression is observed when both the protein kinase A and protein kinase C pathways are activated in BeWo cells. This synergy in fusion is also accompanied by dramatic increases in mRNA for the placental fusion proteins syncytin 1, syncytin 2, as well as dysferlin. Dysferlin, however, was shown to be dispensable for stimulus-induced BeWo cell syncytialization, since dysferlin knockdown <b>lines</b> <b>fused</b> to the same extent as control cells.

40|$|Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n., a new {{nematode}} pathogenic on Coffea arabica cv. Catimor, {{is described}} from Vietnam. Females of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. are characterised by the broad amphidial apertures with prominent margins. Males are characterised by the bursa extending to one third, rarely middle, of the tail. The new species {{belongs to the}} group of species with a long tail in the female. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. is easily distinguished from R. similis by the bursa reaching to only one third of the tail vs extending to the tail terminus. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. is differentiated from R. bridgei by the lateral field having three bands of equal width (vs middle one narrower than others), lateral field completely areolated over whole body vs not areolated except irregularly in neck and tail, hemizonid distinct vs indistinct, four lateral field incisures terminating far behind phasmid vs three incisures terminating at or just behind phasmid, lateral <b>lines</b> <b>fusing</b> at two thirds of tail vs fusing at one third of tail, longer spicule length (18 - 21 vs 15. 5 - 18. 0 mum), and male bursa usually extending to only one third of tail vs mid tail. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. differs from R. colbrani by the rod-like vs round sperm, spicule length (18 - 21 vs 13 - 16 mum), tail length to stylet ratio (4. 1 - 4. 9 vs more than 5. 1) and presence vs absence of a bursa. Radopholus arabocoffeae sp. n. differs from R. duriophilus by the rod-like vs kidney-shaped sperm. Males further differ from R. duriophilus by shorter stylet length (8. 2 - 11. 6 vs 11. 5 - 15 mum), smaller distance between dorsal pharyngeal gland orifice and stylet base (1. 7 - 3. 4 vs 4 - 9. 5 mum), shorter hyaline tail (2. 6 - 3. 4 vs 4 - 9. 5 mum), and bursa extending to one third of tail vs mid-tail. Female R. arabocoffeae sp. n. differ from R. duriophilus by the broad amphidial aperture with prominent margin present vs absent. Males of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. differ from R. musicola by the rudimentary and amalgamated stylet base (vs with knobs), and inner lateral <b>lines</b> <b>fusing</b> at two thirds of the tail vs just posterior to the phasmid. The high level of ITS-rDNA sequence divergence of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. from other Radopholus spp. and the presence of nucleotide autapomorphies support a separate specific status of this new species. On carrot disks, the two species reproduced from 15 - 30 °C; optimum reproduction occurring at 28 °C. The reproductive capacity of R. duriophilus was higher than that of R. arabocoffeae sp. n. Radopholus duriophilus reproduced from single juveniles; R. arabocoffeae sp. n. did not.
