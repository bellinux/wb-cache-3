5|$|Most nemerteans are marine {{animals that}} burrow in sediments, <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals. Some live {{deep in the}} open oceans, and have {{gelatinous}} bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.|$|E
5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> areas that are concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

25|$|On 14 September, the National Ebola Response Center {{confirmed}} {{the death of}} a 16-year-old in a village in the Bombali district. Swabs taken from the body tested positive for the disease. The village was placed under quarantine. She had no history of traveling outside the village, and it is suspected that she contracted the disease from the semen of an Ebola survivor who was discharged in March 2015. Seven of her immediate contacts were taken to an Ebola treatment center, with a further three patients she had contact with at a health clinic. A new study to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates the possibility that the virus may <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> the semen of survivors for up to six months. Nearly half of 200 patients tested had traces of the virus in their semen six months after surviving the disease. On 7 November, the World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone Ebola-free.|$|E

25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
500|$|The {{primitive}} Liphistiidae, the [...] "trapdoor spiders" [...] of {{the family}} Ctenizidae and many tarantulas are ambush predators that <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> burrows, often closed by trapdoors and often surrounded by networks of silk threads that alert these spiders {{to the presence of}} prey. Other ambush predators do without such aids, including many crab spiders, and a few species that prey on bees, which see ultraviolet, can adjust their ultraviolet reflectance to match the flowers in which they are lurking. Wolf spiders, jumping spiders, fishing spiders and some crab spiders capture prey by chasing it, and rely mainly on vision to locate prey.|$|E
500|$|Vickers is a Weyland Corporation {{employee}} who {{is sent to}} monitor the expedition. Theron described the character as [...] "a suit who slowly sheds [...] skin through the film", and also as [...] "somewhat of a villain... definitely has an agenda". She stated [...] "Vickers is pragmatic, and desperately wants to control the situation." [...] Scott wanted the character to <b>lurk</b> <b>in</b> the background of scenes watching other characters instead of being the focus. Theron said that this helped layer her character because [...] "you're just so suspicious of her, instantly." [...] The similarities between the appearances and mannerisms of Vickers and David were intended to raise the possibility that David was based on Vickers's DNA, or that Vickers is an android herself. After Theron was cast in the role, she developed three new scenes with Scott and Lindelof to expand her character. Physical action scenes, some of which involved her running through sand in [...] boots were a problem for Theron. It was intended that Theron would portray Shaw, but a prior commitment to [...] prevented her involvement. When that film was delayed, {{she was able to}} rejoin Prometheus. Michelle Yeoh and Angelina Jolie were considered for the role.|$|E
