5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved {{due to lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{there has}} not been much {{alteration}} to the park's roads. , there are five pedestrian crossings over the Major Deegan Expressway, mostly in the northern section. A sixth bridge near 233rd Street was proposed in a 2009 feasibility study, However, in 2014, plans to build the $7.5 million pedestrian bridge were deferred due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The next year, the city announced its intent to begin building the bridge at a cost of $12 million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> has precluded major improvements, however, {{and timber}} {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|The Revolutionary War was {{ended by}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and by 1785 the Continental Navy was disbanded and the {{remaining}} ships were sold. The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the American Revolutionary War, was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress {{wanted to keep the}} ship, but the new nation did not have the funds to keep her in service. Other than a general <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E
5|$|The {{bibliography}} of Fyodor Dostoyevsky comprises novels, novellas, short stories, essays and other literary works. Raised by a literate family, Dostoyevsky discovered literature {{at an early}} age, beginning when his mother introduced the Bible to him. Nannies near the hospitalsin the grounds {{of which he was}} raisedintroduced Dostoyevsky to fairy tales, legends and sagas. His mother's subscription to the Library of Reading gave him access to the leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. After his mother's death, Dostoyevsky moved from a boarding school to a military academy and despite the resulting <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> he was captivated by literature until his death.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful because of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him {{a glimpse of the}} inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1937, Jessie became seriously {{infected}} with boils and, {{while under the}} care of a Glanton Brethren family, became a Christian. Before the end of the year, Jenner and Jessie began living together again. Although Jenner gave up gambling, he was often unemployed because he would evangelise at his workplace and then be fired. In 1939, Jessie developed a peptic ulcer. At the time, it was believed that such ulcers were caused by stress, and Jessie's ulcer was therefore attributed to the stress induced by the family's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Consequently, she and Ann moved to India to live with Jenner's aunt Emily McKenzie, who ran the Kotagiri Keswick Missionary Home. Ann subsequently attended Hebron School in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, until she was ten years old. Once Jessie had recovered from her illness, they returned to Sydney on SS Oronsay.|$|E
5|$|Strafford's {{fall from}} power {{weakened}} Charles's influence in Ireland. The {{dissolution of the}} Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford's imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to disband the army {{at the end of}} Strafford's trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster, coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.|$|E
5|$|The King of Fighters series {{director}} Toyohisa Tanabe {{asserted that}} the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults, and the newer KOF characters were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences. Characters such as Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan were added to have an off-beat variety to the cast, which he has previously deemed to be too serious. SNK artist C.A.C Yamasaki commented that although the lead programmer thought the game would not sell well, he believed it would eventually become popular. Ten people arrived at the first location test, but larger numbers came to subsequent tests. The SNK staff also had troubles with advertising the game due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{and some of their}} ads were noted to be of a poor quality.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, the images were colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran natively on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E
