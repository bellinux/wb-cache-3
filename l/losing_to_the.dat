50|$|However, {{this play}} is not optimal {{in the sense}} of {{optimising}} the above described matchpoint objective. Consider the line of play that starts by taking a deep finesse by playing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eight. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nine, next play <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jack, next let the ten run. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ace, let the queen run and then finesse over the jack. This play results in 2.09 expected tricks, a results slightly less than the above 2.12 tricks obtained by playing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ten. Yet, the play that leads to 2.09 tricks on average, beats <b>the</b> play leading <b>to</b> an average of 2.12 tricks in terms of matchpoint objective.|$|R

50|$|Again, {{this play}} is not optimal {{in terms of}} matchpoint objective, as it gets beaten by the {{following}} line of play: take a deep finesse by playing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eight. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nine, next play the ten and finesse the jack. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jack, next let the ten run. If <b>the</b> eight <b>loses</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ace, let the queen run and then finesse over the jack. A similar analysis {{as in the previous}} example shows that the line of play that starts with a deep finesse in 31.43% of <b>the</b> cases leads <b>to</b> more tricks than the line of play starting with a finesse. The reverse result holds only in 23.18% of the cases.|$|R
