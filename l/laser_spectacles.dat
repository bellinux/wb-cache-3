5000|$|ILDA {{was founded}} on August 16, 1986, at their first {{organizational}} meeting in Lake Tahoe. Those founding members who are still active as of 2006 are Tom Harman of LaserNet, Jim Martin of Peachtree Lase, Walt Meador of Laser Rentals, Inc., Todd Rogers of Beamin’ Lasers, and Tim Walsh of <b>Laser</b> <b>Spectacles.</b> [...] Originally, the meeting was labeled a gathering of Laser Entertainment Professionals. [...] The first topics that were covered at the meeting were ethical business standards, quality shows, CDRH, insurance, standardization, market overview, mission statement, and many more. The first officers were Ron Goldstein as President, Walt Meador as Secretary, and Tim Walsh as Treasurer. At {{the end of the}} meeting, each company was able to show off their own laser light creations. The most memorable display was when Laser Media and Image Engineering performed their collaboration to prove that cooperation between laser light companies was possible.|$|E

2500|$|One of the island's most noted {{landmarks}} is the fountain, {{based on}} the famous [...] Jet d'Eau (water-jet), situated in Lake Geneva. The Belgrade one is also 140 metres high and it was installed in 1996. The fountain operates during the day all year round, except in case there is frost or a particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evening between spring and autumn and is lit {{by a set of}} lights. During the summer months in the later hours, the island stages a special <b>laser</b> light <b>spectacle</b> for those still present at the beach.|$|R
50|$|Entertainment {{is one of}} {{the other}} {{applications}} that have been found for lasers. The most common use of lasers in entertainment can be seen in special effects used in laser shows. Clubs, parties and outdoor concerts all use high-power lasers, with safety precautions, as a <b>spectacle.</b> <b>Laser</b> shows are often extravagant, using lenses, mirrors and smoke.|$|R
50|$|Prevention of ocular {{trauma is}} most {{effective}} when soldiers wear polycarbonate eye armor correctly in the battlefield. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Military have made Ballistic <b>Laser</b> Protective <b>Spectacles</b> (BLPS), Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), and Sun/Wind/Dust Goggles (SWDG) available to combatants and associated personnel. These forms of eye protection are available in non-prescription and prescription lenses, and their use has been made mandatory at all times when soldiers are in areas of potential conflict. Despite their proven record of protection against secondary blast trauma, soldier compliance remains low: 85% of soldiers afflicted ocular trauma {{in the first year}} of OEF were not wearing their protective lenses at the time of detonation. While 41% of soldiers could not recall whether or not they were wearing eye protection at the time of detonation, 17% of casualties were wearing eye protection while 26% of casualties were not. Among this group, the poorest visual prognoses were documented in individuals who did not wear eye protection. The lack of compliance has been attributed to complaints about comfort, stylishness, and “misting” of the lenses when in the field. BLPS and SPECS offer the same line of protection against secondary trauma as the SWD goggles, and these lenses may overcome the complaints many soldiers have with their military-issue goggles.|$|R
