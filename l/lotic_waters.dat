A monthly samples of water and zooplanktons were collected from those sites and analyzed for the entire twenty four months period. Only three groups of zooplankton viz: Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda were collected from the <b>lotic</b> and lentic <b>water</b> bodies. It was observed that Rotifers were found to be more diversified than Cladocerans and Copepods in all water bodies except in Nagpokhari. A total of seventy one species of zooplankton were recorded during that period. The lentic water bodies sup-ported a higher species richness constituting seventy species whereas the <b>lotic</b> <b>water</b> bod-ies constituted only seven species of zooplankton.

40|$|Barriers {{in running}} (<b>lotic)</b> <b>waters</b> {{are known to}} have serious impacts on fish fauna that would {{otherwise}} naturally colonialize them. The two most important effects barriers have on lotic fish fauna are the blockage of fish migration routes and the reduction of water velocity. These effects can in turn change the conditions for survival for species using lotic habitats. In this study I have investigated how barriers effect lotic fish fauna and whether the number of barriers blocking a river section from a migration pool is an important factor affecting these communities. To investigate this, a specially designed net, The Nordic multi-mesh Stream Survey Net (NSSN), for lotic watercourses was used to sample fish in the Swedish river Hedströmmen during July 2015. The number of species caught in the net was noted, the number of individuals per species counted, and in addition the body length was measured for European perch (Perca fluviatilis). In contrast to our predictions, number of species did not differ between unblocked and blocked sections in the river. However, there were differences in abundance (i. e. total number of individuals), although species differed in this respect. Seven out of the total eleven species were unevenly distributed between the two site categories (blocked and unblocked), in general showing a greater abundance in unblocked sites, thus following the predictions of this study. For European perch there were also differences in body length between the sites, with mean length being larger in blocked sites, proving different ecological implications depending on whether the site is obstructed or not. These results thus indicate that many fish species in <b>lotic</b> <b>waters</b> are affected by barriers...|$|E

The eggs of the creek chubsuckers are a valuable source of energy for many creatures of the lotic stream system. Special emphasis should be placed on promoting high levels of breeding individuals to ensure breeding adult recruitment, therefore continuing a viable food source for other organisms. Buffer zones should be implemented around all streams in the vicinity of disturbances that could cause sediment pollution. Excessive siltation fills the gravel beds used for egg laying during spawning and deprives eggs of oxygen. Dams may also pose a problem by not allowing the fish to access areas used for breeding, but little information exists on their effects on the creek chubsucker.|$|R
