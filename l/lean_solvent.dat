Process model was developed using Aspen Plus v 12. 1 with the electrolyte property inserts for each amine using electrolyte-NRTL thermodynamic model. The rate-based Radfrac absorber column are model by using data adapted from pilot plant data Case 32 at University of Texas, Austin by Dugas (2006). From the results obtained, it showed {{shows that the}} CO 2 removal efficiency is increased with increasing of amine concentration for each amine. The CO 2 removal efficiency using the MEA solvent is the highest compared than DEA and MDEA solvent. Besides that, it is more realistic to used MEA concentration not more than 31. 5 wt. % as it can achieved 99. 8 % CO 2 removal efficiency and to avoid corrosion effect to equipment in real plant. As the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> flow rate increases, the CO 2 removal efficiency for studied amines increases that can be arranged as the following order: MEA > DEA > MDEA. MEA shows high CO 2 removal efficiency because MEA is primary amine which has high CO 2 absorption capacity and reactivity than to DEA and MDEA. However, CO 2 removal efficiency was decrease as <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> temperature increase for all amines.

This work investigated the effects of operating conditions on aerosol growth in a combined, PZ-based, absorber/water wash column through simulation using thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport models in Aspen Plus® in combination with an external aerosol model in MATLAB®. Aerosol transport equations included continuum-kinetic length-scale corrections. In the absorber, aerosols grow by continual uptake of CO 2 and PZ. Subsequently, H 2 O condenses to return to saturation. Droplets grow faster in non-intercooled columns because the temperature bulge and <b>leaner</b> <b>solvent</b> increases available PZ in the bulk gas phase. Aerosols grow fastest where the <b>solvent</b> is <b>lean</b> and hot, i. e., above the temperature bulge. Droplets grow faster in the water wash because of elevated PH 2 O relative to that in the absorber. PH 2 O is proportional to the amine concentration in the wash loop.

A dynamic test campaign examines the response of a CO 2 absorption/desorption pilot-scale plant to realistic changes in flue gas flow rates and steam supply, representative of the operation of a Natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant fitted with post-combustion capture. Five scenarios, demonstrating the operational flexibility that is likely to be encountered in an energy market with significant penetration from intermittent renewables, are presented, with 30 % monoethanolamine (MEA) as the absorbing solvent. It complements a wider effort on dynamic modelling of these systems where a lack of dynamic plant data has been reported. The campaign focuses on analysing critical plant parameters of the response of the pilot plant to a gas turbine shutdown, a gas turbine startup and three enhanced operational flexibility scenarios, including two for power output maximisation and one for frequency response with a rapid increase of steam supply to the reboiler. The campaign also demonstrates the use of continuous in situ <b>solvent</b> <b>lean</b> loading measurement {{with the use of a}} novel online continuous liquid sensor. It confirms that no significant barriers to flexible operation of amine post-combustion capture are found, although there remains scope for the improvement of plant response. Solvent inventory and circulation times are found to have a significant effect on capture rate during certain dynamic operations. A large solvent inventory increases total circulation times, which can result in additional time being required for the plant to return to steady state following a perturbation. The plant is forced to operate with a non-optimal capture rate while the solvent loading at the absorber inlet stabilises is identified as a potential impact. Use of interim solvent storage and continuous online measurement of solvent CO 2 loading, combined with comprehensive knowledge of liquid circulation times and potential mixing effects, are suggested as methods for improving plant response to dynamic operation, thereby increasing CCS plant flexibility...|$|R

40|$|Solvent {{emissions}} from a Post Combustion CO 2 Capture (PCCC) process {{can lead to}} environmental hazards and higher operating cost. Aerosol based emissions {{in the order of}} grams per Nm 3 have been reported from PCCC plants. These emissions are attributed to the presence of particles such as sulphuric acid aerosol droplets in the flue gas. Recently, we confirmed the relation between particle number concentration in the inlet flue gas and aerosol based emissions of monoethanolamine (MEA) as the solvent. The operating parameters and especially the presence of CO 2 were found to influence the extent of aerosol based emissions. In this study, the following parametric experimental tests were performed in a mini CO 2 capture plant: changing the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> temperature, the pH of the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent,</b> and the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas. Moreover, other commonly used CO 2 capture solvents, a mixture of 2 -amino- 2 -methyl-propanol (AMP) with piperazine (Pz), and AMP with potassium taurate (KTau), were evaluated for their potential for aerosol formation. Increasing the temperature of the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> resulted in a lowering of the amine emissions. Aerosol based emissions were observed only at a relatively high lean pH. As the CO 2 content of the flue gas was reduced from 12. 7 to 0. 7 vol. %, a maximum in the emissions was observed at 6 vol. % of CO 2. Aerosol based emissions for both AMP (1500 - 3000 mg/Nm 3) and Pz (200 - 400 mg/Nm 3) were measured, while no aerosol based emissions were observed for AMP-Ktau as a solvent even in the presence of sulphuric acid aerosols in the flue gas. The ratio of AMP:Pz emissions was found to be much lower in the presence of aerosols (5 - 12) as compared to only volatile emission (~ 26). This indicated that Pz has a preference to be in the aerosol phase over AMP. Three aspects were found to be important for aerosol based emissions in a CO 2 capture absorber: (i) the particle number concentration, (ii) the supersaturation, and (iii) the reactivity of the amine. These observations add to the existing understanding of aerosol formation and growth by heterogeneous nucleation in counter-current gas liquid absorption processes, by considering the reactivity of the components...|$|E

In this paper, a definition of the economic baseline for post-combustion CO 2 capture from 600 MWe bituminous coal-fired power plant is described. The baseline capture process is based on 30 % (by weight) aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA). A process model has been developed previously using the Aspen Plus simulation programme where the baseline CO 2 -removal has been chosen to be 90 %. The results from the process modelling have provided the required input data to the economic modelling.

Thus, it has become a potential industry for CO 2 removal process. High energy consumption of amine scrubbing has caused the challenge for the large scale application. Even though recent studies have been done to reduce the energy consumption, there are lacking of focus on the optimization of stripper operating conditions. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate the relationships of the stripper operating parameters on the reboiler heat duty and CO 2 removal percentage in the stripper. The modeling was done by using rate-based model in Aspen Plus with “MEA Property Insert” which described a MEA-H 2 O-CO 2 system thermodynamically with electrolyte-NRTL model. The column specifications were adapted from a pilot plant in University of Texas, Austin and the flue gas flow and compositions were adapted from Arasto et al. (2012). From the results, it showed that the increase in stripper with higher MEA concentration had reduced the reboiler duty up to 20 % and higher rich solvent temperature were able to reduce the reboiler heat duty. Besides that, the increase of stripper pressure had increased CO 2 removal efficiency in the stripper yet the CO 2 removal percentage was remained constant with the increase in rich solvent temperature. Lower rich solvent loadings with constant <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loadings, molar flow rate of CO 2 exiting the stripper and mass flow rate of MEA solvent enabled the reduction in reboiler heat duty. Even though high stripper temperature enables better performance, the stripper temperature should be maintained below 125 °C to avoid MEA degradation.

There have been significant efforts to develop energy efficient and cost effective PCC processes. Given that PCC is still maturing as a technology, there will be a continuing need for pilot scale facilities to support process optimisation, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Pilot scale PCC facilities, which are usually orders of magnitude smaller than those that will be used in future in large scale fossil power plants, make it possible to study details of the PCC process at an affordable scale. However, it is essential that pilot scale studies provide credible data, if this is to be used with confidence to envisage the future large-scale use of the PCC process, especially in terms of energy consumption. The present work therefore establishes and experimentally verifies (using a representative pilot plant as a case study) procedures for analysing the energy performance of a pilot scale amine based CO 2 capture plants, focusing on natural gas fired applications. The research critically assesses the pilot plant’s current energy performance, and proposes new operating conditions and system modifications by which the pilot plant will operate more efficiently in terms of energy consumption. The methodology developed to assess and improve the energy performance of the PCC process is applicable, with appropriate inputs, to other plants of this type that employs aqueous 30 wt. % monoethanolamine (MEA) solution as the solvent. A rate based model of the post combustion CO 2 capture process using an aqueous solution of 30 wt. % MEA as the solvent was developed in Aspen Plus® V. 8. 4, and verified using the results of experimental studies carried out using the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre / Pilot-scale Advanced Capture Technology (UKCCSRC/PACT) pilot plant, as a representative pilot-scale capture plant, and employed for parametric sensitivity studies.

Results show, for a given packing material type, the majority of energy savings can be realised by optimising the stripper operating pressure. To some extent, a higher solvent temperature at the stripper inlet has the potential to reduce the regeneration energy requirement. A more efficient packing material, can greatly improve the pilot plant overall energy and mass transfer efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A {{membrane}} evaporation {{system for}} energy penalty reduction in liquid absorbent based carbon capture {{and the effects}} of operating parameters (i. e. evaporation temperature, and gas/liquid flow rates) on mass and heat transfer are systematically investigated. It is found that monoethanolamine (MEA) vapor flux is approximately one order of magnitude lower than water vapor flux for membrane evaporation of 30 wt% MEA solution. Heat flux across the membrane is closely associated with mass transfer and is also influenced by the evaporation efficiency. Experimental results show that membrane wetting and vapor condensation occurs during the evaporation of MEA solution. Both evaporation temperatures and liquid flow rates play important roles in membrane wetting via changing the pressure on the liquid side. Slight wetting may decrease both mass transfer and the associated convective heat transfer across the membrane, but it can also provide benefit by preventing CO₂ absorption into the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent.</b> The occurrence of vapor condensation on the gas side is determined by the gas flow rate. Vapor condensation occurs at low gas flow rates but it will not be a significant operational issue in the membrane evaporator application as long as condensation occurs within the desorber where the latent heat is released and recovered. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMulti-objective {{optimisation}} {{is applied}} to the simulation of an IGCC power station with solvent based CCS technology. An Aspen Plus® model of the IGCC power station including CCS is interfaced with an Excel based genetic algorithm to optimise the process. The process is optimised with respect to capital cost and energy efficiency for a range of operating conditions of the solvent plant. This work is based on an air-blown gasification process consuming pre-dried lignite, it uses pinch analysis to design a HRSG for the IGCC power station with CCS to determine the power produced by the power station as well as estimating the additional capital costs due to the CCS equipment. The genetic algorithm then determines a range of non-dominated solutions by systematically adjusting the range of variables studied. Multiple-Objective Optimisation enables the decision makers to see a range of non-dominated options for multiple objectives. This can help to identify an appropriate technology or an operating regime for an individual technology that best suits the projects multiple objectives. In this example the gas temperature into the solvent absorber should be around 130  °C, the regenerator pressure should be around 2 bara and the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loading between 0. 37 and 0. 42 to maximise the net power output...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{a number}} of {{different}} process upgrades have been implemented at a 1  ton/h CO 2 capture test facility operating on a slipstream of flue gas from a coal-fired power plant. The benefits of the upgrades have been assessed through tests using monoethanolamine (MEA) as well as novel solvents. Amongst others the solvent cross flow heat exchanger was improved resulting in a closer temperature approach. The improvement of the heat exchanger was found only to reduce the energy requirement marginally. It was furthermore found that applying inter-stage cooling in the lower section of the absorber did not benefit the MEA process significantly, whereas with novel solvents, the regeneration energy could be reduced with up to 7 %. Introducing a vapour recompression cycle on the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loop was found to lower the regeneration energy with up to 20 % with MEA but to a lesser extent with novel solvents. In all cases the introduction of vapour recompression significantly increased the auxiliary power consumption. All in all, a saving in the regeneration energy of close to 25 % compared to that of the standard MEA process (3. 7  GJ/ton CO 2) could be realised with the tested process improvements and novel solvents...|$|E
40|$|Efficient CO capture by {{chemical}} absorption {{is currently}} gaining interests {{for the control}} greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, a nonaqueous process was developed to regenerate CO below 373 K by removing methanol first after the hybrid solvent of monoethanolamine (MEA) and methanol had absorbed CO. A model was accordingly developed to analyze {{the performance of the}} desorption process. Experiments were performed to determine the missing reaction kinetics of nonaqueous solvent regeneration of CO to help develop the model. The predicted gas concentration, axial velocity, energy consumption, and desorption efficiency agreed well with the stripper experimental data. A parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature, pressure, <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loading, gas/liquid ratio, packing, and internals on the energy consumption and desorption efficiency. All analyses were performed under three defined desorption conditions: N, methanol vapor, and steam as purge gases. Major energy savings were clearly identified because of feasible desorption temperatures below 373 K under nonaqueous desorption conditions. N purge gas desorption conditions offered the minimum energy consumption of 2. 28 GJ/t, being 24 % below the typical value of 3. 0 GJ/t. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} nonaqueous environment improved the desorption efficiency by 10 % compared to that obtained by typical aqueous solution regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{are the largest}} {{anthropogenic}} point sources of CO 2 emissions worldwide. About 40 % of the world's electricity comes from coal. Approximately 49 % of the US electricity in 2008 and 23 % of the total electricity generation of Canada in 2000 came from coal-fired power plant (World Coal Association, and Statistic Canada). It is likely that {{in the near future}} there might be some form of CO 2 regulation. Therefore, it is highly probable that CO 2 capture will need to be implemented at many US and Canadian coal fired power plants at some point. 	Several technologies are available for CO 2 capture from coal-fired power plants. One option is to separate CO 2 from the combustion products using conventional approach such as chemical absorption/stripping with amine solvents, which is commercially available. Another potential alternative, membrane gas separation, involves no moving parts, is compact and modular with a small footprint, is gaining more and more attention. Both technologies can be retrofitted to existing power plants, but they demands significant energy requirement to capture, purify and compress the CO 2 for transporting to the sequestration sites. 	This thesis is a techno-economical evaluation of the two approaches mentioned above along with another approach known as hybrid. This evaluation is based on the recent advancement in membrane materials and properties, and the adoption of systemic design procedures and optimization approach {{with the help of a}} commercial process simulator. Comparison of the process performance is developed in AspenPlus process simulation environment with a detailed multicomponent gas separation membrane model, and several rigorous rate-based absorption/stripping models. 	Fifteen various single and multi-stage membrane process configurations with or without recycle streams are examined through simulation and design study for industrial scale post-combustion CO 2 capture. It is found that only two process configurations are capable to satisfy the process specifications i. e., 85 % CO 2 recovery and 98 % CO 2 purity for EOR. The power and membrane area requirement can be saved by up to 13 % and 8 % respectively by the optimizing the base design. A post-optimality sensitivity analysis reveals that any changes in any of the factors such as feed flow rate, feed concentration (CO 2), permeate vacuum and compression condition have great impact on plant performance especially on power consumption and product recovery. 	Two different absorption/stripping process configurations (conventional and Fluor concept) with monoethanolamine (30 wt% MEA) solvent were simulated and designed using same design basis as above with tray columns. Both the rate-based and the equilibrium-stage based modeling approaches were adopted. Two kinetic models for modeling reactive absorption/stripping reactions of CO 2 with aqueous MEA solution were evaluated. Depending on the options to account for mass transfer, the chemical reactions in the liquid film/phase, film resistance and film non-ideality, eight different absorber/stripper models were categorized and investigated. From a parametric design study, the optimum CO 2 <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loading was determined with respect to minimum reboiler energy requirement by varying the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> flow rate in a closed-loop simulation environment for each model. It was realized that the success of modeling CO 2 capture with MEA depends upon how the film discretization is carried out. It revealed that most of the CO 2 was reacted in the film not in the bulk liquid. This insight could not be recognized with the traditional equilibrium-stage modeling. It was found that the optimum/or minimum <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loading ranges from 0. 29 to 0. 40 and the reboiler energy ranges from 3. 3 to 5. 1 (GJ/ton captured CO 2) depending on the model considered. Between the two process alternatives, the Fluor concept process performs well in terms of plant operating (i. e., 8. 5 % less energy) and capital cost (i. e., 50 % less number of strippers). 	The potentiality of hybrid processes which combines membrane permeation and conventional gas absorption/stripping using MEA were also examined for post-combustion CO 2 capture in AspenPlus®. It was found that the hybrid process may not be a promising alternative for post-combustion CO 2 capture in terms of energy requirement for capture and compression. On the other hand, a stand-alone membrane gas separation process showed the lowest energy demand for CO 2 capture and compression, and could save up to 15 to 35 % energy compare to the MEA capture process depending on the absorption/stripping model used...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} global {{challenges}} {{in the years to}} come is to reduce the CO 2 emissions in view of the apparent contribution to global warming. Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel fired power plants is drawing increased interest as an intermediate solution towards sustainable energy systems in the long term. However, CCS is still facing some challenges, such as large scale implementation requires high energy demands and leads to high cost. Innovation and optimization of the capture process is needed to reduce the energy requirement and to minimize the investment cost in order to make CCS viable for application in the near future. The CO 2 post-combustion capture based on the absorption/desorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, is considered as the state-of-art technology. In this thesis, the MEA process has been defined as the reference case for the purposes of comparison and benchmarking. By analysing the MEA reference case, it can be concluded that this is an energy intensive process due to the regeneration energy of the MEA solution (4 GJ/tonne CO 2). For this conventional process, major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> loading, the amine solvent concentration, as well as the stripper operating pressure. A minimum thermal energy requirement of 3. 0 GJ/tonne CO 2 can be obtained using a 40 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{was aimed}} to {{simulate}} a conventional dual-stage Selexol process for removing CO 2 and H 2 S simultaneously from a synthesis gas (syngas) originated from a typical Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant {{driven by a}} dry-coal fed gasifier using Honeywell UniSim R 400. The solubilities of syngas components on Selexol were predicted by temperature-dependant Henry’s law constants being newly evaluated in this study based on the experimental data in Xu et al. (1992). The operating conditions of the dual-stage Selexol unit were determined so as to meet simultaneously various performance targets, such as 99 +% H 2 recovery, 90 % CO 2 recovery, 99 +% H 2 S recovery, and less than 20 ppm H 2 S in CO 2 product. By and large the resulting energy consumptions of the Selexol process were in good agreement with those reported in DOE NETL (2010) that this study was based on. It was shown that the integrated dual-stage Selexol unit could achieve 95 % carbon capture rate as well as 90 % by simply changing the operating conditions. By contrast a CO 2 removal Selexol process having not an input of <b>lean</b> <b>solvent</b> generated by thermal regeneration could not achieve 95 % carbon capture rate due to a pinch point formed {{at the top of}} the CO 2 absorber...|$|E
