5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and <b>licked</b> their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is <b>licked</b> to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|The thicker {{end of the}} log, the {{end that}} was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro {{it is called the}} head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head {{pointing}} east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the ognjište. The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In Gruža it is coated with honey which is then <b>licked</b> by children. At the side of ognjište where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a plowshare, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.|$|E

50|$|Blacklick Creek is a {{tributary}} stream of Big Walnut Creek in Ohio, flowing through <b>Licking,</b> Fairfield and Franklin counties.

5|$|When resting, lion {{socialisation}} occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body <b>licked,</b> which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E

40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{a multiple}} measurement procedure to assess conditioned flavor aversions (CFA) and conditioned flavor prefer-ences (CFP) in male albino rats. Volume consumed {{is currently the}} most common and often the sole method used. Most studies employ group designs, whereas this study used a single-subject design to compare be-havior patterns and responses between individual rats. Response mea-surements include: total <b>licks,</b> <b>lick</b> rate, <b>lick</b> patterns, volume (ml) con-sumed, volume (ml) per <b>lick.</b> Strong CFA showed consistent decreases in total <b>licks,</b> <b>lick</b> rate, total volume, and volume per <b>lick.</b> CFP was evident, although not consistent, in total <b>licks,</b> <b>lick</b> rate, total volume (ml), and volume (ml) per <b>lick.</b> Volume per <b>lick</b> measurement in CFP revealed that three of the four rats drank more per <b>lick</b> on the posttest flavor day after training. This measure may be a good indicator of CFP. This study pro-vides normative data for evaluating the effects of drugs on neurotrans-mitters that modulate CFA and CFP...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish a low dose salicylate-induced tinnitus rat model and to investigate whether central or peripheral auditory system is involved in tinnitus. Methods: <b>Lick</b> suppression ratio (R), <b>lick</b> count and <b>lick</b> latency of conditioned rats in salicylate group (120 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and saline group were first compared. Bilateral auditory nerves were ablated in unconditioned rats and <b>lick</b> count and <b>lick</b> latency were compared before and after ablation. The ablation was then performed in conditioned rats and <b>lick</b> count and <b>lick</b> latency were compared between salicylate group and saline group and between ablated and unablated salicylate groups. Results: Both the R value and the <b>lick</b> count in salicylate group were significantly higher than those in saline group and <b>lick</b> latency in salicylate group was significantly shorter than that in saline group. No significant changes were observed in <b>lick</b> count and <b>lick</b> latency before and after ablation. After ablation, <b>lick</b> count and <b>lick</b> latency in salicylate group were significantly higher and shorter respectively than those in saline group, but they were significantly lower and longer respectively than those in unablated salicylate group. Conclusion: A low dose of salicylate (120 mg/kg) can induce tinnitus in rats and both central and peripheral auditor...|$|R

The Hebrew Bible says that dogs <b>licked</b> his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah.

40|$|Neurons {{that fire}} in {{relation}} to <b>licking,</b> in the ventral part of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), were studied during acquisition and performance of a <b>licking</b> task in rats for 14 sessions (2 h/d).

40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} {{in controlling}} behavior remains poorly understood. In {{this study we}} examined <b>licking</b> behavior in an established hyperdopaminergic mouse model—dopamine transporter knockout (DAT KO) mice. DAT KO mice showed higher rates of <b>licking,</b> {{which is due to}} increased perseveration of <b>licking</b> in a bout. By contrast, they showed increased individual <b>lick</b> durations, and reduced inter-lick-intervals. During extinction, both KO and control mice transiently increased variability in <b>lick</b> pattern generation while reducing <b>licking</b> rate, yet they showed very different behavioral patterns. Control mice gradually increased <b>lick</b> duration as well as variability. By contrast, DAT KO mice exhibited more immediate (within 10 <b>licks)</b> adjustments—an immediate increase in <b>lick</b> duration variability, as well as more rapid extinction. These results suggest that the level of dopamine can modulate the persistence and pattern generation of a highly stereotyped consummatory behavior like <b>licking,</b> as well as new learning in response to changes in environmental feedback. Increased dopamine in DAT KO mice not only increased perseveration of bouts and individual <b>lick</b> duration, but also increased the behavioral variability in response to the extinction contingency and the rate of extinction...|$|R
