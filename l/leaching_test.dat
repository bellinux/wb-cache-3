40|$|Precipitation-induced {{runoff from}} {{historical}} mine-waste located {{adjacent to the}} headwaters of the Snake River, Deer Creek, Saints John Creek, Grizzly Gulch, Stevens Gulch, and Leavenworth Creek contributes to the degradation of water quality in these streams. Because historical mine-waste piles have had long-term exposure to the atmosphere, it is surmised that runoff from these piles, induced by meteorological events such as cloudbursts and snowmelt, may cause mobility of acid and metals into a watershed due to dissolution of soluble minerals. For this study, 13 mine-waste composite samples from various mine-wastes in these drainage basins were leached using both a short-term and a long-term <b>leach</b> <b>test.</b> Analytical results from this combination of <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> are tools that allow the investigator to quantify (fingerprint) which geochemical components could be expected in runoff from these piles if they were leached by a cloudburst (5 -minute <b>leach</b> <b>test),</b> as well as what the “worst-case ” geochemical profile would look like if the material were subject to extended leaching and breakdown of the mine-waste material (18 hour <b>leach</b> <b>test).</b> Also, this combination of <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> allows the geoscientist the ability to see geochemical changes in the mine-waste leachate over time.

Since {{there was no difference}} in the {{concentrations of}} heavy metals in the <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> between the paraffin-coated flower pot (this study) and the no-coated one (the previous report [11]), the paraffin may have no preventive effect for the heavy metals to leach out.

Even if the rain would attack the paraffin-coated flower pot, the heavy metals would little meld out into the ground. Paraffin itself is used for coating the surface of fruits [29] and eatable. Even if the paraffin of the paraffin-coated flower pot would melt down to the ground due to a hot environment, the paraffin seems to have no negative effect on the ground.|$|E

40|$|An {{industrial}} waste containing {{large amounts of}} arsenic (42 wt %) was studied. The waste was treated using solidification/stabilisation sation technology (SIS) with cement and pozzolanic materials. Addition of lime {{appeared to be the}} major factor in reducing the concentration of arsenic in the leachate from the S/S material through the formation of a slightly soluble calcium-arsenic compound in the leachate. To investigate the mechanism of leaching from the SIS waste, semi-dynamic <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> were performed (ANSI/ANS 16. 1), but no direct conclusions concerning the release mechanism could be drawn from these tests, as equilibrium was reached during the intervals of static leaching of which the semi-dynamic <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> consists. Therefore, static <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out that gave much information about the behaviour of arsenic in the leachate.

In these cases the apparent activation energy for leaching was approximately 10 kcal/mole based on Na and Si data. For <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> at 90 {sup 0 }C with (SA/V) (t) less than 0. 2 cm{sup - 1 }d, the activation energy for Na and Si dissolution was 18. 5 kcal/mole for sample S 29 and 14. 5 kcal/mole for sample LS 04. These activation energies are in agreement with values reported by Tole and Lasaga (1981) for nepheline dissolution. The effect of sample geometry was investigated by leaching a series of crushed samples of different grain size.

40|$|Phosphogypsum (PG), {{a primary}} {{byproduct}} from phosphoric acid production, is accumulated in large stockpiles and occupies vast areas of land. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize the trace metals leachability of phosphogypsum under different environmental conditions. For this purpose multiple batch leaching tests were conducted to observe the leaching behavior of PG elements. Based on the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and extraction procedure toxicity (EPTOX) test, none of the metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Pb, Se) exceeded the regulatory toxicity limits; thus PG samples tested did not meet the definition of EP Toxicity under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). It is notable that mercury was not tested in this study. Results from the TCLP, synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) and deionized water (DI) extraction, leached relatively similar concentrations of inorganic constituents (except calcium). Aluminum and iron concentrations exceeded their respective groundwater cleanup target level (GWCTL) in SPLP leachates. In the multiple extraction procedure (MEP), most of the metals leached at greater concentration in the second extraction than in the first. In a <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> utilizing municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate as the extraction fluid, a few constituents of PG such as calcium and sulfate considerably leached out. Calcium leached more in the MSW <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> than TCLP and SPLP.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S.

There are many significant technical problems with the specific protocols proposed for use, such as not specifying a defined redox condition under which the tests are to be conducted. The most significant deficiency is in the proposed method for interpretation of <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> results. The use of these tests as currently formulated could readily result in chemicals that present minimal risk to the environment and human health being classified as hazardous. More importantly, their use could cause truly hazardous wastes to be classified as acceptable for on-land disposal with minimum restrictions. Adopting the U. S.

Samples from Tank 16 H annulus were characterized and tested to provide information to evaluate various alternatives for removing the annulus waste. The analysis found all four annulus samples to be composed mainly of Si, Na, and Al and lesser amounts of other elements. The XRD data indicate quartz (SiO{sub 2 }) and sodium aluminum nitrate silicate hydrate (Na{sub 8 }(Al{sub 6 }Si{sub 6 }O{sub 24 }) (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }. 4 H{sub 2 }O) as the predominant crystalline mineral phases in the samples. The XRD data also indicate the presence of crystalline sodium nitrate (NaNO{sub 3 }), sodium nitrite (NaNO{sub 2 }), gibbsite (Al(OH) {sub 3 }), hydrated sodium bicarbonate (Na{sub 3 }H(CO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }. 2 H{sub 2 }O), and muscovite (KAl{sub 2 }(AlSi{sub 3 }O{sub 10 }) (OH) {sub 2 }). Based on the weight of solids remaining {{at the end of}} the test, the water <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> results indicate 20 - 35 % of the solids dissolved after three contacts with an approximately 3 : 1 volume of water at 45 C. The chemical analysis of the leachates and the XRD results of the remaining solids indicate sodium salts of nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, and possibly carbonate/bicarbonate make up the majority of the dissolved material. The majority of these salts were dissolved in the first water contact and simply diluted with each subsequent water contact. The water leaching removed large amounts of the uranium in two of the samples and approximately 1 / 3 of the {sup 99 }Tc from all four samples. Most of the other radionuclides analyzed showed low solubility in the water <b>leaching</b> <b>test.</b> The oxalic acid <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> result indicate approximately 34 - 47 % of the solids in the four annulus samples will dissolve after three contacts with an approximately 3 : 1 volume of acid to solids at 45 C. The same sodium salts found in the water <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> comprise the majority of dissolved material in the oxalic acid <b>leaching</b> <b>test.</b> However, the oxalic acid was somewhat more effective in dissolving radionuclides than the water leach. In contrast to the water leaching results, most constituents continued to dissolve during subsequent cycles of oxalic acid leaching. The somewhat higher dissolution found in the oxalic acid <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> versus the water <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> might be offset by the tendency of the oxalic acid solutions to take on a gel-like consistency. The filtered solids left behind after three oxalic acid contacts were sticky and formed large clumps after drying. These two observations could indicate potential processing difficulties with solutions and solids from oxalic acid leaching. The gel formation might be avoided by using larger volumes of the acid. Further testing would be recommended before using oxalic acid to dissolve the Tank 16 H annulus waste to ensure no processing difficulties are encountered in the full scale process...|$|E

40|$|Two bauxite residue products, Alkaloam® and Red Lime™, {{generated}} from Alcoa of Australia’s Western Australia alumina refineries, {{have the potential}} to be re-used in a range of applications, in particular in agricultural land management as soil amendments for phosphorus retention and as an agricultural liming agent. Currently there are no regulatory frameworks or guidelines in Western Australia to promote and facilitate the re-use of industrial by-products. This is partly {{due to the lack of}} assessment protocols required to ensure that all regulatory standards have been met, with assurance that a by-product is safe and acceptable by the community as a suitable raw material for re-use. In addition, the Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP), the standard <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> adopted in Australia for environmental assessments, is significantly limited and not suitable for assessing leaching in industrial by-products, such as Alkaloam® and Red Lime™. The aim of this thesis was therefore to determine whether a more suitable <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> could be used as an alternative to ASLP for assessing industrial by-products and apply this <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> to Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ for investigating their leach behaviour when used as a soil amendment or liming agent. This thesis reported on relevant literature on the re-use of bauxite residue products, international <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> procedures and current assessment of industrial by-products for re-use. The European standard pH dependent <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> was compared to ASLP for assessing the leaching behaviour of Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ and for determining its suitability for assessing industrial by-products for re-use in different pH scenarios. This <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> was more superior to ASLP in that it provided more accurate and fundamental leaching information on Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ and was considered more suitable for assessing by-products for re-use, in particular materials that were highly alkaline and exhibited high buffering capacity. Method optimisation was conducted on the pH dependent <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> to improve <b>leaching</b> assessments on clay type soils and to allow nitrate leaching to be assessed in WA soils ameliorated with Alkaloam® and Red Lime. The main focus of this thesis was on characterising and assessing the pH dependent leaching behaviour of Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ and determining changes in leaching at different pH for a range of WA soils, when ameliorated with Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ at an application rate of 6. 25 g/kg (Alkaloam®) and 1. 6 g/kg (Red Lime™). A Bassendean soil and agricultural soils in the Peel Harvey catchment and Merredin and Newdegate region were assessed in this study. LeachXS™ geochemical modelling was applied to the pH dependent leach data to identify the processes controlling leaching of species in these scenarios as well as the speciation likely to be present in the liquid and solid phase during leaching. It is anticipated that this information will be a key input into the environmental assessment of Alkaloam® and Red Lime™ as an agricultural soil ameliorant and liming agent as these products progress towards becoming commercialised as raw material commodities...|$|R
40|$|Air-cooled {{blast-furnace}} slag {{is commonly}} utilised as a construction material in roads, fill and embankments. Materials used in such constructions do not remain continuously wetted, but is often subjected to cyclic wetting and drying under various exposure conditions. However, its leaching behaviour is often assessed based on tests performed under continuous wetting. This work {{was conducted to}} evaluate the leaching behaviour of an air-cooled blast-furnace slag under intermittent and continuous wetting. Four different leaching tests were performed, including a static <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> without leachant renewal and three dynamic leaching tests: a column <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> with continuous flow of the leachant, a tank <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> with sequential renewal of the leachant and an intermittent <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> with periodical flow of leachant. Leaching of the studied material under cyclic wetting and drying led to less alkaline and more oxidised eluates than leaching under continuously wetted conditions. The eluates are expected to maintain a mildly alkaline pH for long time periods during wetting, drying and oxidation of the material because the material has considerable acid neutralising potential. The leaching of soluble elements such as Ca and S was lower under intermittent than under continuous flow of the leachant which {{could be due to}} the shorter contact time between the leachant and material, and the precipitation of secondary phases on the particle surfaces during intermittent leaching. During exposure of the BFS to cyclic wetting and drying, the leaching of these elements decreased and the speciation of S in the eluates shifted towards more oxidising forms. The leached amounts of constituents were low in all performed tests, which indicate that the material was resistant to leaching under the conditions that were investigated here.

The materials subjected to the leaching tests were obtained by mixing different amounts of Portland cement (C) with fly ash (FA) coming from a Hospital Solid Waste (HSW) incineration plant. Ideally, as far as contaminant release from the waste is concerned, a <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> must be able to determine the following characteristics: 1) the compounds that can be released from the waste; 2) the maximum concentration of these compounds in the leachate; 3) the quantities released per unit mass of waste; 4) the release rate of these compounds; 5) the effects of a co-disposal of the waste. The aspect regarding concentration is relevant because the toxic effects of a number of elements, like most chemical reactions, depend on concentration. As far as the amount of release is concerned, the necessity to evaluate the maximum amount of hazardous compounds leachable from a waste under different environmental conditions is evident; moreover, it would be important to determine the possibility of accumulation of toxic compounds due to biological and chemical reactions. Furthermore, the trend of release is related to eventual physical and chemical changes occurring in the waste because of contaminant leaching from the waste matrix. The procedures applied in carrying out the extended-time leaching tests on S/S products made with HSW fly ash and Portland cement were {{a modified version of the}} IRSA - CNR acetic acid <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> (Italian law standard <b>leaching</b> <b>test)</b> and a modified version of the proposed standard European <b>leaching</b> <b>test</b> (option C). The tests were carried out over a thirty-day period by renewing the leaching solution every 24 hours. The comparison between the extended-time and the standardized tests allowed the leaching rate for different contaminants and the leaching - controlling process to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Beneficial reuse of coal {{combustion}} byproducts requires {{an evaluation of}} metal leaching potential. Reuse of high carbon fly ash in highway embankment construction was evaluated using different soil-fly ash mixtures and three common leaching tests: the water <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> (WLT), the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), and the column <b>leach</b> <b>test</b> (CLT). The effect of test methodology and pH on Cu, As, and Cr leaching was examined. TCLP concentrations for Cu and As exceeded those from WLTs {{in the majority of}} mixtures due to lower pH conditions, while Cr was higher in the WLT for alkaline fly ash mixtures. Peak CLT concentrations were higher than TCLP and WLT concentrations for the majority of mixtures, but usually decreased rapidly, suggesting that leachate concentrations might exceed regulatory limits, but only for a short time. Based on these results, a combined WLT and CLT <b>leaching</b> protocol for <b>testing</b> fly ash mixtures is presented...|$|R
40|$|Different {{analytical}} methods {{were applied to}} analyse the leachates obtained from <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> on S/S industrial waste containing arsenic and the treated percolate water from a landfill. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) {{was used to determine}} total As and other elements, hydride generation-ICP-MS for the determination of As(III) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) for As(III) and As(V). Interferences and matrix effects were studied in detail and corrected for. For the leachates, no corrections were required, for treated percolate water with lower As concentrations, in the case of ICP-MS important corrections were necessary. Results for different types of <b>leach</b> <b>tests</b> (extraction, static and semi-dynamic) and for treated percolate waters are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Due to {{mining and}} {{processing}} of sulphide laterite and sulphide ore leads to environmental contamina- tion by metals and metalloid elements. To {{determine how the}} contaminant leached and how can da- mage its nearby area, serves leaching experiments. In {{order to determine the}} potential impact on hu-man health can be used in <b>leaching</b> <b>tests</b> simulated gastric, gastrointestinal and pulmonary solutions. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to make these <b>leaching</b> <b>tests</b> to determine how a metallurgical waste affect the environment or the population in the region (eg. workers in the steel industry). The results show that the greatest exhibit leachability have ash. The limit values for hazardous waste in excess of Ni (4250 mg/kg) for inert waste Zn (22. 3 mg/kg) and Cd (0. 51 mg/kg). Gastric <b>leaching</b> <b>tests</b> show that the greatest health risk exists for Al TDI (181 μg/day), Ni (BE 324 μg/day) and V (TDI of 0. 78 μg/day). Tolerable daily intake (Tolerable Daily Intake, TDI) is the estimated amount that a person can endure in the long term without harming the body. Background exposure (BE) is the dose or amount, to which the individual is exposed to. As a result of the extraction to the surroundings gets more contaminants than would be obtained by natural processes (erosion, leaching by water) ...|$|R
