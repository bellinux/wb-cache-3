25|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the site}} starts at ~600 BCE and lasts until ~1500 CE The first two phases are weakly defined and things don’t solidify until the Ichpa phase, which <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> with the Early Classic Period and is consequently the first agreed upon phase. There is polychrome pottery characteristic of the region in that time period, and hieroglyphics. The Noheb phase <b>lines</b> <b>up</b> with the Middle Classic and there we see polychrome pottery disappears along with any sort of stone inscriptions, {{and the construction of}} large pyramids begins. In the Ukmul phase, hieroglyphics re-emerge and there is an abundance of rich detailed iconography. The Nak phase is a high point, with the building of the most 'glamorous' architecture, and Pre-pizarran ceramics emerge, characterized by supporting conical feet but displaying a broad diversity in design otherwise. Finally the Tokoy phase is defined by a disappearance in all evidence of human activity, except for pottery with a deterioration in materials and in consistency in technique, which fades out completely towards 1500 CE.|$|E

25|$|P. gibbosus {{is a part}} of a mimicry {{group with}} a wide variety of other wasps that also exhibit black and yellow banding and coloring.
