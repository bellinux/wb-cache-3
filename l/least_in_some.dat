5|$|At <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear {{capable of}} producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a few {{units of}} presumably light {{infantry}} with names denoting specialist function: superventores and praeventores ("interceptors") exculcatores ("trackers"), exploratores ("scouts"). At the same time, Ammianus describes light-armed troops with various terms: velites, leves armaturae, exculcatores, expediti. It is unclear from the context {{whether any of}} these were independent units, specialist sub-units, or indeed just detachments of ordinary troops specially armed for a particular operation. The Notitia evidence implies that, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases, Ammianus could be referring to independent units.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} wing membrane did attach to the hindlimbs, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E

5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|When dinosaurs appeared, {{they were}} not the {{dominant}} terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful than the dinosaurs. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about 215million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs, including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (about 200million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and early Rhaetian, respectively, and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles. The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.|$|E

A 1988 study in Indian waters found that the species is an active feeder during February and March, showing only moderate activity for the rest of the year. Their main prey items were small crustaceans, particularly copepods and small or larval fish, with smaller amounts of Lucifer, prawns, amphipods and fish eggs taken.|$|E
25|$|After Giotto, Fra Angelico {{and others}} {{systematically}} developed uncluttered images {{that focused on}} the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty, in works like Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper, arguably the first High Renaissance painting. Images of Jesus now drew on classical sculpture, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> of their poses. However Michelangelo was considered to have gone much too far in his beardless Christ in his The Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, which very clearly adapted classical sculptures of Apollo, and this path was rarely followed by other artists.|$|E

Notwithstanding his frequent protests {{that he did not}} covet power, but longed for retirement, we find him again, so late as 1835, within three years of his death, in hopes of office under Peel. He spoke in parliament for the last time in July 1834.|$|E

He mixed certain substances with the lacquer to ensure it would not crack when his urushi-e scroll paintings were rolled up. He used bronze in his lacquer to simulate the appearance and texture of iron, and cereal starch to thicken his lacquer to simulate, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> respects, the effect of Western oil painting.|$|E
25|$|These snakes produce {{cytotoxic}} venom that {{is strongly}} hemorrhagic and tissue toxic, but {{devoid of any}} neurotoxins (Ernst, 1992; Van Mierop, 1976). The venom was basis {{for the development of}} the drug eptifibatide which is used to prevent clotting during a heart attack. The venom is somewhat different in that it contains substantial amounts of serotonin and related tryptamine compounds (Welsh, 1967). Antivenin does not appear to be effective in the treatment of these bites, although CroFab does seem to do a better job than ACP, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> animal models.

25|$|An enemy {{attacking a}} spur castle or {{hillside}} castle could often position himself above the castle itself.

From the elevated fighting platform the hillside could be better controlled than from the fighting positions lower down. The bergfried usually also served generally as a fortified tower. Examples of very high bergfrieds were or are those at Rheinfels Castle (54 m) and the Osterburg (53 m). Additional chemins de ronde (walkways behind the battlements) could be built on the lower storeys of a tower (e.g. Bischofstein Castle on the Moselle).|$|E

25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{opinions}} about the halakhic date line are structured {{as a response to}} the question of what days someone should observe as Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the halakhic date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the halakhic date line, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> places.|$|E
25|$|Cryptic {{self-incompatibility}} (CSI) {{exists in}} {{a limited number of}} taxa (for example, there is evidence for CSI in Silene vulgaris, Caryophyllaceae). In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher seed set from cross pollen, relative to self pollen. However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E
