5|$|Manager Roy Keane {{placed him}} on the {{transfer}} list on 27 February 2008 due to a 'lack of discipline' and 'poor timekeeping', evidenced by his frequent <b>lateness</b> arriving to training sessions. He was linked with a move to Toronto FC, a Canadian club with ties to former Sunderland players Danny Dichio, Carl Robinson and Andy Welsh.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent <b>lateness.</b> She responded by overturning a table, damaging a computer that was sitting on it. A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged {{her out of the}} room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lateness</b> of her casting forced Durance {{to start}} filming {{only three days}} after being hired, with no {{time to prepare for}} the role. Under the initial agreement, Durance was only to portray the {{character}} for a total of four episodes, but, after a discussion with Peter Roth over how they planned to use the character on the show—insisting that she and Clark would not be having a romantic relationship—the feature film division then cleared the character for more episodes. After the character was cleared for more episodes, the creative team decided to plant her in the Kent home so that she could provide a constant annoyance to Clark. To separate the physical appearance of Lana and Lois from each other, the producers had highlights added to Durance's hair, as she and Kristin Kreuk both shared a similar brunette coloring.|$|E
5|$|Whitney Carter (also Dean) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Shona McGarty. The character is the adoptive daughter of long-running character Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and {{was introduced in}} April when Palmer returned to the series after a six-year absence. Whitney is described by executive producer Diederick Santer as both an equal to, and younger version of Bianca, and is the oldest of Bianca's four children. Her storylines have revolved around her fractured family life, her sexual abuse by Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), her sexual exploitation by Rob Grayson (Jody Latham), her marriage to Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and miscarrying his baby, surviving a bus crash, {{falling in love with}} her father-in-law Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and becoming engaged to Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). McGarty was temporarily written out of EastEnders for four weeks in July 2012 because of her repeated <b>lateness</b> to work. McGarty took an extended break from the show in 2017, with Whitney departing on 29 May, she returned on 31 July.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{was born}} on 27 March 1972 in Paramaribo, Suriname (then part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), to Frank Ware and Cornelli Hasselbaink; he was the {{youngest}} of six children. At the age of three Hasselbaink was run over by a moped which broke his right leg. In October 1978, his mother took him and three siblings to live in Zaandam, Netherlands; his father remained in Suriname and rarely contacted the family. The next year Hasselbaink began playing youth football for Gestaagt Volharding Overwint (GVO), initially as a goalkeeper. He later played for Zaansche Football club (ZFC) and Zaanlandia as a right winger. He joined a street gang as a teenager and spent three months in a youth detention facility for stealing. After his release he joined the youth team at DWS, but was dismissed from the club for stealing the watch of a first-team player. He began his senior career with Telstar, while still a gang member, and had disciplinary issues at the club due to his persistent <b>lateness.</b> He made his Eerste Divisie debut on 27 October 1990, in a 2–0 defeat at VVV-Venlo. Head coach Niels Overweg dismissed him after he turned up late to a match.|$|E
25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the <b>lateness</b> with an ad {{campaign}} showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers {{what was going on with}} the show's plot since it had been so long since the last new episode.|$|E
25|$|Donnie Smith, {{a former}} What Do Kids Know? champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent {{the money he}} won as a child, {{and he has been}} fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon, an {{electronics}} store, due to chronic <b>lateness</b> and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting oral surgery, thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces. He hatches a plan to get back at his boss by stealing the money he needs for his braces.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March 1798 Echo was {{scouting}} {{ahead of}} Apollo {{and the rest}} of her squadron when Echo discovered a cutter that she immediately chased. The cutter ran ashore a few miles north of Camperdown where her crew abandoned her when boats from the ships of the squadron deployed to attempt to bring her off. Surf, and the <b>lateness</b> of the hour prevented the British from recovering the cutter so they destroyed her. She had been armed with 10 guns and was out of Dunkirk.|$|E
25|$|Mercati {{posed the}} {{question}} to himself, why would anyone prefer to manufacture artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to <b>lateness</b> of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the tumultuous}} nature of Finnish history {{during the first}} half of the 20th century (including the Finnish Civil War and the Winter War which both left marks on the city), Helsinki {{continued}} its steady development. A landmark event was the 1952 Olympic Games, held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the Helsinki Metro subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the <b>lateness</b> of its growth.|$|E
25|$|In Salzburg, Austria, {{just before}} World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, {{is on the}} nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the {{beautiful}} hills ("The Sound of Music") where she was brought up. She returns late. The Mother Abbess and the other nuns consider {{what to do about}} her ("Maria"). Maria explains her <b>lateness,</b> saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song ("My Favorite Things"). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is ready for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.|$|E
25|$|After {{serving his}} {{apprenticeship}} in Worcestershire's Second XI {{and for the}} county's Board XI in the 38-County Cup {{for a couple of}} years, Kabir Ali made his first-class debut in a drawn game against Middlesex in September 1999. He bowled respectably enough, taking 2–36 and 1–22, but the match's <b>lateness</b> in the season robbed him of the chance to push for a regular place in the first team. Despite several appearances in the Benson & Hedges Cup in April 2000, including an impressive 4–29 on List A debut, Kabir spent most of the first part of that season still in the second team, although by the summer he had pushed his way into the full XI. Also in 2000, Kabir was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for the most promising young Worcestershire player.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{explanations}} {{have been}} proposed for the relatively slow response of the snow cleanup in the New York City metropolitan area. For example, the local media did not fully alert the general public until Christmas Day about the impending storm due to the complexity and <b>lateness</b> of the forecast models predicting the storm; thus, public awareness was delayed. Another possible cause was that Mayor Bloomberg had previously laid off 400 New York City Sanitation workers due to budget cuts; therefore, fewer plows were at work. In addition, some city workers {{who are responsible for}} managing the snow removal process had taken the day off from work during the storm due to the Christmas holiday. Also, a snow emergency was not declared, contributing to the number of abandoned cars on the streets.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of October, the Armada was still in no shape to depart. Lack of food and money as well as potential mutiny forcibly delayed the expedition which infuriated Philip. The Adelantado had preparation for the Armada as his main priority but soon asked to be relieved of his command to defend himself, which Philip refused. Philip instead abruptly cancelled the Irish enterprise altogether; the relenting weather, <b>lateness</b> {{of the season and}} disease amongst ships crews being the reasons. The Adelantado instead was to sail to La Coruna, where he was to be given orders to seize the French Port of Brest which they had briefly held in 1594 only to be defeated by Anglo French troops who took the fort there. Brest was chosen simply because it was closer to Spain but also {{could be used as a}} base to attack England and also to help the Irish rebels.|$|E
25|$|Wood's {{good form}} for Lancashire {{led to his}} {{selection}} for his first Test against Australia at The Oval in 1972. Against a fearsome Australian bowling attack, spearheaded by the great Dennis Lillee, he made a very fine score of 90 which led to his selection for a tour of India and Pakistan. However, he had a lean time in the subcontinent and was dropped from the side. He was again selected as a replacement in a New Zealand tour as a replacement but failed again. The <b>lateness</b> of his selection was a contributing factor as he completed a 63-hour trip from the West Indies to New Zealand just before the first Test. In 1975, he played Tests against Australia, {{standing up to the}} menacing duo of Lillee and Thompson scoring a half century. His final Test was against Pakistan in 1978. In his prime, Wood was widely regarded as the finest player of fast bowling in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{first nations}} guides turned for home {{as had been}} agreed, as did Wentzel, leaving Franklin with fifteen voyageurs and his four Britons. Franklin gave orders to those departing that caches of food were to be left on route and that most {{importantly}} Fort Enterprise be stocked with {{a large amount of}} dried meat. With the <b>lateness</b> of the season the latter point was crucial because Franklin now feared that if, as seemed likely, he failed to reach Repulse Bay, the sea would freeze and prevent him returning to the mouth of the Coppermine River. If so, he would be forced to make a direct return across the Barren Lands, where he and his men would be dependent on whatever food they could forage. There was therefore a real risk that they would be close to starvation {{by the time they reached}} Fort Enterprise; he frequently repeated that their survival would depend on the huts being well stocked.|$|E
25|$|In March 1917, {{two months}} later, Gaza was {{attacked}} by Eastern Force infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division reinforced by an infantry brigade. This attack was protected {{from the threat of}} Ottoman reinforcements by the Anzac Mounted Division and a screen from the Imperial Mounted Division. The infantry attack from the south and southeast on the Ottoman garrison in and around Gaza was strongly resisted. While the Imperial Mounted Division continued to hold off threatening Ottoman reinforcements, the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza from the north. They succeeded in entering the town from the north, while a joint infantry and mounted infantry attack on Ali Muntar captured the position. However, the <b>lateness</b> of the hour, the determination of the Ottoman defenders, and the threat from the large Ottoman reinforcements approaching from the north and north east, resulted in the decision by the Eastern Force to retreat. It has been suggested this move snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.|$|E
25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant <b>lateness</b> and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his <b>lateness,</b> but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E
500|$|McGarty was {{suspended}} from the show in July 2012 across four weeks for [...] "persistent <b>lateness</b> to arrive on set". A show insider described her <b>lateness</b> as a big problem because it [...] "regularly held up the filming of vital scenes." [...] McGarty apologised for her <b>lateness.</b> In 2016, she discussed her suspension with The Sun magazine Fabulous and said her actions were [...] "lazy and irresponsible" [...] and the suspension made her realise the consequences of her actions. McGarty promised fans that she was now punctual for work.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the number}} of last-minute changes and the <b>lateness</b> of the hour during the final votes, the Assembly held a [...] "cleaning up" [...] day on Saturday, September 22, to make {{technical}} clarifications to the final bills. After this session, the Assembly adjourned sine die.|$|E
500|$|Amtrak's incorporators {{selected}} the Broadway Limited {{as the new}} company's sole New York-Chicago route. Amtrak operated a Washington, D.C. section via the Port Road Branch, which separated at Harrisburg. In the 1970s, the Broadway Limited experienced chronic <b>lateness</b> as the tracks it ran on degraded. Beginning in 1979, the route changed, as tracks were abandoned and downgraded by Conrail, Penn Central's successor. These changes included: ...|$|E
500|$|The fleet sailed {{down the}} Gulf of Saint Lawrence {{and came to}} anchor at Spanish River (now the harbour of Sydney, Nova Scotia) on 4 September, where a council was held to discuss {{whether or not to}} attack the French at Plaisance. [...] Given the <b>lateness</b> of the season, {{insufficient}} supplies to overwinter in the area, and rumours of strong defences at Plaisance, the council decided against making the attack, and sailed for England.|$|E
500|$|They then {{discovered}} the Ross Ice Shelf, {{which they were}} unable to penetrate, and followed it eastward until the <b>lateness</b> of the season compelled them to return to Tasmania. The following season, 1842, Ross continued to survey the [...] "Great Ice Barrier", as it was called, continuing to follow it eastward. Both ships returned to the Falkland Islands before returning to the Antarctic in the 1842–1843 season. They conducted studies in magnetism, and returned with oceanographic data and collections of botanical and ornithological specimens.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Assad {{disclosed}} to the OPCW [...] "a facility {{for the production}} of ricin" [...] but stated that [...] "the entire quantity of ricin produced was disposed of prior to the entry into force" [...] of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The <b>lateness</b> of this disclosure raised doubts about the completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile. The Israeli intelligence community believes the Assad government retains a [...] "residual" [...] chemical stockpile of somewhere between several hundred kilograms to several tons of chemical weapons, about 1% of its original stockpile.|$|E
500|$|Ezrin's poor {{punctuality}} caused {{problems with}} the tight schedule dictated by Waters. Mason found the producer's behaviour [...] "erratic", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his <b>lateness</b> as ammunition for [...] "tongue-in-cheek resentment". [...] Ezrin's share of the royalties was less {{than the rest of}} the band and he viewed Waters as a [...] "bully", especially when the bassist mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share of the album's royalties. [...] Ezrin later admitted that he had marital problems and was not [...] "in the best shape emotionally".|$|E
500|$|La Pérouse did {{not learn}} of the {{capitulation}} until 26 August, and continuing bad weather and difficulties with the frigates meant {{that he did not}} effect a junction with Rostaing until 31 August. [...] The terms of capitulation included the surrender of Fort Severn, another small outpost. [...] He chose not to go to Fort Severn on account of the <b>lateness</b> of the season and the poor condition of his ships and men, who were suffering from scurvy and other maladies. [...] During the process of loading goods and supplies onto the fleet, five small boats overturned and 15 men drowned.|$|E
500|$|Finding a {{pass through}} the Selkirks became a {{priority}} after construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway began. [...] Completion of the railway was a condition of the Colony of British Columbia upon entering Canadian Confederation in 1867. [...] In 1865, CPR surveyor Walter Moberly led an expedition up the Illecillewaet River (which he named, using the Okanangan word for [...] "swift water"). Despite recently discovering Eagle Pass through the nearby Monashees, Moberly failed to find a {{pass through the}} Selkirks after getting sidetracked in the Tangier Creek drainage. [...] His party refused to explore further due to the <b>lateness</b> of the season, and Moberly was forced to retreat.|$|E
500|$|By {{the later}} months of 1932, Robey {{had formed a}} romantic {{relationship}} with the Littlers' daughter Blanche (1897–1981), who then took over as his manager. The couple grew close during the filming of Don Quixote, a remake of the comedian's 1923 success as Sancho Panza. Unlike its predecessor, Don Quixote had an ambitious script, big budget and an authentic foreign setting. Robey, however, resented having to grow a beard for the role and disliked the French climate and gruelling 12-week filming schedule. He refused to act out his character's death scene in a farcical way and also objected to the <b>lateness</b> of the [...] "dreadfully banal" [...] scripts, which were often written the night before filming.|$|E
500|$|On November 1, Montgomery sent a truce flag, {{carried by}} a {{prisoner}} captured during Carleton's aborted relief attempt, into the fort. The man delivered a letter, in which Montgomery, {{pointing out that}} relief was unlikely to come, offered to negotiate a surrender. Preston, not entirely trusting the man's report, sent out one of his captains to confer with Montgomery. [...] The counteroffer, which Montgomery rejected, owing to the <b>lateness</b> of the season, was to hold a truce for four days, after which the garrison would surrender if no relief came. [...] Montgomery let the captain examine another prisoner from Carleton's expedition, who confirmed what the first one had reported. Montgomery then repeated his demand for an immediate surrender, terms for which were drawn up the next day.|$|E
500|$|The drama Bus Stop was {{the first}} film that Monroe chose to make under the new contract; the movie was {{released}} in August 1956. She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy {{who falls in love}} with her. For the role, she learnt an Ozark accent, chose costumes and make-up that lacked the glamour of her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult. The filming took place in Idaho and Arizona in early 1956, with Monroe [...] "technically in charge" [...] as the head of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic <b>lateness</b> and perfectionism.|$|E
500|$|In September 1775, {{early in}} the American Revolutionary War, the American Continental Army [...] {{embarked}} on an invasion of Quebec. The invasion ended in disaster in July 1776, with the army chased back to Fort Ticonderoga [...] by a large British army that arrived in Quebec in May 1776. [...] A small Continental Navy fleet on Lake Champlain was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island. [...] The delay required by the British to build their fleet on Lake Champlain caused General Guy Carleton to hold off on attempting an assault on Ticonderoga in 1776. [...] Although his advance forces came within three miles of Ticonderoga, the <b>lateness</b> {{of the season and}} the difficulty of maintaining supply lines along the lake in winter caused him to withdraw his forces back into Quebec.|$|E
500|$|Planning {{began in}} June 2004, and {{production}} was {{much larger than}} The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was only shot on location in St. Vincent. This time, the sequels would require fully working ships, with a working Black Pearl built over the body of an oil tanker in Bayou La Batre, Alabama. By November, the script was still unfinished as the writers did not want director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to compromise what they had written, so Verbinski worked with James Byrkit to storyboard major sequences without need of a script, while Elliott and Rossio wrote a [...] "preparatory" [...] script for the crew to use before they finished the script they were happy with. By January 2005, with rising costs and no script, Disney threatened to cancel the film, but changed their minds. The writers would accompany the crew on location, feeling that the <b>lateness</b> of their rewrites would improve the spontaneity of the cast's performances.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of her {{personal}} life are also revealed, including {{her relationship with her}} ex-colonel father; serving as Batwoman's ally, whom she addresses as [...] "sir." [...] The strain of her late night vigilante activity has also taken a toll on her romantic relationships. Her <b>lateness</b> and night time absences are interpreted by her girlfriend as an on the side liaison with another woman. She breaks the relationship off as she believes Kate is not ready to commit to an exclusive relationship. A past traumatic incident is also alluded to which she claims still haunts her. As she vaguely describes the experience, her face is shown superimposed on the page over a restrained girl with a bag over her head. She later tracks down the new leader of the Religion of Crime: an elaborately costumed woman named Alice. Over the course of the conflict that ensues, Batwoman observes that Alice only speaks in quotations from Lewis Carroll, believing herself to be Alice Liddell. Alice denies a connection to the Mad Hatter.|$|E
500|$|The loss of Lochry's {{detachment}} {{proved to}} be the fatal setback to Clark's 1781 campaign. In early September, Clark held a series of councils with Kentucky militia officers at Fort Nelson. Clark still advocated carrying out an expedition into the Ohio Country, saying that [...] "I am ready to lead you on to any Action that has the most distant prospect of Advantage, however daring it may appear to be." [...] Given the <b>lateness</b> of the season and the shortage of available men, the council overruled Clark and decided instead to remain on the defensive, although they proposed that another campaign against Detroit should be carried out the next year. On October 1, 1781, a disappointed Clark wrote, [...] "My chain appears to have run out. I find myself enclosed with a few troops, in a trifling fort, and shortly expect to bear the insults of those who have for several years been in continual dread of me." [...] Clark led an expedition against the Shawnee towns on the Great Miami River in 1782, one of the last actions of the war, but he was never able to mount an expedition against Detroit.|$|E
