40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} laboratory experiments in order to investigate {{on the effect of}} <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash on hydraulic conductivity of sand. The study were conducted on Baldivis Yellow Concrete Sand (The Western Australian sand) with different percentage of lime (% 1, 2 %, 3 %), fly ash (% 5, % 10, % 15) <b>and</b> composition of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash. A few researches carried out in this field however, the result of current study revealed an effective role of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash in the reduction of hydraulic conductivity of sand. The obtained results illustrated that, in compared with the other results of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash specimens the combination of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash had a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity of sand. Hence, it seems that utilization of the combination of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash was more effective than use additives alone (i. e., <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> fly ash) ...|$|R

Testing showed a white lime plaster layer made of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> sand <b>and</b> a brown <b>lime</b> plaster layer made from a [...] "clayish soil" [...] of weathered rock <b>and</b> <b>lime.</b> Both types showed lump-typed clayish soil of weathered rock, <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> shell.|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} {{stabilization}} {{was meant to}} analysis the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of lateritic soil when stabilized with <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> wood ash. The aim was to evaluate and provide information for adequate and economical design during stabilization procedures. Classification tests including the moisture content, specific gravity, Atterberg limit and grain-size analysis were performed on the samples in the natural state and when stabilized with <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> wood ash. CBR tests (both soaked and unsoaked) and compaction tests were carried out to establish the analysis parameters needed for the study. <b>Lime</b> <b>and</b> wood ash were added in 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % by weight of sample. Controls were made at 0 % <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> wood ash and another at 2 % each of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> wood ash. The optimum percentage of stabilization was obtained at 6 % for both stabilizers while results also indicated that 10 % lime sample had the highest optimum moisture content at maximum dry density. The value of CBR at 2 % lime + 2 % wood ash {{was found to be}} lower than stabilizations at 4 % <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> 4 % wood ash and that soaking generally lowered the CBR values for all the samples. The results revealed that the CBR values of the soil samples were generally better when stabilized with lime, while MDD of the samples were better with wood ash stabilization...|$|R

40|$|For the {{utilization}} of flyash in improving the strength of problematic soils a detail experimental study {{on the behavior of}} flyash stabilized with various percentages of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> sodium silicate and the strength characteristics at their free pouring (30 %, 35 % & 40 % of water by weight of flyash) consistencies have been studied. Different percentages of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> sodium silicate (gel) were added to flyash and tested for UCS and split tensile strength for different curing periods like 3 days, 7 days and 28 days to obtain optimum dosage of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> sodium silicate. From the test data it was found that 10 to 15 % of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> 3 to 5 % of sodium silicate have been identified as optimum dosages.

40|$|Application of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> gypsum for {{alleviation}} {{of aluminum}} toxicity in acid soil, including potassium (K) fertilization, {{may interfere with}} the nutrient uptake of longkong (Aglaia dookkoo Griff.) trees. Threeexperiments were conducted to explore the possible problem of longkong soil. 1) Effect of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> gypsum on growth and nutrient uptake of longkong seedling. 2) Effect of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> potassium chloride on potassiumand magnesium uptake of longkong. 3) Relationship between potassium, calcium and magnesium in longkong leaves. The results showed that exchangeable aluminum in the soil decreased {{with the increase of}} Ca(OH) 2 treatment and the application of lime was more effective than that of the gypsum treatment. Theapplication of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> gypsum tended to increase nutrient concentration in longkong, but did not affect the growth of longkong seedlings. The lime application on nutrient uptake of longkong seedlings decreased Kuptake; no <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> <b>lime</b> treatments were 863 and 720 mg tree- 1, while without K applied the per tree uptakes were 579 and 356 mg tree- 1 respectively. Besides the K application treatment reduced Ca and Mg uptake. Negative correlations between K and Ca (r = - 0. 532 **) and between K and Mg (r = - 0. 663 **) in leaves of 60 longkong trees in a farmer's orchard were found...|$|R

40|$|Construction on {{problematic}} {{and soft}} soils {{has always been}} considered a challenging task by the geotechnical engineers. Such soils can be treated with traditional <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> cement stabilization. However in some cases using geogrid reinforced <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> cement treated materials can be very effective, especially in case of seismic or dynamic loads. In this research, a series of laboratory testing {{has been carried out}} to investigate mechanical properties of <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> cement treated granular materials with and without geogrid reinforcing layers. The results of the unconfined compressive tests show that geogrid reinforcement improves the ductility of the treated materials. However, it would not develop the compressive strength in many of used mix Designs. The investigations reveal that the mix design for <b>lime</b> <b>and</b> cement treatment must be selected accurately by considering the natural beds conditions to achieve the best possible results from stabilization procedure...|$|R
