This study evaluated the level of Malaysian youth appreciation {{of the spirit of}} volunteerism with respect to six appreciation constructs, namely, understanding, emotion, belief, practices, attitudes and motivation The study was conducted throughout the states in Peninsular Malaysia involving 500 randomly sampled youth aged between 15 and 30 and comprising all ethnic groups. Results of the statistical analysis showed that the level of Malaysian youth appreciation of the spirit of volunteerism was satisfactory except for the two parameters of emotion and motivation. In the case of emotion the study indicated the youth relative reluctance when volunteer programmes were located in areas suffering from diseases, unhygienic conditions and <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>amenities</b> as in disaster areas. Yet, it was in such a situation that the keen spirit of volunteerism was most needed. This thus points to the imperative of improving the motivational side of youth volunteerism programmes in the country...|$|E

40|$|Toronto is {{following}} the footsteps of populated urban cities like New York through the extrusion of skyscrapers, transforming Toronto {{into one of the}} densest cities in North America. Rapid development of residential density has produced a mono-centric core in which density is favoured over sustainable social neighbourhoods. This “gold rush” of condominium development has superseded the production of <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure to support the density added. Limited vacant lands, coupled with rising housing prices and the ever-increasing population, points to a potential crisis in which the long-term sustainability of these towers is questioned. Towers within the core {{can no longer afford to}} maintain the existing inflexible mono-culture, but must include <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure which supports the rapid density and diverse populous. The presence of the tower, soaring far beyond the ground plain, has further amplified the social and physical disconnect of the cities fabric and its inhabitants, while removing the responsibility from developers taking advantage of these trends. This thesis aims to investigate the production of tower “neighbourhoods” through the hybridization of vertical public and private spaces. The proposal aims to question the current high rise trends and limited <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure within the city and provide an alternative model for porous vertical neighbourhoods <b>in</b> which <b>public</b> <b>amenity</b> infrastructure is used to achieve social sustainability within Toronto’s core...|$|R

The first focuses on formal volunteering, that is volunteering through a third-sector organisation, and emphasises the free-choice nature of voluntary work, the public {{nature of the}} work and the high degree of personal agency involved.

The issue of whether the organisation makes a difference was explored in fifty-four life-review interviews with mid-life and older women. Women's formal and informal volunteering was explored within the dimensions of agency and public recognition. The results supported the proposition that in general high agency, highly public activities were associated with formal volunteering and low agency, private activities were associated with informal volunteering. While many formal activities, however, were limited <b>in</b> their <b>public</b> exposure they still differed from informal activities in that they often networked people who would not otherwise have contact.

Recent evidence (Dal Bo et al. 2013; Ashraf et al. 2014) shows, for instance, that offering higher compensation or career prospects is not incompatible with being able to attract pro-socially minded workers, and further research, particularly in advanced economies, is certainly needed. On the other hand, if it is the case that the public sector attracts prosocial workers, but this attitude dissipates over time, then this would have implications, for instance, for the design of career paths. Namely, closely linking career progression to tenure, as is common <b>in</b> the <b>public</b> sector <b>in</b> many countries, would effectively mean selecting people <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> <b>public</b> service motivation for leadership positions. Moreover, the <b>public</b> sector workforce <b>in</b> many OECD countries is ageing at an even faster pace than the rest of society due to the rapid expansion of the workforce from the 1970 s until the mid 1980 s followed by stabilization and hiring freezes in the 1980 s and 1990 s (Pilichowski et al. 2007).
