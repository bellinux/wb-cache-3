25|$|Tanzania's {{literary}} {{culture is}} primarily oral. Major oral <b>literary</b> <b>forms</b> include folktales, <b>poems,</b> riddles, proverbs, and songs. The greatest part of Tanzania's recorded oral literature is in Swahili, even though {{each of the}} country's languages has its own oral tradition. The country's oral literature has been declining because of {{the breakdown of the}} multigenerational social structure, making transmission of oral literature more difficult, and because increasing modernisation has been accompanied by the devaluation of oral literature.|$|R
50|$|Voltaire was a {{versatile}} and prolific writer, producing works {{in almost every}} <b>literary</b> <b>form,</b> including plays, <b>poems,</b> novels, essays, and historical and scientific works. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and more than 2,000 books and pamphlets. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties, despite the risk this placed him in under the strict censorship laws of the time. As a satirical polemicist, he frequently made use of his works to criticize intolerance, religious dogma, and the French institutions of his day.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the rhythmic}} {{patterns}} observed in natural and synthesized speech are compared for three <b>literary</b> <b>forms</b> (rhymes, <b>poems,</b> and fairy tales). The {{aim of the}} comparison is to evaluate how rhythm could be improved in synthesized speech, which could allow adapting it to specific styles or genres. The study {{is based on the}} analysis of a corpus of six rhymes, four poems and two extracts from fairy tales. All texts were recorded by three speakers and were generated with two distinct synthesized voices. The comparison of the rhythmic patterns observed is done by analyzing duration in relation to prosodic structure in the various data sets. This approach allows showing that rhythmic differences between synthesized and natural speech are mostly due to the marking of prosodic structure...|$|R
50|$|This poem of Donelaitis did {{not differ}} in <b>literary</b> <b>form</b> from fables, <b>poems,</b> and idylls then in vogue in Germany and Europe in general, nor did it depart from the fashion of writing in {{imitation}} of the ancient Greek and Roman poets. The Seasons, moreover, followed the literary tendency of the day to portray not cities and aristocrats but rather the natural setting of the village and its inhabitants (for example James Thomson, Albrecht von Haller, Ewald Christian von Kleist, Barthold Heinrich Brockes). In the poem the reader finds {{a good deal of the}} didactic element so popular at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Tanzanian {{literature}} is primarily oral. Major oral <b>literary</b> <b>forms</b> include folktales, <b>poems,</b> riddles, proverbs, and songs. The {{majority of the}} oral literature in Tanzania that has been recorded is in Swahili, though each of the country's languages has its own oral tradition. [...] The country's oral {{literature is}} currently declining because of changes in family structure that make transmission of oral literature more difficult {{and because of the}} devaluation of oral literature that has accompanied Tanzania's development. [...] Tanzania's written literary tradition is still relatively undeveloped; Tanzania does not have a strong reading culture, and books are often expensive and hard to come by. Most Tanzanian literature is in Swahili or English. Major figures in Tanzanian written literature include Shaaban Robert, Muhammed Said Abdulla, Abdulrazak Gurnah, and Penina Mlama.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} postcolonial politics and aesthetics in Linton Kwesi Johnson’s poetry. The thesis shows how Johnson’s poems are predominantly analysed and discussed in a political context. Less examined, however, are ways Johnson’s poetry engages in a discussion about poetic form and aesthetics. Johnson is inspired by reggae music, and he discusses how reggae can inspire a new <b>literary</b> <b>form.</b> In the <b>poems,</b> bass and rhythm can transform people and the society they live in. This thesis examines why studies of Johnson, and of many postcolonial authors in general, tend to extract explicit political messages from the texts and neglect their aesthetic features, and discusses the problematic consequences of this critical praxis. The thesis will discuss Elleke Boehmer’s claim {{that there is an}} institutionalised opposition between ‘the postcolonial’ and ‘the aesthetic’. I argue that Johnson’s poems challenge this opposition, and that they offer the ongoing debate over the role of aesthetics in postcolonial literature some new perspectives...|$|R
40|$|Ekphrasis is {{examined}} here {{in terms of}} the creative process behind Henri Michaux's En rêvant à partir de peintures énigmatiques (1972), a collection of prose poems inspired by the paintings of René Magritte. Ekphrasis will be primarily understood as a verbal description of a visual work of art; Michaux's use of this technique will be seen to question its traditional boundaries and limitations. Analysing Michaux's exploration of the processes of literary creation through ekphrasis in this text also highlights Magritte's similarly playful interrogation of representation. A central concern here is the ekphrastic work's constant struggle to disengage from its source of inspiration whilst being in itself a prolonged engagement with this source. Michaux's interpretation and manipulation of images (Magritte's paintings) and the <b>literary</b> <b>form</b> (the prose <b>poem)</b> are also explored in terms of his dual status as artist-writer. Given that grainy photographs are the basis of Michaux's initial encounter with many of the paintings described, what is the status of the painting and its potential to generate ekphrasis in the age of mechanical reproduction? How might the ‘visual poetry’ of Magritte be recreated or interpreted in a poetic work...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} Jan Erik Vold's early {{work from the}} {{perspective}} of "attituderelativisme" represented in Scandinavia by the Danish poet and essayist Hans-Jrgen Nielsen. All the 7 Vold's books from this period are treated not only chronologically but rather cyclically - as three plus one contradictory pairs. The lyrical début mellom speil og speil (1965) is confronted with the experimental book blikket (1966). The thesis observes the different ways of inspiration of the absurd in HEKT (1966) and in fra rom til rom SAD &CRAZY (1967) and analyses the monistic double-project: Mor Godhjertas glade versjon. Ja (1968) in comparison with kykelipi (1969). The last book, spor, sn from 1970, introduces a final perspective (being in contrast to all the other books) inspired by Zen Buddhism and the <b>literary</b> <b>form</b> of haiku <b>poems.</b> The structure of "consentient antithesis" in Vold's literary concept shows how the lyrical structure is modified into the structure of a poetic text; how the lyrical subject changes; how the traditional metaphors and symbols are dissolved and the poem becomes metaphorical as a whole. The thesis indicates that this is caused by an emphasized use of non-figurative poetic expression instead of the traditional figurative meaning...|$|R

50|$|Al-Wathiq al-Mutahhar (1303 - 1379/80) was an imam of the Zaidi {{state of}} Yemen, {{who was also}} a poet. A native of As Sudah, {{he was the son of}} the {{powerful}} imam al-Mahdi Muhammad bin al-Mutahhar who died in 1328. After the death of al-Mahdi, no less than four would-be imams tried to assert their authority over the Zaidi community. One of them was al-Wathiq al-Mutahhar, who made his proclamation in 1330 from Haidah, south of San'a. However, he quickly had to yield to the strongest claimant, al-Mu'ayyad Yahya. Al-Mu'ayyad held the imamate to his death in 1346 or 1349. Although he was not really a mujtahid (a person sufficiently educated to make independent legal-religious interpretations), al-Wathiq briefly succeeded al-Mu'ayyad Yahya in 1349, and seized San'a. Again, however, he was rapidly forced to step down by a stronger candidate, al-Mahdi Ali. After this, he withdrew to teaching and literary activities, and eventually died in San'a. His gravestone, in the Great Mosque (al-Jami' al-Kabir) of San'a, is dated in 781 AH (1379/80). Other texts mention the year 802 AH (1399) for his demise. The biography of al-Wathiq al-Mutahhar was written by his cousin an-Nasir bin Ali bin al-Mutahhar. The imam himself is credited with a number of writings. These include a diwan with many <b>poems</b> in younger <b>literary</b> <b>form,</b> and praise <b>poems</b> about Sultan al-Malik al-Afdal. In fact, he is one of the earliest known authors of the vernacular humayni poetry.|$|R
