5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Seeing him, a faint exclamation escaped her, and {{she turned}} away in sudden haste to enter the inn. The fine gentleman <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> scowled; the parson <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> trembled; the ostler <b>and</b> his boy <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> grinned. Then all swept forward and were {{screened}} by the porch from the wondering eyes of Mr. Caryll.|$|R

[Singing.] <b>Look</b> <b>up,</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> see, What heaven {{prepares for}} thee; <b>Look</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> this fair fruit behold, Ruddy it smiles, and rich with streaks of gold. The loaded {{branches}} downward bend, Willing they stoop, and thy fair hand attend. Fair mother of mankind, make haste And bless, and bless thy senses with the taste.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E
25|$|Sarah <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> sees birds flying by. Leslie becomes defensive. Nancy {{explains}} to Sarah {{that the birds}} are seagulls. The females compare them to underwater rays. Nancy tells Sarah that she has seen photographs of rays. Nancy and Charlie cannot explain what photography is to her, so Sarah believes they are insulting her. When Leslie returns, Sarah explains what has happened.|$|E
25|$|Sadako {{eventually}} recovers and tearfully mourns her own actions. However, Ikuma, albeit reluctantly, {{drugs and}} chases {{her to a}} nearby well, where he apologizes to her before throwing her down the well. Sadako briefly has a dream of meeting with Toyama again before cutting down to the present. She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> screams as the well stone is slid to its place, trapping her inside.|$|E

50|$|Vervet monkeys are {{the typical}} example of both animal alarm calls and of {{semantic}} capacity in non-human animals. They have three distinct calls for leopards, snakes, and eagles, and {{research shows that}} each call elicits different responses. When vervets {{are on the ground}} they respond to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running to cover, to leopard alarm calls primarily by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> running into a tree, and to the snake alarm call primarily by looking down. When in trees vervets responded to the eagle alarm call by <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and running out of trees, to the leopard alarm call by running higher in the tree <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down, and to the snake alarm call by looking primarily down.|$|R

500|$|Tony, Carmela, and AJ {{meet for}} dinner, while the Journey song [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...] {{plays in the}} background. The camera cuts away from the Soprano family and {{presents}} vignettes of other diners. As the tension increases, Meadow is shown struggling with parking then crossing {{the street to the}} restaurant. A man, who had been previously shown at the counter specifically taking notice of Tony, is shown entering the restroom, the door of which is directly facing and approximately 90 degrees to the table at which Tony and his family are sitting. As Meadow walks up to the door, the screen goes to Tony. The diner door opens with a bell ringing, Tony <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the show smash cuts to black and after a few seconds the credits roll in silence.|$|E
2500|$|After filming in {{the desert}} concluded, {{production}} moved to Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles, on Las Virgenes Road off Mulholland Highway, where the 20th Century Fox's Malibu Ranch was located. Ape City {{was built on the}} ranch, and a field of corn grown, by which Heston first encounters Harrison. [...] "It was stinking hot," [...] Harrison recalled. [...] "The scenes of us in cages were also shot at Ape City." [...] From the Malibu Ranch, production moved to the coast, where the penultimate scenes were shot between Malibu and Oxnard. The final scenes were filmed in a secluded cove between Zuma Beach and Point Dume on the far eastern end of Westward Beach. Harrison's Nova was the sole human witness to Taylor's outburst on the beach, after which she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>and,</b> in the film's iconic ending, sees the ruined Statue of Liberty, without comprehending why it has caused her mate's grief.|$|E
