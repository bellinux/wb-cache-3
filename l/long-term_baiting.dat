40|$|Translocation and {{reintroduction}} {{are used}} to reduce extinction risk associated with a small population and range size in threatened mammal species. We evaluated {{the outcome of a}} reintroduction of the bridled nailtail wallaby Onychogalea fraenata to Avocet Nature Refuge, a private refuge in central Queensland, Australia. This macropod was also reintroduced to Idalia National Park in western Queensland in 1996 and occurs in one natural population in central Queensland. We estimated population growth, adult and juvenile survival, and distribution changes since the last release of O. fraenata to Avocet in 2005, and evaluated female reproductive success and health. Although animals were in good condition, population size was a tenth of that of the 1996 Idalia reintroduction reported after 3 years and, unlike at Idalia, juvenile survival at Avocet was low. The likely causes are consistent with predictors of translocation and reintroduction failures in mammals. These are predation, the small number of individuals in each release, the likely suboptimal health status of reintroduced individuals, drought, and possibly lack of dispersal from the small area of preferred habitat. The lessons of this reintroduction are that future attempts are likely to have the best chance of success if they occur in non-drought years, at sites with large, non-fragmented areas of brigalow forest, involve the release of large groups of animals together, and are accompanied by intensive, <b>long-term</b> <b>baiting</b> to control introduced predators...|$|E
40|$|The {{mountain}} beaver (Aplodontia rufa) is a fossorialrodent species endemic to the Pacific Northwest and portions of California. This herbivore inflicts {{millions of dollars}} of damage annually to forest seedling plantations. Currently, extensive trapping prior to planting is the most reliable method for reducing damage. With increasing restrictions placed on trapping, forest resource managers need alternative tools to minimize forest damage. This study assessed the potential of four toxicants registered for underground use to control{{mountain beaver}}; zinc phosphide, diphacinone, chlorophacinone, and strychnine. Zinc phosphide and strychnine are acute toxicants, whereas diphacinone and chlorophacinone are anticoagulants. Anticoagulants prevent the recycling of vitamin K in the body, which inhibits the production of clotting factors. Efficacy varied among treatments. Zinc phosphide and strychnine were avoided by mountain beaver. Pre-baiting marginally increased acceptance of strychnine, but did not alter mountain beaver acceptance of zinc phosphide. Diphacinone and chlorophacinone were both readily consumed, but only chlorophacinone was 100 % effective after a 14 -day baiting regime. Subsequently, we tested the effects of diet on the efficacy of diphacinone by varying the availability of food containing vitamin K, the anticoagulant antidote. Restricting access to potential sources of vitamin K appeared to increase efficacy. We conclude that anticoagulants hold some promise as additional tools for managers to reduce mountain beaver populations with chlorophacinone showing the most promise. However, limitations to anticoagulant baits include the necessity of <b>long-term</b> <b>baiting</b> (greater than 10 days), a possible decrease in toxicity if baits contact moisture, and potential primary hazards...|$|E
40|$|Context: Feral {{cats and}} foxes pose a {{significant}} threat to native wildlife in the Australian arid zone and their broadscale control {{is required for}} the protection of threatened species. Aims: The aim of this research was to trial aerial poison baiting as a means of controlling feral cats and foxes in northern South Australia. Methods: Eradicat baits or dried meat baits containing 1080 poison were distributed by air over areas of 650 to 1800 km 2 in trials from 2002 to 2006. Different baiting density, frequency, bait type and area were trialled to determine the optimum baiting strategy. Baiting success was determined through mortality of radio-collared animals and differences in the track activity of cats and foxes in baited and unbaited areas. Key results: Quarterly aerial baiting at a density of 10 baits per square km successfully controlled foxes over a 12 -month period, while annual baiting led to reinvasion within four months. Despite the majority of radio-collared cats dying after baiting, a significant decline in cat activity was only recorded during one of the eight baiting events. This event coincided with extremely dry conditions and low rabbit abundance. Rabbit activity increased significantly in baited areas over the study period in comparison with control areas. Conclusions: Despite trialling different baiting density, frequency and area over a five-year period, a successful <b>long-term</b> <b>baiting</b> strategy for feral cats could not be developed using Eradicat baits or dried meat baits. Implications: Broadscale control of feral cats in the arid zone remains a significant challenge and may require a combination of control methods with flexible delivery times dependent on local conditions. However, it is doubtful that current methods, even used in combination, will enable cat numbers to be reduced to levels where successful reintroductions of many threatened wildlife species can occur.

40|$|Small mammals {{pass through}} or under chain link {{security}} fences, triggering sensors and undermining facility infrastructure at sensitive military sites. Traditional methods of rodent control are not practical {{because of the}} vastness of land to be maintained with limited manpower. Permanent barriers (above and below ground) and low-maintenance, <b>long-term</b> <b>bait</b> stations offer potential permanent and cost-effective solutions to mitigate rodent intrusions. We assessed Richardson’s ground squirrel populations, activities, and burrows at Malmstrom Air Force Base, MT. We also conducted preliminary barrier trials in the outdoor rodent buildings of the USDA National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins, CO. Ground squirrels were very numerous and active at most sites visited in Montana. Burrows were both simple and short as well some being elaborate and deep (to 5 + ft). Squirrels readily passed through and under the 2 -inch mesh chain link fences as well as under site gates. Several effective barriers were identified in pen trials that prevented above-ground and below-ground intrusions. These {{will need to be}} field tested. Future studies will investigate designs for a low-maintenance, <b>long-term</b> rodenticide <b>bait</b> stations for deployment at remote sites...|$|R
40|$|A low-maintenance, <b>long-term</b> <b>bait</b> {{station that}} resets itself after being {{triggered}} {{would be a}} very useful tool for controlling Richardson’s ground squirrels, or other problem rodent species, in remote locations. With collaborators, we developed and tested two such devices using lab rats in pen settings. The devices can be left in-situ {{for long periods of time}} without servicing, and requires only occasional bait and/or battery replacement. Squirrels would be unable to cache bait due to the integrated time-out mechanism. The devices use capacitive sensor or strain gauge systems for animal identification, making it very unlikely that smaller non-target species would be able to trigger the systems while the design precludes entry by larger non-target species. Further refinement and testing will be needed before a viable, commercial product can go into production. These refinements include increasing reliability, reducing power requirements, design features and triggering mechanisms tightly linked to the attributes of the targeted pest species, and reduction of production costs. The devices will also need to be tested in field settings for extended periods of time...|$|R
40|$|Echinococcus multilocularis, the {{zoonotic}} agent of human alveolar echinococcosis, has considerably extended its range and became {{more prevalent in}} many parts of the endemic areas. Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for measures to prevent human infections. Rising public awareness of this zoonosis and individual protective actions should be part of every prevention program. Considering the high reproduction of E. multilocularis in domestic dogs which live in close contact to humans, a monthly deworming scheme for domestic dogs with access to rodents is likely to be of high importance. This holds true if only low prevalences in domestic dogs are recorded, as high densities of these pets can easily outweigh low infections rates. Thus, in central Europe their estimated contribution to environmental contamination with E. multilocularis eggs ranges between 4 % and 19 %. The estimated contribution of domestic cats is insignificant (< 0. 3 %) due to low parasite reproduction in this species. Control of the parasite by reducing its main wildlife hosts (foxes, vole species) is barely achievable on a larger scale and is generally not well accepted due to ecological considerations and animal welfare concerns. In general, the frequency of the parasite sharply decreases when anthelmintic baits are regularly distributed to foxes. However, eradication of the parasite is unlikely and <b>long-term</b> <b>baiting</b> campaigns are actually the most effective tool to significantly lower the infection pressure with parasite eggs. Regarding the long latency of 5 - 15 years of alveolar echinococcosis, however, such measures can only be cost effective if they are pursued for several decades and concentrate on restricted areas which are most relevant for the transmission of alveolar echinococcosis such as highly endemic areas in densely populated zones. Thus, the implementation of this approach strongly depends on factors such as public attitude, available financial resources and priority setting of political decision-makers...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} the diet of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the Jervis Bay Region was {{assessed}} following a <b>long-term</b> <b>baiting</b> program by analysing the composition of fox faecal excreta (scats). In all, 470 fox scats were collected between April and August 2003 from two baited sites, Booderee National Park (BNP) and Beecroft Peninsula, and from two unbaited sites in the southern and northern parts of Jervis Bay National Park (SJBNP and NJBNP respectively). Diet was compared between these sites and mammalian diet was also compared from scats collected before baiting in 1996 and after baiting in 2000 at Beecroft Peninsula and in 2001 at Booderee National Park. In 2003, the most common species consumed by foxes was the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), except at unbaited NJBNP, where the swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) was the most frequent dietary item. Significant dietary {{differences were found between}} unbaited and baited sites, with the long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta) and P. peregrinus featuring more in the diet of foxes from the baited sites. Marked increases in the frequency of occurrence of P. peregrinus and P. nasuta i n fox scats occurred from before baiting through to after baiting. Relative fox abundance, as indexed by the number of scats collected per kilometre, was lowest in Booderee, followed by Beecroft, then SJBNP, with NJBNP having the highest relative abundance of foxes. We suggest that baiting did affect the diet of foxes on both peninsulas and that the dietary changes across baiting histories were intrinsically related to an increase in abundance in some taxa as a result of relaxed predator pressure following sustained fox control. However, the lack of unbaited control sites over the whole study precludes a definitive conclusion. <br /...|$|E
