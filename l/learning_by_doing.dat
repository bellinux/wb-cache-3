5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing,</b> teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of Scouting describe {{a code of}} behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: law and promise, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing,</b> team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support. While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.|$|E
5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

500|$|The operas of {{the early}} period show Verdi <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> and {{gradually}} establishing mastery over the different elements of opera. Oberto is poorly structured, and the orchestration of the first operas is generally simple, sometimes even basic. The musicologist Richard Taruskin suggests [...] "the most striking effect in the early Verdi operas, and the one most obviously allied to {{the mood of the}} Risorgimento, was the big choral number sung—crudely or sublimely, according to the ear of the beholder—in unison. The success of [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] in Nabucco (which Rossini approvingly denoted as [...] "a grand aria sung by sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses"), was replicated in the similar [...] "O Signor, dal tetto natio" [...] in I lombardi and in 1844 in the chorus [...] "Si ridesti il Leon di Castiglia" [...] in Ernani, the battle hymn of the conspirators seeking freedom In I due Foscari Verdi first uses recurring themes identified with main characters; here and in future operas the accent moves away from the 'oratorio' characteristics of the first operas towards individual action and intrigue.|$|E

While there is much enthusiasm for constructivism as a design strategy, according to Tobias and Duffy [...] "... to us it would appear that constructivism remains more of a philosophical framework than a theory that either allows us to precisely describe instruction or prescribe design strategies.(p.4)".|$|E

5000|$|Research {{conducted}} by Shaffer, D., Squire, K., Halverson, R., & Gee, J. P. from the University of Wisconsin - Madison shows {{the educational and}} social benefits of digital games. Games {{do not need to}} be specifically geared towards education to be educational tools. Games can bring together ways of knowing, ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of caring. [...] As John Dewey argued, schools are built on an obsession with facts. Students need to <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing,</b> and with gaming, students can <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> something as a part of a larger community of people who share common goals and ways of achieving those common goals, making gaming a benefit for social reasons as well. Gaming has also changed the look of content-driven curriculum in schools. In content-driven media, people <b>learn</b> <b>by</b> being told and reflecting on what they are told. In gaming, game designers create digital environments and game levels that shape, facilitate and even teach problem solving.|$|R
