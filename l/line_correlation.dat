40|$|We derive an {{analytical}} expression for a novel large-scale structure observable: the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function. The <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function, which is constructed from the three-point correlation {{function of the}} phase of the density field, is a robust statistical measure allowing the extraction of information in the non-linear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in perturbation theory, the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> is sensitive to the coupling kernel F 2, which governs the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field. We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations and find a very good agreement for separations r ∼> 20 Mpc/h. Fitting formulae for the power spectrum and the non-linear coupling kernel at small scales allow us to extend our prediction into the strongly non-linear regime. We discuss {{the advantages of the}} <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> relative to standard statistical measures like the bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> is independent of the linear bias. Furthermore, the variance of the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of the density field. This suggests that the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> can probe more precisely the non-linear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the power spectrum variance...|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{anisotropic}} generalisation of the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function (ALCF) {{to separate}} and quantify phase {{information in the}} large-scale structure of galaxies. The <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function probes the strictly non-linear regime of structure formation and since phase information drops out of the power spectrum, the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function provides a complementary tool to commonly used techniques based on two-point statistics. Furthermore, it is independent of linear bias {{as well as the}} Gaussian variance on the modulus of the density field and thus may also prove to be advantageous compared to the bispectrum or similar higher-order statistics for certain cases. For future applications it is vital, though, to be able to account for observational effects that cause anisotropies in the distribution of galaxies. Based on a number of numerical studies, we find that our ALCF is well suited to accomplish this task and we demonstrate how the Alcock-Paczynski effect and kinematical redshift-space distortions can in principle be measured via the ALCF.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an alternative to}} conventional three-point statistics such as the bispectrum, which is purely based on the Fourier phases of the density field: the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function. This statistic directly probes the non-linear clustering regime and contains information highly complementary to that contained in the power spectrum. In this work, we determine, for the first time, its potential to constrain cosmological parameters and detect baryon acoustic oscillations (hereafter BAOs). We show how to compute the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function for a discrete sampled set of tracers that follow a local Lagrangian biasing scheme and demonstrate how it breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of density fluctuations and the bias parameters of the model. We then derive analytic expressions for its covariance and show {{that it can be}} written as a sum of a Gaussian piece plus non-Gaussian corrections. We compare our predictions with a large ensemble of N-body simulations and confirm that BAOs do indeed modulate the signal of the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function for scales 50 – 100 h− 1 Mpc and that the characteristic S-shape feature would be detectable in upcoming Stage IV surveys at the level of ∼ 4 σ. We then focus on the cosmological information content and compute Fisher forecasts for an idealized Stage III galaxy redshift survey of volume V ∼ 10 h− 3 Gpc 3 and out to z = 1.

Extracting this information is extremely challenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant computational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing correlations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether {{it is possible to}} reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of information by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of Fourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on ΛCDM parameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum decomposition, (b) the <b>line</b> <b>correlation</b> function and (c) the integrated bispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on ΛCDM parameters using these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those obtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple estimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise.
