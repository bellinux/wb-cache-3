50|$|For {{the next}} three months the {{destroyer}} escort continued screening operations out of Ulithi for a fleet <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> <b>unit</b> which replenished both Task Force 38 and Task Force 58. Departing Ulithi on 2 January 1945, Kyne provided escort service for refueling operations in support of the Luzon landings on 6 January. She remained on station in the Philippines before returning Ulithi on 21 January to prepare for the Iwo Jima landings. Operating together with support units, she departed Ulithi on 8 February to provide a screen for refueling operations during the Iwo Jima invasion. When that island was secure, giving the United States an air strip vitally needed as base for future B-29 raids on Japan, Kyne returned Ulithi on 5 March. Sailing again on 25 March as a screen to oilers, she made her way to Okinawa — the last step on the road to Japan. She continued screen and patrol operations for the support unit throughout most of the Okinawa campaign, returning to Ulithi on 21 May.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} five deployments to the Far East involved routine <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> for <b>units</b> {{assigned to}} TF 77 {{and to the}} Taiwan Strait patrol. When not cruising Asiatic waters, Tolovana punctuated training operations off the California coast with upkeep and periodic overhauls. In January 1960, Tolovana returned to the U.S. West Coast completing the last in her series of six, regular summer-fall deployments to the Far East. This, however, did not signal an end to such duty but rather to its regularity. In fact, {{over the next four}} years, she completed five tours of duty in Asian waters. During the second of this series, she was called upon to <b>support</b> those <b>units</b> of the fleet sent to Southeast Asia late in March 1961 to bolster the resolve of pro-western forces in Laos crumbling {{in the face of a}} major push on the part of Pathet Lao guerillas supported by North Vietnamese regulars. Though American resolve lessened the probability of a complete collapse of the anticommunist faction in Laos, the crisis did not die away until after Tolovana left the Far East in May to return home. She began her next tour of duty in the western Pacific in October 1961 and returned to the United States in February 1962.|$|R
25|$|In early April 1966, {{the unit}} was re-raised {{with the intent}} to deploy to South Vietnam as part of Australia's {{contribution}} to the Vietnam War, and was based initially at Puckapunyal, Victoria. The unit was staffed primarily by Citizens Military Force (CMF) medical officers on full-time service. A year-long period of training followed before the unit finally deployed, arriving at Vung Tau in late April 1967, and taking over from the 2nd Field Ambulance. Forming part of the 1st Australian <b>Logistic</b> <b>Support</b> Group, the <b>unit's</b> main force of about 100 personnel established a field hospital at Vung Tau capable of supporting about 50 patients. A smaller team of around platoon-strength deployed forward inland, working directly with the 1st Australian Task Force's deployed infantry battalions. In 1968, the field hospital was redesignated the 1st Australian Field Hospital as the medical services in Vietnam were expanded, although the forward medical detachment retained the 8th Field Ambulance designation. It was subsequently disbanded in 1972 following the conclusion of its tour.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn operational {{analysis of the}} delays incurred in Underway Replenishments of the Pacific Fleet, December, 1967 - April, 1969, is conducted. Twenty specific delays are analyzed from the UNREP data of which more than 80 %, was from UNREPs conducted in Southeast Asia by supply ships providing <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> to naval <b>units</b> engaged in combat operations. Delay occurrence distributions are derived; delay time distributions are derived, and tested for goodness-of-fit with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Delay {{as a function of}} the following UNREP attributes is analyzed: supply ship class, receiver ship type, time: day or night, location: EASTPAC or WESTPAC, simultaneous receivers or a single receiver, delivery method, product delivered, length of supply ship deployment, and weather. Hypothesis testing of delay occurrence parameters for UNREP attributes is done, and causes of delays are discussed. A method, based on the use of conditional probabilities and Bayes' Theorem, of predicting a delay occurrence prior to an UNREP when the UNREP attributes are known is presented[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
