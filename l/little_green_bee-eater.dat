40|$|I {{report on}} the social and {{breeding}} biology of four bee-eater species in Thailand. <b>Little</b> <b>Green</b> <b>Bee-eaters</b> (Merops orientalis) breed cooperatively in clusters of overlapping territories. Cooperative breeding units have one to two helpers that join the breeding pair only after incubation has begun. Nests rarely are left unguarded due to threats of predation and possible intraspecific brood parasitism. Males also guard their mates against extrapair copulations. The Blue-tailed Bee-eater (M Philippinus) breeds cooperatively and has a complex social system, with evidence suggestive of intraspecific brood parasitism and extrapair copulation. I provide evidence that the Bay-headed Bee-eater (M Leschenaulti) breeds cooperatively and report observations of noncooperative breeding at one nest in the Blue-bearded Bee-eater (Nyctyornis athertoni) ...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{breeding}} (CB) {{is found}} in a wide diversity of avian lineages and can be explained at several levels of analysis. After a brief introduction to the theory explaining CB, I take an historical approach to examine CB evolution in the bee-eaters (Family Meropidae). Parsimony analyses of plumage color and shape characters yielded a number of phylogenetic hypotheses. The best supported phylogenies are six fully resolved trees from three analyses and a strict consensus tree from another analysis. These trees are {{used to examine the}} possible patterns of evolution in CB and how transition correspond to transitions in other ecological and behavioral traits. Bee-eaters were also studied in Thailand. <b>Little</b> <b>green</b> <b>bee-eaters,</b> Merops orientalis, breed cooperatively and predation pressure may be high in this species. Blue-tailed bee-eaters, M. philippinus, breed cooperatively in dense colonies and show signs of potential extra-pair copulation and intraspecific brood parasitism. Observations of the bay-headed bee-eater, M. leschenaulti, and the blue-bearded bee-eater, Nyctyornis athertoni, document CB in the former and support non-CB designation for the latter. Cooperative breeding is either primitive in bee-eaters or evolved early in the family. Reversals to non-CB occurred in one to three lineages. Transitions in breeding systems are not generally correlated with the transitions in nesting requirements, habitat utilization, migratory behavior, or diet. Evidence suggests correlated evolution between CB and both foraging mode (weak evidence) and social systems (stronger support). This study does not support any single hypothesis for the adaptive basis of CB across the family. Social system evolutionary patterns do suggest the importance of kin selection in several lineages. Lack of change in breeding systems, given diverse ecological and behavioral circumstances, means either cooperative breeding is malleable (selectively advantageous in a variety of ecological conditions) or represents phylogenetic inertia. A final analysis demonstrates that phylogenetic confidence indices fail to express the degree to which characters in a matrix are non-conflicting and congruent (for a given level of noise) and show only limited abilities to distinguish among probabilities of analyses making type II errors...|$|R

50|$|The green {{bee-eater}} (Merops orientalis) (sometimes <b>little</b> <b>green</b> <b>bee-eater)</b> is a near passerine {{bird in the}} bee-eater family. It is resident but prone to seasonal movements and is found widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal and the Gambia to Ethiopia, the Nile valley, western Arabia and Asia through India to Vietnam. They are mainly insect eaters and they are found in grassland, thin scrub and forest often quite far from water.

50|$|Like {{other species}} in the genus, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants, which {{are caught in the}} air by sorties from an open perch. Before swallowing prey, a bee-eater removes stings and breaks the exoskeleton of the prey by repeatedly thrashing it on the perch. Migration is not known but they make seasonal movements in response to rainfall. These birds are somewhat sluggish in the mornings and may be found huddled next to each other on wires sometimes with their bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They sand-bathe more frequently than other bee-eater species and will sometimes bathe in water by dipping into water in flight. They are usually seen in small groups and often roost communally in large numbers (200-300). The birds move excitedly at the roost site and call loudly, often explosively dispersing before settling back to the roost tree.The <b>little</b> <b>green</b> <b>bee-eater</b> is also becoming common in urban and sub-urban neighborhoods, and has been observed perching on television antennae, only to launch into a brief, zig-zag flight formation to catch an insect, then return to the same perch and consume the meal. This behaviour is generally observed between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00am, and after 4:00pm.The breeding season is from March to June. Unlike many bee-eaters, these are often solitary nesters, making a tunnel in a sandy bank. The breeding pairs are often joined by helpers. They nest in hollows in vertical mud banks. The nest tunnel that they construct can run as much as 5 feet long and the 3-5 eggs are laid on the bare ground in the cavity {{at the end of the}} tunnel. The eggs are very spherical and glossy white. Clutch size varies with rainfall and insect food density. Both sexes incubate. The eggs hatch asynchronously with an incubation period of about 14 days and the chicks grow fledge in 3 to 4 weeks and in the fledging stage show a reduction in body weight.|$|E

40|$|Part 3 of {{the study}} of loess ground and {{bee-eater}} birds concerns birds and ground in the north-western part of the Indian Sub-continent. Three species of bee-eaters are considered, relative to the Indus region: the <b>Green</b> <b>bee-eater,</b> the Blue-cheeked bee-eater and the European bee-eater. Loess in the Indus region is considered via the deterministic approach to loess deposit formation; the P events occur in the mountains of the western part of High Asia, particles are formed by the action of mountain glaciers. Major T actions involve the five rivers of the region which carry loess material into the Punjab plains. Subsequent T actions deliver loess material to local deposits, which provide nesting grounds for bee-eaters. To some extent the bee-eaters define the loess. The <b>Green</b> <b>bee-eater</b> is small (16 – 18 cm long) and lives over all of India and Pakistan-nesting ground is available everywhere. The larger bee-eaters (European and Blue-cheeked: (25 cm)) are more constrained by ground properties-they require the ideal properties of loess ground (an ideal positioning relative to the Heneberg compromise) for nesting, and thus tend to define loess extent. Soil mechanics requires that more exact stress conditions are achieved when a relatively large nest tunnel is being constructed...|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the <b>green</b> <b>bee-eater</b> to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|R
