5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set his sights on a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|In 1666 John Mylne {{designed}} and {{was engaged to}} build Panmure House, near Forfar, for the 2nd Earl of Panmure. After his death, the work was continued by Alexander Nisbet, possibly {{with the assistance of}} William Bruce. This house, demolished in 1950, resembled Heriot's Hospital and other Scottish 17th-century buildings, rather than <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new classical styles which would be introduced by Bruce. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–1667, Mylne {{designed and}} built fortifications at Lerwick, which were later reconstructed as Fort Charlotte. He provided a design for Linlithgow's tolbooth in 1667, but following his death another mason was sought, and a different design built. Another scheme was for Leslie House, carried out after his death by Robert Mylne, again with the advice of Bruce.|$|E

5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who {{came back from}} the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and the Bucks won 106–85. In Game 2, the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E

25|$|Moore's {{law is the}} {{observation}} {{that the number of}} transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).|$|E
25|$|Another serious fire {{occurred}} in Hastings {{in the spring}} of 1864, by which a fine brick store and a large stock of goods were almost entirely destroyed.

But this dark day, it is believed, has to a threat extent passed away; and increased hope and renewed enterprise promise ere long to restore this fine village to more than its former prosperity.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{unveiled}} on November 20, when Activision {{announced it was}} not going to be a direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after the events of the film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time. The game was next shown at E3 in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham liked the idea of the 360° combat system but found it difficult to get used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the camera system to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first game had failed to do) and admitted he was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final build.|$|E

Then the three Patriarchs read out a conciliar decree, authorizing the cardinals, without regard to Obedience, {{in the name of the}} Council and by virtue of Canon Law to proceed to an election.

25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E
