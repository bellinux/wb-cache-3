In this paper, a yeast amyloid-forming protein Sup 35 {{was used as a}} model for understanding amyloid fiber formation. The dynamics of amyloid formation by Sup 35 were studied with scanning force microscopy. We found that: 1) the assembly of Sup 35 fibers begins with individual NM peptides that aggregate to form large beads or nucleation units which, in turn, form dimers, trimers, tetramers and longer <b>linear</b> <b>assemblies</b> appearing as a string of beads; 2) the morphology of the <b>linear</b> <b>assemblies</b> differ; and 3) fiber assembly suggests an analogy to the aggregation of colloidal particles.

Additionally, further control over the resulting H-bonded structures could be gained with a slight modification of the molecular building blocks by, for example, varying the length or the chemical nature of the alkyl moieties for 2 and/or 3 or by attaching other functional groups to 1.

The current study highlights the extension of a two-metalloporphyrin array to a four-metalloporphyrin array through the incorporation of a coiled-coil repeat unit. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the initial design evolves rapidly to a stable structure with a small rmsd compared to the original model.

40|$|Self-assembly is {{fundamental}} to both biological processes and nanoscience. Key features of self-assembly are its probabilistic nature and local programmability. These features can be leveraged to design better self-assembled systems. The conventional Tile Assembly Model (TAM) developed by Winfree using Wang tiles is a powerful, Turing-universal theoretical framework which models varied self-assembly processes. A particular challenge in DNA nanoscience is to form linear assemblies or rulers of a specified length using the smallest possible tile set, where any tile type may appear {{more than once in}} the assembly. The tile complexity of a <b>linear</b> <b>assembly</b> is the cardinality of the tile set that produced it. These rulers can then be used as components for construction of other complex structures. While square assemblies have been extensively studied, many questions remain about fixed length linear assemblies, which are more basic constructs yet fundamental building blocks for molecular architectures. In this paper, we extend TAM to take advantage of inherent probabilistic behavior in physically realized self-assembled systems by introducing randomization. We describe a natural extension to TAM called the Probabilistic Tile Assembly Model (PTAM). A restriction of the model, which we call the standard PTAM is considered in this paper. Prior work in DNA self-assembly strongly suggests that standard PTAM can be realized in the laboratory. In TAM, a deterministic <b>linear</b> <b>assembly</b> of length N require...|$|E

It {{is possible to}} create complex nanostructures {{with the use of}} self-assembling biological building blocks, which can be engineered to form specific interconnects. The filamentous bacteriophage M 13 is easily modified, and can display peptides on all five different types of coat proteins. An effective system that directs ordered <b>linear</b> <b>assembly</b> of M 13 would expand the possible applications of this phage. Our aim is to characterize a <b>linear</b> <b>assembly</b> system that was designed by Sweeney et al. In their model, each end of the phage displays a different, complementary leucine zipper domain. The two complementary leucine zipper sequences heterodimerize to line up the phage in linear structures. The Johnson Lab received a series of display plasmids from the Georgiou lab and identified a mutation in one of the leucine zipper sequences. A previous student, Marina Zambrotta, subcloned and corrected sequences containing the mutation. The corrected sequence has now been recloned into the original context to generate a corrected display vector and was used to produce fusion-displaying progeny phage. However, the expression of the display constructs appears to have a strong negative effect on phage yields. Current effort is being directed at optimizing improving phage yields, confirming display levels, and characterizing the ability of these genetically engineered phage to assemble into linear arrays. These experiments should shed further light on the properties of the system and make it a reliable and attractive candidate for further work...|$|E
