5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing <b>legal</b> <b>risks</b> to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision {{has defined}} {{operational}} <b>risk,</b> <b>legal</b> <b>risk</b> and compliance risk. However, the definitions {{might not be}} adequate for countries with a hybrid legal system, such as South Africa. This study aims to provide a practical solution to the problems faced by countries with a hybrid legal system wishing {{to comply with the}} Basel Committee’s standards. It is argued that compliance, compliance risk and regulatory risk should all be viewed as constituent components of <b>legal</b> <b>risk,</b> and in turn necessarily also of operational risk in a hybrid <b>legal</b> system. <b>Legal</b> <b>risk</b> is a wide concept which includes all aspects of a legal system, while compliance risk is a narrower concept which only includes the codified aspects of a <b>legal</b> system. <b>Legal</b> <b>risk</b> therefore includes compliance risk.

2500|$|The ADA {{has been}} criticized {{on the grounds that}} it {{decreases}} the employment rate for people with disabilities and raises the cost of doing business for employers, in large part due to the additional <b>legal</b> <b>risks,</b> which employers avoid by quietly avoiding hiring people with disabilities. Some researchers believe that the law has been ineffectual. [...] Between 1991 (after the enactment of the ADA) and 1995, the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 7.8% regardless of age, educational level, or type of disability, with the most affected being young, less-educated and mentally disabled men. Despite the many criticisms, a causal link between the ADA and declining disabled employment over much of the 1990s has not been definitively identified.|$|E

[...] As late as the 1990s, before medical abortion was legalized in Mexico City, one herbal remedy sought in the market was one to promote the termination of a pregnancy. Those who sold it did not give the treatment, rather they instructed the client what to use and how. The client was responsible for preparing the mixtures and taking them in order to take on the medical and <b>legal</b> <b>risks</b> onto themselves. Medical risks were serious as the treatment always led to excessive hemorrhaging which would require medical attention. During the H1N1 flu scare in 2009, business fell at the market about 50%. However, for herbal medicine sellers, demand for a 10-herb blend designed to prevent and treat the flu kept a number of vendors solvent. The remedy includes eucalyptus, bougainvillea and tejocote fruit, selling for 80 pesos per kilo. During the same time period, merchants selling Santa Muerte paraphernalia reported selling a significant number of white dresses for the images, as the color is associated with health and purity.|$|E

In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.

Instead, it is argued that <b>legal</b> <b>risk</b> and in particular, legal uncertainty creates considerable harm to market participants, and adversely affects market efficiency and market volatility.
