5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While {{the procedure is}} inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being <b>looked</b> <b>at.</b> <b>A</b> device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Madonna trained {{physically}} doing aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to {{cope with}} the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from her music videos. The stage had four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Patrick Leonard, who was the music director, encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of remixing and presenting her older songs for the show. The title Who's That Girl came to Madonna's mind when during rehearsals one-day when she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage.|$|E

5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which would have run from the Bristol Channel to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the Bristol Channel) to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E

25|$|It is more {{acceptable}} {{for women to}} touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched. Whitcher and Fisher conducted a study to see whether therapeutic touch to reduce anxiety differed between the sexes. A nurse was told to touch patients for one minute while the patients <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> pamphlet during a routine preoperative procedure. Females reacted positively to the touch, whereas males did not. It was surmised that males equated the touch to being treated as inferior or dependent.|$|E

25|$|Plans for a {{light rail}} to Fornebu were first {{launched}} in 1919, {{but at the time}} there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also played}} {{critical}} roles {{following the death}} of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. His body was taken to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, for an autopsy. Jacqueline and Robert F. Kennedy were escorted to a VIP suite on the 17th floor of the hospital. As the evening wore on, the family began making plans for the funeral. Jacqueline Kennedy vaguely remembered an engraving of the catafalque on which President Abraham Lincoln's coffin had rested while he lay in repose. Robert Kennedy telephoned the White House, and at about 10:00 P.M. relayed the message that Mrs. Kennedy wanted the same bier. Officials at the Library of Congress quickly looked up reports of Lincoln's funeral, and a Lincoln funeral scholar identified the most accurate ones. Walton <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> copy of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly, chose an engraving from Harper's, and began sketching the bier and funerary decorations. Military carpenters, unaware that the original Lincoln catafalque was stored in the Capitol building and that a replica was also available, began constructing one from Walton's sketches.|$|E

500|$|A Journal of Law and Politics {{article was}} {{critical}} of the decision, criticizing the Court's claimed distinction between the speech restriction in Rust and {{the one on the}} Legal Services Corporation and contending that there was no functional difference between the two. The article highlighted a problem with the Court's interpretation of the statute's purpose at hand, stating: [...] "Even assuming the propriety of invoking legislative purpose in statutory interpretation, the text of the [...] does not support the Court's understanding of the Act's purpose." [...] The article noted that, although the Court <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> section of the Act discussing attorneys [...] "protecting the best interest of their clients", the same section noted that the program must be free of [...] "political pressures". Because a factor in the Court's reasoning was its understanding of the Act's purpose, this alleged error purportedly misguided the rest of the Court's analysis.|$|E
500|$|Development for [...]hack {{began in}} early 2000 {{with the aim}} of {{shocking}} and surprising the player and creating a distinctive product. CyberConnect2's president Hiroshi Matsuyama {{played a key role in}} developing the concept for the series. A number of core ideas, including [...] "slaying dragons or being a thief in London" [...] were explored, but these were rejected in favor of an [...] "offline/online game". Matsuyama said that this would give young gamers an opportunity to experience online play without paying monthly fees or needing powerful Internet connections. The developers <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> number of MMORPGs such as Phantasy Star Online, Ultima Online, and Final Fantasy XI for inspiration, and drew influences from the prior works of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Neon Genesis Evangelion) and scenario writer Kazunori Itō (Ghost in the Shell). Itō noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of The World creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted as she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have}} been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|Though {{production}} {{was difficult for}} many of the actors involved, especially Campbell, the film was eventually completed within acceptable budget limits. Raimi had completed the filming of his [...] "prototype" [...] and sought out to develop and edit the film as cheaply as possible. Though {{at the time it was}} unknown how the film was going to be distributed. Raimi had shot the film in the same style as many of his earlier films, with 8mm film. [...] He intended to blow the footage up after filming to the industry standard of 35mm in order to save money, though Campbell noted that the idea was without precedent. Though the request was [...] "obscure" [...] in nature, a company in San Francisco managed to accommodate the task with little difficulty. Upon testing how the footage <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> local movie theater, it came out mostly acceptable, until further tests led to the footage appearing grainy and difficult to make out.|$|E

However, Ofcom concluded that Benefits Street had reflected the real lives of the children taking part, and Channel 4 had taken care to {{limit the amount of}} time they were seen on screen. Of the concerns about criminal activity, the watchdog said it was [...] "satisfied that certain essential details were not broadcast which may have enabled the successful commission of a crime, and that there was a sufficient editorial justification for including the material broadcast." [...] The regulator also concluded that the programme had been fair in its portrayal of its participants because it was an observational documentary, and that almost 900 complaints about the [...] "negative and offensive portrayal" [...] needed no further investigation.|$|E
