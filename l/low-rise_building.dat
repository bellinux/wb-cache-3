40|$|The {{development}} of design seismic forces is reviewed. The earthquake engineering {{was shown to}} have developed in the last 60 years. The characteristics of ground motion and structural response were gradually understood {{over the last five}} decades. The damage statistics from recent major earthquakes indicated that the severe damage was observed in taller buildings. The ratios of buildings with operational damage were as high as 90 percent because predominant <b>buildings</b> were <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> and such <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> suffered much less damage. Contrary to the statistics, the nonlinear response analysis results showed higher ductility demand (damage) to <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings.</b> Causes of earthquake damage are briefly discussed for reinforced concrete buildings. A large number of problems have been solved in research community. It is essential for the disaster reduction that the information in research domain should be transferred to the engineering community and implemented in engineering pra [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Pakistan and {{neighbourhood}} experience numerous earthquakes, most {{of which}} result in damaged or collapsed buildings and loss of life that also affect the economy adversely. On 29 October, 2008, an earthquake of magnitude 6. 5 occurred in Ziarat, Quetta Region, Pakistan which was followed by more than 400 aftershocks. Many villages were completely destroyed and more than 200 people died. The previous major earthquake was in 2005, known as the South Asian earthquake (Mw= 7. 6) occurred in Kashmir, where 80 000 people died. Inadequate building stock is to be blamed for the degree of disaster, as {{the majority of the}} buildings in the region are unreinforced masonry <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings.</b> In this study, seismic vulnerability of regionally common unreinforced masonry <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> was investigated using probabilistic based seismic safety assessment. The results of the study showed that unreinforced masonry <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> display higher displacements and shear force. Probability of damage due to higher displacements and shear forces can be directly related to damage or collapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} literature on wind-induced pressures on roofs of <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> is generally limited to regular-shaped, mostly rectangular roofs with relatively small dimensions, say less than 60 m. Large roofs for industrial and institutional buildings {{have not been}} considered {{in the formulation of}} wind code and standard provisions. Therefore, it is important to assess the efficiency of the current national building code/standard provisions as to their applicability for very large roofs. This paper presents experimental results of wind loads on flat roofs of <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> with large dimensions carried out in an atmospheric boundary-layer wind tunnel for different wind directions. Nine <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings</b> (5, 7. 5 and 10 m high) have been modeled and tested in open-country terrain exposure. The buildings have square plans with full-scale horizontal dimensions ranging from 60 to 180 m. Comparison of the results with respective provisions adopted by ASCE 7 - 10, NBCC 2015, EN 1991 - 1 - 4 : 2005 and AS/NZS 11702, 2011 indicates that some of the current provisions may lead to considerably conservative designs by increasing the size of the edge and corner zones. A variety of approaches were considered in order to redefine the size of the edge and corner zones with respect to the magnitude of the pressure coefficients provided for all roofs in the different codes/standards when dealing with large roofs of <b>low-rise</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
