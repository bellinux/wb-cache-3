60|$|On the day I {{speak of}} {{they had been}} driven {{out of one of}} the gates of the city and at the end of half an hour had left the {{carriage}} to await them by the roadside while they walked away over the short grass of the Campagna, which even in the winter months is sprinkled with delicate flowers. This was almost a daily habit with Isabel, who was fond of a walk and had a swift <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>step,</b> though not so swift a one as on her first coming to Europe. It was not the form of exercise that Pansy loved best, but she liked it, because she liked everything; and she moved with a shorter undulation beside her father's wife, who afterwards, on their return to Rome, paid a tribute to her preferences by making the circuit of the Pincian or the Villa Borghese. She had gathered a handful of flowers in a sunny hollow, far from the walls of Rome, and on reaching Palazzo Roccanera she went straight to her room, to put them into water. Isabel passed into the drawing-room, the one she herself usually occupied, the second in order from the large ante-chamber which was entered from the staircase and in which even Gilbert Osmond's rich devices had not been able to correct a look of rather grand nudity. Just beyond the threshold of the drawing-room she stopped short, the reason for her doing so being that she had received an impression. The impression had, in strictness, nothing unprecedented; but she felt it as something new, and the soundlessness of her step gave her time to take in the scene before she interrupted it. Madame Merle was there in her bonnet, and Gilbert Osmond was talking to her; for a minute they were unaware she had come in. Isabel had often seen that before, certainly; but what she had not seen, or at least had not noticed, was that their colloquy had for the moment converted itself into a sort of familiar silence, from which she instantly perceived that her entrance would startle them. Madame Merle was standing on the rug, a little way from the fire; Osmond was in a deep chair, leaning back and looking at her. Her head was erect, as usual, but her eyes were bent on his. What struck Isabel first was that he was sitting while Madame Merle stood; there was an anomaly in this that arrested her. Then she perceived that they had arrived at a desultory pause in their exchange of ideas and were musing, face to face, with the freedom of old friends who sometimes exchange ideas without uttering them. There was nothing to shock in this; they were old friends in fact. But the thing made an image, lasting only a moment, like a sudden flicker of light. Their relative positions, their absorbed mutual gaze, struck her as something detected. But it was all over by the time she had fairly seen it. Madame Merle had seen her and had welcomed her without moving; her husband, on the other hand, had instantly jumped up. He presently murmured something about wanting a walk and, after having asked their visitor to excuse him, left the room.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{changing}} gait {{analysis in}} the elderly cause complaints such as the slowing pace of walking, so that the elderly {{are not able to}} walk as before. One is a stride length. The stride length is the distance between two consecutive placement on the same leg. Stride length starting from the right foot then left foot and right foot back, or vice versa. Factors that may cause a decrease stride length in the elderly is declining strength in the gastrocnemius muscle so it can not produce optimal flexion flantar can also be caused because of poor body control or because a sense of security that can be acquired when running with short steps. The balance is defined as the body's ability to maintain the body's center of mass to the plane of the pivot. The balance is a complex interaction of sensory and musculoskeletal systems are regulated in the brain in response to changing internal and external conditions. Objective: To know is there a relationship between the stride length with the dynamic balance in elderly. Methods: This type of research is observational with cross sectional approach.

This thesis analyses how the rider's proficiency effects the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> a walking and trotting horse. This experiment involves five horses of different breeds from ZF JU Ceske Budejovice and four riders of different proficiency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced and a professional). These parameters were tested using video recordings: walking speed, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>step,</b> the elevation height of the front left leg and the back left leg, the angle of the nose to the ground and the angle of the cheeks when walking and trotting. Measurements proved that the rider's proficiency and ability has statistically very high effect on the {{mechanics of}} the horse's movement, especially in relation to the elevation height of the legs, the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steps</b> and speed. As the rider's proficiency level increases the walking speed and the elevation height of the legs also increase and the steps become longer. The nose angle got close to 90 Â° with an increased level of rider's proficiency and the level of the angle of the cheeks decreased. The biggest differences were found between a beginner and a professional on a trotting horse. The differences were smaller when the horse was walking rather than trotting, however they still showed the same trend. The results found show that the rider has a significant effect on the mechanics of movement. A horse with a rider of higher proficiency can achieve better results and is able to demonstrate its abilities better. This can be used in races, exhibitions or horse sales...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Cognitive radio (CR) is a {{promising}} paradigm to achieve efficient {{utilization of the}} limited spectrum resource by allowing the unlicensed users to access the licensed spectrum, and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) {{is one of the}} fundamental functions of CR networks. Market-driven spectrum auction has been recognized as an effective way to achieve DSA. In spectrum auction, the primary spectrum owners (POs) act as auctioneers who are willing to sell idle spectrum bands for additional revenue, and the secondary users (SUs) act as bidders who are willing to buy spectrum bands from POs for their services. However, conventional spectrum auction designs are restricted within the scenario of single auctioneer. In this paper, we study the spectrum auction with multiple auctioneers and multiple bidders, which is more realistic for practical CR networks. We propose MAP, a Multiauctioneer Progressive auction mechanism, in which each auctioneer systematically raises the trading price and each bidder subsequently chooses one auctioneer for bidding. The equilibrium is defined as the state that no auctioneer and bidder would like to change his decision. We show analytically that MAP converges to the equilibrium with maximum spectrum utilization of the whole system. We further analyze the incentive for POs and SUs joining the auction and accepting the auction result. Simulation results show that MAP well converges to the equilibrium, and the spectrum utilization is arbitrary closed to the global optimal solution according to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>step.</b> Index Termsâ€”Cognitive radio, dynamic spectrum access, auction theory, spectrum auction, dual theory.

Channel steps formed by woody debris and boulders are significant channel units in headwater streams. Numbers, intervals, and heights of steps {{did not differ}} among management and disturbance regimes. A negative exponential relationship between channel gradient and mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> intervals was observed in the fluvial reaches (< 0. 25 unit gradient) of recent landslide and old-growth channels. No such relationship was found in upper reaches (â‰¥ 0. 25 gradient) where colluvial processes dominated. Woody debris and sediment recruitment from regenerating riparian stands may have obscured any strong relationship between step geometry and channel gradient in young alder, young conifer, and recent clear-cut channels. Channel reaches are described as pool-riffles, step-pools, step-steps, cascades, rapids, and bedrock. Geometry of channel steps principally characterized channel reach types. We infer that fluvial processes dominated in pool-riffle and step-pool reaches, while colluvial processes dominated in bedrock reaches. Step-step, rapids, and cascade reaches occurred in channels dominated by both fluvial processes and colluvial processes. Step-step reaches were transitional from cascades (upstream) to step-pool reaches (downstream). Woody debris recruited from riparian corridors and logging activities formed steps and then sequentially might modify channel reach types from step-pools to step-steps. Scour, runout, and deposition of sediment and woody debris from landslides and debris flows modified the distribution of reach types (bedrock, cascade, and step-pool) {{and the structure of}} steps within reaches.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{displacement}} electrophoresis is described and its analogy with displacement chromatog. shown. The app. consists basically of a capillary tube, a few tenths of a mm bore and thin walled, uniting 2 vessels, each contg. an electrode. For the anal. of anions the cathode vessel contains an anion less mobile than {{any in the}} sample mixt. to be analyzed. The capillary tube is filled with a soln. of a salt of an anion more mobile than any in the sample and a buffering cation. The anode vessel contains the buffering cation. The electrodes must not produce interfering ions or gas. To reduce disturbance by electroendosmosis a long chain soluble polymer is used to increase the viscosity of the soln. in the capillary tube, and the electrode vessel is closed at the end to which electroendosmosis would cause flow if it were open. The sample is introduced between the cathode and the capillary, and a const. current is passed between the electrodes. The anions in the sample move initially at different speeds until they are sepd. in order of their mobility. Then all the anions in the app. move down the capillary at the same speed, assuming the tube to be of const. bore. The boundary between each successive pair of ions {{is more or less}} sharp, depending upon the diffusion consts., the potential gradient, the difference in mobility, and the disturbance caused by electroendosmosis, temp. difference across the capillary, and flow of liq. Each zone has a characteristic pH. Once the train of anions has sepd. it proceeds down the capillary unchanged. Since each zone has a particular potential gradient, it has also a particular rate of heat generation per unit length and a particular temp. It is thus possible to follow the sepn. by means of fixed thermocouples {{on the outside of the}} tube, which will record the fronts as they pass under the thermocouple. A thermocouple measuring the temp. of the capillary relative to its surrounding plots a series of steps on a recorder, the height of a step from the baseline being a measure of the mobility. The length of the step is preferably measured from the distance between the peaks of the record provided by a differential thermocouple measuring the difference in temp. along a short length of the tube, which gives a record which is the differential of the step curve. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> is proportional to the length of tube occupied by that species of ion and hence to the quantity. A qual. and quant. anal. is possible.

The book proposed spending significant time studying and organizing household work, including having the housewife pin a pedometer to her bodice that would record the number and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> she takes. This created a comic effect that reviewers exploited, and the ideas that women should claim authority over the home and that improvement of domestic chores was important were considered even more comic. The humorous or sarcastic treatment of the book undermined the serious reputation that the CNOF was attempting to foster, and the domestic economy section of the CNOF remained dormant during the interwar years.|$|R

Cladograms {{showing the}} {{alternative}} phylogenetic positions of Staurikosaurus pricei and Herrerasauridae: (a) based upon reanalysis of the dataset of Rauhut (2003), showing S. pricei as a theropod; (b) based upon reanalysis of the dataset of Langer & Benton (2006), showing S. pricei as a basal saurischian. The black circle on cladogram (a) represents the Theropoda node, and on (b), the Saurischia node. Numbers at the branches represent Bremer support (before slash) and bootstrap support above 50 % (percentages after slash). Both values were calculated with TNT software following Goloboff et al. (2008). The tree generated for the Rauhut (2003) dataset represents the strict consensus of 1488 MPTs, with tree <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 643 <b>steps</b> (CI = 0. 426; RI = 0. 740). Coelophysoids and tetanurans are {{represented as a}} single clade. Only a single MPT was recovered during reanalysis of the Langer & Benton (2006) dataset, with a tree <b>length</b> <b>of</b> 183 <b>steps</b> (CI = 0. 574; RI = 0. 549). In both cladograms the outgroups were omitted...|$|R
