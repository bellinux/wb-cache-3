5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen <b>large</b> <b>egg</b> capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a <b>large</b> <b>egg,</b> such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E

25|$|When an Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) {{encounters}} a <b>large</b> <b>egg,</b> {{it takes a}} stone into its beak and forcefully throws it at the egg until the shell is broken, usually taking a few minutes. This behaviour, first reported in 1966, seems to be largely innate and is displayed by naïve individuals. Its origin {{could be related to}} the throwing of eggs; rounded (egg-like) stones are preferred to jagged ones.|$|E
25|$|Mating and {{spawning}} {{are distinct}} events in blue crab reproduction. Males may mate {{several times and}} undergo no major changes in morphology during the process. Female blue crabs mate only once in their lifetimes during their pubertal, or terminal, molt. During this transition, the abdomen changes from a triangular to a semicircular shape. Mating in blue crab is a complex process that requires precise timing of mating {{at the time of}} the female's terminal molt. It generally occurs during the warmest months of the year. Prepubertal females migrate to the upper reaches of estuaries where males typically reside as adults. To ensure that a male can mate, he will actively seek a receptive female and guard her for up to 7 days until she molts, at which time insemination occurs. Crabs compete with other individuals before, during, and after insemination, so mate guarding is very important for reproductive success. After mating, a male must continue to guard the female until her shell has hardened. Inseminated females retain spermatophores for up to one year, which they use for multiple spawnings in high salinity water. During spawning, a female extrudes fertilized eggs onto her swimmerets and carries them in a <b>large</b> <b>egg</b> mass, or sponge, while they develop. Females migrate to the mouth of the estuary to release the larvae, the timing of which is believed to be influenced by light, tide, and lunar cycles. Blue crabs have high fecundity: females may produce up to 2 million eggs per brood.|$|E
500|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The zebra shark is oviparous, with females laying <b>large</b> <b>egg</b> capsules measuring [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female's vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Between {{the end of}} the Brood War and Kerrigan's defeat on Char, Kerrigan created {{numerous}} broodmothers, powerful s, each {{of which}} would lead a brood. The queens were ordered to evolve and only submit to the will of the strongest leader, which became a problem upon Kerrigan's defeat. The brood mothers scattered their broods. Kerrigan was forced to follow and attempt to subdue them. Following the eradication of the last cerebrates in Brood War, Kerrigan creates powerful and intelligent broodmothers to fulfill their role in the Swarm. Kerrigan commanded the broodmothers [...] "to fight, to conquer, to be strong and to lead by force of will". Through decentralizing command hierarchy, Kerrigan ensured the Zerg Swarm could function without leadership. The strongest of these zerg broods, The Zagara Brood, was led by Zagara. Following Kerrigan's defeat and de-infestation on Char, the Zagara brood remained there, seeking <b>large</b> <b>egg</b> piles in an acid marsh. Despite General Horace Warfield's extermination campaign against the zerg remaining on the planet, the brood thrived while all others perished. Its prosperity was interrupted however, when Kerrigan returned to Char and subjugated Zagara, thereby putting the brood under Kerrigan's control.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the Japanese {{bullhead}} shark is oviparous.

25|$|Males also {{assess their}} partner's {{reproductive}} value and adjust their own {{investment in the}} brood according to their partner's condition. Females that lay <b>larger</b> and brighter <b>eggs</b> are in better condition and have greater reproductive value. Therefore, males tend to display higher attentiveness and parental care to <b>larger</b> <b>eggs,</b> since those eggs were produced by a female with apparent good genetic quality. Smaller, duller eggs garnered less paternal care. Female foot color is also observed {{as an indication of}} perceived female condition. In one experiment, the color of eggs was muted by researchers, it was found that males were willing to exercise similar care for both <b>large</b> <b>eggs</b> and small eggs if his mate had brightly colored feet, whereas males paired with dull-footed females only incubated <b>larger</b> <b>eggs.</b> Interestingly, researchers also found that males did not increase their care when females exhibited both bright feet and high-quality offspring.|$|R

6000|$|It {{is in this}} loose, hot, black {{sand that}} those {{singular}} birds, the [...] "Maleos" [...] deposit their eggs. In the months of August and September, when {{there is little or}} no rain, they come down in pairs from the interior to this or to one or two other favourite spots, and scratch holes three or four feet deep, just above high-water mark, where the female deposits a single <b>large</b> <b>egg,</b> which she covers over with about a foot of sand--and then returns to the forest. At the end of ten or twelve days she comes again to the same spot to lay another egg, and each female bird is supposed to lay six or eight eggs during the season. The male assists the female in making the hole, coming down and returning with her. The appearance of the bird when walking on the beach is very handsome. The glossy black and rosy white of the plumage, the helmeted head and elevated tail, like that of the common fowl, give a striking character, which their stately and somewhat sedate walk renders still more remarkable. There is hardly any difference between the sexes, except that the casque or bonnet at the back of the head and the tubercles at the nostrils are a little larger, and the beautiful rosy salmon colour a little deeper in the male bird; but the difference is so slight that it is not always possible to tell a male from a female without dissection. They run quickly, but when shot at or suddenly disturbed, take wing with a heavy noisy flight to some neighbouring tree, where they settle on a low branch; and, they probably roost at night in a similar situation. Many birds lay in the same hole, for a dozen eggs are often found together; and these are so large that it is not possible for the body of the bird to contain more than one fully-developed egg at the same time. In all the female birds which I shot, none of the eggs besides the one large one exceeded the size of peas, and there were only eight or nine of these, which is probably the extreme number a bird can lay in one season.|$|E
