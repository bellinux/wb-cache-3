After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with <b>laryngectomy</b> and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|In August 1989, doctors found a {{tumor in}} Davis' throat. Davis died in Beverly Hills, California, on May 16, 1990, aged 64, of {{complications}} from throat cancer. Earlier, when {{he was told that}} surgery (<b>laryngectomy)</b> offered him the best chance of survival, Davis replied he would rather keep his voice than have a part of his throat removed; he subsequently was treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. However, a few weeks prior to his death, his entire larynx was removed during surgery. Davis had often smoked four packs of cigarettes a day as an adult. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park. On May 18, 1990, two days after Davis's death, the neon lights of the Las Vegas Strip were darkened for 10 minutes as a tribute to him.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} long-term results of endoscopic surgery for supraglottic carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From 1992 to 2004, 45 patients diagnosed with supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma (two Tis, nine T 1 N 0, 27 T 2 N 0, two T 2 N 1, one T 2 N 2, four T 3 N 0) underwent different types of endoscopic supraglottic <b>laryngectomies</b> according to the European Laryngological Society (ELS) classification: three limited excision (type I); 27 medial without resection of the preepiglottic space (type IIb); one medial with resection of the preepiglottic space (type IIIa); three medial with resection of the preepiglottic space (type IIIb); nine lateral (type IVa); two lateral (type IVb). RESULTS: Overall survival was 93 +/- 4 percent (SE) after three years and 89 +/- 6 percent (SE) after five years. The median follow-up is 3. 7 years. Patients with clinically N 0 necks were found to have positive nodes in eight (19 %) cases. Two cases of postoperative hemorrhage were controlled by electrocautery. All of the patients without previous treatment for larynx cancer regained swallowing function within five days to three weeks after surgery. Mean duration of hospitalization was 12. 5 days. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic partial <b>laryngectomies,</b> as defined by the ELS classification, for selected supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma proved to be an excellent alternative to radiotherapy and open neck surgery...|$|R
500|$|On 17 May, Gerhardt {{and other}} doctors, {{including}} Ernst von Bergmann, diagnosed the growth as laryngeal cancer. Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, Morell Mackenzie; he also recommended a thyrotomy to gain {{better access to}} the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx - a total <b>laryngectomy</b> - if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told. Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign epithelioma. A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment. Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a biopsy of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist Rudolf Virchow for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a <b>laryngectomy</b> being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover [...] "in a few months." [...] While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it. On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.|$|E
500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total <b>laryngectomy</b> was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the <b>laryngectomy</b> as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

This article reviews reported functional outcomes after partial <b>laryngectomies,</b> particularly when related to swallowing. In the majority of patients, reports indicate acceptable feeding without the presence of a permanent tracheostomy. However, a wide variety of methods and variables are used to describe these functional outcomes, making the comparison of functional outcome after different treatment modalities and resections difficult.
