5000|$|Once the {{temperature}} and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through tilting the furnace. For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace</b> to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer. Often, a few tonnes of liquid steel and slag is left in the furnace in order to form a [...] "hot heel", which helps preheat the next charge of scrap and accelerate its meltdown. During and after tapping, the furnace is [...] "turned around": the slag door is cleaned of solidified slag, the visible refractories are inspected and water-cooled components checked for leaks, and electrodes are inspected for damage or lengthened through the addition of new segments; the taphole is filled with sand at the completion of tapping. For a 90-tonne, medium-power furnace, the whole process will usually take about 60-70 minutes from the tapping of one heat to the tapping of the next (the tap-to-tap time).|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the Libyan {{government}} proposed several state-company {{projects for}} which joint ventures would be considered. This included a $20 million modification of Lisco’s {{electric arc furnace}} as well as construction and installation of a $17 million <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace.</b> The Government also promoted development of numerous mineral deposits, including clay, gypsum, iron, lead, salt, sodium carbonate, and stone. Additionally, projects were initiated for quarrying limestone and dolomite and manufacturing lime and calcined dolomite for Lisco’s As Seddadah facility, 125 km southwest of Misrata. In 2004, Lisco signed a loan contract to develop LISCO I aimed at boosting capacity from 674 kn of liquid steel per year to 1.100 kn. This project is the first stage to raise capacity of LISCO I and II. In 2006, Lisco initiated an ambitious project aiming to double design capacity to 2.5 million tons by further developing facilities on the 4.5 sq mi plant near Misrata.

40|$|Whereas in the past, ladles {{were simply}} {{a means of}} {{transferring}} molten products from furnace tapholes to points of discharge be they casting pans or waste dumps, the ladle is now becoming a more integral and versatile piece of equipment in the pyrometallurgical plant.

50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including <b>ladle</b> <b>furnaces</b> (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|R

However, due to energy costs rise, national steel industries are investing in electrical power generation in partnership with energy supply companies aiming at overall cost reduction. Therefore, actions that search for energy consumption reduction and productivity increase became priority for their research and development projects. The <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace</b> of V&M {{is one of the}} largest energy consuming units in the steel plant, consuming up to 2, 400 MWh on average a month.

40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc <b>furnace</b> and <b>ladle</b> melt <b>furnace</b> (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions. This paper will present a detailed case study of vacuum breaker switching of a new LMF transformer involving current chopping and restrike simulations using the electromagnetic transients program.

40|$|The {{conventional}} foundry {{not only}} frequently uses batch melting, where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, sometimes {{as long as a}} complete shift, but also uses the gravity sand casting process where the molten aluminium alloys are transferred using a <b>ladle</b> from <b>furnace</b> to pour station and are poured into a mould. During the filling of the mould, the turbulent nature of the liquid metal gives rise to massive entrainment of the surface oxide films which are the subsequently trapped into the liquid and act as micro cracks. Also the long exposure time of the liquid surface to the surrounding environment during melting, transferring and filling will increase the level of hydrogen absorption from the atmosphere. The abovementioned factors are often the main reasons for casting defect generation. In this paper the novel CRIMSON aluminium casting method is introduced which has a number of advantages. Instead of gravity filling method, it uses the single shot upcasting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid counter-gravity-filling mould operations which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation. Another advantage is the drastic reduction of energy consumption due to shortened melting and filling time. A simulation software, FLOW- 3 D, is used to compare this new method with the conventional gravity casting process. A tensile bar case is used as a sample to simulate the filling process...|$|R

50|$|According to his {{autobiography}} Bessemer {{was working with}} an ordinary reverberatory furnace but during a test, some pieces of pig iron were jostled {{off the side of}} the ladle, and were left above the <b>ladle</b> in the <b>furnace's</b> heat. When Bessemer went to push them into the ladle, he found that they were steel shells: the hot air alone had converted the outsides of the iron pieces to steel. This crucial discovery led him to completely redesign his furnace so that it would force high-pressure air through the molten iron using special air pumps. Intuitively this would seem to be folly because it would cool the iron. Instead, the oxygen in the forced air ignited silicon and carbon impurities in the iron, starting a positive feedback loop. As the iron became hotter, more impurities burned off, making the iron even hotter and burning off more impurities, producing a batch of hotter, purer, molten iron, which converts to steel more easily.|$|R
