25|$|Transferrin can {{instead be}} removed by size {{exclusion}} chromatography. This method {{is one of}} the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, <b>low</b> <b>capacity</b> and low elution times.|$|E

During the Games, though, the airport operated only restricted hours and experienced street block closures (for security), and the <b>low</b> <b>capacity</b> ramp and short runway excluded most long-range arrivals.

25|$|Bus {{services}} use buses {{on conventional}} roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with <b>low</b> <b>capacity</b> (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses {{are commonly used}} in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for shuttle services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. Bus rapid transit is an ambiguous term used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much like a light rail. Trolleybuses are electric buses that receive power from overhead wires for mobility. Online Electric Vehicles are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are recharged frequently at certain points via underground wires.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the basic {{diversity}} combining techniques and investigate analytically-derivedclosed-form expressions for the capacities per unit bandwidth for Rayleigh fading channels with equalgain combining (EGC) diversity. We consider different channel performance adaptation policies such as:power and rate adaptation with constant transmit power, channel inversion with fixed rate, and truncatedchannel inversion. A simulation of these schemes {{was carried out}} under ideal communication conditionsand their performance compared. Results obtained show that channel inversion policies gave the highestcapacity over other adaptation policies (with EGC diversity) while the constant transmit power policyyielded the <b>lowest</b> <b>capacity.</b> Furthermore, the truncated channel inversion policy outperformed otherpolicies, while the constant power policy had the <b>lowest</b> <b>capacity,</b> compared to other policies...|$|R

25|$|Manitoba Hydro has {{transmission}} lines connecting with Saskatchewan, Ontario, North Dakota and Minnesota. Ties to the Canadian provinces are of <b>low</b> <b>capacity</b> but {{a substantial portion}} of Manitoba Hydro's annual generation can be exported over the tie to Minnesota. In 2003, a new line was completed to the United States (the Harvey-Glenboro 230kV line), allowing a firm export capacity of 700 megawatts. In 2005 Manitoba Hydro announced increased interchange up to 500 MW with Ontario, after construction of additional transmission facilities. Manitoba Hydro's largest interconnection is the Dorsey-Forbes-Chisago 500,000 volt (AC) line that begins at the Dorsey substation located in Rosser near Winnipeg and travels south into the United States and takes a southeasterly direction to the Forbes Substation northwest of Duluth, Minnesota and from there goes south to the Chisago substation located just north of St. Paul, Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|Electric Ferries' {{franchise}} expired on March 31, 1954, and {{the city}} contracted the 69th Street ferry's operation to Henry Shanks {{in order to keep}} the ferry running. The 69th Street ferry ceased operation in 1964 due to the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge a short distance south. At the time of discontinuation, 7,000 daily passengers paid five cents each to cross, while 8,000 vehicles per day paid a toll of 75 cents to use the ferry. Each boat could fit from 500 to 750 passengers as well as 42 vehicles, which caused traffic jams at both of the ferry's slips due to the boats' <b>low</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the route between St. George and Whitehall Streets was kept since the bridge's opening was expected to spur an influx of residents to Staten Island, potentially increasing ridership on the ferry to Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|The {{game against}} the Notre Dame All-Stars had been {{originally}} devised by Frankford. It was planned as non-league exhibition game between former Notre Dame stars and the top NFL team in the east; after defeating the Maroons 20–0, Frankford had believed they would indeed be the NFL's top eastern team. However, when they were later defeated by the Maroons in a second contest, they lost the right to play the game. Instead, Pottsville would host the All-Stars at Minersville Park, while Frankford scheduled another league {{game against the}} Cleveland Bulldogs. Pottsville was excited to host Notre Dame, hoping {{it would be a}} huge financial windfall for the team. However, they felt that Minersville Park, a high school field with a <b>low</b> <b>capacity,</b> was too small for such a big event. Instead, they scheduled the game in Philadelphia, in the Yellow Jackets' territory. Frankford protested to commissioner Carr, who warned the Maroons in writing that they faced suspension if they played in Philadelphia. However, the Maroons claimed that the league office verbally approved the game during a telephone call.|$|E

500|$|Economic {{indicators}} {{have improved}} after {{the financial crisis}} of 2007–2008. After several consecutive years of high growth, GDP contracted 5.5 per cent in 2009 and unemployment remained above 12 per cent. Industrial output declined 10 per cent, mining by 31 per cent, and ferrous and metal production marked a 60 per cent drop. Positive growth was restored in 2010, although investments and consumption continue to decline steadily due to rising unemployment. The same year, intercompany debt exceeded €51 billion, meaning that 60 per cent of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted. By 2012, it had increased to €83 billion, or 227 per cent of GDP. The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results, but the social consequences of these measures have been [...] "catastrophic" [...] according to the International Trade Union Confederation. Corruption remains another obstacle to economic growth. Bulgaria {{is one of the}} most corrupt European Union members and ranks 75th in the Corruption Perceptions Index. Weak law enforcement and overall <b>low</b> <b>capacity</b> of civil service remain as challenges in curbing corruption. However, fighting against corruption has become the focus of the government because of the EU accession, and several anti-corruption programs have been undertaken by different government agencies.|$|E
