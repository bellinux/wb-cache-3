25|$|Netascii is a {{modified}} form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764. It {{consists of an}} 8-bit extension of the 7-bit ASCII character space from 0x20 to 0x7F (the printable characters and the space) and eight of the control characters. The allowed control characters include the null (0x00), the line feed (LF, 0x0A), and the carriage return (CR, 0x0D). Netascii also requires {{that the end of}} <b>line</b> <b>marker</b> on a host be translated to the character pair CR LF for transmission, and that any CR must be followed by either a LF or the null.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid marker, {{also known}} as a {{referencing}} exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed <b>line</b> <b>marker</b> used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as a cookie by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large blank space on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from. They are personal markers, and should not be used by others to judge the suitability of a route as the practicability of an exit may depend {{on the size of the}} diver and the equipment carried.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approach}} via {{the unofficial}} Brace Mountain Trail is the gentlest and shortest, but less used {{due to the}} limited parking and minimal maintenance of the trail, entirely on private land in Connecticut. The unblazed, gated road starts from a small parking area on Mount Washington Road two miles (3.2km) north of the dam at South Pond in Lakeville, just south of where the road, the highest in Connecticut, crosses the shoulder of Gridley Mountain. From this [...] elevation it descends slightly to cross an unnamed tributary of Monument Brook, after which an overgrown ascends gently to the state <b>line</b> <b>marker,</b> [...] from the parking area. From there it is a more sustained climb [...] to the South Taconic and an equivalent distance to the summit.

25|$|<b>Line</b> <b>markers</b> are {{generally}} used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided {{are used to}} wrap the line to secure the marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area {{at the base of}} the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The basic function of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary <b>line</b> <b>markers</b> are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.|$|R

The trail follows the south-east {{shore of the}} pond before leaving {{the shore of the}} pond to head east to the Rhode Island border.
