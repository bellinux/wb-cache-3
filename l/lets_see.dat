500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12" [...] vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, <b>lets</b> <b>see</b> what happens.'" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Lets</b> <b>see</b> {{some of the}} {{examples}} of semantic borrowing:Thus from the above examples from i to vi, {{it is observed that}} Alavi Bohras speak the semantic borrowed words from the Arabic, Persian and Urdu Language. Hence they use a particular form of Gujarati language permeated with Arabic, some Persian words, and some Urdu words and write in the Arabic script called as Lisaan ud-Da'wat il-'Alaviyah. So this unique language sets a recognition for Alavi Bohras and make them linguistically different from other Bohra sects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lets</b> <b>see</b> {{some more}} examples:In example xv, the mid vowel /a/ in ‘cap’ meaning “cup” changes to close-mid vowel /u/ in ‘cup’ meaning “cup” when {{followed}} by a stop. Similar example xvi. In example xvi, the open vowel /A/ in ‘barAbar’ meaning “proper” changes to close-mid vowel /o/ in ‘barobar’ when {{followed by a}} stop. The same {{is the case with}} example xvii & xviii where close-mid vowel of end vowel of /o/ changes to /u/. Means if the open and mid-vowels are followed by a stop/plosive sound, it changes to close-mid vowels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lets</b> <b>see</b> an example:In {{the above}} example, in {{standard}} Gujarati ‘rasoi’ meaning “to cook” and ‘pakavvu’ means “to ripen” and in LDA Language they use ‘pakavvu’ {{in both the}} cases “to cook” and “to ripen”. ‘pakna’ which means “to cook” as well as “to ripe” in Urdu language. Here the meaning of “to ripe” is extended metaphorically. Thus it is used metaphorically. Metaphor in semantic change involves extensions in {{the meaning of a}} word that suggest a semantic similarity or connection between the new sense and the original one. Thus due to the contact of Urdu language and metaphorical extension they have dropped the word ‘rasoi’ meaning “to cook” and have adopted the word ‘pakAvvu’ meaning “to cook/to ripe” to explain both the senses cook and ripe.|$|E
