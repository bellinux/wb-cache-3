5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. <b>Leg</b> <b>muscles</b> are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of <b>leg</b> <b>muscles</b> being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals.

The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main <b>leg</b> <b>muscles</b> accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E

The population of research was the male students of Sport Training Education of Sport and Health Department, Teacher Training and Education Faculty, Surakarta Sebelas Maret, as many as 71 students. The sample of research is 40 students taken using purposive Random Sampling. The variable of research consists of two independent variables: weight and plyometrics training; and one dependent variable: <b>leg</b> <b>muscle</b> power.

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and <b>leg</b> <b>muscles.</b> Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E

Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and <b>leg</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the <b>leg</b> <b>muscles</b> to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Mental stress, which {{increases}} {{blood pressure and}} heart rate, increases forearm blood flow but does not change calf blood flow. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if mental stress 1) increases muscle sympathetic nerve activity in the leg and 2) causes a dissociation of muscle sympathet-ic nerve activity in the arm and the leg. We recorded heart rate, blood pressure, and efferent sympathetic nerve activity during mental stress (4 minutes of mental arithmetic) in 13 healthy men. Microelectrodes were inserted percutaneously into a fascicle of the peroneal nerve (leg) and radial nerve (arm) to measure sympathetic discharge to muscle. In Study 1, <b>leg</b> <b>muscle</b> sympathetic nerve activity was recorded in seven subjects. Mental stress significantly increased heart rate and blood pressure. Despite the increased blood pressure (which would be expected reflexly to inhibit sympathet-ic nerve activity), <b>leg</b> <b>muscle</b> sympathetic nerve activity (in total integrated activity, bursts per 100 heart beats or bursts per minute) increased significantly during stress. Further, whereas heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal during recovery, <b>leg</b> <b>muscle</b> sympathetic nerve activity remained elevated during recovery.
