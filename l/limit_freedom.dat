5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

This was in response to two cases: Attorney General (Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd.) v Open Door Counselling Ltd. and Dublin Wellwoman Centre Ltd. (1988), which granted an injunction restraining two counseling agencies from assisting women to travel abroad to obtain abortions or informing them of the methods of communications with such clinics, and Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd. v Grogan (1989), which placed an injunction restraining three students' unions from distributing information in relation to abortion available outside the state.|$|E
25|$|While {{teachers}} {{point out}} the vital importance of good posture both {{for the sake of}} the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of repetitive strain injury, advice as to what good posture is and how to achieve it differs in details. However all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity. Things which are almost universally recommended is keeping the left wrist straight (or very nearly so) to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner. This, like any other unwarranted tension, would <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of motion, and increase the risk of injury.|$|E

25|$|On 29 November, {{voting on}} the new {{constitution}} by the Constituent Assembly of Egypt began, and continued through Thursday night. There were protests against Morsi outside the presidential palace and a small protest supporting Morsi in Giza {{on the outskirts of}} Cairo. The new constitution adopted {{the first part of the}} draft that included the Sharia as the main source of legislation and making Islam a state religion. Egyptian State TV reported that Christianity and Judaism would be the main source for legislation for Christians and Jews. The liberals, left-wing, and Christians boycotted the assembly and accused the Islamists of trying to impose their vision; they also accused them of trying to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech as well as not including articles establishing equality between men and women.|$|E
500|$|The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticised FITs {{for their}} {{surveillance}} and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists. Marc Vallee, who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest, {{has said that}} the teams <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press and called on the Home Office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists. Bob Broadhurst, {{who is in charge of}} public order policing at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement to the NUJ in 2008 that journalists, [...] "on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work". The NUJ are to make a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner due to the Metropolitan Police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of press pass) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued.|$|E
2500|$|Pravit Rojanaphruk, , , is a Thai {{journalist}} {{who works as}} a senior staff writer for Khaosod English ('fresh news'). He formerly wrote a regular column for The Nation, an English-language newspaper in Thailand, but was pressured to resign due to his political opinions following the 2014 coup d'etat. Before the military coup, he was a prominent champion of democracy and free expression and was consequently investigated several times. Immediately after the coup, he was arrested on a charge of lèse majesté and detained for a week. Since the coup, he has been highly critical of the ruling junta and its efforts to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom.</b> Pravit has been detained for [...] "attitude adjustment" [...] twice by the ruling junta and as of 2017, has sedition charges against him for Facebook posts he made earlier that year.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1979, Nathan {{returned}} to the Foreign Ministry and became its First Permanent Secretary until February 1982, when he left to become the Executive Chairman of the newspaper company the Straits Times Press. The appointment was viewed dimly by journalists who felt that the Government was trying to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press; they wore black armbands in protest. According to Nathan in a 2010 interview, [...] " [...] When they saw I was not doing what they expected me to do, they began to have confidence." [...] At various times between 1982 and 1988, Nathan also held directorships of several other companies, including the Singapore Mint, The Straits Times Press (London), Singapore Press Holdings and Marshall Cavendish. He held a directorship in the Singapore International Media between September 1996 and August 1999. He was Chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Singapore, a ship-repairing and engineering joint venture with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, from 1973 to 1986. From 1983 to April 1988, Nathan was Chairman of the Hindu Endowments Board. He was {{a founding member of}} the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and its term trustee until August 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of {{same-sex}} marriage {{say they have}} faced attempts to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech. Joe de Bruyn has argued against Labor using a binding vote on the issue. David van Gend's business was graffitied, which included the word [...] "bigot". A university student union called for the cancellation of a lecture, the subject of which was [...] "assumed" [...] to include opposition to same-sex marriage. At another university when it hosted [...] "an evening with 'Traditional Marriage Champion' Dr. Ryan Anderson PhD" [...] the student union leader said, [...] "because we're a publicly funded university, {{we have a responsibility}} to be politically correct and this is not politically correct". The online 'star ratings' and reviews of an international hotel were targeted, however that campaign rebounded. Wendy Francis has said she received [...] "abusive phone calls and emails" [...] in 2012. Lyle Shelton says that he dislikes Bernard Keane calling him a [...] "nauseating piece of filth" [...] on Twitter, and that criticism of a Q guest amounts to [...] "vicious attacks". Other issues have included threatening legal action, refusing advertisements. Roman Catholic bishop Anthony Fisher and columnist Paul Kelly have claimed that if same-sex marriage becomes law, there would be concern for future freedom of speech.|$|E
2500|$|Christian organisations {{have said}} that {{non-discrimination}} laws {{should not be allowed}} to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of religion, and have argued for new laws to enshrine a right to discriminate against same-sex couples. ACT Attorney-General, Simon Corbell has said, in the ACT, it will be, [...] "unlawful for those who provide goods, services and facilities in the wedding industry to discriminate against another person on the basis of their sexuality or their relationship status. This includes discrimination by refusing to provide or make available those goods, services or facilities." [...] Tim Wilson has argued that religious anti-discrimination exemptions should be included in same-sex marriage laws. Others though, such as Australian lawyer and associate director and research fellow in the Public Interest Law Centre at New York University School of Law, David Glasgow, have argued that the core of this religious freedom campaign is simply desiring [...] "the liberty to refuse service" [...] to particular customers. Glasgow contends that Australian anti-discrimination law includes sexual orientation and gender identity as protected attributes akin to race or religion [...] "because we recognise that those attributes should not impede a person's participation in civic life" [...] and that [...] "the law insists, rightly, that to reap the benefits of opening a business to the public, the business must be open on equal terms." [...] Some are concerned that allowing religious business owners and service providers to right to refuse to provide services related to same-sex weddings/ceremonies (i.e.: wedding cakes and/or flowers) might lead to further exemptions not related to same-sex marriages but rather anything to do with homosexuality. Others have lamented the fact that, increasingly, much of the religious-based opposition to same-sex marriage has lost touch with the secular reality governing Australian laws and legal principles.|$|E
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{influence}} of socio-cultural behaviours and women’s health facilities utilisations in northern Nigeria. A Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis was employed using a questionnaire administered to 315 {{women between the ages}} of 15 and 45 years. The findings indicate husband’s permission had strong significant relationships to antenatal care services (ANC). In addition, there were strong significant relationships between women <b>limited</b> <b>freedom</b> and female genital mutilation in terms of skilled delivery (DC) as well as husband’s permission and <b>limited</b> <b>freedom</b> of women among others. Also, a strong significant relationship exists between the postnatal care services (PNC) and <b>limited</b> women <b>freedom</b> as well as with home delivery and hot-bathing practices among others. To improve women health care utilisation and maternal health in northern Nigeria, this study provides useful planning information drawn from the women sociocultural behaviours leading to the consequent low modern health facilities utilisations...|$|R

60|$|Above this {{fundamental}} mass {{is the growing}} moiety which has a conscious thought-process, of a sort. Its fundamental ideas, its preconceptions, are begotten of a mixture of social traditions learnt {{at home and in}} school and from the suggestions of contemporary customs and affairs. But it reads and listens more or less. And scattered through this, here and there, are people really learning, really increasing and accumulating knowledge, really thinking and conversing--the active mind-cells, as it were, of the world. Their ideas are conveyed into the mass much as impulses are conveyed into an imperfectly innervated tissue, they are conveyed by books and pamphlets, by lecturing, by magazine articles and newspaper articles, by the agency of the pulpit, by organized propaganda, by political display and campaigns. The gross effect is considerable, but it is just as well that the Socialist should look a little closely at the economic processes that underlie these intellectual activities at the present time. Except for the universities and much of the public educational organization, except for a few pulpits endowed for good under conditions that <b>limit</b> <b>freedom</b> of thought and expression, except for certain needy and impecunious propagandas, the whole of this apparatus of public thought and discussion to-day has been created and is sustained by commercial necessity.|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner {{he had a}} return of the dizziness, {{though he did not}} faint. He would not ring the bell, because he knew it would mean a fuss, and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous. When one grew old, the whole world was in {{conspiracy}} to <b>limit</b> <b>freedom,</b> and for what reason?--just to keep the breath in him a little longer. He did not want it at such cost. Only the dog Balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness; anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy, instead of giving him a biscuit. When at last old Jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed. And, though still shaky next morning, the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him. It was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner--he suspected her of undereating when she was alone; and, at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten, the unconscious smiling of her lips. She hadn't much pleasure, and this was the last time {{he would be able to}} give her that treat. But when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him, and the exertion, too, of telling her about June's return.|$|E
