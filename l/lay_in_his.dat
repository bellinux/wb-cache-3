5|$|A {{document}} of Inchaffray Abbey, {{preserved in the}} original (as opposed to a later copy), recorded that Bishop Walter {{had been involved in}} settling a dispute involving Inchaffray, an abbey which <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diocese. Inchaffray's dispute was with Naomhán Mac Eóghainn (Nevin MacEwen) and his wife Mairead (Mariota). Under Abbot Symon de Scone, previous Abbot of Inchaffray, the abbey had given some lands in exchange for 40marks to Mairead's father Maol Mhuire (Malmoran) of Glencarnie.|$|E
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{influence on the}} younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, that threatened to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E
5|$|Especially {{during the}} 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars Bob Wilson and Emlyn Hughes were brought out of {{retirement}} to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans of the strip Martin Kemp and Steve Norman, of the pop group Spandau Ballet. Geoff Boycott served for several years as Melchester's chairman, and Sir Alf Ramsey had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> coma. Players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, {{despite the fact that}} the clubs they played for in real life were never featured in the strip.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's renown comes {{largely from}} his {{treatment}} {{at some length}} by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law Æthelfrith, or to Æthelfrith's sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than {{a key figure in}} Britain {{during the first half of}} the 7th century. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin's reign <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> failures: the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of Æthelfrith, which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E

25|$|He was {{essentially}} a theorist, and his great merit <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, expounding the true explanation of the results. He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.|$|E
25|$|Briggs was a notably {{short man}} at {{about five feet}} five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ability to vary the flight and pace of the ball {{as well as in}} {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of Lostwithiel, {{there was little to}} detain Charles's main army in the extreme west. Meanwhile, Banbury, a most {{important}} point in the Oxford circle, and Basing House (near Basingstoke) were in danger of capture. Waller, who had organised a small force of reliable troops, had already sent cavalry into Dorsetshire with the idea of assisting Essex. He now came himself with reinforcements to prevent, so far as <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> power, the King's return to the Thames valley.|$|E

25|$|Butler was {{expected}} {{to compensate for the}} loss of Harold Larwood to retirement after persistent injuries, and the decline of Bill Voce's powers, but although a fine bowler, he was not as fast as Larwood although similar in pace to Voce. Butler's chief merit <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> accuracy and ability to move the ball off the seam, and vary his length according to the conditions, as shown when he went on his only overseas tour to the West Indies. His physical strength, however, was always doubtful and he suffered from injury.|$|E
25|$|Charles marched by Bridgnorth, Lichfield and Ashbourne to Doncaster, {{where on}} 18 August he {{was met by}} great numbers of Yorkshire gentlemen with {{promises}} of fresh recruits. For a moment the outlook was bright, for the Derbyshire men with Gell were far away at Worcester with Leven, the Yorkshire Parliamentarians engaged in besieging Scarborough and Pontefract castles and other posts. But two days later he heard that David Leslie with the cavalry of Leven's army was coming up behind him, and that, the Yorkshire sieges being now ended, Major-General Poyntz's force <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> front. It was now impossible {{to wait for the}} new levies, and reluctantly the King turned back to Oxford, raiding Huntingdonshire (the home county of Oliver Cromwell) {{and other parts of the}} hated Eastern Association en route.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{physical}} injuries, Hughes was proud that {{his mind was}} still working. As he <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hospital bed, {{he decided that he}} did not like the bed's design. He called in plant engineers to design a customized bed, equipped with hot and cold running water, built in six sections, and operated by 30 electric motors, with push-button adjustments. The hospital bed was designed by Hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries. Despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed, Hughes' bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed. Hughes' doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous. Hughes, however, believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery, instead asserting the natural life-giving properties of fresh-squeezed orange juice were responsible.|$|E

25|$|Skilling {{started his}} career in Houston as an analyst for First City Bancorporation of Texas in Houston. First City was one of Enron's banks and just before it failed the first time, Skilling quit. The CEO of Collecting Bank, the FDIC's {{facility}} for managing the bad assets of First City, was Sam Segnar, the first CEO and chairman of Enron. The new First City Bank, headed by A. Robert Abboud, was also an Enron bank. Abboud was {{the former president of}} First Chicago Bank and Occidental Petroleum under Armand Hammer. First City was initiated by Judge James Andersen Elkins and his law partnership, Vinson & Elkins, one of Enron's main law companies. As a consultant for McKinsey & Company, Skilling worked with Enron during 1987, helping the company create a forward market in natural gas. Skilling impressed Kenneth <b>Lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> capacity as a consultant, and was hired by Lay during 1990 as {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Enron Finance Corp. In 1991, he became the chairman of Enron Gas Services Co., which was a result of the merger of Enron Gas Marketing and Enron Finance Corp. Skilling was named CEO and managing director of Enron Capital & Trade Resources, which was the subsidiary responsible for energy trading and marketing. He was promoted to president and chief operating officer of Enron during 1997, second only to Lay, while remaining the manager of Enron Capital & Trade Resources. During 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{were now}} {{lodged in the}} {{northern}} French provinces depriving Louis XIV of vital resources, but Villars' resistance had provided a boost to French morale. There was also French success in Spain in 1709: Alicante's citadel fell in April, and on 7 May the Marquis of Bay defeated Fronteira and Galway at the Battle of La Gudina on the Portuguese border. However, Louis XIV's greatest advantage <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> enemy's political disunity, exacerbated as it was by the appalling Allied losses at Malplaquet (particularly the Dutch) and the strategic indecisiveness of the battle. The Tories – whose Land Tax was funding the war – sought to make political gain by demonstrating that the Whigs and their friends at the Bank of England were benefiting from the ongoing conflict {{to the detriment of}} their compatriots. But there was also anger from the Dutch who, since April, had been pressing British ministers to accept their latest Barrier project. Talks had reached deadlock, but in August the Dutch had learnt of the secret territorial and commercial concessions the Habsburgs had yielded Britain; concessions at odds with the Treaty of Grand Alliance which had promised an equal division of the Spanish spoils. To appease their allies the Godolphin ministry now proposed its own concessions. By the Barrier Treaty of 29 October Townshend, without consulting Vienna, promised the Dutch an extensive Barrier fortress system, as well as commercial advantages in the Spanish Netherlands and an equal share of any advantages secured from Spain's empire; the Treaty also granted the Dutch Upper Guelders, to which the Prussians laid claim. In return, the States General offered concessions of their own, primarily to provide armed help in repelling any future foreign attempt to overthrow the Protestant succession in Great Britain. From the outset, however, Joseph I, Charles III, and the Tories who saw the Dutch primarily as commercial rivals, considered the agreement prejudicial to their own economic and strategic interests.|$|E

500|$|Filipovitch-Robinson {{asserts that}} the heart of Jovanović's appeal as an Orientalist <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> [...] "positive {{characterization}} of Balkan life". Modern scholars, she writes, have criticized the artist for overlooking the hardships of rural Balkan life. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that such criticism is unfounded, and draws parallels between Jovanović's Orientalist works and those of contemporary popular realists in France, whose works rarely had political connotations and yet were never criticized for neglecting social issues.|$|E

[...] There was a native drollery in his lightly rolling dance, a comic dignity in his rotund and placid, yet twinklingly intelligent face. [...] He always {{gave the impression of}} thoroughly enjoying whatever he did...." [...] In its review of Ruddigore, The Theatre wrote, [...] "Better comic acting than his, or more highly finished, I have never seen and never wish to see." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Michael Rutter, the {{importance}} of Bowlby's initial writings on [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> emphasis that children's experiences of interpersonal relationships were crucial to their psychological development and that {{the formation of an}} ongoing relationship with the child was as important a part of parenting as the provision of experiences, discipline and child care. Although this view was rejected by many at the time, the argument focussed attention on the need to consider parenting in terms of consistency of caregivers over time and parental sensitivity to children's individuality and it is now generally accepted. Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest and controversy in the nature of early relationships and gave a strong impetus to what Mary Ainsworth described as a [...] "great body of research" [...] in what was perceived as an extremely difficult and complex area.|$|E
