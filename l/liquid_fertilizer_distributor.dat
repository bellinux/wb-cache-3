The diluted <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> {{can then be}} used for direct sustainable greenwall irrigation. Our {{results show that the}} presence of organic matter in the <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> draw solution did not compromise FO membrane performance. No discernible changes in water flux and key membrane transport parameters (pure water permeability coefficient, A, and salt (NaCl) permeability coefficient, B) were observed when the organic matter concentration in the draw solution was increased to 2000. mg/L. Parameters influencing the osmotic dilution process were examined in terms of reverse salt flux, <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> concentration, cross-flow rate, and feed and <b>liquid</b> <b>fertilizer</b> draw solution temperatures. The reverse flux of phosphate was much lower compared to those of ammonium and potassium as the reverse flux of these solutes were proportionally related to their hydrated radii. Cross-flow rate had no discernible impact on either water flux or reverse nutrient transport. Water and reverse nutrient fluxes increased markedly with increasing temperature, driven by higher water and solute diffusivities. More than 80 % water recovery was achieved by osmotic dilution using raw sewage feed. Water production was stable and not affected by deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. By contrast, reverse nutrient diffusion was hindered due to enhanced steric hindrance. Results reported here have significant environmental implications.
