If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> top of the nest and try {{to blend in with}} the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E

A relative of one of the victims questioned why Alvarez did not simply <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the tracks if it was really a suicide attempt.|$|E
25|$|Also, Cramer has National Football League yellow {{penalty and}} red coach's {{challenge}} flags that he throws whenever he believes a company has behaved unethically (penalty) {{or when he}} questions a stock decision (coach's challenge), respectively.

25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the floor of the}} mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams {{at the mouth of the}} tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the group's first album in 1973, they were banned from {{competing}} in the isicathamiya competitions because of their ability to win many of the competitions. They were, however, welcome to perform for the audience. Following this, the group started performing for their own audiences in shows that were specially made and, soon afterwards, the group began touring around South Africa in their own concerts, but due to the Apartheid system in use, they were often stopped by police guards; on some of these occasions they were even made to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground whilst being searched. Shortly afterwards, they were allowed to tour without permits.|$|E
25|$|LTTE had {{executed}} {{prisoners of}} war {{on a number of}} occasions, in spite of the declaration in 1988, that it would abide by the Geneva Conventions. One such incident was the mass murder of 600 unarmed Sri Lankan Police officers in 1990, in Eastern Province, after they surrendered to the LTTE on the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Police officers were promised safe conduct and subsequent release; they were instead taken to the jungle, blindfolded, and had their hands tied behind their backs, before being made to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground to be subsequently shot. In 1993, LTTE killed 200 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, captured in the naval base at Pooneryn, during the Battle of Pooneryn.|$|E

He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while they pick at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and {{taken out of the}} house {{on the morning of the}} second day after Christmas.

500|$|There is a {{story about}} a dragon man from the village of Pečenjevce, eastern Serbia, who saw an ala in a cloud while he was scything. He said to scythemen beside him, [...] "I am going to sleep, and you swing a scythe above me," [...] before he lay down and fell asleep. A man who swung the scythe, however, {{inadvertently}} grazed him with the tip of the blade. When the dragon woke up, he told that he had been wounded by the ala he fought with, and lost a lot of blood. A dragon from the village of Bogojevac always kept with him a piece of a scythe blade or a knife. As soon as he perceived the imminent approach of bad weather, he would <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground and stick the blade above his head. It was thought that his spirit then soared into the clouds to deal with the ala. When he was drafted into the army, he fell asleep without a blade during a thunderstorm, and died. At a village near Tran in western Bulgaria, a man reputed to be a dragon would swoon when it started to thunder. After he came to, he would say, [...] "How tired I am!" [...] This was thought to refer to the strenuous battle he fought in the clouds.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{is thought}} to have stopped {{painting}} by several writers, but she herself tells us that she drew all her life. [...] She moved from Paris to Villa Sant'Agnese, a villa outside Florence, Italy in 1937, and in 1940fleeing the invasion of France by GermanyBarney joined her there. [...] After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to [...] "get back to [...] painting and painter's life", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war. [...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. [...] She died in Nice, France, in 1970 at the age of 96. Barney and Brooks are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

500|$|The clan's {{social life}} {{revolves}} around a communal den. While some clans may use particular den sites for years, others may use several different dens {{within a year}} or several den sites simultaneously. Spotted hyena dens can have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are usually oval in section, being wider than they are high, and narrow down from an entrance width of ½–1 metre (1.6–7.7ft) to as small as [...] In the rocky areas of East Africa and Congo, spotted hyenas use caves as dens, while those in the Serengeti use kopjes as resting areas in daylight hours. Dens have large bare patches around their entrances, where hyenas move or <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>on.</b> Because of their size, adult hyenas are incapable of using the full extent of their burrows, as most tunnels are dug by cubs or smaller animals. The structure of the den, consisting of small underground channels, is likely an effective anti-predator device which protects cubs from predation during the absence of the mother. Spotted hyenas rarely dig their own dens, having been observed for the most part to use the abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. Faeces are usually deposited [...] away from the den, though they urinate wherever they happen to be. Dens are used mostly by several females at once, and {{it is not uncommon to}} see up to 20 cubs at a single site. The general form of a spotted hyena den is tunnel-shaped, with a spacious end chamber used for sleeping or breeding. This chamber measures up to [...] in width, the height being rather less. Females generally give birth at the communal den or a private birth den. The latter is primarily used by low status females in order to maintain continual access to their cubs, as well as ensure that they become acquainted with their cubs before transferral to the communal den.|$|E
