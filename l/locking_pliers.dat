25|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>pliers,</b> Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an {{over-center}} action. One side of the handle includes a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first <b>locking</b> <b>pliers</b> with a locking handle that Petersen called the Vise-Grip was patented.|$|E

Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of <b>locking</b> <b>pliers,</b> covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

50|$|Lock {{snapping}} is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of cylinder lock, such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. Lock snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the lock cylinder, usually {{with a pair of}} <b>locking</b> <b>pliers,</b> thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.|$|E

50|$|Venustodus is an extinct genus of eugeneodontid holocephalid {{from the}} Carboniferous of the Komi Republic of Russia, and in {{similarly}} aged strata in the United States The generic name is from Ancient Greek, meaning Tooth of Venus. The genus {{is believed to}} be of cosmopolitan distribution due to the discovery of specimens across two continents within the same period. The individual teeth are heterodontal, measuring between 8-9mm (0.3 inches), with unusual curvature familiar among members of Eugeneodontida, growing in the shape reminiscent of a pair of <b>Locking</b> <b>pliers,</b> hundreds of teeth continuing to grow and cause pre-existing teeth to protrude outwards.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{removal of}} broken femoral stems {{has become a}} major issue in {{revision}} surgery, and is a technically difficult and time-consuming procedure. [...] - CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a fracture of a cementless long femoral stem in a 65 -year-old, white Caucasian man. The distal part was removed with a special longitudinal osteotomy through the anterior cortex extending distally for 10 cm. It was then followed by a transversal osteotomy 2 cm below the tip of the femoral stump to allow enough space for two <b>locking</b> <b>pliers.</b> Simultaneously using a lamina spreader on the distal part, the broken stem was extracted while hammering on two <b>locking</b> <b>pliers.</b> [...] - CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple and easy technique for the removal of a broken femoral stem that can be applied to all kinds of femoral stems and intramedullary nails regardless of their cross section.

30|$|A small {{longitudinal}} skin incision just {{distal to}} the tibia-femur joint was made. The tibia/femur head was exposed subperiosteally and an osteotomy {{performed with the}} delicately placed pilot drill over the entry point and lightly pumped up and down under copius saline irrigation just to enter the cortical bone for the MDIs. This was used for initial bone drilling to depth of 0.5  mm. The 3 M™ESPE™ MDI (size 1.8  mm[*]×[*] 10  mm) vial was opened and {{the body of the}} implant was firmly grasped with a sterilized <b>locking</b> <b>pliers.</b> The titanium finger driver was attached {{to the head of the}} implant. The implant was transferred to the site and rotated clockwise while exerting downwards pressure. This began the self tapping process and was used until noticeable bony resistance encountered when it touched the lower cortical plate. The winged thumb wrench was used for driving the implant deeper into the bone, if necessary. All the animals received one MDI on the head of each tibia or femur. Therefore, total 18 mini dental implants were inserted.|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds/Aims: We {{investigated}} the clinical application of extended distal pancreatectomy {{in patients with}} pancre-atic neck cancer accompanied by distal pancreatic atrophy. In this study, we have emphasized on {{the technical aspects of}} using the linear stapling device for a bulky target organ. Methods: From March 2010 to September 2013, 46 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent pancreatic resection with radical intent at our institute, were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, three patients (6. 5 %) underwent extended distal pancreatectomy. A linear stapling device and vise-grip <b>locking</b> <b>pliers</b> were used for en bloc resection of the distal pancreas, first duodenal portion, and distal common bile duct. The results were compared with those after standard pancreatectomy. Results: All three patients presented with jaundice, and the ratio of pancreatic duct to parenchymal thickness of the pancreatic body was greater than 0. 5. Grade A pancreatic fistula developed in all of the cases, but none of these fistulae were lethal. Pathological staging was T 3 N 1 M 0 in all of the patients. The postoperative daily serum glucose fluctuations and insulin requirements were comparable to those in patients who received pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. At the last follow-up, two patients were alive with liver metastasis at 4 and 10 months postoperatively, respectively, and one patient died of liver metastasis at 5 months postoperatively. Conclusions: While the prognosis of advanced pancreatic neck adenocarcinoma is still dismal, extended distal pancreatectomy is a valid treatment option, especially when there is atrophy of the distal pancreas. Also, the procedure is technically feasible, and further refinement is necessary to im...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{requirements}} of the law for animal protection should be tried to develope a compatible minimal-invasiv castration method by using diathermia. It was eximinated, whether with this method a lock of the Arteria testicularis can be achieved. In addition a diathermy operation kit was developed, which consists a generator and a needle electrode as well as a neutral electrode. A bipolar use of percutaneously needle electrodes in connection with <b>locking</b> <b>pliers</b> for testicle bag neck wasn&# 65533;t possible, so that teflon-coated monopolary needle electrodes were set manually into the range of the spermatic cord vessels. In comparison to the castration method after Burdizzo 113 bull calves were diathermally treated with this mobile equipment. After the treatment with GnRH one week after the operation testosterone and testicle condition were estimated by slaughtering seven month later. After an initial lock of the Arteria testicularis on 52, 2 % of the animals (testosterone < 0, 01 nmol/l) there was a both- sided catch in 14, 3 % and a one-sided catch in 36, 7 % and thus after anaemic necrosis a loss of function of the testicles. Only seven Animals showed a both-sided castration effect. The testosterone level of the animals, which only were diathermally treated successfully on one side, was with an average of 0, 37 nmol/l higher than controlled animals (0, 21 nmol/l). The functional testicle increased and their weight remained compared with untreated testicles of the same age group at approximately 40 %. A castration success with diathermally coagulation necroses can be obtained by an experienced user. The parameter of diathermia are usable and compatible without disturbance of the general condition. However predominantly uncertain and repeatable castration effects did not result, so that this method has no practical relevance. The diathermally needle electrode with appropriate isolation can open several options for veterinary application, so among other things a purposeful coagulation of various vessels, wereby only one injection point is to prepare. The anatomically exact setting of coagulation necroses by means of diathermia under visual inspection would revalorize the developed method. By the associated opening of the testicle bag the method can&# 65533;t be called animal compatible and minimal-invasiv. The secretion of testosterone after the treatment with GnRH is possible as an indicator of the castration effect even with very young bull calves, however can lead with the diathermally method to misinterpretations. In the own investigations after the treatment with GnRH the testosterone values (0, 21 - 0, 37 nmol/l) are comparable with the few individual values were found by MONGKONPUNYA et al. (1975) and KESLER et al. (1976). The transcutaneous ligature of the spermatic cord vessels as an animal-fair castration method appears to be alternatively possible and can be recommended practical veterinary surgeon in connection with anaesthetic clearence of horns at bull calves. By the minimal invasive, selektive banding of the spermatic cord and its vessels it appears to be more compatible for the animals than the Burdizzo method. A castration with the Burdizzo pliers can further be used with older bull calves and bulls. Due to the complex damage of the entire testicle during the appropiate handling a successful castration with this method is relatively safe. </p...|$|E
