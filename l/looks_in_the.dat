5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E

She added that she would not be overshadowed in the film despite the presence of three male leads. Similar to Ye Maaya Chesave, Chaitanya and Samantha had a kissing scene in this film {{as a part of the}} script. A clip of one of Samantha's <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film was leaked in late July 2013. She was seen sporting an urban look and opted for a complete makeover. Nagarjuna's look in the film was leaked in mid August 2013 and he was seen sporting corrective eyeglasses and a conventional clean shave and moustache for which he removed the goatee he grew for his previous works Greeku Veerudu (2013) and Bhai (2013). Saran's look in the film's flashback sequences was leaked in late February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Whoever <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{past and}} {{thinks about the}} time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E

In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others.

Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. I mean how it <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly."

Monroe theorized that with the recent reveal by Gaga that she {{suffered}} from Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in an open letter, the continued theme between the videos made sense. Along with the essay, the videos portrayed Gaga being handled roughly in her early career, forced to tour through her hip pain (described by the dancing in [...] "Perfect Illusion"), and finally in the [...] "Million Reasons" [...] clip, her team helps her in healing and crafting Joanne.

The note tells Keen that the McMire killed in the previous game was an android replica, that the [...] "Gannalech" [...] is a mispronunciation of [...] "Grand Intellect", his title from the first trilogy, and that the Armageddon Machine was itself a distraction, as McMire plans on destroying the universe instead.

She also felt the video was Perry's [...] "most complex, stylized and out-there video production yet". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly felt that West's rap verses helped the song top the Billboard Hot 100, and called the video an [...] "awesomely bizarre sci-fi video, which impressively resists any obvious Spielberg references". Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone described the video as [...] "a sequel to Avatar or a Katy Perry video game", and felt the song and video were [...] "a bold move away from Perry's usual silliness and sexuality". Los Angeles Times described the video as a [...] "sweeping visual manifestation". In a more negative review, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized Perry, saying she looked like an [...] "animated video-game character", while saying West was a [...] "non-presence". Cinquemani later went on to say: [...] "It's a step up from bras that shoot whipped cream and fireworks, but this is ultimately Sigimondi's vision, and it's far from her finest five minutes." [...] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the video for [...] "E.T." [...] won awards for Best Collaboration and Best Special Effects.|$|E

500|$|As {{stated by}} Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, in this video, Rihanna {{returned}} to nature as in her video for her previous single, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", which features {{nearly the same}} colors as the [...] "California King Bed" [...] video. Lipshutz also commented that Rihanna's just rolled-out-bed appearance is completed by the modest, cream-colored attire in the airy, light-filled clip. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, writing: [...] "Instead of being in complete control, here she is—vulnerable, open, and unsure. The video captures the feel of 'King Bed,' not that it's a difficult one to grasp." [...] Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press was also positive about the video, praising the sensual side of Rihanna. A writer of The Huffington Post concluded: [...] "In the video for her new video, 'California King Bed,' the Barbadian pop star slows it down and shows her sensitive side, holding notes and bearing her soul over a troubled relationship. Set entirely in a gorgeously pink-palleted open air room overlooking the beach, the winds swirl and blow the curtains dramatically around the heart broken singer." [...] The writer finished the review saying that [...] "Not much happens in the video – but then, that's the point." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy compared the video with Fergie's [...] "Big Girls Don't Cry" [...] saying, that they [...] "Both are midtempo, ballady and filmed in a soft-focus domestic setting." [...] Katz also complimented {{the bed in the}} video saying that it [...] "evoke a very Caribbean vibe, a shout-out to Rihanna's native Barbados, no doubt." [...] A writer of Daily Mail complimented Rihanna's <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, saying that it showed her [...] "most sultry" [...] side. Both Nicole Eggenberger of OK! and Eleanor Young of Marie Claire commented that the video uses a lot of sex appeal which was a departure from Rihanna's older videos.|$|E
500|$|Vikram {{signed on}} to {{collaborate}} again with Shankar for I, a romantic thriller opposite Amy Jackson, in early 2012. Following hushed production developments, {{it was revealed that}} the actor would sport four significantly different <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film: a body builder, a beast, a model and a hunchback. He put on weight to portray the bodybuilder, sticking to a diet of protein and coffee, to ensure his muscles are defined on screen. Vikram subsequently lost weight to portray a model, before shaving his head and reducing his weight to 56 kilograms to portray the crippled hunchback. He changed his physique by eating small meals of egg whites and apples instead of regular food intakes, while engaging in an intensive weight loss regime to become thin. The cast and crew of the film reportedly struggled to recognise the actor at times, while he also stayed away from the media for close to a year when sporting the look. Taking almost three years for production, Vikram described the film [...] "as the toughest he has ever done" [...] and regularly suffered folliculitis {{as a result of the}} prosthetic make-up he had to wear. The film opened amidst much expectation in January 2015 to mixed reviews, though critics gave Vikram's portrayal of Lingesan, unanimously positive reviews. A critic from Times of India noted [...] "Vikram bowls you over with a heart-wrenching performance whether he is handsome or disfigured", while The Hindu added his transformation was [...] "laudable", and that [...] "Vikram wins hearts as the earnest-to-boot gym rat and as the strapping new model on the block, he floors the audience with his performance as Koonan, the deformed hunchback". Similarly Rediff.com noted the actor [...] "is truly impressive and deserves much applause", while Sify.com added he [...] "lived the role". Despite mixed reviews, I performed well at the box office, as well as becoming the most successful Tamil film of all time in Kerala. He then worked on Vijay Milton's road-thriller, 10 Enradhukulla (2015), which featured him as an unnamed race driver who goes on a road trip through India. Paired opposite Samantha, the film opened to mixed reviews and did not perform well at the box office. A critic from Sify.com however noted Vikram [...] "breathes life to his role and his energy level is highly infectious", adding that [...] "the way he smiles, dances and fight is a treat for his fans". Likewise a critic from The Hindu criticised the film's script adding [...] "it's hard to see Vikram in this fluff". Vikram later appeared in Iru Mugan, a science fiction action film directed by Anand Shankar, featuring him alongside Nayantara and Nithya Menen.|$|E
