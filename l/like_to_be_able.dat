Some <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to access their benches from all sides, while others like their bench against a wall. The {{advantage}} of wall placement - besides the saved space - is that tools can be stored on the wall over the bench, within easy reach. This keeps the tool storage out of the way, and the tools can still be reached without turning around or bending down.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} in focused {{crawling}} {{is that in}} the context of a Web crawler, we would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to predict the similarity of the text of a given page to the query before actually downloading the page. A possible predictor is the anchor text of links; this was the approach taken by Pinkerton in the first web crawler of the early days of the Web. Diligenti et al. propose using the complete content of the pages already visited to infer the similarity between the driving query and the pages that have not been visited yet. The performance of a focused crawling depends mostly on the richness of links in the specific topic being searched, and a focused crawling usually relies on a general Web search engine for providing starting points.|$|E

25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

For many years well-known local musician Professor Ian Parrott regularly sat beneath this window during services.

The window, which was designed by John Petts, is on the theme of [...] "Music in Praise of the Lord".|$|E
500|$|Original [...] "Tribbles" [...] creator David Gerrold was {{contacted}} by The New York Times, {{who wanted to}} interview him about the anniversary and the rumored [...] "tribbles" [...] episode. When he questioned Berman about the episode, Berman initially denied it. [...] Gerrold responded that he didn't want to embarrass anyone, but would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to endorse the project. [...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later {{said that he would}} have gone in a different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being better than anything he would have created.|$|E

[...] According to Tyagananda, Sarkar's statement that Tantric worship (upasana) is [...] "looking upon a woman as mother" [...] (janani ramani) was misquoted by Kripal to mean the opposite, that the mother is the lover.|$|R

In Psycho, Marion Crane steals $40,000 and runs away; Norman Bates would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run away from his situation. In The Birds, Mitch Brenner is symbolically the new father of his family, since his actual father is dead, and this is reflected in multiple scenes, most prominently when he calls his mother [...] "Darling".|$|R

2500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of the film's dream sequences, which heavily utilize special effects and deviate from the overall naturalistic feel of the film. In his review for the St. Petersburg Times, Hal Lipper called the dream sequences [...] "existential flights of fancy are accompanied by psychedelic images that seem better suited for '60s 'happenings.'" [...] In addition, one scene in which the adult bear mates with a female bear while the cub looks on was criticized as being unfriendly for children viewers. David Denby of New York Magazine stated as much in his review of the film, noting [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to recommend The Bear as a movie that parents and children could see together, but I'm afraid there's a scene in the middle {{that would have to}} be... explained." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Romancing, the {{director}} suddenly had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay, which was titled Back to the Future. Starring Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Christopher Lloyd, the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release, and {{was followed by}} two sequels, released as Back to the Future Part II in 1989 and Back to the Future Part III in 1990. Before the Back to the Future sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which painstakingly combined traditional animation and live action; its US$70 million budget made {{it one of the}} most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success, and won three Academy Awards. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do everything.

It's that simple. We don't understand why this is such a big deal."

The paper investigates the concept of flexible delivery, and contextualising flexible assessment.

The findings indicated that the programs were only significantly different in the negotiation of the due date of an assessment item. The results revealed that both flexible and traditional programs failed to address the assessment needs of the students when examining the elements of assessment that they would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> negotiate. The study suggests that the students should be provided with the option of negotiating the various assessment elements even though they might wish to change the offered alternatives...|$|R
