2500|$|Considered {{as a state}} machine, the {{turnstile}} has {{two possible}} states: <b>Locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unlocked.</b> [...] There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (coin) and pushing the arm (push). [...] In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; {{no matter how many}} times the input push is given, it stays in the locked state. [...] Putting a coin in – that is, giving the machine a coin input – shifts the state from Locked to Unlocked. [...] In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. [...] However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.|$|E
2500|$|The lower wings were parallel-chord, {{while the}} upper wings {{increased}} in chord from the centre section to the wingtips. The two prototype aircraft had ailerons {{on the upper}} wing only. These were single-acting, relying on the airflow to maintain them in a neutral position unless pulled downwards by using the flight controls. [...] The interplane struts were steel tubing with wood fairings to produce a streamline section. [...] The wings could be swung out from the pilot's position, {{by means of a}} hand-winch in the cockpit, locking being accomplished by means of a splined and threaded spigot in the forward spar, <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> by a quarter-turn in a similar manner to the breech of a field-gun. [...] In the folded position the wings were supported by a transverse shaft mounted in front of the tailplane: this was rotated by a lever in the cockpit so that its upturned ends engaged with slots on the interplane struts in order to lock the wings in the folded position.|$|E
2500|$|The temple {{consisted}} of twelve rooms, {{each with a}} specific theme (e.g., the Throne Room, the King's Storeroom, the Observatory, the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, the Heart Room, etc.). The rooms connected to adjacent rooms by doorways, although some doors were locked, blocking a contestant's progress into the adjacent room; the pattern of <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> doors changed from episode to episode depending both on the temple layout and the artifact's location. The unlocked doors were closed {{at the start of}} the round, but they could be opened by completing a specific task or puzzle within each room. One room in the temple contained the themed artifact (as stated by Olmec prior to the Steps of Knowledge round). Three other designated rooms held temple guards (spotters in Lavish Mayan sentinel costumes). If the winning team had exactly [...] pendants, the remaining half pendant was also placed in a room for the contestant with the half pendant to collect to make a full pendant. The extra half pendant, if needed, would either be hanging on the wall near a door or placed inside an object in a room (e.g., hidden inside a pot in the King's Storeroom). If the first player dropped their pendant, the second player was allowed to pick it up and either throw it back to their partner or use it if needed.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{remember}} one thing: no miscreant {{was seen to}} enter or leave the house surreptitiously; the murderer left no signs of entrance, and none of exit. An armed burglar would have left some trace--some one would have heard something. Then who <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> Lady Donaldson's door that night while she herself lay dead? ...|$|E
6000|$|Grave {{possibilities}} forced {{themselves on}} his attention. Suppose {{they did not}} believe him, what would they do to him? Would his unblemished high character count for nothing? Technically he was a burglar, beyond dispute. Following out this train of thought, he was composing a lucid apology for [...] "this technical crime I have committed," [...] to be delivered before sentence in the dock, when the stout gentleman got up and began walking about the room. He <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> drawers, and Mr. Ledbetter had a transient hope that he might be undressing. But, no! He seated himself at the writing-table, and began to write and then tear up documents. Presently the smell of burning cream-laid paper mingled with the odour of cigars in Mr. Ledbetter's nostrils.|$|E
50|$|As he <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> the {{cabinets}} for scholars and observed {{the intensity of}} their desire to see forbidden images, he pondered {{on the possibility of}} his own archive. Politically, the time was approaching complete censorship and book burning.|$|E

The system uses near field communication which also allows the car to be <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> even if the phone is out of battery.|$|E
5000|$|Early systems <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> {{only the}} car doors. Many cars today also feature systems which can unlock {{such things as}} the luggage {{compartment}} or fuel filler cap door. It is also common on modern cars for the locks to activate automatically when the car is put into gear or reaches a certain speed.|$|E
50|$|Identilock is {{a firearm}} safety device, created by Michigan {{engineer}} Omer Kiyani. Identilock is a gun attachment that covers and prevents {{access to the}} trigger, which makes it different from other trigger locks. Identilock is clamped to {{the handle of the}} gun. It is <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> with a fingerprint, a biometric scanner that stores up to three fingerprints.|$|E

50|$|The KM 400 first flew in June 1983 at Nyíregyháza, piloted by Károly Borosnyai. An all-moving {{tailplane}} {{was fitted}} on these early flights, {{to check out}} its general characteristics. It was then modified so the pilot could switch between <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> elevator and by December 1983 was reported as flying successfully entirely under flaperon control. Tests to optimize the tailplane were still in progress in 1988, after which little is heard about the KM 400.|$|E
50|$|Trains on the now electrified, more northerly {{of the two}} Liverpool to Manchester Lines still {{pass through}} the station site. The {{buildings}} have been demolished and a signal box built since the station's closure occupies part of the site. An electrical switching site is being constructed in the vicinity {{as part of the}} Manchester - Liverpool (via Earlestown) section of the NW electrification schemes. The level crossing is <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> by the signaller, but is operated manually by road users.|$|E
50|$|The {{countdown}} {{mechanism is}} constructed using a column wheel that extends {{through the main}} plate and a vertical clutch.

5000|$|Each train {{consists}} of four cars with three rows per car, two riders per row, holding 24 total riders. Each row has a lap bar and a seat belt. The lapbar itself is <b>locked</b> <b>and</b> <b>unlocked</b> by an electrical current that activates solenoids on the train, resulting in a [...] "buzzing" [...] electrical sound. They can be troublesome, sometimes requiring the operating crew to manually unlock the lapbar for a rider. The trains ride on steel wheels with guide wheels and upstops attached. The track is plank wood stacked 7 planks high, with steel running surfaces on the top, bottom and sides (locations where the running, guide, and upstop wheels contact the track).|$|E
