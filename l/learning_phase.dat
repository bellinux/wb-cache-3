25|$|One {{study found}} that juggling novices showed a {{bilateral}} gray matter expansion in the medial temporal visual area (also known as V5) over a three-month period during which they had learned to sustain a three-ball cascade {{for at least a}} minute. No changes were observed in a control group that did not engage in juggling. The extent of these changes in the jugglers reduced during a subsequent three-month period in which they did not practice juggling. To further resolve the time course of these changes, the experiment was repeated with another young cohort scanned in shorter intervals, and the by then typical changes in V5 could already be found after just seven days of juggling practice. Interestingly, the observed changes were larger in the initial <b>learning</b> <b>phase</b> than during continued training.|$|E

2500|$|Song {{learning}} in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile {{listening to the}} father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template. During the sensorimotor <b>learning</b> <b>phase,</b> song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called [...] "sub-song", which is akin to babbling in human infants. Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called [...] "plastic song". Finally, {{after two or three}} months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order). Some birds, such as zebra finches, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{a leading}} user of {{collaborative}} procurement methods, which are used to deliver large and complex infrastructure projects. Project alliances, Early Contractor Involvement (ECI), and partnering are typical examples of collaborative procurement models. In order to increase procurement effectiveness and value for money (VfM), clients have adopted various learning strategies for new contract development. However client learning strategies and behaviours have not been systematically analysed before. Therefore, the current paper undertakes a literature review addressing the research question “How can client learning capabilities be effectively understood?”. From the resource-based and dynamic capability perspectives, this paper proposes that the collaborative learning capability (CLC) of clients drives procurement model evolution. Learning routines underpinning CLC carry out exploratory, transformative and exploitative <b>learning</b> <b>phases</b> associated with collaborative project delivery. This learning improves operating routines, and ultimately performance. The conceptualization of CLC and the three sequential <b>learning</b> <b>phases</b> is used to analyse {{the evidence in the}} construction management literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies how information technologies, such as automatic {{question answering}} (QA), can add interactivity into a multimedia-based e-learning system {{and turn it}} into a "virtual mentor" to provide students with interactive, one-on-one instruction. It also explores the key factors of making such a "virtual mentor" as effective as a real mentor. Based on a review of multiple learning theories and technologies, an exploratory model for studying the effectiveness of interactive e-learning, named "Learning with Virtual Mentors (LVM) ", is proposed and a prototype system is developed to implement the LVM model. A series of studies, including controlled experiments and surveys have been conducted to explore the relationships among the core constructs of the LVM model: <b>learning</b> <b>phases,</b> system interactivity, learner characteristics, learning activity and learning outcomes. Findings indicate that <b>learning</b> <b>phases</b> and some learner characteristics such as learning style affect students' behaviors, performance, and perceptions in e-learningpartly as we expected. Furthermore, the virtual interaction impacts student behaviors, encouraging students to interact more and increasing student satisfaction with the learning process. However, the correlation between virtual interaction and actual learning performance is limited. Consequently, the LVM model needs to be further explored and developed...|$|R

This theoretical paper focuses on the initial phase of a design-based research approach; that is, the description of the design of a formal, written curriculum for primary science education in which features of social constructivist approaches to learning are synthesized with essential aspects of Vietnamese culture.

Learning aims are formulated to comprehensively develop scientific knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward science for primary students. Derived from these learning aims, the designed framework consists of four <b>learning</b> <b>phases</b> respectively labeled as Engagement, Experience, Exchange, and Follow-up.

With the evolution of entrepreneurship during the 1990 s, no other contemporary classification has emerged comprising such unique characteristics as the propreneur. Edwards and Edwards differentiated between conventional entrepreneurs by creating this modern classification. Although a body of research has been generated on both professionalism and entrepreneurship, investigations focused on the realm of the propreneur have been exiguous. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} construct a model of crucial success factors for propreneurs and to establish a clearer distinction of what transpires during their developmental <b>learning</b> <b>phases.</b> A qualitative grounded theory approach was used to collect, analyze, and synthesize data. Data were collected utilizing interviews and personal observations of 17 small business owners from various professional career fields located within the third largest career market in the United States. Interview transcripts were recorded and analyzed by the researcher to determine themes, patterns, categories, and properties. A theoretical model of crucial success factors (CSF) for small business propreneurs was developed from the research findings. The research indicated that propreneurs evolved over time after experiencing diverse stages of mentoring in different learning environments. These propreneurs had the opportunity to obtain firsthand knowledge of the essential components of entrepreneurship with experiential learning. The participants in this study systematically achieved the 10 crucial success factors depicted in the developmental model in sequential order. The subjects observed and learned the internal workings of a successful business which were crucial in their individual development and evolution. The developmental model of this study contains three separate <b>learning</b> <b>phases.</b> The three <b>learning</b> <b>phases</b> identified in the literature and the data helped the propreneurs absorb the meaningful knowledge necessary to continue advancing through the model.
