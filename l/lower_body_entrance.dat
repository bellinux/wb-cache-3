40|$|ObjectiveThere is {{no common}} {{guideline}} on what temperature should be achieved at the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest {{followed by the}} initiation of selective cerebral perfusion. MethodsBetween October 1999 and August 2005, a total of 377 patients underwent repair of the aortic arch with selective cerebral perfusion and hypothermic circulatory arrest at 20 °C to 28 °C and {{were divided into two}} groups: (1) 125 patients with deep <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest at 20 °C to 24. 9 °C (deep <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest group) and (2) 252 patients with moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest at 25 °C to 28 °C (moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest group). To compensate for the differences in patient characteristics, we used a propensity score matching analysis, and comparable patients, 92 patients from each group, were identified for final analysis. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences in}} mortality or morbidity between deep and moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest, in either the entire study cohort or the propensity-matched cohort. C-reactive protein level 1 day after the operation approached but fell short of significance (108. 4 ± 47. 7 mg/L in deep <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest group and 95. 8 ± 44. 2 mg/L in moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest group, P =. 07). The mean temperatures at the initiation of <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest were 24. 1 °C ± 2. 2 °C in patients who underwent reexploration for bleeding and 24. 9 °C ± 1. 8 °C in patients who did not (P =. 025); the difference also reached statistical significance in multivariate analysis (P =. 046, odds ratio 0. 796). ConclusionsOur results suggest that moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest can be safely performed for aortic arch repair. In fact, postoperative inflammatory response tended to be lower in patients with moderate <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest than those with deep <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest, and deep <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> circulatory arrest was a strong risk factor for reexploration for bleeding...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the aerobic contribution to upper <b>body</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> Wingate Anaerobic tests (WAnT). Eight nonspecifically trained males volunteered to take part in this study. Participants undertook incremental exercise tests for peak oxygen uptake and two 30 -s WAnT (habituation and experimental) for both the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body.</b> The resistive loadings used were 0. 040 and 0. 075 kg·kg body mass- 1, respectively. Peak power output (PPO) and mean power output (MPO) were calculated for each WAnT. The aerobic contribution of each WAnT was assessed using breath by breath expired gas analysis. Peak oxygen uptake was lower for the upper body when compared with the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (P = 0. 001). Similarly, PPO and MPO were greater for the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (both P < 0. 001). Absolute oxygen uptake during the upper <b>body</b> WAnT was <b>lower</b> than for the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (P = 0. 013), whereas relative oxygen uptake (% peak oxygen uptake) was similar (P = 0. 997). The mean aerobic contribution for the upper body WAnT (43. 5 % ± 29. 3 %) was greater than for the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (29. 4 % ± 15. 8 %; P < 0. 001). The greater aerobic contribution to the WAnT observed for the upper body in comparison with the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> is likely due to methodological differencesinupper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> WAnT protocols and potentially differencesinanaerobic power production and exercise efficiency.

A total of 25 direct measurements {{were selected for}} the relevant literature <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> size measurement analysis, that included 9 components related to BMI, height and circumferences, 3 components related to width and thickness, 5 components related to length, 3 components related to height, and 2 other components. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, cluster analysis and variance analysis were executed using PASW 18. 0 to analyze the data. In accordance with the factor analysis results to classify the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> shape of overweight women in their 20 s to 60 s whose BMI was over 25, 4 factors were identified (<b>lower</b> <b>body</b> volume, leg volume, <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> length and leg length). A total of 4 <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> shapes of overweight women were found through cluster analysis using 4 factor scores from the factor analysis.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{experimental}} animals indicate an important inhibitory interaction between cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflexes. In the dog, for example, cardiopulmonary vagal afferents modulate carotid baroreflex control of vascular resistance. On the other hand, previous studies in human subjects have not produced convincing {{evidence of a}} specific interaction between these baroreceptor reflexes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether unloading of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors in humans with nonhypotensive <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure selectively augments the reflex vasoconstrictor responses to simulated carotid hypotension produced by neck pressure. In nine healthy subjects, we measured forearm vascular responses with plethysmography during <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure alone (cardiopulmonary baroreflex), during neck pressure alone (carotid baroreflex), and during concomitant <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure and neck pressure (baroreflex interaction). <b>Lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure produced a greater than twofold augmentation of the forearm vasoconstrictor response to neck pressure. This increase in resistance was significantly greater (P less than 0. 05) than the algebraic sum of the increase in resistance from <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure alone plus that from neck pressure alone. In contrast, <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure did not potentiate the forearm vasoconstrictor responses either to intra-arterial norepinephrine or to the cold pressor test. Thus, the potentiation of the vasoconstrictor response to neck pressure by <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure cannot be explained by augmented reactivity to the neurotransmitter or to a nonspecific augmentation of responses to all reflex vasoconstrictor stimuli. In conclusion, nonhypotensive <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure selectively augments carotid baroreflex control of forearm vascular resistance. These experiments demonstrate a specific inhibitory cardiopulmonary-carotid baroreflex interaction in humans...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> {{anaerobic}} performance of semi-elite Rugby League (RL) players. Methods: Twenty-two semi-professional RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed two Wingate anaerobic tests (WAnT) on an electronic arm ergometer and a cycle ergometer separated by three days. Percent body fat was used determined from the sum of six skinfolds and upper and lower muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated from anthropometric data. Results: Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> absolute peak (P= 0. 035, P= 0. 002) and mean (P= 0. 005, P= 0. 031) power were higher in the RL group compared to the control group. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> relative peak power was higher (P= 0. 022, P= 0. 047) in the control group compared to the RL group. Peak and mean power (relative and absolute) were higher (P≤ 0. 05) in the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> compared to the upper body. Peak and mean power relative to upper and lower muscle CSA was higher (P≤ 0. 001) in the upper body compared to the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> for both groups. Conclusion: Semi-elite Rugby League players have well developed absolute anaerobic power, but relative to body weight upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> anaerobic power is not well developed. The upper body is able to generate more power relative to body weight and muscle CSA compared to the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> during the WAnT.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study was to measure and compare the aerobic, {{anaerobic}} alactic and anaerobic lactic energy system contribution during the 30 -­sec Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) for the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> within the same individuals. METHODS: Physically active men (n= 14) completed two WAnTs on an electronic arm ergometer and a cycle ergometer separated by three days. A fly wheel braking force corresponding to 5 % and 7. 5 % of the participants body weight was used for the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> WAnTs respectively. Oxygen uptake and blood lactate were measured before, during and after both WAnTs, and body composition was measured using dual-­energy X-­ray absorptiometry (DEXA). RESULTS: The anaerobic lactic energy system contribution was significantly (p < 0. 01) higher during the upper body (60. 3 ± 5. 6 %) compared to the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (46. 9 ± 6. 9 %) WAnT. The contribution of the anaerobic alactic system was significantly higher (p < 0. 01) during the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (36. 5 ± 6. 3 %) compared to the upper body (28. 3 ± 4. 9 %) WAnT, with the aerobic system contribution significantly (p < 0. 05) higher for the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> (16. 8 ± 2. 5 %) compared to the upper body (11. 4 ± 1. 4 %) WAnT. CONCLUSIONS: The anaerobic lactic energy system provides over 60 % of the energy requirements during an upper body WAnT but provides less the 50 % during the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> WAnT. In contrast, the aerobic and anaerobic alactic energy system contribution was significantly less for the upper body WAnT compared to the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> WAnT...|$|R

The data were compared with those of 14 age-matched heart-transplant recipients, i. e., subjects with cardiac denervation. In healthy subjects, <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure at — 15 mm Hg caused a modest reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (- 5 ± 3. 4 %) and no change in vasopressin, whereas <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> negative pressure at — 37. 5 mm Hg caused a more marked reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (- 12 ± 2. 5 %) and a small, variable, but overall statistically significant (p< 0. 05) increase in vasopressin (+ 145 ± 46 %, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose: The present {{investigation}} aimed {{to examine and}} compare upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s performance using a randomized crossover design. Materials and Methods: Twelve physically active males (24 ± 3 years, 178 ± 6 centimetres (cm), 82. 5 ± 12. 2 kilograms (kg)) volunteered to complete two 5 x 6 s tests. An electronically braked cycle ergometer was used, with a fly wheel braking force corresponding to 5 % and 7. 5 % bodyweight being used for the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s respectively. The 5 x 6 s consisted of 5 maximal sprints, 6 seconds (s) in duration, separated by 24 s of passive recovery. Body composition was assessed via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance determined significance differences between the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> sprint performances.

Methods: Twenty physically active adults (males n= 12, females n= 8) volunteered to perform an upper and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s. The upper body 5 x 6 s was conducted on a modified electro-magnetically braked cycle ergometer, while the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s was conducted on an electronically braked cycle ergometer using a flywheel braking force corresponding to 5 % and 7. 5 % bodyweight respectively. During the upper body 5 x 6 s, participants were restrained at the waist with an adjustable seatbelt in an attempt to minimise the contribution from the <b>lower</b> <b>body.</b> Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Data are reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). A level of significance of 5 % (P< 0. 05) was adopted in all analyses. Results: Significant (p< 0. 001) differences occurred in both absolute (W) and relative (W·kg- 1) PP and mean power (MP) between genders during the upper body 5 x 6 s, with differences remaining even when relative to lean body mass (LBM) and active muscle mass (AMM). In contrast, PP and MP for the <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s was only significantly different between genders when expressed in absolute (W) and relative (W·kg- 1) terms. Conclusion: While both <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s performance and <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> 5 x 6 s predictors do not differ significantly between genders, significant differences do exist for upper body 5 x 6 s performance and performance predictors. Even after allometric scaling and training status have been considered, significant gender differences still remain for upper body 5 x 6 s performance, suggesting that unknown intrinsic muscle properties may be responsible for the significant gender differences observed.

Baseline and post-exercise pressure pain thresholds were measured at eight sites across the body and pressure pain tolerance was measured at the knee. ResultsPressure pain thresholds increased following exercise for all three groups, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. For the young and old healthy groups this exercise-induced analgesia (EIA) occurred following upper or <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> resistance exercise.

The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between diabetes mellitus and incident <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> disability over a 7 -year follow-up period. Methods. Ours was a 7 -year prospective cohort study of 1835 Mexican-American individuals 65 years old, nondisabled at baseline, and residing in five Southwestern states. Measures included self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, stroke, heart attack, hip fracture, arthritis, or cancer. Disability measures included activities of daily living (ADLs), mobility tasks, and an 8 -foot walk test. Body mass index, depressive symptoms, and vision function were also measured. Results. At 7 -year follow-up, 48. 7 % of diabetic participants nondisabled at baseline developed limitations in one or more measures of <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> function. Cox proportional regression analyses showed that diabetic participants were more likely to report any limitation in <b>lower</b> <b>body</b> ADL function (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 05, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 58 – 2. 67), mobility tasks (HR 1. 69, 95 % CI, 1. 39 – 2. 04), and 8 -foot walk (HR 1. 46, 95 % CI, 1. 15 – 1. 85) compared with nondiabetic participants, after controlling for relevant factors.
