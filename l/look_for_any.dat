5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

25|$|National {{and local}} {{government}} regulations require a minimum width for aisles in various building types. Regulatory agencies frequently inspect buildings, vehicles, etc., to enforce regulations requiring that aisles not be restricted. Inspectors have imposed fines for blocking or restricting passage when boxes or folding chairs are stored in aisles, for example. Insurance companies frequently have safety inspectors to examine the premises, both to determine whether insureds are complying with the insurer's requirements for coverage and to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> practices {{that could lead to}} injury or property damage, including restricting passage in aisles.|$|E

The day was {{primarily}} devoted to inspect Atlantis’s thermal protection system to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> signs of launch damage. Using the shuttle's robotic {{arm and the}} Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew performed a six-hour inspection of the reinforced carbon nose cap and wing leading edge panels of the shuttle. After releasing its grasp on the inspection boom, the robotic arm grappled the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 1 (ELC1) as a preparatory step for installation on Flight Day 3.|$|E
25|$|Screening for {{glaucoma}} {{is usually}} performed {{as part of}} a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma should include measurements of the intraocular pressure via tonometry, anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy, and examination of the optic nerve to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> visible damage to it, or change in the cup-to-disc ratio and also rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test should be performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry, and/or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).|$|E
25|$|To better {{study the}} AA problem, the Circus soon added a fourth trailer to some AA {{sites in the}} London area, {{dedicated}} solely to recording the inputs to the predictors, the numbers of rounds fired, and the results. These numbers were fed back through the AA command structure to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> chance of improvement. The official history, published just after the war, noted that between September and October 1940, 260,000 AA rounds had been fired with the result of 14 aircraft destroyed, a rate of 18,500 rounds-per-kill. This was already a great improvement over pre-radar statistics which were 41,000 rounds-per-kill. But {{with the addition of}} GL/EF, GL mats and better doctrine, this fell to 4,100 rounds-per-kill by 1941.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{the only known}} 'twin-set' railcar surviour was RM 133 in its grassgrub form as AC 8140, used for fire {{training}} at Auckland Airport. Fortunately in 2001 the RM 133 Trust Board was able to obtain this car, which was later {{found to be the}} No 1 end of RM 133 and the No 2 end of RM 115. Unfortunately, before the car could be removed a fire broke out in the No 2 half of the railcar, damaging the body.

25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they will <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the day was}} to inspect Atlantiss thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> signs of launch damage. To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at reinforced carbon–carbon wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser sensor package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 UTC, was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut Stephen Robinson who communicated with them during the survey.|$|E

500|$|During the First Battle of Savannah on December 29, 1778, the British landed {{near the}} city, {{and under the}} command of Archibald Campbell, managed to flank Howe's army, which was drawn up in the open for battle, by taking a path through a marshy area Howe {{believed}} was impassable. [...] Howe had previously ordered a scout to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> paths through the swamp, but Campbell's route, which was shown to the British commander by a slave, remained unknown to the Patriots. [...] Howe's position was otherwise strong and defensible, but the appearance of the British in the Patriot rear caused a panic. [...] The militia under Howe's command fled instantly, and more than 500 Patriots and Continental Army soldiers were killed or captured. [...] The ensuing defeat gave Savannah to the British, for which Howe received much blame. [...] On January 3, 1779, Howe formally relinquished his command to Lincoln.|$|E

This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, {{will be required to}} fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.|$|E
