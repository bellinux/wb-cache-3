25|$|On 5 April 2009, on {{day three}} of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand, he {{displayed}} an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid. Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight {{into the hands of}} a waiting Brendon McCullum. A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had been a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so.|$|E
25|$|The 2013 Big Ten season {{kicked off}} with the Purdue Boilermakers {{squaring}} {{off with the}} Wisconsin Badgers. Both teams started off a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> as they exchanged punts on their first possessions. After another Purdue punt the Badgers took over at their own 5-yard line. Just 8 plays and 95 yards later, Wisconsin got on the board first with a RB Melvin Gordon 5-yard touchdown run. After another Boilermakers three-and-out, the Badgers struck again as RB James White scored on 70-yard touchdown run. At {{the end of the}} first quarter the Badgers led 14–0. Purdue then got on the board on a broken play where QB Rob Henry scrambled for a 22-yard touchdown run. On the next Wisconsin drive, QB Joel Stave's pass was intercepted by CB Ricardo Allen and returned to the Wisconsin 10-yard line. The Badgers defense was able to hold the Boilermakers to a field goal to make the score 14–10 Wisconsin. The Badgers then marched right down the field and scored on a Milevin Gordon 27-yard touchdown run. After another Purdue three-and-out, the Badgers again moved the ball with ease against the Boilermaker defense but stalled out and settled for a 32-yard field goal by K Kyle French. Wisconsin led 24–10 at the half.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] is the twenty-second {{and final}} episode of The Simpsons fifth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on May 19, 1994. In the episode, Homer fears {{he may be a}} <b>little</b> <b>slow,</b> so he goes to the adult education center. While there, he decides to teach a class of his own on the secrets of a successful marriage, since that is the only class he is qualified to teach. However, to keep his students interested, he is forced to tell personal secrets about his wife Marge, which she dislikes, leading up to Homer getting kicked out of the house.|$|E

500|$|Western critics {{had a few}} complaints, {{but gave}} mostly {{positive}} reviews. The Chicago Tribune called the game [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> in spots, but, like Final Fantasy, worth your patience", and a [...] "good quest". The newspaper gave the game ratings of 8 out of 10 and 7 out of 10. German gaming magazine [...] gave the game a score of 78%, and praised it for showing potential for the Game Boy as the first role-playing game on the platform. IGN called The Final Fantasy Legend a [...] "compelling RPG with a complex gameplay system and a solid soundtrack", but complained about the game's difficulty and [...] "dated" [...] graphics. Allgame praised the title on its merits as a role-playing game, but criticized its high difficulty and lack {{of a sense of}} direction. 1UP's Retronauts described its gameplay as a successor to Final Fantasy IIs, though added that the systems involved were not properly refined until its sequel; they further stated that the randomness of the mutant and monster character classes made the game very difficult.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 8.5 out of 10, stating [...] "L.A. Noire may {{not reach the}} {{emotional}} heights of a game like Heavy Rain, but it's something everyone must try out. It reaches high and almost succeeds as a brilliant new type of video game narrative." [...] GameTrailers gave the game a 9.1 out of 10, concluding that [...] "L.A. Noire floors {{you out of the}} gate, loses some steam due to repetition, but eventually wins the day thanks to its subtlety, attention to detail, and stunning character interaction." [...] GameSpot's Carolyn Petit awarded the game a 9 out of 10, concluding that [...] "L.A. Noires absorbing investigations and intoxicating sense of style make it an unforgettable journey through the seamy side of the City of Angels." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8.5/10, stating [...] "The story is intriguing, albeit a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> at first. L.A. Noire takes an old school approach toward its storytelling. It’s a much slower approach, similar to older movies, with a heavy emphasis on detail. It is that attention to detail that sets L.A. Noire apart from other games and makes it enjoyable to play." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{received}} mixed critical reviews. TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist we grew to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're going to go through with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette really and truly on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the episode's overall storyline [...] "too juicy a landmine to not have the repercussions play out deliciously on this, the show’s last season." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his final}} University Match, Oxford batted first and Jardine's innings began after {{his team had}} lost two wickets without scoring any runs. He batted for 285 minutes, scoring 140. Before lunch, he played very {{carefully}} but increased his scoring rate afterwards. In total, he hit 21 fours and The Times described his innings as faultless. Wisden noted his strong defence and his powerful leg glance. Critics noted that he frequently hit Stanley Jackson to the leg side, a method of play which was unusual at the time. Players educated at Public School generally considered hitting to leg highly unorthodox and almost unfair. K. S. Ranjitsinhji, {{who was in the}} crowd at Lord's, would develop the leg glance and make it respectable within a few years, but he had not yet made his first-class debut in 1892. It is likely that Jardine {{was one of the first}} players to use this shot. Jackson refused to depart from the orthodox methods of the time, continuing to bowl with seven fielders on the off side and only two on the leg side, making it easier for Jardine to score runs.The Times commented that Cambridge [...] "appeared a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> to grasp the idea of putting a man on the leg side for [...] ". Jardine also hit 39 in the second innings as Oxford chased down a target to win for the only time in his University career. Jardine's first innings remained his only first-class century.|$|E
2500|$|Over the Top {{received}} minuscule network promotion (generally {{only small}} blurbs tacked onto {{the ends of}} commercials for Soul Man) and aired for three weeks with dismal ratings before being canceled (in some markets the final November 4 episode was bumped off the schedule unannounced for election coverage, and some TV Guide listings were a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> to catch up, citing the unaired episodes [...] "Who's Afraid of Simon Ferguson?" [...] and [...] "The Review" [...] in the weeks following the show's cancellation). [...] Production was instantly halted two episodes shy of the standard 13-episode order for a new series, and almost immediately following the show's cancellation, executive producers Mitchel Katlin and Nat Bernstein cried foul, blaming the Morton/Tarses breakup for {{the demise of the}} show.|$|E
2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of the corner of his eye and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 25 December Satono Diamond was matched against older {{opposition}} {{when he was}} one {{of sixteen}} horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama. He was made the 2.6/1 favourite ahead of the four-year-old Kitasan Black and the 2015 winner Gold Actor. The other runners included Sounds of Earth (second in 2015), Cheval Grand (Hanshin Daishoten, Copa Republica Argentina), Marialite (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Takarazuka Kinen) and Mikki Queen (Yushun Himba, Shuka Sho). Satono Diamond raced in mid-division on the outside as the Maltese Apogee set the pace from Kitasan Black. He moved up to third place entering the straight before producing a late burst of acceleration to overtake Kitasan Black well inside the last 100 metres and win by a neck with Gold Actor half a length away in third place. Lemaire said [...] "He is such an easy ride. He makes my job so easy. He was a <b>little</b> <b>slow</b> to react on the last turn. But he was so strong in front of goal.
