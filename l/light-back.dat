40|$|Galactic cirrus {{emission}} at far-infrared wavelengths affects many extragalactic observations. Separating this emission {{from that}} associated with extragalactic objects is both important and difficult. In this {{paper we discuss}} a particular case, the M 81 group, and the identification of diffuse structures prominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. The origin of these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them being the result of a past interaction between M 81 and M 82 or due to more local Galactic emission. We show that over an order of a few arcmin scales, the far-infrared (Herschel 250 ??m) emission correlates spatially very well with a particular narrow-velocity (2 ??? 3 km s??? 1) component of the Galactic H i. We find no evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with these features actually originates in the M 81 group. Thus we infer that the associated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic <b>light-back</b> scattered off dust in our galaxy. Ultraviolet observations pick out young stellar associations around M 81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. We consider in detail one of the Galactic cirrus features, finding that the far-infrared H i relation breaks down below arcmin scales and that at smaller scales there can be quite large dust-temperature variations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years gas {{combustion}} technology has undergone important innovations especially in residential heating appliances. In particular, requirements on low emissions together with load modulation has led to the use of premixed combustion technologies besides traditional diffusive flames. Constant demand for smaller overall dimensions and cost optimization has led to design combustion chambers with higher combustion intensity and this has led to premixed surface burners, then to radiant burners, and then to metallic mat burners in particular. With the metallic mat combustion flame front stabilizes above a metallic mat and at specific power loads is located inside. It differs from porous matrix combustion where combustion takes place inside a solid. If the initial calculations show that the convection heat exchange is not enough to establish the designed combustion intensity, the use of radiant burners becomes decisive. The radiative contribution of the mat is naturally predominant in the power range when flame develops within the mat itself. Apart from the radiative contribution, the metallic mat has others functions: it increases the operating margin with regards to flame lift-off and flashback that can happen with the variation in excess air and gas type like the <b>light-back</b> limit gas (as defined in EN 676). Metallic mat combustion is widely used in residential heating (at least in Europe) especially in those applica-tions where condensation is sought. It is also used in process applications like bread ovens, paint ovens and where a radiant load is required. In the following, metallic mat combustion technology will be described with special reference to metallic mat production technology and material selection. Next, testing for such technology and especially combustion testing will be presented. At the end some design issues regarding combustion chamber coupled with this tech-nology will be given...|$|E
