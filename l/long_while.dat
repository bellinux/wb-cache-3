The year {{is divided into two}} semester terms, and all courses are a semester <b>long.</b> <b>While</b> there is a suggested curriculum for each program, students are free to choose any classes to attend during a specific semester, and class attribution is done in the basis of grade average, with higher-graded students having priority when choosing classes.|$|E
5|$|Twin Peaks, an American serial drama {{television}} series created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, premiered on April 8, 1990, on the ABC Network in the United States and ended on June 10, 1991. The show spans 30 episodes over two seasons. The original pilot and season 2 premiere are 90 minutes <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> {{all the other}} episodes are approximately 45 minutes long. ABC canceled the series due to declining ratings in the second season.|$|E
5|$|His first post upon {{returning}} to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted {{for only a few}} months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from {{the fact that he did}} not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.|$|E

5|$|How {{great the}} glory of Origen was, appears {{from the fact that}} Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a <b>long</b> <b>while.</b> Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m <b>long</b> <b>while</b> some are {{as short as}} 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E

5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held {{before the race}} on Friday. The first session lasted 80 minutes <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> the second was 85 minutes long. Kurt Busch was quickest {{with a time of}} 26.366 seconds in the first session, more than five-tenths of a second faster than Jeff Burton. Denny Hamlin was just off Burton's pace, followed by Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski. Kasey Kahne was seventh, still within a second of Kurt Busch's time. Also in the session, Trevor Bayne collided into the wall, so the team had to go to their back-up car. In the second practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 26.454 seconds, only one-hundredth of a second quicker than second-placed David Ragan. Edwards took third place, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Greg Biffle and Martin. Newman only managed seventh place.|$|E
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The four lower cheekteeth—the fourth lower premolar (p4) {{and first}} through third lower molars (m1–m3)—are high-crowned teeth. Like the upper teeth, they bear four cusps (metaconid, protoconid, entoconid, and hypoconid), four lophs (metalophid, mesolophid, hypolophid, and posterolophid) and three valleys. Each {{of the lower}} cheekteeth lacks an {{additional}} loph, the ectolophid, which is present in Arikareeomys. The p4 is larger {{than any of the}} molars and longer than it is wide. Among the molars, m1 and m2 do not differ appreciably from each other and are a little wider than they are <b>long,</b> <b>while</b> m3 is a little smaller and its back side is more rounded and narrower. Syncline IV, which is located {{at the back of the}} tooth, between the hypolophid and posterolophid, is closed at the margins; this valley is open in Megapeomys bobwilsoni. Syncline IV also opens into the centrally located syncline III; this opening is absent in Arikareeomys. There are two roots under p4 and three under each of the molars, fewer than in Megapeomys bobwilsoni, which shows three under p4 and four under the molars.|$|E
