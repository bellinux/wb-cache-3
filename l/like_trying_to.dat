500|$|In November 1940, the German Luftwaffe began bombing Southampton, {{where the}} OS offices were located. Crawford removed {{some of the}} old OS maps and stored them in the garage of his house at Nursling, while also unsuccessfully urging the Director-General to remove the OS' archive of books, documents, maps and {{photographs}} to a secure location. Subsequently, the OS headquarters were destroyed in the bombing, resulting in the loss of most of their archive. The refusal of the OS administration to take his warnings seriously infuriated Crawford, exacerbating his anger about the civil service's red tape and bureaucracy. In his words, [...] "trying to get a move on in the Civil Service was <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> swim in a lake of glue".

Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E
500|$|Mike Masnick {{wrote about}} the case on Techdirt, commenting {{on the effect of}} Beck's actions on the meme's spread. He {{observed}} in retrospect it would have been advantageous for Beck to have simply done nothing rather than encourage the meme as a byproduct of his attempts to remove it from the Internet. Masnick pointed out that Beck's actions provided legitimacy to the meme's noteworthiness. Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in a Des Moines Register article: [...] "Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site is <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> eradicate Pueraria lobata the dreaded Kudzu vine that is eating the South." [...] Citizen Media Law Project observed Beck had exacerbated the situation by intimating legal tactics against Eiland-Hall, which served to increase the popularity of the meme and coverage of it among blogs.|$|E

[...] In their review of the album, Down Beat magazine criticized the song, but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa's masterpiece. [...] Lowe called it the [...] "crowning achievement of the album" [...] and [...] "one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced". [...] Zappa told Neil Slaven that {{he thought it was}} [...] "the best song on the album".

The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind the Spanish driver. Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher said [...] "I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fight with a blunted weapon....

500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of Variety {{thought that}} the film should have {{remained}} an episode of Tales from the Crypt.

[...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert, felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a [...] "two thumbs down" [...] rating on their TV show At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film's special effects as [...] "ugly, aggressive" [...] and [...] "proliferating", saying that [...] "trying to keep interested in [...] was <b>like</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [...] ear". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman's music score". The Austin Chronicles Joey O'Brien, said that although the screenplay was [...] "practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations", it [...] "switched gears" [...] too fast and too frequently that [...] "the audience is left struggling to catch up as [...] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1986, roughly 100 PBS {{stations}} carried The Mechanical Universe, and by {{the fall of}} 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional classroom or a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University.
