50|$|LinkExchange was {{a popular}} {{internet}} advertising cooperative, similar in function to a webring, originally known as Internet <b>Link</b> <b>Exchange</b> or ILE.|$|E
50|$|A <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> is a {{confederation}} of websites {{that operates}} similarly to a web ring. Webmasters register their web sites {{with a central}} organization, that runs the exchange, and in turn receive from the exchange HTML code which they insert into their web pages. In contrast to a web ring, where the HTML code simply comprises simple circular ring navigation hyperlinks, in a <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> the HTML code causes the display of banner advertisements, for the sites of {{other members of the}} exchange, on the member web sites, and webmasters have to create such banner advertisements for their own web sites.|$|E
5000|$|Engaging in <b>link</b> <b>exchanges</b> or paid <b>linking</b> {{activity}} is highly discouraged by Google and {{not recommended for}} webmasters seeking an advantage in search engine rankings. Google considers excessive <b>link</b> <b>exchanges</b> and <b>exchanging</b> reciprocal <b>links</b> [...] "Link Schemes" [...] and can suppress the linked site in search engine results or block in altogether.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} {{responded with}} a <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate on 17 October 1983.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} <b>link</b> <b>exchanges</b> was LinkExchange, {{a company that is}} now owned by Microsoft.|$|R
50|$|In error detection, {{normally}} the two {{ends of the}} <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> a very brief silence (e.g. a few microseconds for DS-SE), or a reset command {{and then try to}} reset and restore the link as if from power-up.|$|E
50|$|Interface {{electronics}} perform {{most of the}} packet-handling, routing, housekeeping and protocol management. Software is {{not needed}} for these tasks. When there is an error, the two ends of a <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> an interval of silence or a reset, and then restart the protocol as if from power-up.|$|E
50|$|ITU-T G.998.3 (Multi-pair bonding using {{time-division}} inverse multiplexing) specification, a.k.a. G.Bond/TDIM, {{defines a}} symmetric aggregation protocol, {{in which both}} sides of a point-to-point <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> information about the aggregation, so there's no need for a separate header. G.Bond/TDIM is optimized for both Time-Division Multiplexing and packet traffic with less than 3% overhead (estimation for Ethernet traffic, including Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) encapsulation).|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{reserves of}} Hong Kong and {{the banking system}} are important underpinnings of the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate system.|$|R
50|$|Since 1983, the <b>linked</b> <b>{{exchange}}</b> rate {{system is}} a unique type of exchange rate regime used for the Hong Kong dollar to be pegged with the United States dollar at a fixed rate of HK$7.80 = US$1. In this unique <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate system, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) authorises the three note-issuing banks (HSBC, Bank of China and Standard Chartered) to issue new banknotes provided that they deposit an equivalent value of United States dollars with the HKMA.|$|R
50|$|It is {{included}} the <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate System and noticeable {{features such as}} the Aggregate Balance, Certificates of Indebtedness and coins issued and the Outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and Notes.|$|R
50|$|A {{reciprocal}} link is {{a mutual}} link between two objects, commonly between two websites, to ensure mutual traffic. For example, Alice and Bob have websites. If Bob's website links to Alice's website and Alice's website links to Bob's website, the websites are reciprocally linked. Website owners often submit their sites to reciprocal <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> directories {{in order to}} achieve higher rankings in the search engines. Reciprocal linking between websites is no longer {{an important part of the}} search engine optimization process. In 2005, with their Jagger 2 update, Google stopped giving credit to reciprocal links as it does not indicate genuine link popularity.|$|E
5000|$|On the World Wide Web, a {{link farm}} is {{any group of}} web sites that all {{hyperlink}} to every other site in the group. In graph theoretic terms, a link farm is a [...] clique. Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A link farm {{is a form of}} spamming the index of a web search engine (sometimes called spamdexing). Other <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites and are not considered a form of spamdexing.|$|E
40|$|Parallel web {{crawling}} {{is an important}} technique employed by large-scale search engines for content acquisition. A commonly used inter-processor coordination scheme in parallel crawling systems is the <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> scheme, where discovered links are communicated between processors. This scheme can attain the coverage and quality level of a serial crawler while avoiding redundant crawling of pages by different processors. The main problem in the exchange scheme is the high inter-processor communication overhead. In this work, we propose a hypergraph model that reduces the communication overhead associated with <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> operations in parallel {{web crawling}} systems by intelligent assignment of sites to processors. Our hypergraph model can correctly capture and minimize the number of network messages exchanged between crawlers. We evaluate the performance of our models on four benchmark datasets. Compared to the traditional hash-based assignment approach, significant performance improvements are observed in reducing the inter-processor communication overhead. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited...|$|E
40|$|The <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> {{rate was}} {{implemented}} in 1983. This paper finds that over these 32 years, this system did bring lots of benefits to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, as Hong Kong is a vastly different place now relative {{to what it}} was 32 years ago, the costs for the adoption of the link outweigh the benefits so this system is no longer suitable for Hong Kong. It is suggested that in order to serve the best interest of Hong Kong, it should not maintain the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate system and should switch to the managed floating exchange rate system...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Link</b> <b>exchanges</b> have {{advantages}} and disadvantages {{from the point of}} view of those using the World Wide Web for marketing. On the one hand, they have the advantages of bringing in a highly targeted readership (for <b>link</b> <b>exchanges</b> where all members of the exchange have similar web sites), of increasing the [...] "link popularity" [...] of a site with Web search engines, and of being relatively stable methods of hyperlinking. On the other hand, they have the disadvantages of potentially distracting visitors away to other sites before they have fully explored the site that the original link was on.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{performance}} of the Hong Kong dollar <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system since the introduction of the three refinements to it in May 2005. It presents an analytical framework which argues that, in a fully credible exchange rate target zone regime, the spot exchange rate normally stays inside the band but does not have a natural tendency to converge towards the centre of the zone. While a certain level of interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar may persist, it should not grow significantly larger than what is implied by the width of the Convertibility Zone. Judged against this framework, the developments since May 2005 point to increased credibility of the refined <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Accessing {{the large}} volume of {{information}} that {{is available on the}} Web is more important than ever before. Search engines are the primary means to help users find the content they need. To suggest the most closely related and the most popular web pages for a user’s query, search engines assign a ranking to each web page, which typically increases with the number and ranking of other websites that link to this page. However, link spammers have developed several techniques to exploit this algorithm and improve the ranking of their web pages. These techniques are commonly based on underground forums for collaborative link exchange; building a relationship network among spammers to favor their web pages in search engine results. In this study, we provide a systematic analysis of the spam <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> performed through 15 Search Engine Optimization (SEO) forums. We design a system, which is able to capture the activity of link spammers in SEO forums, identify spam <b>link</b> <b>exchange,</b> and visualize the link spam ecosystem. The outcomes of this study shed light on a different aspect of link spamming that is the collaboration among spammers. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{results show}} that after {{the introduction of the}} three refinements to the <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system in May 2005 the Hong Kong dollar follows a bounded process that is consistent with a fully credible exchange rate band. The bounded process will limit the movements of the exchange rate to between the strong- and weak-side limits because its variance vanishes at the Convertibility Undertakings making it inaccessible to the limits. The Hong Kong dollar does not show any strong tendency to revert towards the centre of the Convertibility Zone. This is perhaps not surprising as there have been no interventions in the foreign exchange market since May 2005. There may be few forces or incentives for market participants to drive the exchange rate towards 7. 80. <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system, target zone, mean reversion, bounded process...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{adoption}} in 1983 the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate {{system has been}} widely accepted by professionals in the financial sector as a key stabilizing factor for Hong Kong {{in the run-up to}} 1997. In fact, the operation of the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate system can be said to have exceeded initial expectations. Apart from the rather large interest rate swings during the first few weeks of operation, interest rates in Hong Kong have been surprisingly stable. Contrary to expectations, {{there is no evidence that}} the link with the US dollar has led to larger interest rate fluctuations. However, the fact that the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate system has functioned satisfactory from 1983 till now is not a sufficient reason for us to stick to the system with no reservation. As pointed out by Takagi, the benefit of maintaining stability against the linked currency must be comparted with the cost of greater fluctuation vis-a-vis other currencies. Moreover, the maintenance of a fixed link means that the country concerned is giving up an important tool for stabilization in the face of a major external shock. The next Section will examine some of the potential problems under the existing <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate framework. In Section III, I shall discuss the proposal of linking the Hong Kong dollar to a basket of currencies. I shall argue that effective linking of the Hong Kong dollar to a basket of currencies can be achieved by the judicious readjustment of the HK dollar—US dollar link on regular basis. Section IV will argue that the proposal in Section III is only a second-best policy under the constraint of imperfect information. The first best policy is not linking the domestic currency to any fixed basket of currencies but rather continuous relinking to the US dollar (or any other major currency) to achieve full employment. In Section V, I contend that adoption of such a rule by all the small economies of the world would automatically result in a high level of international economic coordination...|$|R

40|$|Currently, most of {{the online}} social {{networks}} (OSN) keep their data secret and in centralized manner. Researchers are allowed to crawl the underlying social graphs (and data) but with limited rates, leading to only partial views of the true social graphs. To overcome this constraint, we may start from user perspective, the contributors of the OSNs. More precisely, if users cautiously collaborate with one another, they can use the very infrastructure of the OSNs to exchange noisy friend lists with their neighbors in several rounds. In the end, they can build local subgraphs, also called local views of the true social graph. In this paper, we propose such protocols for the problem of private <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> over social graphs. The problem is unique {{in the sense that}} the disseminated data over the links are the links themselves. However, there exist fundamental questions about the feasibility of this model. The first question is how to define simple and effective privacy concepts for the <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> processes. The second question comes from the high volume of link lists in exchange which may increase exponentially round after round. While storage and computation complexity may be affordable for desktop PCs, communication costs are non-trivial. We address both questions by a simple (α,β) -exchange using Bloom filters...|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, I {{would argue}} that Hong Kong’s recent {{inflation}} is of the “cost-push” category, that it is to a degree self-inflicted, and moreover, that it is triggering a structural adjustment that will have long-term implications on the Hong Kong society. I would urge that the Hong Kong government should make a strong effort to hold back inflation, even if this means a temporary running down of our fiscal reserves. Section II will describe how inflation has evolved over the 1991 to 1995 period. Section III argues that demand-pull inflation, under the <b>linked</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regime, will not cause serious problems for Hong Kong.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{significance}} of Mainland-related shocks in determining Hong Kong money market interest rates after controlling for the influences of US variables. Analysis using a vector auto-regression model suggests that an unexpected rise in the Mainland policy interest rate, or a higher-than-expected growth in Mainland output or money supply, in general produces a positive and hump-shaped effect on the three-month HIBOR. Forecast error variance decomposition shows that US shocks still dominate, but Mainland shocks have become more important in accounting for the unexpected fluctuations in HIBOR in recent years. A historical decomposition shows that from autumn 2003 to spring 2005 the large negative spread between HIBOR and LIBOR was mainly due to Mainland factors. Thus, while the HIBOR-LIBOR spread {{is expected to be}} bounded inside a band that reflects the width of the Convertibility Zone of the <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system, Mainland-related shocks could exert a significant influence on the actual size of the spread.
