5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their <b>love</b> <b>to</b> be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{the truth}} is, Lillie {{would have been}} quite {{astonished}} to have been told this. She, and many other women, suppose that they love their husbands, when, unfortunately, they have not {{the beginning of an}} idea what love is. Let me explain it to you, my dear lady. <b>Loving</b> <b>to</b> be admired by a man, <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> be petted by him, <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> be caressed by him, and <b>loving</b> <b>to</b> be praised by him, is not loving a man. All these may be when a woman has no power of loving at all,--they may all be simply because she loves herself, and <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> be flattered, praised, caressed, coaxed; as a cat likes to be coaxed and stroked, and fed with cream, and have a warm corner.|$|R

5|$|During the {{production}} of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the script of Barfi!. The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. He said that the script required a 30-year time span for the characters' <b>love</b> <b>to</b> grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded <b>love</b> <b>to</b> display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E

5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence.

They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey.

The two agents arrive at the synagogue to find Ariel and the creature exchanging wedding vows. After an intense fight, in which Jacob and Mulder are both wounded, Ariel declares her love for Isaac and returns the creature to dust.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829.

Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true <b>love</b> <b>to</b> protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
