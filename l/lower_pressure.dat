5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to <b>lower</b> <b>pressure,</b> lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|Because both {{methanol}} {{and carbon}} monoxide are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long {{appeared to be}} attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a cobalt catalyst, was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based catalyst (cis−−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> with almost no by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst (−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. This iridium-catalyzed Cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{hurricane}} brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.30inHg) was recorded, though a <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> {{may have occurred}} on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with {{the hurricane}} flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000.|$|E
5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that a cuff with a wider bladder occludes blood flow at a <b>lower</b> <b>pressure</b> level than a cuff with a {{narrower}} bladder.
