40|$|Novel {{low-power}} circuits {{based on}} low swing voltage technique, {{in the internal}} nodes of bus architectures, are proposed. Different classes of driver/receiver and repeater circuits are presented. They are implemented on conventional CMOS technology. The proposed technique is based on inserting a variable number of MOSFET transistors in the driver circuits, causing variable low swing voltage levels in {{the output of the}} driver circuits. In order to re-pull up the low swing voltage to full swing, innovated high-speed, crosscoupled <b>latch</b> <b>voltage</b> receiver circuits are proposed. In applications having high load capacitance due to long interconnections, novel repeater circuits, based also on low swing voltage technique, are introduced. The difference between the values of threshold voltage of the nMOS transistor and the pMOS transistors is exploited to decrease the power dissipation. The effect of the proposed technique in noise margins is also analysed...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{modeling and}} {{experimental study of}} the zenithal bistable liquid crystal device is presented. A dynamic Landau de Gennes theory of nematic liquid crystals is solved numerically to model the electric field induced latching of the device {{and the results are}} compared with experimental measurements and theoretical approximations. The study gives a clear insight into the latching mechanism dynamics and enables the dependence of the device latching on both material parameters and surface shape to be determined. Analytical approximation highlights a route to optimize material selection in terms of <b>latching</b> <b>voltages</b> and the numerical model, which includes an accurate surface representation, recovers the complex surface shape effects. Predictions of device performance are presented as a function of both surface anchoring strength and surface shape and grating pitch. A measurement of the homeotropic anchoring energy has been undertaken by comparing the voltage response as a function of cell gap; we find the homeotropic anchoring energies can be varied in the range 0. 5 to 4 (10 - 44 J m- 2) ...|$|R

Two TBJs and two in-plane gates are laterally integrated in a high-electron-mobility InGaAs/InP quantum-well material by a single-step lithography process. Electrical measurements {{reveal that the}} integrated device functions as a set-reset (SR) <b>latch</b> with <b>voltage</b> gains at room temperature. The demonstrated device provides a new and simple circuit design for SR latches in digital electronics...|$|R
5000|$|Later AT (so-called [...] "Baby AT") and LPX style {{computer}} {{cases had}} a power button that was {{directly connected to}} the system computer power supply (PSU). The general configuration was a double-pole <b>latching</b> mains <b>voltage</b> switch with the four pins connected to wires from a four-core cable. The wires were either soldered to the power button (making it difficult to replace the power supply if it failed) or blade receptacles were used.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>latch</b> style <b>voltage</b> mode sense amplifiers {{for operation}} in the sub-threshold region, where VDD<VT. We show that the offset gets worse relative to strong inversion as technology scales. Furthermore, increasing the sizes of devices in the sense amplifier does not yield the reduction of input referred offset according to 1 /(WL) 0. 5 that is achieved for strong inversion operation. We analyze {{the source of the}} offset and propose circuit level operating principles for minimizing its impact in sub-threshold SAs. This design methodology will optimize sub-VT SAs for more robust ultra low power operation. 1...|$|R

We propose a modeling methodology which is not tied to a specific topology such as Monte Carlo simulation. To generate failure analysis, we sampled the probability domain and reconstructed the probability density function...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{presents}} a novel idea for analog current comparison which compares input signal current and reference currents with high speed, low power and well controlled hysteresis. Proposed circuit {{is based on}} current mirror and <b>voltage</b> <b>latching</b> techniques which produces rail to rail output voltage {{as a result of}} current comparison. The same design can be extended to a simple current comparator without hysteresis (or very less hysteresis), where comparator gives high accuracy (less than 50 nA) and speed at the cost of moderate power consumption. The comparators are designed optimally and studied at 180 nm CMOS process technology for a supply voltage of 3 V...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — High speed {{devices such}} as ADC, {{operational}} amplifier are of great importance and for this high speed application a major thrust is given towards low power methodologies. Reduction of power consumption in these device {{can be achieved by}} moving towards smaller feature size processes. Now ADC requires lesser power dissipation, low noise, better slew rate,high speed etc. Dynamic comparator are being used in today's A/D converters extensively because these comparator are high speed,consumes lesser power dissipation,having zero static power consumption and provide full-swing digital level output voltage in shorter time duration. Back to back inverter in these dynamic comparator provides positive feedback mechanism which convert a smaller voltage difference in full scale digital level output. A pre-amplifier based comparator can amplify a small input voltage difference to a large enough voltage to overcome the <b>latch</b> offset <b>voltage</b> and also can reduce the kickback noise. However the pre-amplifier based comparator suffer large static power consumption {{as well as from the}} reduced intrinsic gain with the reduction of the drain to source resistance due to continuous technology scaling. In this paper a delay analysis has been presented for different dynamic comparators and finally a proposed designed has been given where delay has been reduced 264 Ps and average power dissipation has been reduced to 1. 09 µw. The above design has been simulated in 180 nm technology with a supply voltage of 0. 8...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{analyzing}} bit error rates (BERs) for SFQ circuits and their outputs at GHz speeds will be presented. This method {{was used to}} test four- and six-bit pseudorandom code generators. The code generators were operated in free-run mode, i. e., without a synchronization (Reset) pulse. This enabled us to conduct BER testing to much lower levels than when the code generator is operated in Reset mode. The SFQ circuit output was amplified with a superconducting output <b>latch</b> to give <b>voltage</b> levels suitable for display on a sampling scope. The GHz output data was analyzed by external computer software; this permitted extended tests without user supervision. With the code generators operating in free-run mode, they routinely gave bit error rates (BERs) in the 10 - 11 range; the best BER recorded was 1. 1 * 10 - 13 (2 errors in ~ 2. 5 hours) at 2 GHz. We have successfully tested these code generators at frequencies in excess of 3. 5 GHz with BERs in the 10 - 10 range as well. I. INTRODUCT [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient means of synchronizing and pipelining asynchronous circuits implemented using differential cascode voltage switch logic (DCVSL) precharged function blocks. A {{modified version of}} this logic, called LDCVSL (<b>latch</b> differential cascode <b>voltage</b> switch logic), {{which is similar to}} the LCDL (latched CMOS differential logic), or DCVSL with NORA-latch, is used to improve the storage capability of the precharged function blocks. Improving the storage capability of the building blocks allows the design of an efficient pipeline scheme which is described in detail. Following a description of its potential performance, the pipeline scheme is applied to the design of self-timed rings. It is shown that more compact ring structures can be obtained without loss of performance. Our design methodology is then presented. It is based on the use of a private asynchronous standard cell library, fully compatible with an existing CMOS standard cell library provided by the foundry. Our approach allows the rapid design of standard cell based asynchronous circuits. Finally, both the pipeline scheme and design approach are illustrated through the design of a 32 -b self-timed ring divider. The division algorithm is first briefly presented. The chip architecture is then described with the results obtained after fabrication. The test chip has been fabricated using the CNET/SGS-Thomson 0. 5 mu m three metal layer technology. The 0. 7 mm/sup 2 / chip computes 32 -b divisions in 101 ns with a power consumption of 30 mW at a throughput of 10 million operations per second...|$|R
