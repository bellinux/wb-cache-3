This thesis documents licensed driver response to, interpretation of, and perceived urgency of response to freeway lane control signals (more s. pacifically to the yellow X and yellow diagonal arrow) when displayed in a scene depicting a three-lane freeway section containing a <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> array. Each of the arrays tested consisted of some combination of freeway <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> symbols which included one of the candidate yellow symbols, at least one green down arrow, and either one or no red X. The response offered most frequently by survey subjects when asked what they would do if travelling in the lane below any of the candidate yellow symbols was "move to the lane with the green arrow". However, it was observed that subject responses to the yellow diagonal arrow varied less than those to the yellow X when the red X was introduced into the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> array. Regarding subject interpretation of the candidate yellow symbols, the meaning offered most frequently by survey subjects was "lane closed, blocked, or closing". The second most frequent interpretation of both candidate yellow symbols when shown with green down arrows only was "lane ends physically"; however, introduction of the red X into the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> array altered subject perception, and "lane is congested" became the second most popular meaning. Although the average median distance to the lane change maneuver was identical for both the yellow X and yellow diagonal arrow, subjects' perceived urgency of response to both candidate yellow symbols were similar regarding subjects' introduction of the red X into the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> array. However, this affect was more pronounced for subjects viewing the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> array containing the yellow X. While results for the two candidate yellow symbols were similar regarding subjects' interpretation and perceived urgency of response, analysis of their indicated reaction revealed an interesting difference. Subjects viewing the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> arrays containing the yellow X were more likely to indicate a reaction considered "incorrect" given the intended use of the candidate yellow symbols than they were when viewing the arrays with the yellow diagonal arrow...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike regular traffic lights, <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> {{either have}} one face each to {{indicate}} all lane conditions (the so-called [...] "searchlight" [...] configuration), or separate faces for each condition (as illustrated). <b>Lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> {{of the latter}} type are usually placed horizontally. Signals that may indicate other conditions for roads without counterflow lanes also exist, {{such as those that}} indicate different speed limits for different lanes.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> {{are used}} on many toll plazas to {{indicate}} the open/closed status of toll lanes. Many older toll plazas use conventional circular red and green indications {{to indicate the}} open and closed status of toll lanes, however, the use of circular red and green signals for this purpose is now non-compliant in the 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic <b>Control</b> Devices, with <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> being the preferred indicator. The reason for discouraging the use of circular red and green signals for indicating the open and closed status of toll lanes is due to their use being contrary to their traditional definitions of stop and go.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> {{around the}} world follow their own {{universal}} pattern, as specified in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. Typical signals include a green downward arrow, used to indicate a lane which is open to traffic facing the signal, a red cross, which indicates a lane is either reserved for opposing traffic or closed to traffic in both directions, and a flashing amber circle, arrow or cross, indicating to traffic facing the signal to immediately clear the lane.|$|R
25|$|The A38(M) {{motorway}} (also {{known as}} the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> allow for 4 lanes in and 2 {{out in the morning}} rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.|$|R
2500|$|Traffic {{patterns}} on the bridge's five lanes can be adjusted via its <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> system, which consists of overhead <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> on both spans and approaches. Typically, the two lanes on the south-most span are configured for vehicles traveling east on eastbound US50/US301, while the three lanes on the north-most span are configured for vehicles traveling west on westbound US50/US301; the spans are therefore {{referred to as the}} [...] "eastbound span" [...] and [...] "westbound span", respectively. However, this pattern is adjusted during incidents or peak travel times: for instance, on the outset of weekends when there is a high volume of beach-bound traffic, one lane on the westbound span is configured for eastbound traffic.|$|R
40|$|Queue warning’s basic {{principle}} is to inform travelers {{of the presence}} of downstream stop-and-go traffic (based on real-time traffic detection) using warning signs and flashing lights. Drivers can anticipate an upcoming situation of emergency braking and slow down, avoid erratic behavior, and reduce queuing-related collisions. Dynamic message signs (DMS) show a symbol or word when stop-and-go traffic is near. Variable speed limits and <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> that provide incident management capabilities can be combined with queue warning. The system can be automated or controlled by a traffic management center operator. Work zones also benefit from queue warning with portable dynamic message sign units placed upstream of expected queue points...|$|R
50|$|In the Australian {{state of}} Victoria, {{green and yellow}} are {{replaced}} by white, {{and there may be}} additional modes such as 'Centre lane turns only' at particular times of the day. On Jarvis Street in Toronto, Edmonton and some other jurisdictions in Canada the <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are employed without the use of an amber warning signal. Instead, the lane that is to undergo the direction reversal (the middle lane of a 5 lane downtown street) is marked with a red cross in both directions {{for a short period of}} time. This allows time for the lane to clear of traffic before a green arrow permits traffic in the reversed direction. However, Jarvis Street was converted to a 4-lane arterial with bicycle lanes in 2009, and was converted back to a 5 lane road in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began on}} March 31, 1937. After {{one and a}} half years and a cost of $5,873,837.17 (CAD), it opened to traffic on November 14, 1938. On May 29, 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth presided over the {{official}} opening during a royal visit to Canada. A toll of 25 cents was charged for each car. On January 20, 1955, the Guinness family sold the bridge to the province for $5,959,060, and on April 1, 1963 the toll was removed. The newly constructed bridge differed from the current configuration of the bridge as it originally had only two lanes. Yet, as had been foreseen, West Vancouver’s population boomed {{as a result of the}} new connection. Thus, to accommodate the increased population, the lanes were divided into three with the middle lane acting as a passing lane. Eventually overhead <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> were installed, enabling traffic in the centre lane to be directed in either direction, and facilitating emergency vehicle access by closing off the center lane.|$|R
5000|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Lake Washington Floating Bridge, the {{original}} bridge was built under a 1 1/2-year contract awarded to the Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company (the project was led by engineer Peter John Jensen) {{in the amount of}} $3,254,000. It included a movable span that could be retracted into a pocket {{in the center of the}} fixed span to permit large boats to pass. This design resulted in a roadway [...] "bulge" [...] that required vehicles to swerve twice across polished steel joints as they passed the bulge. A reversible lane system, indicated by lighted overhead <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> with arrow and 'X' signs, compounded the hazard by putting one lane of traffic on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the bulge at different times of day in an effort to alleviate rush-hour traffic into or out of Seattle. There were many serious collisions on the bridge. The problems grew worse as the traffic load increased over the years and far outstripped the designed capacity. Renovation or replacement was essential and a parallel bridge, the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, was completed in 1989. The bridge opened just one day after the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows Bridge.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis documents the results of a laboratory study designed to evaluate and compare the glance legibility distance of commercially available freeway <b>Lane</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Signals</b> (LCS). Two prototype fiber-optic <b>lane</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> were evaluated to determine their suitability for freeway-lane-control-signing applications. The LCS used in the study were obtained from C. J. Hood, Inc., and Electro Fiberoptics, Inc. This study emphasized the visibility of the standard LCS displays (their ability to be detected and recognized) rather than their comprehension (their ability to be understood by a majority of the drivers). For this, glance legibility distance was used as a Measure of Effectiveness (MOE). It is the distance at which the sign catches the attention of a driver in a limited time of exposure. The glance legibility was evaluated and compared for the corresponding symbols displayed by the two signs. An attempt was made to correlate the difference in legibility to the differences in sign design characteristics. Also evaluated was the sensitivity of glance legibility to the gender and age of the subject. The glance legibility distances of the symbols displayed by the two signals were analyzed for their compliance with the MUTCD guidelines. Glance legibility of "Red X", "Yellow X", and "Green Arrow" displayed by the two signs was found to be in the ranges of 750 - 950 feet, 800 - 1000 feet, and 1200 - 1400 feet respectively. The size of the sign, brightness of the display, and the pixel arrangement were found to be the main design characteristics that have a direct bearing on the legibility of the displays. Brightness of the sign is a greater determinant than the color of the display. Significant differences exist between the color versus symbol recognition distances. The signal displays were visible but not legible. The glance legibility does not depend upon the gender of the driver; however, significant differences in legibility of displays were found to exist between the younger and the older age groups. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding and utilization of LCS systems and will promote more uniformity in the design, installation, and operation of LCS systems in the most cost effective manner possible; however, further research needs to be done as regards the factors contributing to the effective visibility of freeway LCS. In summary, {{there is a need to}} make an in-depth study of the interrelationships between the LCS hardware elements (e. g. the light intensities, symbol displays, color combinations etc), geometric features and traffic conditions, mounting characteristics, and driver limitations so as to promote more uniformity in the application of LCS to freeway traffic management...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{interactive}} PC-based STISIM {{driving simulator}} {{was used to}} test the effectiveness of Intelligent <b>Lane</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Signals</b> (ILCS). The participants were 160 licensed drivers from four age groups: 18 - 24, 32 - 47, 55 - 65, and 70 + years of age. Each participant drove three times in a counterbalanced order. In each trial, after driving five miles in the center lane of a six-lane highway where the speed limit was 65 mph, they encountered five sets of ILCSs that occurred at half-mile intervals. These ILCSs presented (1) 45 -mph speed limit messages; (2) 35 -mph speed limit messages; (3) a yellow lane closure warning; (4) one of three merge messages that used a diagonal arrow, or words, or dynamic chevrons to indicate that drivers should move from the center lane; (5) a red lane closure warning. Analysis of lane position data showed that the diagonal arrow merge sign was the most effective; participants moved from the center lane 266 feet before reaching the diagonal arrow merge sign, 123 feet before reaching the dynamic arrow merge sign, and 54 feet before the merge sign with words. Analysis of driving speed data indicated that the speed limit signs were effective. Before the 45 -mile speed limit was visible, participants drove at 63 mph. When the 45 -mph speed limit was visible, they reduced speed by approximately 10 mph. Then on the approach to the 35 -mph speed limit, they reduced speed by a further 14 mph—on average, they were driving at 38. 7 mph shortly after passing the 35 -mph speed limit.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical-empirical model for estimating the total approach capacity at signalized intersections with of shared-short lanes. This model extends the theoretical capacity formula for shared-short lanes at unsignalized intersection, which {{was introduced by}} the author earlier, to signalized intersections. The model {{takes into account the}} stochastic nature of traffic flow and the effect of queue blockage to the short turn lanes. Using the simulation package VISSIM, a comprehensive database was generated for calibrating the model under different <b>lane</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> conditions. The proposed model can be used for arbitrary lane and signal timing configurations. For signalized intersections with simple shared-short lane configurations, explicit equations are given.

30|$|We {{design the}} MDs by {{explicitly}} exploiting the layered {{construction of the}} <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> In particular, we first generate a quantized control vector based {{on the principles of}} PPC. This vector contains the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and N− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Then, we construct M descriptions based on this control vector. The descriptions are constructed so that the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and J− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be obtained by combining any subset of J∈{ 1,, M} descriptions. Thus, the more packets that are received at the plant, the more future plant predictions become available. Note that on reception of at least one packet out of the M packets, the current quantized <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> can be completely recovered at the plant input side. When receiving and combining more descriptions, the quality of this <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is not improved. Instead new <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> become available. With this approach, we thus avoid the issue of having to guarantee stability subject to a probabilistic and time-varying accuracy of the <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Instead, we can use ideas from quantized PPC, when assessing the stability. A detailed design of the MDs is provided in Section 4.|$|R

The results imply that popular controller design methods implicitly take <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> properties into consideration...|$|R
40|$|An {{interface}} logic circuit permitting {{the transfer of}} information between two computers having asynchronous clocks is disclosed. The information transfer involves utilization of <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> (including request, return-response, ready) to generate properly timed data strobe signals. Noise problems are avoided because each <b>control</b> <b>signal,</b> upon receipt, is verified by at least two clock pulses at the receiving computer. If <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are verified, a data strobe pulse is generated to accomplish a data transfer. Once initiated, the data strobe signal is properly completed independently of signal disturbances in the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> initiating the data strobe signal.

30|$|The model {{predictive}} controller (MPC) utilizes a {{model of}} a system (under control) to predict the system’s response to a <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> Using the predicted response, the <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are attuned until the target response is achieved, and then, the <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are applied. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, this model can be used to predict the path of the vehicle. If the predicted path does not match the reference or target path, adjustments are made to the <b>control</b> <b>signals,</b> until the two paths are within an acceptable range.|$|R
40|$|Multi-damped-oscillation <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> {{are applied}} {{in this study}} for, active noise control (ANC) in an {{acoustic}} duct. Feedback active noise controllers that can generate damped-oscillation <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are designed by using an internal model-based linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) design technique.

40|$|A Terahertz Optical Asymmetric Demultiplexer (TOAD) having preferably two {{non-linear}} elements (NLES) {{in which}} the extinction ratio is enhanced by saturating both NLEs when closing a switching window. A data signal input on one port of the TOAD is split onto two optical paths, each including one NLE. The optical paths converge at an output port.
