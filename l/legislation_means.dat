50|$|When, in {{the opinion}} of the House of Representatives, a Senate-introduced bill that raises revenue or appropriates money is passed by the Senate and sent to the House for its consideration, the House places a blue slip on the {{legislation}} that notes the House's constitutional prerogative and immediately returns it to the Senate without taking further action. This blue-slipping procedure, done by an order of the House, is routinely completed to enforce its interpretation that the House is the sole body to introduce revenue or appropriations legislation. The failure of the House to consider the <b>legislation</b> <b>means</b> it cannot become a law. This tactic is historically of great use to the House and, as a practical matter, the Senate does not introduce tax or revenue measures to avoid a blue slip.|$|E

Household food insecurity in South Africa is at unacceptable levels. This paper reviews the country’s agricultural legislative framework {{in terms of}} food security {{and the right to}} food. The review found that South African agricultural policies do not actively promote food security and the lack of enforceable food security policy makes it difficult to coordinate existing policies. The lack of food security <b>legislation</b> <b>means</b> that the right to food has no enforceable framework.

40|$|In Australia, {{there is}} no binding {{protocol}} that proscribes the processes by which the release of personal records of adults {{who grew up in}} care occurs.

Drawing on qualitative in-depth interviews with a group of Australian care-leavers, this paper discusses their experiences of accessing personal records. Accessing these records was often highly significant to identity formation, but could produce both positive and negative effects. The negative aspects of the records were that, typically, at least in part, they were incomplete, insulting, incorrect and/or incomprehensible. Currently, the range of support provided to those accessing their records varies significantly across agencies. The findings of this research suggest the need for the greater provision of supported release and the implications for social work practice are discussed...|$|E
