40|$|This article {{examines}} how Dutch citizens with long-term care needs have used existing legal opportunities {{to respond to}} cuts in publicly financed care. Unexpectedly, most did not make use {{of their right to}} appeal the reduction or elimination of their previous entitlements, even when this led to marked problems in daily life. Thirty interviews with disabled and elderly persons and their care-givers revealed that specific social norms on how to feel about the cuts inhibited the <b>lodging</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeals.</b> Given the new policy's stated intention of preserving care for the most needy, many affected clients felt they had no right to be angry. Despite their (often objectively warranted) grievances, they did not appeal as breaking with the new moral code would trigger feelings of shame - of not being autonomous, of demanding too much when others are worse off, and of appearing ungrateful...|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} June 2010, six <b>appeals</b> <b>of</b> the {{decision}} had been lodged with the Environment Court. Central Plains Water Trust <b>lodged</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>appeals</b> as applicant in order to change some consent conditions which limit the taking of water to 12 hours a day. Christchurch City Council's appeal was because it considered to much water would be taken from the Waimakariri River which may affect Christchurch's water supply. Fish and Game's appeal was motivated by concern over the Waimakariri River take and 'inadequate' fish screening conditions.

5000|$|On 21 May 2013, the Social Christian Party (SCP) <b>lodged</b> an <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the National Council's {{decision}} in the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil. The party alleged that the Council had committed an abuse of power and that legalising same-sex marriage was a matter exclusively for the legislature to decide. The appeal {{did not affect the}} Council's original {{decision in}} favour of same-sex marriage. On 30 May 2013, the Supreme Federal Court rejected the appeal on technical grounds, stating that the SCP had used the wrong form <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> The Court held that the National Council's decision could only be challenged through a [...] "direct action for unconstitutionality" [...] (ação direta de inconstitucionalidade) rather than an action for injunction (mandado de segurança). On 6 June 2013, the SCP re-lodged the appeal. On 28 August 2013, the Procuradoria Geral da República (Attorney General) forwarded to the Supreme Court an opinion in favor of same-sex marriage in Brazil. Given the National Council ruling was issued by the council's president, who was also the Chief Justice of the Supreme Federal Court, it is unlikely the latter court would ever overturn the council's ruling.|$|R
40|$|The {{concern of}} the study is to {{document}} and evaluate the development control process in Zimbabwe. Development control is an interventionist tool used by government to regulate development. This regulatory mechanism has been criticised mostly by developers. The planning environment in Zimbabwe has been and is changing. It is time to take stock and there may be need to improve on it. This study is a step towards critically understanding our planning system through analysing planning appeals. This has been achieved through documenting a brief history of development control. This history gives a background to an analytical view of applications for planning permission that were brought before the Administrative Court. Historical developments are traced to bring out the institutions involved; the reasons why some of the planning standards in use today are as they are. Changes that have taken place over the time are revealed. Planning appeals often go unnoticed and receive very little coverage in any form of the media. The control of development, controversial as it is, worries the users mostly. For many citizens in Zimbabwe control of development is not a major issue because they seem to take physical development as given by government. This thesis looks at the handling of planning permission applications by the LPA and the Administrative Court to check whether government laws and regulations are followed. The process is evaluated through analysing applications that went through the LPA and turned into appeals at the Administrative Court. The findings under the history of development control and the planning appeals chapters lead to conclusions about development control and planning appeals. It is hoped that specific studies on planning appeals reveal useful information that might be used in improving upon development control. The recommendations advanced relate to both the procedure and substance of development control. The study found out that there is substantial delay in the process of development control for application for planning permission and at planning appeals stage. There is delay of varying degree at various stages in the process. It starts from lodging an application for planning permission as demonstrated with the case study on the City <b>of</b> Harare to <b>lodging</b> <b>of</b> Notice <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> and the Appellantâ€™s Case by the Applicant/Appellant. Worse still there is further delay by the Respondent and to some extent by the Administrative Court. This delay problem is accompanied by lack of adequate framework for planning. This inadequacy in policy framework and the resultant delay in processing applications raise the cost of development or leads to loss of revenue by investors...|$|R
