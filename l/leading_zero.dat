25|$|The value, or number, zero is not {{the same}} as the digit zero, used in numeral systems using {{positional}} notation. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> may be used to distinguish a number.|$|E
2500|$|Values {{less than}} 1.0 should {{always have a}} <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> - one should write [...] "0.5kg", not [...] ".5kg" [...] as the latter is easily {{confused}} with [...] "5kg".|$|E
2500|$|Bitwise tries {{are much}} the same as a normal character-based trie except that {{individual}} bits are used to traverse what effectively becomes a form of binary tree. Generally, implementations use a special CPU instruction to very quickly find the first set bit in a fixed length key (e.g., GCC's __builtin_clz (...) intrinsic). This value is then used to index a 32- or 64-entry table which points to the first item in the bitwise trie with that number of <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> bits. The search then proceeds by testing each subsequent bit in the key and choosing child or child appropriately until the item is found.|$|E
50|$|The count {{trailing}} zeros operation {{would return}} 3, while the count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> operation returns 16. The count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> operation {{depends on the}} word size: if this 32-bit word were truncated to a 16-bit word, count <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> would return zero. The find first set operation would return 4, indicating the 4th position from the right. The log base 2 is 15.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} applicable when <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained.http://kaprekar.sourceforge.net/output/sample.php If <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are discarded, {{the only difference}} is that the 09→81→63→27→45 cycle for digit length 2 does not occur, because then 54 − 45 = 9 (instead of 09), and 9 − 9 = 0, so all 2-digit sequences will instead end in 0. When <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained, only repdigits will result in 0.|$|R
5000|$|One or more <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes</b> {{from any}} groups of {{hexadecimal}} digits are removed; {{this is usually}} done to either all or none of the <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes.</b> For example, the group 0042 is converted to 42.|$|R

This [...] "sixth quadrant" [...] is roughly bounded by Naito Parkway and Barbur Boulevard to the west, Montgomery Street {{to the north and}} Nevada Street to the south. East-West addresses in this area are denoted with a <b>leading</b> <b>zero</b> (instead of a minus sign).

When <b>leading</b> <b>zeros</b> are retained, only repdigits will result in 0.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reason this}} method is used is because an unmodified CRC does not {{distinguish}} between two messages which differ only {{in the number of}} <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes,</b> because <b>leading</b> <b>zeroes</b> do not affect the value of [...] [...] When this inversion is done, the CRC does distinguish between such messages.|$|R
