50|$|The bus {{analyzer}} {{monitors and}} captures the bus communication data, decodes and analyses it and displays {{the data and}} analysis reports to the user. It is essentially a <b>logic</b> <b>analyzer</b> with some additional knowledge of the underlying bus traffic characteristics. One of the key differences between a bus analyzer and a <b>logic</b> <b>analyzer</b> is notably its ability to filter and extract only relevant traffic that occurs on the analyzed bus. Some advanced logic analyzers present data storage qualification options that also allow to filter bus traffic, enabling bus analyzer-like features.|$|E
