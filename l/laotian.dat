5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, <b>Laotian</b> civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the <b>Laotian</b> embassy in Saigon, the <b>Laotian</b> commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal <b>Laotian</b> Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In January 1954, Muong Khoua was re-occupied by <b>Laotian</b> forces, {{which were}} {{subsequently}} overrun once {{more by the}} 316th Division of the Viet Minh. The <b>Laotian</b> commander, {{who lived in the}} village itself with his wife, was killed in his home before the attack. Battalions of the French Foreign Legion and <b>Laotian</b> forces suffered losses covering the retreat of garrison survivors. The area of Muong Khoua later became a critical supply route across Dien Bien Phu for the Viet Minh and by 1963 was the site of a construction project for the proposed Route 19.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 January, {{one day after the}} fall of Khe Sanh village, the North Vietnamese 304th Division moved against their next target, the small <b>Laotian</b> outpost at Ban Houei Sane. Prior to 1968, <b>Laotian</b> forces at Ban Houei Sane had played an {{important}} role in the war, watching North Vietnamese infiltration into South Vietnam from a section of the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos. The outpost was manned by 700 <b>Laotian</b> soldiers of BV-33 ‘Elephant’ Battalion, Royal Laos Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel Soulang Phetsampou. As night fell, the North Vietnamese 3rd Battalion of the 24th Regiment began attacking the outpost. The 198th Tank Battalion, which was tasked with supporting the 24th Regiment, was delayed as their tank crews tried to navigate their PT-76 amphibious tanks through the rough local terrain. However, confusion quickly descended on the <b>Laotian</b> defenders as North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks turned up outside their outpost. After three hours of fighting, Soulang decided to abandon his outpost, so he radioed the Lang Vei Special Forces Camp and requested helicopters to evacuate his men and their families. However, as helicopters were unavailable, the Laotians decided to move eastward by foot along Highway 9, in an attempt to reach Lang Vei just across the border in South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Muong Khoua {{took place}} between April 13 and May 18, 1953, in {{northern}} Laos during the French Indochina War. A garrison of a dozen French and 300 <b>Laotian</b> troops occupied a fortified outpost in the hills above the village of Muong Khoua, {{across the border from}} Điện Biên Phủ. Muong Khoua was among the last French outposts in northern Laos following the decision of the French High Command to string several isolated garrisons through the region in order to buy time to fortify the major <b>Laotian</b> cities against Việt Minh attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricacies of}} <b>Laotian</b> affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the <b>Laotian</b> government.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of a foreign diplomatic and aid community has {{had a significant effect}} on the economy of Vientiane, both in terms of direct aid and through employment of <b>Laotians</b> by the missions and as domestic help. In response, Vientiane merchants stock imported consumer goods such as electronics, clothing, and food, items purchased by <b>Laotians</b> much more than by foreigners. A once dormant service sector of automobile and truck repair, tailors, barbers, and hairdressers has begun to revive. Patrons at restaurants and the six disco establishments are also predominantly <b>Laotians,</b> reflecting the increased income available to private-sector businessmen and employees of foreign organizations. Foreign assistance in Vientiane {{during the early years of}} the LPDR helped to develop several upper-secondary schools and technical-training schools and improve the two main hospitals.|$|R

5|$|For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 – Southern Laos Victory, {{was viewed}} as a {{complete}} success. The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of <b>Laotian</b> forces, was quickly accelerated. <b>Laotian</b> troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery 60 miles in width was soon expanded to 90 miles. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, known in the west as the Easter Offensive.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Lang Vei (Vietnamese: Trận Làng Vây) {{began on}} the evening of 6 February and {{concluded}} during the early hours of 7 February 1968, in Quảng Trị Province, South Vietnam. Towards the end of 1967 the 198th Tank Battalion, Vietnam People's Army (VPA) 203rd Armored Regiment, received instructions from the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense to reinforce the 304th Division as part of the Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign. After an arduous journey down the Ho Chi Minh trail in January 1968, the 198th Tank Battalion linked up with the 304th Division for a major offensive along Highway 9, which stretched from the <b>Laotian</b> border through to Quảng Trị Province. On 23 January, the VPA 24th Regiment attacked the small <b>Laotian</b> outpost at Bane Houei Sane, {{under the control of the}} Royal Laos Army BV-33 ‘Elephant’ Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese trucks were destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from <b>Laotian</b> soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into <b>Laotian</b> airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and <b>Laotian</b> civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1969, the {{pipeline}} crossed the <b>Laotian</b> frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, {{it reached the}} approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam.

5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort.

PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E
