40|$|This study {{proposes that}} {{individual}} failure experience in organizations induces useful learning {{at the individual}} and group levels because it reveals valuable information and spurs actions. However, the value of individual failure experience depends {{on the level of}} group success experience. Specifically, group contemporary success experience and group congenital success experience will enhance the learning value of individual failure experience. Each type of higher level of group success experience provides useful experience pools (library effect), offers contrasts that are crucial for causal inferences (contrast effect), and motivates the focal individuals and the group to learn (motivation effect), albeit through distinct microprocesses. We test our theory with an event history analysis of the first licensing agreements for 778 <b>lead</b> <b>patents</b> granted to a major university technology transfer organization between 1971 and 1999, and find support for our theory.

50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of <b>lead,</b> <b>patent</b> driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke brown. The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|R

30|$|The {{argument}} {{of a positive}} correlation between patent stock and citations is analogous to that of GDP’s correlation with citations; more <b>patent</b> activity <b>leads</b> to more <b>patent</b> citations in general, including citations of US patents.

The positive correlation between education (EDUCATION) and patent citations is expected because higher education leads to a more skilled labor force, which would then be more likely to create technological advance via patents. Both measures of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are expected to be positively correlated with foreign citation of US patents, because FDI {{has been shown to be}} an avenue through which knowledge flows from source to host country and vice versa (Saggi 2002, Hu and Jaffe 2003, MacGarvie 2005).|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{for a large}} sample of R&D-active {{manufacturing}} firms that collaborative R&D has {{a positive effect on}} firms' patenting in terms of both quantity and quality. When distinguishing between alliances that aim at joint creation of new knowledge and alliances that aim at exchange of existing knowledge, the results suggest that the positive effect on patent quantity is driven by knowledge exchange rather than joint R&D. Firms engaged in joint R&D, on the other hand, receive more forward citations per patent indicating that joint R&D enhances patent quality. In light of literature on strategic patenting, our results further suggest that knowledge creation alliances <b>lead</b> to <b>patents</b> that are filed to protect valuable intellectual property, while exchange alliances drive portfolio patenting, resulting in fewer forward citations...|$|R

Findings suggest that expenditures in Research & Development (R&D) <b>lead</b> to <b>patents</b> while non-R&D expenditures drive the innovative sales. For both types of expenditure, we find relatively weaker effects on innovation in the regions belonging to the New Member States and in Convergence regions but we find significant spillover effects.
