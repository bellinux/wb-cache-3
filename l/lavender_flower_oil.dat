50|$|Lavender oil is an {{essential}} oil obtained by distillation from the flower spikes of certain species of lavender. Two forms are distinguished, <b>lavender</b> <b>flower</b> <b>oil,</b> a colorless oil, insoluble in water, having a density of 0.885 g/mL; and lavender spike oil, a distillate from the herb Lavandula latifolia, having density 0.905 g/mL. Like all essential oils, {{it is not a}} pure compound; it is a complex mixture of naturally occurring phytochemicals, including linalool and linalyl acetate. Kashmir Lavender oil is famous for being produced from lavender at the foothills of the Himalayas. As of 2011, the biggest lavender oil producer in the world is Bulgaria.|$|E

40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of lavender essential oil were determined • <b>Lavender</b> <b>flower</b> was extracted with supercritical CO 2 under isothermal and isobaric conditions • Modeling the extraction system lavender flower-supercritical CO 2 was performed • Essential oil and CO 2 extracts of <b>lavender</b> <b>flower</b> analysis {{was done by}} GC/MS and GC/FID In this study essential oil content was determined in <b>lavender</b> <b>flowers</b> and leaves by hydrodistillation. Physical and chemical characteristics of the isolated oils were determined. By using CO 2 in supercritical state, the extrac-tion of <b>lavender</b> <b>flowers</b> was performed with a selected solvent flow under isothermal and isobaric conditions. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained essential oil and supercritical extracts (SFE) was carried out using gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector (GC/FID). Also, the analysis of individual SFE extracts obtained during different extraction times was per-formed. The main components of the analysed samples were linalool, linalool acetate, lavandulol, caryophyllene oxide, lavandulyl acetate, terpinen- 4 -ol and others. Two proposed models were used for modelling the extraction system lavender flower- supercritical CO 2 {{on the basis of}} experimental results obtained by examining the extraction kinetics of this system.
