40|$|The {{perceived}} {{value of}} integrating small partial- equilibrium structural models of individual <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> into a comprehensive single-sector model {{is to take}} advantage of the interrelationships that are usually expressed by cross elasticities on both the supply and demand sides of these industries. Model integration should provide a more realistic representation of the <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> and an improved mechanism for industry analyses. However, model integration could also lead to increased error in model simulation that could reduce the value of the larger model for those purposes. Using forecasting as an example application, this paper investigates how the increased endogenisation of cross-commodity relationships in alternative structural econometric models of the Australian <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> affects the simulation performance of the larger model. Forecast accuracy and encompassing tests were used to investigate the value of model integration by comparing the accuracy of the models' forecasts and by testing for differences in the information contained in those forecasts. The general result was that combining the models did not adversely affect the forecasts from the integrated model and the encompassing tests indicated that the forecasts of the integrated and single models contained different information. Because the forecasts of the integrated model were not impaired relative to the single model forecasts, model integration was considered to be useful for forecasting and other types of economic analysis in the <b>livestock</b> <b>industries.</b> Structural econometric models, Model integration, Forecasting, Economic analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

25|$|The {{debate as}} to what degree mustangs and cattle compete for forage is multifaceted.

The environmentalist community is split over {{the position of the}} mustang within the North American ecosystem. This debate centers on the potential classification of mustangs as either an introduced species such as cattle, or as a reintroduced native species due to the prehistoric presence of horses in North America, albeit with a gap of thousands of years between their extinction and reintroduction from European stock.|$|E
25|$|The UN {{report also}} {{concluded}} that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes {{of food in}} 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest— and in 2001 consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses. As of 2006 the <b>livestock</b> <b>industry</b> accounted for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia. Livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which {{is involved in the}} production of acid rain.

40|$|Classical {{biological}} control {{is the only}} realistic option for managing {{many of the most}} serious weeds affecting <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> in Australia. This project developed and applied a framework, based on a matrix assessment system, to prioritise biocontrol efforts using new agents against 79 weed taxa. These taxa were identified in a concurrent project as priorities for Research, Development and Extension to address weed problems of Australian <b>livestock</b> <b>industries.</b> The framework considered the current and potential impacts of the weeds versus prospects for biocontrol. The latter combined assessments of feasibility of undertaking a biocontrol program that would yield host-specific agents, and the likelihood that agents would be successful in mitigating the impacts of the weeds once released in Australia. Each categorisation was supported with a written rationale that explained the ranking assigned and captured uncertainties. Key investment areas for future actions to address biocontrol knowledge gaps for each weed were identified. Twenty-one weeds with the highest combined rankings for biocontrol prospects and current and/or potential impacts were shortlisted as priority taxa for future investment. Results provide the best available information for funding agencies responsible for RD&E for <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> to make investment decisions across their weed biocontrol portfolio...|$|R

25|$|Many {{species of}} flies of the two-winged type, Order Diptera, such as mosquitoes, horse-flies, blow-flies and warble-flies cause direct {{parasitic}} disease to domestic animals, and transmit organisms that cause diseases. These infestations and infections cause distress to companion animals, and in <b>livestock</b> <b>industry</b> the financial costs of these diseases are high. These problems occur wherever domestic animals are reared. This article {{provides an overview}} of parasitic flies from a veterinary perspective, with emphasis on the disease causing relationships between these flies and their host animals. The article is organized following the taxonomic hierarchy of these flies in the Phylum Arthropoda, Order Insecta. Families and genera of dipteran flies are emphasized rather than many individual species. Disease caused by the feeding activity of the flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; prominent examples are provided from the many species.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{influences}} {{on the creation of}} agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the <b>livestock</b> <b>industry</b> that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.|$|E

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Australian <b>livestock</b> <b>industries,</b> to maintain social licence to practice as well as ensuring market share overseas. Improvement of animal welfare in the <b>livestock</b> <b>industries</b> requires several important key steps. Paramount among these, objective measures are needed for welfare assessment that will enable comparison and contrast of welfare implications of husbandry procedures or housing options. Such measures need to be versatile (can be applied under {{a wide range of}} on- and off-farm situations), relevant (reveal aspects of the animal’s affective or physiological state that is relevant to their welfare), reliable (can be repeated with confidence in the results), relatively economic to apply, and they need to have broad acceptance by all stakeholders. Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) is an integrated measure that characterises behaviour as a dynamic, expressive body language. QBA is a versatile tool requiring little specialist equipment suiting application to in situ assessments that enables comparative, hypothesis-driven evaluation of various industry-relevant practices. QBA is being increasingly used as part of animal welfare assessments in Europe, and although most other welfare assessment methods record ‘problems’ (e. g. lameness, injury scores, and so on), QBA can capture positive aspects of animal welfare (e. g. positively engaged with their environment, playfulness). In this viewpoint, we review the outcomes of recent QBA studies and discuss the potential application of QBA, in combination with other methods, as a welfare assessment tool for the Australian <b>livestock</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R
