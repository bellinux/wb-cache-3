50|$|The {{direction}} of the <b>lighting</b> placed <b>on</b> a painting also seems {{to have an effect}} on aesthetic preference. The left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with lighting coming from the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> the upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> the left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was <b>lighter</b> <b>on</b> the right side and when given the opportunity to create <b>light</b> <b>on</b> an already existing painting.|$|R

40|$|A current {{demonstration}} in the greenhouses of Wageningen UR in Bleiswijk (the Netherlands) shows positive results of LED <b>light</b> <b>on</b> {{the quality and}} production of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). In this demonstration two strawberry cultivars, Elsanta and Sonata, are exposed to three different light treatments. The first treatment consists of top LED light only (90 Î¼mol m- 2 s- 1), the second of top LED light with additional LED <b>light</b> <b>on</b> the leaves (200 Î¼mol m- 2 s- 1) and the last of top LED light with additional LED <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> the fruits (90 Î¼mol m- 2 s- 1). Strawberries were harvested two times per week from October till December and each time total production was determined. Repeated measurements on refraction, titratable acid and vitamin C content were conducted in addition to flavour testing by a consumer panel and a sensory expert panel. Results point out that treatment with additional LED <b>light</b> <b>on</b> leaves and the treatment with LED <b>light</b> <b>on</b> fruits results in {{a significant increase in}} production, flavour, refraction, titratable acid and vitamin C content. <b>Lighting</b> <b>on</b> fruits causes an even higher increase in vitamin C content than <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> leaves. The observed effect of additional LED <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> the fruits is surprising, since only 90 Î¼mol m- 2 s- 1 was available to the plant compared to 200 Î¼mol m- 2 s- 1 in the other treatment. Our findings indicate that LED lighting is a promising technique in greenhouse horticulture to optimize flavour, nutritional value and production of strawberries...|$|R

In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad diedâ€” this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel.

Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including the <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> the stage, rides and buildings were added.

40|$|Acute light {{exposure}} exerts various effects on physiology and behaviour. Although {{the effects of}} <b>light</b> <b>on</b> brain network activity in humans are well demonstrated, the effects of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> cognitive performance are inconclusive, with the size, as well as direction, of the effect depending {{on the nature of}} the task. Similarly, in nocturnal rodents, bright light can either facilitate or disrupt performance depending on the type of task employed. Crucially, it is unclear whether the effects of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> behavioural performance are mediated via the classical image-forming rods and cones or the melanopsin-expressing photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Here, we investigate the modulatory effects of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> memory performance in mice using the spontaneous object recognition task. Importantly, we examine which photoreceptors are required to mediate the effects of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> memory performance. By using a cross-over design, we show that object recognition memory is disrupted when the test phase is conducted under a bright light (350 lux), regardless of the light level in the sample phase (10 or 350 lux), demonstrating that exposure to a bright light at the time of test, rather than at the time of encoding, impairs performance. Strikingly, the modulatory effect of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> memory performance is completely abolished in both melanopsin-deficient and rodless-coneless mice. Our findings provide direct evidence that melanopsin-driven and rod/cone-driven photoresponses are integrated in order to mediate the effect of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> memory performance...|$|R
