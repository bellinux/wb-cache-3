At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level. Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, Mark Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.|$|E

A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [...] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity." [...] Fourteen years later, another Times reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical [...] "unsophisticated and untroubled. [...] Even its shadows are lightened with a <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> a sweetly sentimental tear... we can even be persuaded to take death as a happy ending".|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them <b>laugh,</b> <b>or</b> cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot).

500|$|When Arsène Wenger joined Arsenal in October 1996, he {{attempted}} to organise an extra training session at the club's University College London Union (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds, {{for the benefit of}} getting to know his players. Wenger was told that the ground – owned by UCL, was reserved for its students, which left him not knowing “whether to <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> cry”. A few weeks after, a fire partially burnt down the training centre, costing £50,000 in damages. Arsenal temporarily rehoused their training base to Sopwell House Hotel in St Albans. Wenger, dismayed by the arrangement, campaigned for a purpose-built, Arsenal-owned ground that housed the latest training equipment.

500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled {{in a place like}} this once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E

[...] cheer upon getting an answer right, the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees are angry, and Michael's Indian accent. Carell improvised with several different accents on the set, with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film, although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit. Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told not to <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> react at all to the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E

500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} lukewarm reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, Species {{holds an}} approval of 34% based on 35 reviews.

[...] James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars, stating that [...] "as {{long as you}} don't stop to think about what's going on, Species is capable of offering its share of cheap thrills, with a <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> two thrown in as well." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly found the film lacking in imagination and special effects, also commenting that Alfred Molina [...] "sport a haircut that's scarier than the creature." [...] Varietys review of the film {{described it as a}} [...] "gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own" [...] and that Ben Kingsley and other lead actors [...] "have only two-dimensional roles to engage them". The review mentions the similarity between H.R. Giger's design of Sil and his work on Alien.|$|E
500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to <b>laugh</b> <b>or</b> to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must say {{it was the first time}} since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E

[...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series. It's almost as if the writers planned it this way – to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we'll miss them when they're gone." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E
