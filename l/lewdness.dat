The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his <b>lewdness,</b> especially towards his mother. During bump and grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, {{it becomes clear that}} the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.|$|E
25|$|On August 22, 2002, {{the show}} was {{suspended}} following its third annual Sex for Sam contest held on August 15 that encouraged listeners to have sex in risky places for prizes while a witness reported from the location. Its name derived from the Boston Beer Company, producer of Samuel Adams beer that sponsored the contest and prize. In the segment, comedian Paul Mecurio, on a cellphone, described Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, having simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral, several feet away from a Mass service. The couple were arrested for public <b>lewdness,</b> and Mecurio for acting in concert. The incident received widespread media attention, causing WNEW to issue an apology the following day, but it {{was rejected by the}} Catholic League that wrote to the FCC demanding Hughes and Cumia be fined and the removal of WNEW's license. The Boston Beer Company also apologized. The show aired live on the following day, but the hosts could not address the incident for legal reasons. WNEW aired a week of reruns while Infinity kept Hughes and Cumia off the air while the matter was reviewed. They were fired on August 22, in addition to WNEW's general manager and program director the day before. Florence died from a heart attack in September 2002 and Harper and Mecurio pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in 2003.|$|E

The chorus, [...] "You're {{too late to}} get your supper" [...] is a {{kindhearted}} taunt {{to a man who}} often arrived after dark, forcing his hosts to scrape up a meal for him.

Salon wrote: [...] "When he’s crooning come-ons, his voice lends the music a {{satisfying}} <b>lewdness,</b> a sense of sticky physicality that gives his snaky hooks a pheromonal urgency." [...] In a review of It Won't Be Soon Before Long, Entertainment Weekly described his vocals as [...] "smug, R deadpan ... there's a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery". In another review, Allmusic noted that [...] "he knows that he's a pop guy, somewhat {{in the tradition of}} Hall & Oates, but he isn't trying to be retro, he's ... making records that are melodic, stylish, and soulful". In a review of the 2013 Honda Civic Tour, The Boston Globe also commented positively on his on-stage presence, which [...] "exude a sense of up-for-anything playfulness ... combined with a rock solid work ethic and a clear love for their audiences and performing".|$|E

He {{declares}} that the gods Odin and Thor are angry with Gerðr, and that Freyr will hate her; she has [...] "brought down the potent wrath of the gods". Skírnir declares to the hrimthursar, thursar, the sons of Suttungr, and the [...] "troops of the Æsir" [...] that he has denied both pleasure and benefit from men to Gerðr. Skírnir details that the thurs's name who will own her below the gates of Nágrind is Hrímgrímnir and that there, at the roots of the world, the finest thing Gerðr will be given to drink is the urine of goats. He carves [...] "thurs" [...] (the runic character *thurisaz) on Gerðr and three runes (unnamed) symbolizing <b>lewdness,</b> frenzy, and unbearable desire, and comments that he can rub them off just as he has carved them—if he wishes.|$|E
500|$|Such trade {{may explain}} the {{relative}} uniformity of the name across the country. [...] Streets named Gropecunt Lane are recorded in several smaller market towns such as Banbury, Glastonbury and Wells, where a street of that name existed in 1300, regularly mentioned in legal documents of the time. ParsonsStreet in Banbury was first recorded as Gropecunt Lane in 1333, {{and may have been}} an important thoroughfare, but by 1410 its name had been changed to Parsons Lane. [...] Grape Lane in Whitby may once have been Grope Lane, or Grapcunt Lane. [...] Gropecunte Lane in Glastonbury, later known as Grope lane, now St Benedicts Court, was recorded in 1290 and 1425 A street called GropeCountelane existed in Shrewsbury as recently as 1561, connecting the town's two principal marketplaces. [...] At some date unrecorded the street was renamed Grope Lane, a name it has retained. [...] In Thomas Phillips' History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury (1799) the author is explicit in his understanding of the origin of the name as a place of [...] "scandalous <b>lewdness</b> and venery", but Archdeacon Hugh Owen's Some account of the ancient and present state of Shrewsbury (1808) describes it as [...] "called Grope, or the Dark Lane". [...] As a result of these differing accounts, some local tour guides attribute the name to [...] "feeling one's way along a dark and narrow thoroughfare".|$|E
500|$|Greatly {{concerned}} {{by what he}} {{perceived to be the}} degeneracy of British society, Wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform, lobbying against [...] "the torrent of profaneness that every day makes more rapid advances", and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals. At the suggestion of Wilberforce and Bishop Porteus, King George III was requested by the Archbishop of Canterbury to issue in 1787 the Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice, as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality. The proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of [...] "excessive drinking, blasphemy, profane swearing and cursing, <b>lewdness,</b> profanation of the Lord's Day, and other dissolute, immoral, or disorderly practices". Greeted largely with public indifference, Wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause, and by founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice. This and other societies in which Wilberforce was a prime mover, such as the Proclamation Society, mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornographic material, {{and those who did not}} respect the Sabbath. Years later, the writer and clergyman Sydney Smith criticised Wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich, and suggested that a better name would have been the Society for [...] "suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £500 per annum". The societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support, although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of Thomas Williams, the London printer of Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. Wilberforce's attempts to legislate against adultery and Sunday newspapers were also in vain; his involvement and leadership in other, less punitive, approaches were more successful in the long-term, however. By the end of his life, British morals, manners, and sense of social responsibility had increased, paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the Victorian era.|$|E

However, Vermont prohibits only [...] "open and gross <b>lewdness</b> and lascivious behavior", meaning that conventional streaking is entirely legal. This difference in legality complicates streaking events such as the Ledyard Challenge, which has components in both states.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Untener {{was named}} the fourth Bishop of Saginaw. His consecration to the episcopacy {{immediately}} became embroiled in controversy, however, as area Catholics filed complaints with the Vatican about a recent workshop on sexuality Untener authorized at St. John's Seminary. [...] Detractors of the workshop claimed it promoted <b>lewdness</b> and promiscuity. [...] In the time leading up to Untener's consecration, he made two trips to the Vatican to defend himself and appeal to Pope John Paul II that he should become bishop. On the second trip, Detroit Cardinal John Dearden came with him and publicly gave his support.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{of these}} tensions, Marston's career {{continued}} to prosper. [...] In 1603, {{he became a}} shareholder in the Children of Blackfriars company, at that time known for steadily pushing the allowable limits of personal satire, violence, and <b>lewdness</b> on stage. [...] He wrote and produced two plays with the company. [...] The first was The Malcontent in 1603; this satiric tragicomedy is Marston's most famous play. This work was originally written for the children at Blackfriars, and was later taken over (perhaps stolen) by the Kings' Men at the Globe, with additions by John Webster and (perhaps) Marston himself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{one year}} after being reconstituted as the German Democratic Republic, the Berlin Appeal Court (Kammergericht Berlin) decided for all of East Germany to {{reinstate}} {{the validity of the}} old, pre-1935 form of Paragraph 175. However, in contrast to the earlier action of the OLG Halle, the new Paragraph 175a remained unchanged, because it was said to protect society against [...] "socially harmful homosexual acts of qualified character". In 1954, the same court decided that Paragraph 175a, in contrast to Paragraph 175, did not presuppose acts tantamount to sexual intercourse. <b>Lewdness</b> (Unzucht) was defined as any act that is performed to arouse sexual excitement and [...] "violates the moral sentiment of our workers".|$|E

So Zack and Miri Make a Porno, {{in spite of its}} sometimes tiresome, sometimes amusing <b>lewdness,</b> follows a gee-whiz romantic-comedy formula that would not be out of place on the Disney Channel. Two best friends who have always been in love with each other discover that ... they have always been in love with each other. Granted, this revelation occurs while they are having sex in front of a camera, but it is so sweet and predictable that these potentially tawdry circumstances hardly matter.|$|E
2500|$|Strange Fruit {{was banned}} in Boston and Detroit for charges of <b>lewdness</b> and {{language}} on March 20, 1944, only weeks after its release, making {{the book the}} first [...] "#1 Bestseller" [...] to be banned in Boston. Cambridge Police Chief Timothy J. O'Leary and the Boston Bookseller's Association both endorsed the book's banning, also asking for Smith to censor her work, removing [...] "three lines of 'sexual phraseology.'" [...] A letter in the Harvard Crimson criticized the banning of the book in Boston and the allegations of obscenity, saying that the usage of [...] "an objectionable word" [...] in Strange Fruit occurred during a scene when Nonnie is overcome by the [...] "cruelty of her situation" [...] and {{the memories of the}} [...] "brutalities she has ever known", causing the book to be [...] "the reverse of obscene".|$|E
2500|$|In 1954 {{the same}} court decided that Paragraph 175a in {{contrast}} to Paragraph 175 did not presuppose acts tantamount to sexual intercourse. <b>Lewdness</b> (Unzucht) was defined as any act that is performed to arouse sexual excitement and [...] "violates the moral sentiment of our workers." [...] A revision of the criminal code in 1957 {{made it possible to}} put aside prosecution of an illegal action that represented no danger to socialist society because of lack of consequence. This removed Paragraph 175 from the effective body of the law, because {{at the same time the}} East Berlin Court of Appeal (Kammergericht) decided that all punishments deriving from the old form of Paragraph 175 should be suspended due to the insignificance of the acts to which it had been applied. On this basis, homosexual acts between consenting adults ceased to be punished, beginning in the late 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. Post Office confiscated the October 1917 {{issue of}} The Little Review {{due to the}} {{publication}} of Wyndham Lewis’ story [...] "Cantleman’s Springmate", which focuses on a young, disillusioned soldier who, while awaiting deployment {{to the front lines}} of World War I, seduces a young girl and afterwards ignores her letters informing him of her pregnancy. The story was seized due to its perceived sexual <b>lewdness</b> and anti-war sentiments which were thought to violate the Comstock laws prohibiting “obscene, lewd, or lascivious” material from being mailed. John Quinn, a successful lawyer and patron of the arts who was benefactor to both The Little Review and Ezra Pound, the magazine’s foreign editor at the time, believed the magazine to have been suppressed due to editors Anderson and Heap’s support of anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman and anti-war statements they published in New York newspapers. Their support of radical political figures had already led to their eviction from their New York studio office.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} {{of education in}} Nesna at the beginning o the 19th century was described as [...] "lamentable". The education Augustinussen himself had received had mainly been from home and through the priest who lent him books. When he was asked in parliament where he studied, he answered: [...] "Actually I ought {{to tell you that}} I was taught at home next to the stove by my mother". It was the curate who was responsible for teaching, and Nesna had been saddled with several awful curates. The curate Müller, in 1811, had to resign his post [...] "due to adultery", and his successor Peter Eggen, who was curate during Augustinussen's childhood and early years, had little more success. He was a cobbler without any pedagogical qualifications and liked to drink and [...] "chase women". Jenssen writes that [...] "he had nothing to teach + {{for the simple reason that}} he knew nothing". The pastor at the time Christian Qvale testified that [...] "He combined <b>lewdness</b> with the greatest incompetence" [...], whilst the later priest Dometius wrote of Eggen that «Han cultivated both Bacchus and Venus and was a general annoyance".|$|E
2500|$|The Church {{responded to}} some of the criticisms being made against it. John Hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews, instigated a series of provincial councils (in 1549, 1552, {{probably}} in 1556, and in 1559), modelled on the contemporaneous Council of Trent. These blamed the advance of the Protestant heresies on [...] "the corruption of morals and the profane <b>lewdness</b> of life in churchmen of all ranks, together with crass ignorance of literature and of the liberal arts". In 1548, attempts were made to eliminate concubinage, clerical pluralism, clerical trading, and non-residence, and to prohibit unqualified persons from holding church offices. Further, the clergy were enjoined to scriptural reflection, and bishops and parsons instructed to preach at least four times a year. [...] Monks were to be sent to university, and theologians appointed for each monastery, college and cathedral. But in 1552, it was acknowledged that little had been accomplished. Attendance at Mass was still sparse and [...] "the inferior clergy of this realm and the prelates have not, for the most part, attained such proficiency in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures as to be able by their own efforts rightly to instruct the people in the Catholic faith and other things necessary to salvation or to convert the erring".|$|E

Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I would guess that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and <b>lewdness</b> thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid?
