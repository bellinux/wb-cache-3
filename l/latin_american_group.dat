25|$|More than 10,000 Argentine Jews {{immigrated to}} Israel since 2000, joining the {{thousands}} of previous Argentine immigrants already there. The crisis in Argentina also affected its neighbour country Uruguay, from which about half of its 40,000-strong Jewish community left, mainly to Israel, in the same period. During 2002 and 2003 the Jewish Agency for Israel launched an intensive public campaign to promote aliyah from the region, and offered additional economic aid for immigrants from Argentina. Although the economy of Argentina improved, and some who had immigrated to Israel from Argentina moved back following South American country's economic growth from 2003 onwards, Argentine Jews continue to immigrate to Israel, albeit in smaller numbers than before. The Argentine community in Israel is about 50,000-70,000 people, the largest <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>group</b> in the country.|$|E

Hippe later landed a job as a journalist for the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet and became the paper's correspondent in Argentina.

Holst was put on a plane to Brazil and Hippe left for Santiago, Chile. In a press conference Argentina's Minister of Interior Bernardo Menendez claimed that the journalists were [...] "compromising national security". In 1984 he sent a job application to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) to become their correspondent in Latin America. When he moved back to Norway he worked for NRK Arbeiderbladet and Fafo. Until 1999 Hippe worked in the economic news sector at NRK.|$|E

The largest commercial television groups are Mexico-based Televisa, Brazil-based Globo and Canada-based Canwest <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>Group.</b> Due to the shared language of Spanish by two thirds of Latin Americans a lot of programmes and broadcasters operate throughout the region, offering both United States television (often dubbed into Spanish) and Spanish-language television.|$|E
