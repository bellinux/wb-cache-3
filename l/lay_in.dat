5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was {{initially}} composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on 1September 1939.

The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
