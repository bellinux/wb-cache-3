25|$|Pann is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} authored the music to Deşteaptă-te, române!, Romania's national anthem.

According to one account, Ucenescu had used a romanza composed by Pann in 1839, in turn complimenting the lyrics of Grigore Alexandrescu. It has also been argued that the music was that of a popular <b>lied,</b> <b>and</b> first published in one of Pann's manele collections. The ethnographic research carried out by Dimitrie Gusti confirmed that the same melody was being sung as a folk song by Southern Dobrujan ethnic Turks in the 1930s.|$|E
