50|$|Unlike {{many other}} states of the period, Genoa gambled the {{majority}} of their economic interest on the Spanish monarchy—bankers invested their money in the crown and farmers of Spanish revenue, while Genoa’s merchants and nobles settled in Spain (Naples and Sicily) marrying local nobility and monopolizing majority of the trade. As long as New Spain was sending silver and gold to Seville, Genoa could flourish. Genoa became a large credit market as the capital of Italian cities was all drained towards Genoa.A multitude of small investors, Genoese and others, obtained from the Crown <b>long-term</b> <b>securities</b> (juros de resguardo) as collateral for their loans; the contracts specified that these securities would be sold if the Crown did not repay the loans. In essence, the Genoese bankers had worked out an interest rate swap. Furthermore, the Crown sold silver spot in Spain to the Genoese in exchange for future delivery of gold in Antwerp, where the gold was used to pay Spanish troops fighting in the Low Countries. Genoa benefited from the Price revolution as they enjoyed the advantage of “increasing returns to scale in international financial services”. Genoa during the price revolution was a snapshot of global finance at its best. Unfortunately, The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the decline of Genoa (due to the Spanish crown's frequent bankruptcies), in particular, Genoa's merchant houses. Later in 1684, Genoa was bombed by a French fleet as punishment for its alliance with Spain and Genoese banker Ambrogio Spinola role in the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands.|$|E
40|$|Securities have {{replaced}} bank lending {{in recent years}} as the primary means through which funds are invested internationally, and in the process, the share of U.

S. <b>long-term</b> <b>securities</b> (equities and long-term debt) that was foreign-owned increased from about 5 percent to about 12 percent. At the same time, U. S. holdings of foreign <b>long-term</b> <b>securities</b> also increased, although their growth did not match the rapid growth in foreign holdings of U. S. securities. At $ 1. 8 trillion, the value of U. S. holdings of foreign <b>long-term</b> <b>securities</b> at the end of 2002 was less than half the value of foreign holdings of U.

40|$|Sensitive digital data, such {{as health}} {{information}} or governmental archives, are often stored for decades or centuries. The processing of such data calls for <b>long-term</b> <b>security.</b> Secure channels on the Internet require robust key establishment methods. Currently used key distribution protocols are either vulnerable to future attacks based on Shor's algorithm, or vulnerable in principle due to their reliance on computational problems. Quantum-based key distribution protocols are information-theoretically secure and offer <b>long-term</b> <b>security.</b> However, significant obstacles to their real-world use remain. This paper, which results from a multidisciplinary project involving computer scientists and physicists, systematizes knowledge about obstacles to and strategies for the realization of long-term secure Internet communication from quantum-based key distribution.

40|$|The sharp {{crash in}} {{prices of the}} Macedonian Stock Exchange {{activities}} after 2007, when the Macedonian Stock Exchange Index has reached the highest value of its establishment and several-years reduced daily turnover of only about 2 thousand euros, indicates that the central institution of the capital market of the Republic of Macedonia has fallen in its own development crisis. Although there are listed more individual reasons {{for the state of}} the Stock Exchange, each of them separately is not sufficient enough to explain the occurrences. It is a matter of complex of reasons dominated by several ones in a certain period. There is no doubt that Macedonia faces the political and security risks, which reason the investors (both home and foreign ones) out of investing in <b>long-term</b> <b>securities.</b> The global crisis has an adverse influence upon the economic flows in the country, and that reflects negatively on the motivation of investing.
