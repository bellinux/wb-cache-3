50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{training}} approaches that may be used with a campus board. As one example, a user may alternate the use of specific fingers to increase finger strength when ascending or descending the board. As another example, upper-body strength may be increased by utilizing large lunges between specific rails or holds of the campus board (Power throws). Reactive training may be used to increase muscle recruitment by dynamically moving between the campus board rails simultaneously with both hands. Training on a campus board may result in better performance due to the improvement of motor training, increased finger strength on a variety grips, and greater power and <b>lock-off</b> strength of the arms.|$|E
5000|$|Director Terrence O'Hara {{says the}} fight {{scene at the}} end of the {{previous}} episode and the beginning of this episode is [...] "probably my favorite just because of the content of the show and the difficulty." [...] The scene was shot in an abandoned bank in downtown Los Angeles and employed scaffolding to make the fight [...] "more vertical" [...] according to producer Jeffrey Bell. O'Hara explains that due to Alexis Denisof's bad back, the show-motion shot of Wesley carrying Faith was a difficult one. The fight scene between Angel and Angelus, which took two days to film, was something that Bell had [...] "waited to do for four years." [...] It was made possible by a split screen and a camera <b>lock-off,</b> explains O'Hara. [...] "We played back to match shot for shot. He was hitting space." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{units are}} among the most {{expensive}} offered by Disney Vacation Club, presumably because of their proximity to the Magic Kingdom. Some of the resort's features include full-length windows with views into the Magic Kingdom or onto Bay Lake. Some bathrooms on the Magic Kingdom side include movable partitions to permit watching the park's fireworks displays from the bathtub. Toward the top of the tower, there are several two-story units that contain large windows. Like all Vacation Club resorts, the one-bedroom, two-bedroom and grand villa units contain full kitchens. The tower contains 295 Disney Vacation Club units consisting of 148 dedicated two-bedroom units, 133 <b>lock-off</b> two-bedroom units (which can be booked together as a two-bedroom unit, or booked separately as either a deluxe studio unit or a one-bedroom unit), and 14 three-bedroom Grand Villa units. There are no dedicated studios or dedicated one-bedroom units in Bay Lake Tower. Each villa is assigned to one of three booking categories: Magic Kingdom View, Bay Lake View, or Standard View, with the relative cost or number of required Disney Vacation Club points assigned accordingly. Although the Magic Kingdom can be seen from some standard and Bay Lake view rooms, the premium views of the park are given the Magic Kingdom view category. Standard view rooms tend to be lower-level rooms that overlook either the parking lot, a service area or an obstructed view. The remainder of the tower is assigned the Bay Lake View category, with views primarily of either Bay Lake or the pool.|$|E

The lock-in and <b>lock-off</b> phenomena observed in the experimental studies of sunroof buffeting is well predicted by CFD speed sweep calculations over the operating speed range of the vehicle. The trend of the shear layer oscillation frequency with vehicle speed is also well predicted. The peak SPL from the CFD calculation has a good compromise with the experimental value after incorporating the real world effects into the CFD model by means of artificial compressibility and damping correction. The entire process right from modeling to flow analysis as well as acoustic analysis has been per-formed within the single environment i. e., STAR-CCM+...|$|E

Post-disaster damage assessment {{that has been}} done by the government have not been supported with a good spatial data so that validation is relatively weak. Method of post-disaster damage assessment, particularly assessment of building damage using geotagged photos, remote sensing and GIS is expected to improve the method of damage assessment by the government of Indonesia. Geojot Applications for Android Smartphone/Tablet allows the assessment of building damage {{to be included in the}} photo attribute. Interpretation of satellite imagery of building damage is done by using three indications: building visibility, building collapse, and building roof. Geotagged photograph can complement the needs of building damage assessment from satellite images because it can describe the structural and non-structural damage to buildings clearly. Geotagged photograph with GPS <b>Lock-Off</b> mode requiring information on the direction and distance of the object being photographed. Geotagged photograph with the QR code is the most profitable because the identity of the building is already known and can be matched with an existing database...|$|E

(KHI) {{has been able to}} {{communicate}} with flight test vehicles during a recent research program. This technology provides a two-way high-capacity communication that has not been achieved with conventional telemetry and can be used not only for flight testing, but also for rescue work. KHI has been authorized to use S-band IP Transceivers since last year in Japan, and various communication tests have been performed. This paper describes Japan's first simulation of an iNET RF network which incorporated testing that performed data backfill, voice communication and video transmission. A data backfilling test was performed using retransmit of <b>lock-off</b> data (which is lost as the aircraft maneuvers) on command from the ground station. Moreover, a tethered aerostat is considered a very useful communication relay platform {{in the event of a}} large-scale disaster which results in the destruction of infrastructure. Also, the silence of an aerostat can be very important for search and rescue work...|$|E
40|$|The poor {{performance}} and durability of traditional steel tendon and cement grout have become serious constraints {{to the development}} of ground anchor systems, especially when these systems are permanent features in large-scale projects such as ground anchors with capacities of more than 4, 000 kN in Aizhai Bridge, China. This paper presents a large-scale ground anchor system with carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendon and reactive powder concrete (RPC) grout as the bonding media in both above-ground and below-ground parts. Two full-scale ground anchor specimens named GA 12 - 20 and GA 12 - 9 were designed and installed at the construction site, and their behavior was systematically studied through monotonic and cyclic load testing. The two systems displayed acceptable displacements under both monotonic load testing with maximum tension twice the design <b>lock-off</b> load and in cyclic load testing under about 90 % of its bearing capacity, with residual displacements all less than 5 mm. Furthermore, the bond stress distributions in the grouted portions of the rods in tendon showed both systems have reliable bonding capacities under tension. This innovative ground anchor system with CFRP tendon and RPC grout showed a good behavior and successfully served as the ground anchor of the Aizhai Bridge...|$|E
40|$|Fluid - Structure Interaction (FSI) {{phenomena}} {{is becoming}} a relevant study field for the design or revamping of hydropower plants. The generalized trend of increasing flow rates and reducing rotor blades/stay vanes thickness {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of the machine together with a major push from plant owners/operators for production flexibility (partial load operation is more common nowadays) make the FSI between the vortex shedding phenomenon and the vanes/blades of the machine an area of interest. From a design point of view, the machine structure has to resist all the hydrodynamic forces generated and maintain tension stresses under the fatigue limit to ensure a machine lifetime of several decades. To accomplish that goal, designers have to assure there is no presence of strong coupling phenomena (lock-in) between the vortex shedding frequency and the eigenfrequencies of the structure. As the vortex street {{is directly related to the}} state of the boundary layer along the hydrofoil, in this paper the effect of the boundary layer on the vortex shedding in a Donaldson-type hydrofoil is studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The development of the boundary layer along the Donaldson trailing edge hydrofoil chord is presented under <b>lock-off</b> conditions. The results are validated against previously obtained experimental results. Since the Donaldson trailing edge is non-symmetric, the boundary layer velocity profiles are reported for the suction and pressure side of the hydrofoil. In addition, the effect of the Donaldson trailing edge on laminar-to-turbulent transition on both sides of the hydrofoil is studied. Postprint (published version...|$|E
