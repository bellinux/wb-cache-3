2500|$|If a film or {{television}} director staged a similar fictional scene, {{the audience will}} be predisposed to consider it less [...] "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives.

5000|$|Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often {{suffered}} {{emotional abuse}} {{from her husband}} J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show. Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife. She led the way for all those girls." [...] She also added, [...] "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end." [...] In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: [...] "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I still say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties." [...] The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented,I loved my drunk scenes. I know that may sound very strange to people!

5000|$|On January 8, 2016, it was {{announced}} that the group would return on the 18th with their 2nd mini-album titled Sting. The album's creation was supported in part through a Makestar-hosted crowd-funding campaign. The campaign's original goal of $8,418 was reached in only three days, ultimately reaching 422% of its goal with $35,510. On January 18, 2016, the album and a music video for the title track [...] "Sting" [...] were released. The band explained that their intentions for [...] "Sting" [...] were different from [...] "Marionette" [...] and [...] "Vibrato", stating [...] "This time, we wanted to look more like a girlfriend rather than to ... look provocative.

40|$|Many {{women wear}} facial makeup to {{accentuate}} their appeal and attractiveness. Makeup may vary from natural (light) to glamorous (heavy), depending {{of the context}} of interpersonal situations, an emphasis on femininity, and current societal makeup trends. This study examined how <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> and heavy makeup influenced attractiveness ratings and facial recognition. In a rating task, 38 Japanese women assigned attractiveness ratings to 36 Japanese female faces with no makeup, <b>light</b> <b>makeup,</b> and heavy makeup (12 each). In a subsequent recognition task, the participants were presented with 36 old and 36 new faces. Results indicated that attractiveness was rated highest for the <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> faces and lowest for the no makeup faces. In contrast, recognition performance was higher for the no makeup and light make up faces than for the heavy makeup faces. Faces with heavy makeup produced {{a higher rate of}} false recognition than did other faces, possibly because heavy makeup creates an impression of the style of makeup itself, rather than the individual wearing the makeup. The present study suggests that <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> is preferable to heavy makeup in that <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> does not interfere with individual recognition and gives beholders positive impressions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} makeup on {{attractiveness}} {{have been evaluated}} using mainly subjective measures. In this study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a total of 45 Japanese women (n = 23 and n = 22 for Experiment 1 and 2, respectively) to examine the neural processing of faces with no makeup, <b>light</b> <b>makeup,</b> and heavy makeup. To have the participants look at each face carefully, an identity judgement task was used: {{they were asked to}} judge whether the two faces presented in succession were of the same person or not. The ERP waveforms in response to the first faces were analyzed. In two experiments with different stimulus probabilities, the amplitudes of N 170 and vertex positive potential (VPP) were smaller for faces with <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> than for faces with heavy makeup or no makeup. The P 1 amplitude did not differ between facial types. In a subsequent rating phase, faces with <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> were rated as more attractive than faces with heavy makeup and no makeup. The results suggest that the processing fluency of faces with <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> {{is one of the reasons}} why <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> is preferred to heavy makeup and no makeup in daily life...|$|E
30|$|Media {{coverage}} of Hiramatsu {{did not end}} there, however. Seven months later, first the Yomiuri Shimbun (June 16, 1955, morning ed., pg. 7) and then the Asahi Shimbun (June 30, 1955, morning ed., pg. 3) newspapers wrote follow up pieces about Hiramatsu’s new life with her fiancé, Nakagawa Hiroshi (dates unknown). The authors of these articles seem to be implicitly arguing for married life and against renunciation. They pointed out Hiramatsu’s “newlywed glow” (even though she was not yet married), her colorful yukata robe, and her <b>light</b> <b>makeup.</b> They also focused on Hiramatsu’s struggle to become a good wife, learning how to cook meals from her soon-to-be mother-in-law and having to be taught about different types and grades of seafood from the neighborhood fishmongers.|$|E

3000|$|Belhumeur et al. [106] use innovatively a fully Bayesian {{approach}} to deduce landmark positions from local evidences. An interesting {{aspect of their}} work is that these evidences, that is, the local detector outputs are collected from a cohort of exemplars (sample faces with annotated landmarks), which thus provide non-parametrically the global model information. In other words, anatomical and geometrical constraints on facial landmarks are implicit in the exemplars. Depending upon {{the choice of the}} exemplars, localization robustness can be obtained against a large range of real-world variations in pose, expression, <b>lighting,</b> <b>makeup</b> and image quality. The local detector itself consists of a sliding window whose size is proportional to IOD and which collects SIFT features. The normalized SVM score of the SIFT feature set, d, gives local likelihood of a landmark at position x: P(x|d). In the next stage, the global detector models the configurational information of the ensemble of fiducial points. Thus the joint probability of the locations of the n landmarks, X= [x [...]...|$|R

Since The Sound of Music, musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... Finian's Rainbow is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with {{as much fun as}} possible... it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of <b>lighting,</b> <b>makeup</b> and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken." ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel Deep Localized Makeup Transfer Network to {{automatically}} recommend {{the most suitable}} makeup for a female and synthesis the makeup on her face. Given a before-makeup face, her most suitable makeup is determined automatically. Then, both the beforemakeup and the reference faces are fed into the proposed Deep Transfer Network to generate the after-makeup face. Our end-to-end makeup transfer network have several nice properties including: (1) with complete functions: including foundation, lip gloss, and eye shadow transfer; (2) cosmetic specific: different cosmetics are transferred in different manners; (3) localized: different cosmetics are applied on different facial regions; (4) producing naturally looking results without obvious artifacts; (5) controllable makeup lightness: various results from <b>light</b> <b>makeup</b> to heavy makeup can be generated.
