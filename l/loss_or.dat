5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Humans are not {{appropriate}} prey because the shark's digestion is {{too slow to}} cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 fatal.|$|E

5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E

Baker asserts that the true figure could be higher, owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due to the <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece or during the subsequent occupation.|$|E
5|$|Sanctions {{for such}} infractions may be levied on {{individuals}} or on to clubs as a whole.

Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> win.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction.

Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses.

5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum.

5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between the extent of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s past and expected future <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> negative cash flows and the ex anteprobability that it will manipulate revenues. When a firm has a string of <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> negative cash flows, traditional valuation models do not yield reliable estimates of firm value, and traditional price-earnings ratios are not meaningful. Evidence suggests that market participants tend to value loss firms {{on the basis of the}} level and growth in revenues, rather than cash flows and earnings, thereby motivating these firms to overstate revenue. In fact, empirical results indicate that there is a positive relation between the number of years that firms exhibit and/or anticipate <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> negative cash flows andinvestment in receivables after controlling for credit policy. We further show that the ex ante likelihood that firms manipulate revenue in violation of GAAP is positively associated with the history of past and expected future <b>losses</b> <b>or</b> negative cash flows, as well as with the investment in accounts receivable (adjusted for credit policy). Our results suggest another indicator of manipulation that may be used by auditors and regulators in identifying firms that are more likely to overstate revenues...|$|R
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where {{the blood supply}} to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm <b>loss)</b> <b>or</b> severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the <b>loss</b> <b>or</b> disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E
