2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (roller <b>lever</b> <b>brake</b> in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to {{transmit}} force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|E
5000|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> for each <b>brake</b> to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the '70s, are called extension levers, safety levers [...] or, for their reputation for being unable to actuate the full range of travel of the main <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> suicide <b>levers.</b> Modern top-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>levers,</b> called interrupt <b>brake</b> <b>levers,</b> use an entirely different method of actuation and are considered safer.|$|R
50|$|The larger twelve {{horsepower}} six-cylinder {{engine was}} {{mounted in the}} chassis of the ten horsepower four-cylinder BSA Ten. Steering was by cam and <b>lever,</b> <b>brakes</b> were mechanical. Tyres specified were 5 inch on 18 inch wheels.|$|R
2500|$|Power for the XR-400 was {{supplied}} by a standard Ambassador two-barrel [...] AMC V8 engine. The engine bay could accommodate any of AMC’s I6 or V8 engines. The transmission was an automatic (not typical of sports cars) controlled through a floor console mounted shift <b>lever.</b> <b>Braking</b> {{was provided by}} an experimental front disc brake system.|$|R
5000|$|Dirtsurfer {{has updated}} their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16 inch wheels. Both models feature the new {{adjustable}} metal calf <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> rear disc <b>brake,</b> and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. The new 16" [...] GP comes in white, {{with the new}} <b>braking</b> <b>lever</b> and disk <b>brakes.</b> The new GP 20" [...] come in black and also has the new braking handle and disk brakes.|$|R

50|$|Built from a {{motorcycle}} engine in 1938, {{this was the}} first locomotive to ply the rails in Roseland. A 1940 photo shows 1500 as an odd-looking shell of an engine with open seats and several long <b>levers</b> (<b>brakes</b> and throttle). Subsequently rebuilt twice, the small, bright-red, single-cab, gas-powered engine that emerged was generally used as a back-up for the other engines. The engine was conveyed to a miniature railroad in Florida, the Key Western Railroad, in 1965.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>levers</b> {{are usually}} {{mounted on the}} {{handlebars}} within easy reach of the rider's hands. They may be distinct from or integrated into the shifting mechanism. The <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> transmits the force applied by the rider through either a mechanical or hydraulic mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Shimano {{introduced}} their STI shifting levers {{for road}} bicycles, which completely integrated the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> and shifter. It also redesigned the brake [...] "hoods" [...] where riders commonly rest their hands. This new design {{worked like a}} normal <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> in the longtitudinal plane, but also allowed the rider to shift to a larger cog by pushing the lever so that it pivots laterally. Behind the <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> there is a smaller lever that shifts to a smaller cog when pushed towards the inside.|$|R

30|$|The rider rides a {{motorcycle}} mock-up equipped {{with all of}} the commands available on a real bike. In particular, the rider’s actions are monitored by measuring the steering torque, leaning of the body, throttle position, front <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> and rear <b>brake</b> pedal pressures, clutch position and gearshift lever position.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Shimano {{introduced}} [...] "dual-control levers" [...] or STI for {{mountain bikes}} in their XTR groupset. Like the road shifters, XTR {{used the same}} <b>lever</b> for <b>braking</b> and shifting. This was met with some resistance as they limited the choice of disc brakes to only those made by Shimano. They are nicknamed, [...] "flippity shifters" [...] for the <b>brake</b> <b>lever's</b> ability {{to move in the}} vertical plane.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> clamp diameter.|$|R

40|$|KEY WORDS: cycling, breaking, {{handlebar}} hand positions INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the present}} study was to evaluate the effect of different kinds of handlebar hand positions on fast <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> reaching movements. More specifically, it was investigated whether the use of clip-on handlebars significantly altered the time taken to reach <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> compared to times obtained with traditional hand positions on the handlebar...|$|R
50|$|The RC8 R {{offers many}} chassis {{adjustments}} not found on other superbikes. In {{addition to the}} suspension, the rider can adjust many other parts on the bike including the front <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> the rear <b>brake</b> pedal, the clutch lever, the handlebars, the shifter, the footpegs, and the seat/subframe height. Essentially, the adjustable options allow the RC8 R to accommodate riders of various sizes.|$|R

50|$|The {{foot brake}} {{operates}} on the transmission and the <b>lever</b> <b>brakes</b> {{on the rear}} wheels. Both sets are of the internal expanding type. The adjustment for wear of the foot brake may be made by hand but adjustment of the rear brakes requires a spanner. Twelve months later front brakes were made available on new cars for a further £55. A year later again they were standardised on the 23-60 in July 1924 along with a redesigned front axle, springs and saddle-plate. Operated by the foot pedal the front brakes and the transmission brake were linked, the latter being given a slight lead. The brakes on the rear wheels were independently controlled by the handbrake lever.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992The ErgoPower levers are introduced, which {{combines}} <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> and a shift lever to answer Shimano's STI levers ...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} options is {{commonly}} found on flatland bikes. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes {{is the use}} of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatlanders will choose to run a front brake (or a dual front brake; one front brake with two <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> using one <b>brake</b> cable), front and rear brakes, or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference.|$|R

5000|$|Shimano Nexus is a {{brand of}} bicycle {{components}} which includes products such as epicyclical gear hubs, cranksets, shifters, <b>brake</b> <b>levers,</b> hub <b>brakes,</b> hub dynamos, and a CPU for automatically changing gears. The series is primarily aimed at the [...] "comfort" [...] market such as urban commuters and tourers, and as such is not made to withstand the rigours of off-road or mountain biking. The free-wheeling Nexus internal gear hubs are compatible with Shimano's [...] "roller brake", its version of a drum brake, {{but not with the}} Shimano disc brakes used with the higher-end Shimano Alfine internal gear hubs.|$|R

50|$|STI ("Shimano Total Integration") - The {{marketing}} terminology for {{the integration}} of shifting into the <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> for road bikes, enabling the rider to shift without taking the hands off the <b>brake</b> <b>levers.</b> This {{made it possible to}} shift during uphill passages that require getting out of the saddle, and added general convenience for the rider. Although first generation of STI was unable to downshift multiple cogs which wasn't a problem in downtube shifters.|$|R
50|$|The 'competition kit legends {{interior}} plus' includes Amalfi White body colour, {{front spoiler}} lip and rear diffuser in Begonia Red, legends graphics with gloss-black Number 1 {{on the hood}} and the doors, decorative bezels for the rearview mirror, air vents, door pull handles, center console; black cloth floor mats with Begonia Red, Stone Gray and Gray Brown strips; color accent on the leather sport steering wheel, gear shift <b>lever</b> and parking <b>brake</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ErgoPower levers {{contain the}} {{mechanism}} inside {{the main body}} of the unit, rather than in the top of the <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> as STI does, and there is no sideways action on the <b>brake</b> <b>lever.</b> Instead, the [...] "flipper" [...] that changes to a smaller cog on STI levers changes to a larger cog, and there is a small lever (sometimes called a 'mouse ear') on the inside of the brake hood body that shifts to a smaller cog.|$|R
50|$|Like the Astra it {{featured}} a rear-mounted 322 cc air-cooled engine mounted under {{the floor at}} the rear and all-round independent suspension with swing axles at the rear.
