5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E
5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E

Special strategies <b>of</b> integrated <b>care</b> may be required where multiple health care providers are involved, including horizontal integration (linking similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> e.g. multiprofessional teams) and vertical integration (linking different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary care).|$|R
5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coordination across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> is {{becoming}} increasingly important due to rapid advances in technology, high specialisation {{and changes in the}} organization of healthcare services; to date, however, the development of indicators to evaluate coordination has been limited. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop and test a set of indicators to comprehensively evaluate clinical coordination across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify indicators of clinical coordination across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> These indicators were analysed to identify attributes of coordination and classified accordingly. They were then discussed within an expert team and adapted or newly developed, and their relevance, scientific soundness and feasibility were examined. The indicators were tested in three healthcare areas of the Catalan health system. 52 indicators were identified addressing 11 attributes of clinical coordination across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> The final set consisted of 21 output indicators. Clinical information transfer is evaluated based on information flow (4) and the adequacy of shared information (3). Clinical management coordination indicators evaluate care coherence through diagnostic testing (2) and medication (1), provision <b>of</b> <b>care</b> at the most appropriate <b>level</b> (2), completion <b>of</b> diagnostic process (1), follow-up after hospital discharge (4) and accessibility across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> (4). The application of indicators showed differences in the degree of clinical coordination depending on the attribute and area. CONCLUSION:/nA set of rigorous and scientifically sound measures of clinical coordination across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> were developed based on a literature review and discussion with experts. This set of indicators comprehensively address the different attributes of clinical coordination in main transitions across <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> It could be employed to identify areas in which health services can be improved, as well as to measure the effect of efforts to improve clinical coordination in healthcare organizations. The research leading to these results received funding from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (PI 10 / 00348) and Fondos FEDER. The funding source had no involvement in the study design, nor in the collection, analysis and interpretations of data, or in the writing of the article and the decision to submit it for publication...|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{length of}} stay in {{neonatal}} care is vital to inform service planning and the counselling of parents. Preterm babies, at the highest risk of mortality, can have long stays in neonatal care and require high resource use. Previous work has incorporated babies that die into {{length of stay}} estimates, but this still overlooks the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> required during their stay. This work incorporates all babies, and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> they require, into length of stay estimates. Data {{were obtained from the}} National Neonatal Research Database for singleton babies born at 24 – 31 weeks gestational age discharged from a neonatal unit in England from 2011 to 2014. A Cox multistate model, adjusted for gestational age, was used to consider a baby’s two competing outcomes: death or discharge from neonatal care, whilst also considering the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> required: intensive care; high dependency care and special <b>care.</b> The probabilities <b>of</b> receiving each <b>of</b> the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> or having died or been discharged from neonatal care are presented graphically overall and adjusted for gestational age. Stacked predicted probabilities produced for each week of gestational age provide a useful tool for clinicians when counselling parents about length of stay and for commissioners when considering allocation of resources. Multistate modelling provides a useful method for describing the entire neonatal care pathway, where rates of in-unit mortality can be high. For a healthcare service focussed on costs, {{it is important to consider}} all babies that contribute towards workload, and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> they require...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{deinstitutionalisation}} of psychiatric service users, fragmentation in mental health care delivery systems has become a public mental health issue in many Western countries. Research indicate that it should be addressed at the system level. Leutz described three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> integration: linkage, coordination, and full integration. Within a European cross-national research on mental health in socially marginalised groups, we used several measures from Social Network Analysis to describe those three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> integration across inter-organisational networks of mental health and social care agencies. The study revealed gaps in the implementation <b>of</b> all three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> integration: <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> linkage (density) and coordination (centrality) were low across all networks, there were few fully integrated services, and these services were generally positioned in peripheral positions. We suggest that these social network indicators are relevant to compare integration models across different welfare systems...|$|R

25|$|By the 1950s, {{concerns}} about the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> children were receiving in institutions led to the closing down of some larger orphanages and children's homes and a move towards group care in smaller cottage and foster homes.

25|$|Critical care {{transporters}} move patients by ground ambulance or aircraft between {{medical treatment}} facilies.
