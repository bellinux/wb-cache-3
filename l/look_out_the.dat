25|$|Harlow's first {{experiments}} involved isolating {{a monkey}} {{in a cage}} surrounded by steel walls with a small one-way mirror, so the experimenters could look in, but the monkey could not <b>look</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> only connection the monkey had with the world was when the experimenters' hands changed his bedding or delivered fresh water and food. Baby monkeys were placed in these boxes soon after birth; four were left for 30 days, four for six months, and four for a year.|$|E
25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E

25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her a beaded necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E
500|$|The {{office and}} {{warehouse}} of the Scranton branch office were sets {{on the production}} company's office in Van Nuys, California, although a real office {{was used in the}} show's first season. For episodes in season two and beyond, scenes set in the parking lot made use of the exterior of the production company's office building. Since the stage set had no windows, writer Jennifer Celotta's office was dressed to look like Michael Scott's when the script called for him or someone else to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window into the parking lot. [...] In the second and subsequent seasons, the office interiors and exteriors are at a different location in Van Nuys.|$|E

500|$|Helen Baxendale {{was nearing}} the end of her pregnancy, so could not join the rest of the cast abroad, thus all of her scenes were filmed in Manchester and Salford. The scenes in Rachel and Adam's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford and {{exterior}} scenes of the hotel were filmed at the GMEX Centre. The taxi that takes Rachel and Adam to the hospital was a Holden car imported to Britain from Australia and altered to look like a taxi. The Loaf bar at Deansgate Locks provided a filming location for some scenes. The final scene of the episode was filmed on an aeroplane set constructed in a studio. Robert Bathurst said, [...] "We shot the scene in the studio because we weren't allowed to film on a real aircraft. So we had to get sections of a plane's interior and stick them all together. The bits were flapping all over the place whenever anyone moved. I had to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> porthole and have a weep. As I was doing that, I looked out and there through the window, standing where the wing should be, was the show's carpenter trying to hold the set together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another writer {{recalled}} {{the area around}} the Dunbar as [...] "a place where people love to congregate and have a good time, check out the new models and pick up on the latest lingo." [...] The Dunbar built a reputation in the 1930s as [...] "the symbol of L.A.'s black nightlife," [...] as [...] "regular jamming sessions and meetings in the hotel lobby elevated the structure to a practically mythical status." [...] Lionel Hampton had fond memories of jam sessions and practices on the Dunbar's mezzanine. Hampton recalled, [...] "Everybody that was anybody showed up at the Dunbar. [...] I remember a chauffeur would drive Stepin Fetchit, the movie star, up to the curb in a big Packard, and he'd <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window at all the folks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} of Love What You Do and <b>Look</b> <b>Out!,</b> <b>The</b> Hackensaws {{departed}} from Nettwerk Records to release two independently produced six-song EPs, The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1 and The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2 [...] These two collections are [...] "recommended for anyone who feels that time, popularity and (maybe) Don Was has watered down Old Crow Medicine Show, The Hackensaw Boys bring the Appalachian string band roots with punk rock flowers hard and raw." [...] The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in Richmond, Virginia. They were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with Look Out! in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the Library of Congress. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired {{by the fact that}} these were the last two recording projects {{to come out of the}} old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990 they {{released}} a compilation album, Look! Listen!!, which featured remixed versions of songs {{from their first}} two albums plus two new songs. At {{the end of that}} year Pleasance was diagnosed with tinnitus and was unable to perform with the group. He was temporarily replaced on bass guitar by former band mate from Serious Young Insects, Vallance. During his break from the band, in 1991, Pleasance released his debut solo album, Galleon. Late that year Boom Crash Opera released a four-track extended play, Dreams on Fire, with both Pleasance and Vallance aboard. The EP was produced by Keith Forsey and the band; it appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top50, and featured the track, [...] "Holy Water". In 1992 they travelled to Los Angeles and began work on a follow-up album, Fabulous Beast. However, during early writing sessions, Pleasance left the band and returned to Australia; he was temporarily replaced by Dorian West on bass guitar (ex-Wildland). It was during the recording of Fabulous Beast that the band found themselves impacted by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The song [...] "The Last Place On Earth", that appears on the album was inspired and written {{as a result of this}} experience. The final vocal line of Ryder's in the song which is [...] "just <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window", has his voice actually breaking due to being so emotionally moved by the experience.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window and I thought I saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reasonâ€” his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} deathâ€” if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibilityâ€” it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
