5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> a standing <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
5|$|Two people {{competed in}} track and field {{representing}} Bermuda: Tyrone Smith and Arantxa King. Smith participated in men's <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> while Arantxa King participated in women's <b>long</b> <b>jump.</b> Neither advanced past the qualifying rounds in Beijing.|$|E

5|$|For the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, two new multi-event {{disciplines}} were included, the pentathlon and the decathlon. A pentathlon, {{based on}} the ancient Greek event, had been introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games. The 1912 version consisted of the <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> javelin throw, 200-meter dash, discus throw and 1500-meter run.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher was {{selected}} to compete at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics in <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> 100m, shot put and discus, but she failed her classification test because the classifiers said the eyesight in her right eye was 0.01% better than it needed to be. In November 2009, her classification was revisited due to deterioration of her vision and she was deemed eligible to compete.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won {{four of the five}} events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place in the <b>long</b> <b>jump.</b> Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|The Ancient Olympic pentathlon (comprising <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> javelin, discus, the stadion {{race and}} wrestling) was a {{precursor}} to the track and field combined events and this ancient event was restored at the 1906 Summer Olympics (Intercalated Games). A men's all-around {{was held at the}} 1904 Summer Olympics, contested between five American and two British athletes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>long</b> <b>jump</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} track and field events, having its roots as one of the events within the ancient Greek pentathlon contest. The athletes would take a short run up and jump into an area of dug up earth, with the winner being the one who jumped farthest. Small weights (Halteres) were held in each hand during the jump then swung back and dropped near the end to gain extra {{momentum}} and distance. The modern <b>long</b> <b>jump,</b> standardised in England and the United States around 1860, bears resemblance to the ancient event although no weights are used. Athletes sprint along a length of track that leads to a jumping board and a sandpit. The athletes must jump before a marked line and their achieved distance is measured from the nearest point of sand disturbed by the athlete's body.|$|E
