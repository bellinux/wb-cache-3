50|$|Go Home Lake is a lake in west central Ontario in the Township of Georgian Bay, District of Muskoka. Go Home Lake is {{a natural}} lake which is {{actually}} part of the Musquash River system also spelled as Musquosh River on some maps. It was opened up as a recreational lake starting in the late 1950's when Crown Lands were surveyed, subdivided and auctioned off in Public Bids that took place from 1958 through 1962. In the early 60's the construction of two dams was completed, a permanent earthen dam at the Go Home River outlet and a stop <b>log</b> <b>dam</b> (control dam) at the Musquash River outlet. The intent of the dams was to control the water level to maintain a constant water level throughout the boating season eliminating the seasonal fluctuations in the water level.|$|R
40|$|Small {{branch and}} <b>log</b> <b>dams</b> {{are a new}} type of check dam used in small(~ 1 km²) basins to prevent {{infrastructure}} damage resulting from heavy precipitation. These dams are built to deposit sediments, reduce flood volume and mitigate hillslope processes. From a geomorphological perspective, this thesis addresses problems with small branch and <b>log</b> <b>dams,</b> and how to make them more resilient and sustainable in regard to erosion, sediment deposition, and flood control. During 2014 four dams were constructed in Soknedal, Norway, an area prone to flooding and landslides. Alterations in the dams were recorded during fieldwork undertaken throughout the Autumn and Winter of 2014 - 2015. These records are combined with theory to answer the aforementioned problems. A dry Autumn and Winter resulted in low dam activity, with no flooding or erosion recorded, nevertheless there was a noticeable amount of fine sediment deposition in two of the dams. Observations and theory suggest that these sediments will be subsequently eroded and transported downstream during a flood. One might consider constructing taller dams if rapid sediment deposition in a short time span is a problem. Taller dams require better erosion control, but would reduce the flood volume more efficiently. This thesis suggests that using step-pool morphology as inspiration when constructing several dams would result in a large amount of energy dissipation. Further research is needed to better record how dams respond to floods in respect to reducing flood volume, erosion and sediment transportation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{conventional}} context-aware {{services of the}} home net-work system (HNS), every context has been defined by current (or recent) situations only. Considering past situations in a house would significantly extend the expressive power of the context-aware services. In this paper, we propose {{a new type of}} context, called log context, by using house log of the HNS, extensively. The log context is defined with both the current and past situations, where the current situation is obtained by sensors or device status of the HNS while the past situations are derived by queries to the house log. We also develop a system that can derive the log contexts within an actual HNS. To manage individual log contexts efficiently, the system is designed by four layers: application <b>layer,</b> <b>log</b> context <b>layer,</b> <b>log</b> query <b>layer,</b> and DB connector layer.
