5000|$|Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers is a 1994 (2nd ed. 1998, 3rd ed. 2004) book by Stanford University {{biologist}} Robert M. Sapolsky. The book proclaims {{itself as}} a [...] "Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases, and Coping" [...] on the front cover of its third and most recent edition. The title derives from Sapolsky's idea that for animals such as zebras, stress is generally episodic (e.g., running away from a lion), while for humans, stress is often chronic (e.g., worrying about <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job).</b> Therefore, many wild animals are less susceptible than humans to chronic stress-related disorders such as ulcers, hypertension, decreased neurogenesis and increased hippocampal neuronal atrophy. However, chronic stress occurs in some social primates (Sapolsky studies baboons) for individuals on the lower side of the social dominance hierarchy.|$|R

Gerald Peary replies: Simply {{that if you are}} a print critic you are in danger of <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> at any moment. As {{newspapers}} are worried about dropping dead, it seems like film critics are a particular target. The film begins by saying, [...] "There are 24 critics who have lost their jobs in the last several years," [...] but since we finished the film, many more have lost their jobs. A lot of people are tagged with a title of ex-critic, but they were not ex when we filmed them just a few years ago. Sure, you can work on the web, but if you do that you're not getting paid much, or at all. And critics should be paid — this isn't an amateur thing to do, it's not like Sunday painting.|$|R

40|$|Confidence is {{a feeling}} of trust in someone or something. To be self-confident is to have {{confidence}} in yourself. Self-confident people don't doubt themselves.

Self-esteem is affected by physical illhealth, negative life events such as <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> or getting divorced, deficient or frustrating relationships, and a general sense of lack of control.

Intelligently composed and powerfully driven, Freedom Summer is a stirring historical document. It would seem an essential addition for any university library." [...] Dawn Baumgartner Vaughan of Herald Sun, about the film said that [...] "“Freedom Summer,” {{for those who were}} born after 1964, brings home a time when wanting to vote meant threats of death on one extreme end, and <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> on the other.

If the projects, he said, are all undertaken simultaneously [...] "half of China's population unquestionably will die; and if it's not half, it'll be a third or ten percent, a death toll of 50 million people." [...] Mao then pointed to the example of Guangxi provincial Party secretary, Chén Mànyuǎn (陳漫遠) who had been dismissed in 1957 for failing to prevent famine in the previous year, adding: [...] "If with a death toll of 50 million you didn't <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> <b>jobs,</b> I at least should lose mine; whether I should lose my head would also be in question.

5000|$|But {{before the}} {{interviewees}} were approached, the film {{had already been}} pitched to Stein as an anti-Darwinist picture: I was approached {{a couple of years}} ago by the producers, and they described to me the central issue of Expelled, which was about Darwinism and why it has such a lock on the academic establishment when the theory has so many holes. And why freedom of speech has been lost at so many colleges to the point where you can't question even the slightest bit of Darwinism or your colleagues will spurn you, you'll <b>lose</b> <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> and you'll be publicly humiliated. As they sent me books and talked to me about these things I became more enthusiastic about participating.Plus I was never a big fan of Darwinism because it played such a large part in the Nazis' Final Solution to their so-called [...] "Jewish problem" [...] and was so clearly instrumental in their rationalizing of the Holocaust.

5000|$|Gordon and Rosemary {{have little}} time together—she works late {{and lives in}} a hostel, and his 'bitch of a landlady' forbids female {{visitors}} to her tenants. Then one evening, having headed southward and having been thinking about women—this women business in general, and Rosemary in particular—he happens to see Rosemary in a street market. Rosemary won't {{have sex with him}} but she wants to spend a Sunday with him, right out in the country, near Burnham Beeches. At their parting, as he takes the tram from Tottenham Court Road back to his bedsit, he is happy and feels that somehow it is agreed between them that Rosemary is going to be his mistress. However, what was intended as a pleasant day out away from London's grime turns into a disaster when, though hungry, they opt to pass by a 'rather low-looking' pub, and then, not able to find another pub, are forced to eat an unappetising lunch at a fancy, overpriced hotel. Gordon has to pay the bill with all the money he had set aside for their jaunt and worries about having to borrow money from Rosemary. Out in the countryside again, they are about to have sex for the first time when she violently pushes him back—he wasn't going to use contraception. He rails at her; [...] "Money again, you see! ...

40|$|Loss of hand {{function}} can be {{a frightening}} experience, the hand {{is an integral part}} of what makes us human. Nowhere else in the body is there such an amazing and complex functioning of bones, joints, muscles, tendons, nerves, blood vessels and skin as in the hand. The proper function and balance of all these elements is required for the hand to function to its full potential. The hands are the primary tool for interacting with our environment and, through touch, are also crucial for receiving information about our surroundings. About a quarter of the motor cortex in the human brain (the part of the brain which controls all movement in the body) is devoted to the muscles of the hands. This is usually illustrated with a drawing of a human figure draped over the side of the brain, body parts sized proportional to the amount of brain devoted to their movement, referred to as a homunculus - as illustrated in this drawing from Dr. Wilder Penfield’s monograph “The Cerebral Cortex of Man”. Until illness or injury forces people to focus on the importance of their hands, few people ever consider the consequences of being unable to use them. Any loss of hand function can have serious economic and psychological consequences. In fact, losing the use of your hand often means <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job.</b> Our hands are also part of our identity. Patients with severe upper extremity injuries can suffer psychologically from post-traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately, we often fail to appreciate the function of the upper limb until it is injured, and that happens quite often...|$|R
5000|$|Galeano {{begins his}} {{analysis}} with the students, and eventually {{looks at the}} role of teachers in the classroom. Finally {{he moves to the}} employment industry, analyzing the lessons learned from commercialism and from the general society. He divides the students into social class based on familial economic standings and sees the futures of students based on these economic standings as being pre-set. Poor kids are disrespected for being poor, rich kids are respected for being rich, and rich and poor kids end up in the same position as their parents. Further distinguishing between the social classes, he explains that rich children in Latin America never experience the city they live in; they live in a sheltered, private, improved version of it. Galeano claims that these children see their own societies [...] "as a threat," [...] and therefore are [...] "stripped of cultural identity". Poor children, on the other hand, are [...] "dodging real bullets" [...] and [...] "little slaves in the family economy of in the informal sector of the global economy". In Latin American society, poor children are seen as potential disasters after they are victimized in child labor, the sex trade and sweat shop labor. Galeano demonstrates that the current system of [...] "education" [...] locks poor children in their social space in ways that often cause additional social grief. Galeano shares the personal story of a street kid who looks to drugs to rid himself of all the problems he faces in his daily life of poverty. Meanwhile, the children that lie somewhere between rich and poor taught the [...] "fear of living, fear of falling, fear of <b>losing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> <b>your</b> car, your home, your possessions, fear of never having what you ought to have in order to be". [...] Teachers, after the redistribution of jobs so that jobs are now almost all temporary, have had to accept that teaching [...] "does not pay". Galeano points out that it is counterintuitive to be financially unappreciative of those who are greatly involved in forming the next generation of workers and citizens.|$|R
