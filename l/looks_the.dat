5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the mouth to the opposite end). However, since {{only two of the}} canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry, in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same as when it started.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{observable}} Universe is isotropic on scales significantly {{larger than}} superclusters, {{meaning that the}} statistical properties of the Universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin. The hypothesis that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic {{is known as the}} cosmological principle. A Universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same from all vantage points and has no center.|$|E

5|$|Unlike our universe, {{which is}} now known to be {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant, whereas the real universe has a small positive cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same {{no matter}} how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a {{flashback}} to 1956, when 16-year-old Emily Locke (Holland Roden) is preparing for {{a date with a}} man twice her age. Her mother tries to stop her from going out, but Emily escapes and is struck by a car. The trauma triggers the premature birth of John (as an adult portrayed by Terry O'Quinn). John's life is monitored by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who at John's birth and throughout his childhood <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same age as he does in present day, and Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick), each of whom attempts to influence his life. The existence of Mittelos Bioscience is revealed when John is invited to spend the summer there as a highly gifted high-school student.|$|E

5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good <b>looks.</b> <b>The</b> reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E

25|$|The term lichenoid {{reaction}} (or lichenoid lesion) {{refers to}} a lesion of similar or identical histopathologic and clinical appearance to lichen planus (i.e. an area which <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same as lichen planus, both {{to the naked eye}} and under a microscope). Sometimes dental materials or certain medications can cause a lichenoid reaction. They can also occur in association with graft versus host disease.|$|E

25|$|Many {{interesting}} {{transformations of}} images do not form groups. For instance, transformations of images associated with 3D rotation of corresponding 3D object do not form a group, {{because it is}} impossible to define an inverse transformation (two objects may <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same from one angle but different from another angle). However, approximate invariance is still achievable even for non-group transformations, if localization condition for templates holds and transformation can be locally linearized.|$|E
25|$|The Tuscan {{order has}} a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a {{simplified}} adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it {{is similar to the}} Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> most solid.|$|E

25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called linearity, since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved. The linearity {{of the transformation}} reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, {{but there is nothing}} absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.|$|E
25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|Amber Lewis' {{sculpture}} {{is similar}} to the readymade in that each component of the artwork is readily available when you step outside (tree and rocks) or can be easily bought at any local hardware store (rope and bucket.) This piece diverts from Duchamp's readymades in that Lewis' sculpture can not be easily moved since it is site specific and is hung from a tree which is immobile. Part of the sculpture is the way the tree changes over time and never <b>looks</b> <b>the</b> same from day to day. The tree from which the bucket hangs is constantly changing with the seasons. In winter the tree has no leaves, but blooms in the spring to eventually create leaves in the summer, only to drop them in the fall.|$|E
