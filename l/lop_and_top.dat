60|$|Mrs Varden's chief aider and abettor, and at {{the same}} time her {{principal}} victim and object of wrath, was her single domestic servant, one Miss Miggs; or as she was called, in conformity with those prejudices of society which <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>top</b> from poor hand-maidens all such genteel excrescences--Miggs. This Miggs was a tall young lady, very much addicted to pattens in private life; slender and shrewish, of a rather uncomfortable figure, and though not absolutely ill-looking, of a sharp and acid visage. As a general principle and abstract proposition, Miggs held the male sex to be utterly contemptible and unworthy of notice; to be fickle, false, base, sottish, inclined to perjury, and wholly undeserving. When particularly exasperated against them (which, scandal said, was when Sim Tappertit slighted her most) she was accustomed to wish with great emphasis that the whole race of women could but die off, in order that the men might be brought to know the real value of the blessings by which they set so little store; nay, her feeling for her order ran so high, that she sometimes declared, if she could only have good security for a fair, round number--say ten thousand--of young virgins following her example, she would, to spite mankind, hang, drown, stab, or poison herself, with a joy past all expression.|$|E
40|$|Restoring {{afforested}} peat bogs: {{results of}} current research The value of peat bogs as open habitats and stores of carbon {{may be lost}} if they are planted with trees. The number of bogs being restored is increasing but still modest in scale relative {{to the area of}} afforested peatland. Research is currently being carried out to determine the feasibility and methodology for restoring afforested bogs. Two experiments were set up to compare a range of methods for managing trees and drainage. In the blanket bog experiment, treatments that involved both felling trees and damming plough furrows were more successful than others in terms of raising the water table. Bog vegetation recovered rapidly in the felled treatments, particularly those with furrows dammed. In the lowland raised bog experiment, the water table rose dramatically in all treatments. Only during a prolonged dry summer was there a difference between treatments, the water table falling deeper in the whole-tree removal than in the fell-to-waste treatment, with conventional harvesting intermediate. Bog vegetation recovered best in the whole-tree removal treatments and least well in the fell-to-waste treatments. Felling is necessary for restoring afforested bogs, but removing <b>lop</b> <b>and</b> <b>top</b> is not. Damming plough furrows can help to restore blanket bog but damming main drains may suffice on lowland raised bogs. Damming furrows is ineffective if the peat is severely cracked. Tree seedlings often colonise bogs undergoing restoration – removing brash mats after harvesting and periodic maintenance should reduce this problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} {{we focus on}} the problem of prob-abilistic sensor fusion in Multi-Robot Multi-Sensor Systems (MRMS), taking into account that some sensors might fail or produce {{erroneous}} information. We study fusion methods that can successfully cope with situations of agreement, partial agreement, and disagreement between sensors. We define a set of specifications for fusion methods appropriate for MRMS environments. In light of these specifications, we review two popular algorithms for probabilistic sensor fusion, Linear Opinion Pool (<b>LOP)</b> <b>and</b> Logarithmic Opinion Pool (LGP). To overcome difficulties of applying them to a MRMS setting, a new method is introduced, p-norm Opinion Pool (POP). Comparing to <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> LGP, POP is more compatible with the specifications and more flexible, successfully handling situations of agreement and disagreement between sensors. Through simu-lation and real-world experiments, we check performance of the POP and compare it with <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> LGP. We also implement a real-world experiment through which the performance of POP is examined. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For a {{wireless}} communications network, Local Pool-ing (LoP) is a desirable property {{due to its}} sufficiency for the optimality of low-complexity greedy scheduling techniques. However, LoP in network graphs with a primary interference model requires an edge sparsity that may be prohibitive to other desirable properties in wireless networks, such as connectivity. In this paper, we investigate {{the impact of the}} edge density on both <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> the size of the largest component under the primary interference model, as the number of nodes in the network grows large. For both Erdős-Rényi (ER) and random geometric (RG) graphs, we employ threshold functions to establish crit-ical values for either the edge probability or communication radius necessary for these properties to hold. These thresholds demonstrate that <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> connectivity (or even the presence of a giant component) cannot both hold asymptotically as the network grows in size for a large class of edge probability or communication radius functions. We then use simulation to explore this problem in the regime of small network sizes, which suggests the probability that an ER or RG graph satisfies <b>LoP</b> <b>and</b> contains a giant component decays quickly with the size of the network. Index Terms—local pooling; greedy maximal scheduling; pri-mary interference; random graphs; connectivity; giant compo-nent. I...|$|R
40|$|Since in {{patients}} with Cushing's disease, unlike in normal subjects, tonic inhibitory opioid control of ACTH secretion does not operate, use of the opiate agonist loperamide (LOP) has recently been proposed in the diagnosis of hypercortisolemic states. We compared the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the LOP test (16 mg orally) with corresponding results of the dexamethasone test (DXM, 1 mg orally overnight) in 23 normal subjects and {{in a total of}} 42 patients, affected by Cushing's disease (n = 8), incidentally discovered adrenal masses with impaired function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (n = 6), obesity (n = 21) and depression (n = 7). While in controls both DXM <b>and</b> <b>LOP</b> strongly suppressed plasma cortisol and ACTH, in Cushing's disease and in incidentalomas no patient showed a decrease in cortisol levels below 50 ng/ml or a reduction in plasma cortisol greater than 50 % of basal values in response to <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM. In obese subjects both drugs significantly reduced plasma cortisol and ACTH without giving false positive results. In the depressed group only 3 / 7 patients showed a decrement in cortisol levels below 50 ng/ml after LOP in contrast to 6 / 7 after DXM. Thus, {{in patients}} with impairment of the HPA-axis, i. e. in Cushing's disease and {{in patients with}} adrenal incidentalomas <b>and</b> hormonal abnormalities, <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM test sensitivity was 100 %. In controls and in obese patients specificity was 100 % both with <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM, while in depressed patients it was 43 % and 86 % with <b>LOP</b> <b>and</b> DXM, respectively. In conclusion, since the diagnostic accuracy of the LOP test (94. 9 %) is slightly lower as compared to DXM (98. 5 %), use of loperamide gives no additional advantages in diagnosis of hypercortisolemic states. However, in account of its good specificity, the LOP test may be considered a complementary diagnostic procedure to DXM in pathological conditions such as obesity in which the DXM test may give false positive results...|$|R

40|$|Most {{analyses}} {{of the impact of}} community management of common property resources are based on cross-sectional comparisons in case studies or small samples, perception-based measurement of resource conditions, and absence of controls for unobserved community characteristics and non-random assignment of management types. This paper compares forests managed by local community groups called Van Panchayats (VPs), with protected and unprotected state forests in the Indian state of Uttaranchal. We utilize ground-level ecological measures of forest quality including canopy cover, biomass, <b>lopping</b> <b>and</b> regeneration in 399 forests accessed by residents of a random sample of 83 villages in the mid-Himalayan region of Uttaranchal. Raw differences between VP and non-VP forest quality indicate no significant differences. We find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that these understate the benefits of VP management owing to endogenous selection, since more degraded forests {{are more likely to be}} converted to VP forests. Controlling for forest geography, unobserved village characteristics and cross-forest spillovers, VP forests are significantly less <b>lopped,</b> <b>and</b> similar on other dimensions. The lopping differences are greater the longer the forest has been under a VP. ...|$|R
