30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>polarisation</b> in Spain using Spanish task data to measure the job content of occupations. Through the analysis, I show graphically and empirically that employment in Spain became polarised between 1994 and 2014. However, {{there is no evidence}} of a similar trend in wages, unlike previous findings from the US. The sample suggests that jobs in bottom and top occupations increased, while employment shares decreased in the middle of the distribution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} how the demography of households relates to individual <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> outcomes. We comprehensively examine household size and structures in the October Household Surveys 1995, 1997, 1999 and the Labour Force Surveys September 2001 and 2002. Over the 1995 - 2002 period, the number of households has increased {{in the face of}} rising unemployment and the average household size has decreased signifi cantly. A rising proportion of single households mostly drives this result. We further investigate how such changes in the patterns of household composition could be correlated to changes in labour force participation rates, unemployment rates, and employment rates. We fi nd that employment rates in smaller households are substantially higher und unemployment rates lower than in larger households with more than two adult members. The shares of workless households where no member is employed, and fully employed households, where all working age adult members earn income from work, tell about employment polarisation. In particular, the share of households with unemployed members has doubled to 27 per cent in 2002, and the share of workless households, in which no member is employed, has risen to a third of all South African households. The results highlight some of the wider welfare effects of job losses and other economic variables on households in South Africa.

Arguably, few places have experienced these processes to such detrimental affect as the Vauxhall ward in north Liverpool, which possesses one of the highest levels of unemployment in the country. During 1990 I was employed by the Eldonian Development Trust to conduct a skills survey of the population of Vauxhall, as a community led attempt to redress this situation. This thesis combines detailed analysis of the skills audit, entitled the Vauxhall Job Link Survey, with the results of a complementary, qualitative research approach, in an attempt to understand why such {{a large proportion of the}} area's population are excluded from paid employment. To develop its arguments the research also draws extensively on a variety of secondary data sources. The findings of the research are related to existing <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> and social <b>polarisation</b> theories. The thesis reveals that the dual processes of deindustrialisation and counterurbanisation have led to a small, residual population remaining in Vauxhall, which is poorly placed to compete for the limited number of job opportunities arising in the city. Detailed analysis by gender reveals that the position of many women is particularly poor. It is propounded that one reason for this is the particular patriarchal relationship that has developed in the area over the last two centuries, with very clearly defined roles of male and female economic activity...|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} was to analyze {{differences}} in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> performance in various <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> regimes during and after the latest recession. Different <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> regimes had specific paths of adjustments to recessional macroeconomic shocks, which can be related to underlying <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> institutions, as well as other institutional characteristics. Reaction of European <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> on economic crisis 2008 ‐ 2009 varied across the Member States.

Key determinants of flexibility and security balance in the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> are: employment protection legislation, unemployment benefits system and active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policies.

However, its real impacts on <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> conditions are ambiguous. Although the literature concerning effectiveness of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policy (ALMP) measures is extensive, there is no conclusive evidence regarding which ALMP measures are efficient and to what extent. The effectiveness of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policy depends on many circumstances including characteristics of a given measure and conditions in a corresponding <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> Therefore, decisions regarding implementation of ALMP measures {{should be based on}} high- quality and systematic evaluation of impacts of these measures in the given <b>labour</b> <b>market.</b> In the Czech Republic there is no regular system of active <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> policy evaluation, but the need for evaluation is even more urgent in the current economic crisis.
