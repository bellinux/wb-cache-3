This meant the bases would require <b>launch</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning</b> authority, which was politically unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|Mukachevo {{radar station}} was a Soviet radar station {{providing}} early warning of ballistic missile attack. It {{was located in}} Shipka in the far south west of Ukraine and {{was part of the}} Soviet, and then Russian missile attack warning system.

40|$|Long-range nuclear-armed cruise {{missiles}} are highly accurate and {{are capable of}} reaching most targets within the United States and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) from launch points beyond their borders. Neither the United States nor the CIS has air surveillance systems capable of providing reliable warning against {{cruise missiles}}. Thus {{it is possible that}} a small-scale cruise missile attack could go entirely undetected until the nuclear weapons arrived over their targets. Such an attack could destroy the other country's entire strategic bomber force on the ground and severely damage its strategic command and control system, perhaps to the point of endangering the ability of its ICBM force to be <b>launched</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning.</b> This capability makes long-range nuclear cruise missiles potentially one of the most destabilizing of all nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|Because fixed missile bases {{have become}} {{increasingly}} vulnerable to strategic nuclear attack, an air-mobile missile system is proposed, whereby ICBMs can be launched from the hold of large subsonic aircraft following a missile-assisted supersonic dash of the aircraft to a safe distance from their base (about 50 n mi). Three major categories of vehicle design are presented: staged, which employs vertical take-off and a single solid rocket booster {{similar to that used}} on the Space Shuttle; unstaged, which employs vertical take-off and four internally-carried reusable liquid rocket engines; and alternative concepts, some using horizontal take-off with duct-burning afterburners. Attention is given to the economics of maintaining 200 ICBMs airborne during an alert (about $ 600 million for each fleet alert, exclusive of acquisition costs). The chief advantages of the system lie in its reduced vulnerability to suprise attack, because it can be <b>launched</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning,</b> and in the possibility for recall of the aircraft if the warning proves to be a false alarm...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{on how to}} redress the perceived vulnerability of U. S. intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMS) is the most controversial strategic nuclear weapon decision now facing the 97 th Congress. A full-scale debate on this issue, especially as regards MX missile basing, seems certain. To assist Members of Congress in the debate, this paper discusses nine proposals for treating ICBM survivability: Recognize that ICBMs are invulnerable, rely only on bombers and submarines for deterrence, deploy a large or scaled-down shell-game multiple shelter system, defend MX with anti ballistic missiles, <b>launch</b> ICBMs <b>on</b> <b>warning</b> of attack, deploy MX on aircraft or small submarines, and diversify strategic forces, perhaps using small ICBMs...|$|R
2500|$|The 820th Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning (...) is the Russian {{early warning}} network against {{ballistic}} missile attack. It has {{headquarters in the}} village of Timonovo [...] near Solnechnogorsk outside Moscow and is part of the Russian Space Forces. The centre consists of a network of early warning radar stations which transmit their data to the control centre near Solnechnogorsk. Other information comes from the early warning Oko and EKS satellites as well as the Don-2N missile defence radar. Information from the centre could be used for a <b>launch</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning</b> nuclear missile attack or to engage the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system.|$|E
2500|$|When {{faced with}} such an attack, {{it might not be}} {{immediately}} clear what the targets are. The only way to be sure would be to wait until well into the attack and then respond in kind. This took long enough that some portion of the US fleet would be caught on the ground, and this [...] "retaliation after ride-out" [...] concept was considered too risky. Instead, the US policy moved to <b>launch</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning,</b> where they would respond to an attack {{as soon as it was}} clear one was in the making. This was not ideal, as it required them to maintain a high alert level that increased the risk of an accidental launch.|$|E
2500|$|Livermore is {{just one}} of several major US weapons labs. Other labs had been working on ideas of their own, from new space or {{ground-based}} missiles, to chemical lasers, to particle beam weapons. Angelo Codevilla argued for similar funding for powerful chemical lasers as well. None of these efforts was taken very seriously by members of the Carter administration. In a meeting with Teller and Lowell Wood, a critic noted that the Soviets could easily defeat the system by attacking the satellite, whose only defense, if it had been unarmed, was to destroy itself. However this may have been rectified if the satellite also included a means of self-defense, and would not have been the first satellite to have a defense system, as a revolver cannon (Rikhter R-23) was mounted on the 1974 Soviet Salyut 3 space station, a satellite that successfully test fired its cannon in orbit. The critics also suggested that the US public would be unlikely to accept nuclear bombs in space, regardless of the potential benefits. At the time Teller was stymied by these arguments; the concept was later adapted to a [...] "pop-up", or <b>launch</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning</b> system, where the X-ray laser would be launched, or [...] "popped-up" [...] into space from ballistic missile submarines.|$|E
40|$|Former Australian Foreign Minister and {{president}} of the International Crisis Group Gareth Evans discusses the difficult issues around nuclear disarmament in the 18 th annual Stephen Murray-Smith Lecture. This lecture was held at the State Library of Victoria on 14 September 2009. "The present reality is this. Twenty {{years after the end of}} the Cold War there are at least 23, 000 nuclear warheads still in existence, nearly every one of them having many times the destructive power of the bomb that devastated Hiroshima: over 9, 000 of these are in the hands of the U. S., around 13, 000 in the hands of Russia, and around 1000 with the other nuclear-armed states: China, France, the UK, Israel, India and Pakistan. Nearly half of all these weapons – some 10, 000 - remain operationally deployed. And, most extraordinarily of all, over 2000 of the US and Russian weapons remain on “hair trigger alert”, ready to be <b>launched</b> <b>on</b> <b>warning</b> in the event of a perceived attack, within a decision window for each President of four to eight minutes. Given what we now know about how many times the very sophisticated command and control systems of the Cold War years were strained by mistakes and false alarms, and what we both know and can guess about how much more sophisticated cyber attacks on defence systems may get in the years ahead, it is hard to believe that our Cold War luck can continue in perpetuity. " Gareth Evans AO is President Emeritus of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, an independent organisation which works to prevent and resolve deadly conflict. He spent 21 years in Australian politics, 13 of them as a Cabinet Minister and eight as Foreign Minister. He has written or edited nine books – most recently The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and for All, and has published over 100 journal articles and chapters on foreign relations, human rights and legal and constitutional reform. In recent years he co-chaired several international commissions, including the Blix Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction (2006), and has also been a member of the UN Secretary General 2 ̆ 7 s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. In June 2008, he was appointed co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, and now works from Australia as an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne...|$|R
40|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence that psychiatric drugs cause violence: 22 international drug regulatory warnings cite violence, mania, hostility, aggression, psychosis and even homicidal ideation.
