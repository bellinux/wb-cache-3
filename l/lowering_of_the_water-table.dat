40|$|The {{succession}} {{process of}} interest in this study, the succession of fens and bogs, is driven to a large extent by the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water-table</b> level as Sphagnum moss and vascular plants invade the habitat. I used a plasticity experiment to compare the phenotypic responses of two groups of sedges (Carex; Cyperaceae) to a water-table gradient: a group of pioneer species, C. aquatilis, C. oligosperma and C. rostrata, that also persist throughout the succession sequence and a group of late-invading species, C. michauxiana, C. paupercula and C. vaginata. The genotypes in the study exhibited largely uniform, adaptive responses on seven functional response variables, but were stable for total biomass, an estimator of fitness. The percentage of significant environment main effects per species and the magnitudes of genotypic coefficients of variation suggested greater plasticity in the late-invading species while reaction norms indicated no difference in pattern of plasticity between the groups. A second experiment made an intra-specific comparison of morphological response between early and late successional populations of both C. aquatilis and C. rostrata to a continuous water-table gradient.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of drainage of a highland Haplic Histosol on CH 4 fluxes. Field research was carried out in Ponta Grossa (Paraná, Brazil) based on the measurement of CH 4 fluxes by the static chamber method in natural and drained Histosol, over one year (17 sampling events). The natural Histosol showed net CH 4 eflux, with rates varying from 238 ?g m- 2 h- 1 CH 4, in cool/cold periods, to 2, 850 ?g m- 2 h- 1 CH 4, in warm/hot periods, resulting a cumulative emission of 116 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 CH 4. In the opposite, the drained Histosol showed net influx of CH 4 (- 39 to - 146 ?g m- 2 h- 1), which resulted in a net consumption of 9 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 CH 4. The main driving factors of CH 4 consumption in the drained soil were the <b>lowering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water-table</b> (on average - 57 cm, vs - 7 cm in natural soil) and the lower water content in the 0 - 10 cm layer (average of 5. 5 kg kg- 1, vs 9. 9 kg kg- 1 in natural soil). Although waterlogged Histosols of highland areas are regarded as CH 4 sources, they fulfill fundamental functions in the ecosystem, such as the accumulation of organic carbon (581 Mg ha- 1 C to a depth of 1 m) and water (8. 6 million L ha- 1 = 860 mm to a depth of 1 m). For this reason, these soils must not be drained as an alternative to mitigate CH 4 emission, but effectively preserved. 201...|$|E

Increase of depth to thewater table through peat accumulation resulted in increased cover of ericaceous shrubs at previously moister microhabitats.

40|$|The current {{engineering}} design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway drainage layer is typically {{based on the}} groundwater table elevation predicted by saturated flow models. Capillary effects may become significant, with unsaturated flow playing {{an important role in}} conducting water out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drainage layer. With the capillarity neglected, saturated flow models such as the Boussinesq equation-based model (BM) and the Laplace equation-based model (LM) over predict the groundwater table elevation. This paper aims to modify the traditional BM to account for the capillary effects on the drainage. A correction term was added to the BM to incorporate predominantly horizontal flow in the unsaturated zone above <b>the</b> <b>water-table,</b> with vertical flow neglected.

It crops out at surface and in the cave, and resulted from <b>the</b> filling <b>of</b> a collapse chamber, which was de-roofed by erosion. The present investigation confirmed that the cave and the Sterkfontein Formation {{are part of a}} single speleogenetic event. The breccia resulted from cavity filling by sediments introduced from a pit entrance, whereas many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phreatic passages around it, which are developed at the same elevation, were only partly filled or remained entirely open up to present. This fill-ing took place mainly in a vadose environment. Taking into account <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sterkfontein Formation (> 3, 3 - 1, 5 My, from base to top), <b>the</b> geomorphic evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape and <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> other caves in the region, it seems that the cave might have started to form 5 My ago.

30|$|The {{computed}} {{discharge from}} a kariz {{is sensitive to}} model dimensions, kariz placement within the model, domain hydraulic conductivity, and water-table and kariz gradients. Our tests suggest that K k/K xy is optimum at 107, and the model domain with little flowline deviation near the model boundaries is 2000  m ×  1000  m ×  50 – 150  m. The model depth has small influence on computed kariz discharge once the water depth is 50  m or greater, with kariz discharge increasing by 13  % when the water depth increased by 110  m (50 – 160  m). The kariz location {{should be at least}} 100  m from all model boundaries. The domain hydraulic conductivity strongly influences kariz discharge, with discharge (m 3  day− 1) equal to about 25 times the K xy (m day− 1). Kariz discharge approximately doubles for a doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water-table</b> gradient, although this factor increases for larger domains. Kariz discharge is an exponential function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kariz in contact with the water table, until the entire kariz length is in contact with the water table. A pumping well positioned at the kariz end successfully simulates removal <b>of</b> water from <b>the</b> model {{in the same way that}} water is discharged from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a kariz. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DRAIN module is partially successful in the drain output approaches the 22  L sec− 1 median kariz flow rate, but is unrealistic in that it removes water from the model over the entire 1  km length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drain, rather than just at the lower end.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of near-surface seismic-wave {{velocity}} of granular materials plays a valuable role in seismic exploration data processing. I {{will use the}} surface-wave analysis method for estimation of shear-wave velocity profile and P-wave refraction for estimation of pressure-wave velocity on a data set acquired over a sand dune in The Netherlands, a dune area part <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Holland coast. For surface-wave analysis I exploit {{the fact that in}} these materials the velocity profile follows a power-law and I invert for the power-law coefficients using a Monte Carlo inversion. A second power-law is introduced into the Monte Carlo inversion to recover vertically varying structures. The P-wave refraction is applied for estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groundwater depth and P-wave velocity. After the seismic data were acquired, several analyses were made on the extracted dispersion curves from different sources, windowing in space domain indicate <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> lateral variation. <b>The</b> estimated shear-wave velocity profiles demonstrates <b>the</b> usefulness <b>of</b> imposing a power-law trend to the velocity. Although the inverted power-law coefficients results into small differences with the literature and theoretical values, these can be explained by <b>the</b> varying shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grains. Furthermore, <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second power-law results into velocities that are lower than the first layer. <b>The</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shear-wave velocity profiles is limited by <b>the</b> shallow position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water-table</b> around 3 m.

40|$|International audienceThe "Niayes" peat {{deposits}} {{north of}} Dakar, in Senegal, provide an unusual {{opportunity to study}} the continental and littoral detrital environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocene in West Africa. These organic deposits, that may attain a thickness of 10 m, accumulated in Late Pleistocene interdune basins whose extend morphology depend closely upon <b>the</b> palaeohydrologic evolution <b>of</b> and <b>the</b> continental model for this zone during the Holocene. The present sub-Canarian climate of this region allows <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> an azonal vegetation of Guinean chorological affinity that is evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider development <b>of</b> now more southerly vegetation during the older Holocene. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sedimentary facies <b>of</b> these peatfields {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> altitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basins <b>of</b> accumulation and <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fresh/salt water interface which conditions <b>the</b> recharge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shallow aquifer. Thus, fresh-water and mangrove-swamp peats exist more or less closely associated according to the site. 14 C age determinations gives ages for these deposits between 12000 B. P. and the present, and detailed palynological studies have shown that there were two periods of climatic optimum, one between 9000 and 7000 B. P. and one between 4000 and 2000 B. P. The highly variable rates of sedimentation (0. 2 - 12, 5 mm/y for the continental zones and 2 mm/y for the mangrove swamps) are related to <b>the</b> paleotopography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water-table</b> or to very local fluctuations <b>of</b> sea level. <b>The</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vegetal biomass, evaluated both qualitatively (relative representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various vegetation levels) and quantitatively (concentration of pollen per gram of dry sediment) during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocene enables reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete climatic and hydrologic history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region up to <b>the</b> dawn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Present...|$|R
