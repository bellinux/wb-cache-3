30|$|When {{examining}} {{the independent variable}} Exposure, <b>laundering</b> had a different influence than light exposure on color compositions of mordanted and nonmordanted dyed specimens. For black walnut, mordanted and nonmordanted specimens were greener (a*) and bluer (b*) when subjected to <b>laundering</b> (Table  3). Mordanted specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted specimens but only before <b>laundering.</b> After <b>laundering,</b> b* value became similar for both mordanted and nonmordanted. For Osage orange, mordanted specimens were redder (a*) than nonmordanted before <b>laundering,</b> but a* of both became similar after <b>laundering.</b> Mordanted Osage orange was also yellower (b*) and nonmordanted Osage orange was bluer (b*) after <b>laundering.</b> For eastern redcedar, specimens turned lighter, redder, and bluer after <b>laundering</b> both for mordanted and nonmordanted. When visually inspecting the specimens, mordanted and <b>laundered</b> Osage orange was a brighter and clearer yellow when compared to nonmordanted.

5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would <b>launder</b> income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E
