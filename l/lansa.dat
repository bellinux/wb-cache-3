5|$|<b>LANSA</b> Flight 502 was a Lockheed L-188A Electra {{operated}} by Líneas Aéreas Nacionales Sociedad Anónima (<b>LANSA)</b> which crashed shortly after takeoff from Quispiquilla Airport near Cusco, Peru, on August 9, 1970, after losing all power {{from one of}} its engines. The four-engine turboprop aircraft, registered OB-R-939, was bound from Cusco to Lima, carrying 8 crew and 92 passengers. All {{but one of the}} occupants died from injuries sustained from impact forces and post crash fire. Two people on the ground were also killed. There were 49 American high school exchange students on board, all of whom perished. A Peruvian government investigation concluded that the accident was caused by improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, aggravated by lack of maintenance and overloading. <b>LANSA</b> was fined and its operations were suspended for 90 days. At the time, the crash was the deadliest ever in Peruvian history.|$|E
5|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{investigated the}} accident, {{and in its}} final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel. There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by <b>LANSA</b> employees during the investigation process. The Peruvian government subsequently fined <b>LANSA</b> {{and some of its}} employees, and suspended the airline's operating license for 90 days as a consequence.|$|E
5|$|About a {{year after}} the accident, a monument—a large white cross with an {{attached}} nameplate—was erected on the spot of the crash site to commemorate the victims of <b>LANSA</b> flight 502. In 2006, because of encroaching development, the Peruvian owner of the land where the memorial was originally located, under pressure from the U.S. Senator from New York, Charles E. Schumer, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Consulate General in Peru, agreed to relocate the memorial 150 feet away to protect the site.|$|E

5000|$|<b>LANSA's</b> {{high-level}} development {{language is}} called RDML, {{which is an}} acronym for Rapid Development and Maintenance Language. RDML {{is an important part}} of <b>LANSA's</b> low-code development platform. High-level programming languages like RDML, require less hand-crafting of code (a lower volume of coding) then traditional programming languages. They are therefore often referred to as [...] "low-code" [...] development platforms. Development, maintenance and debugging of mobile, web and cloud applications is all in the single RDML language, which then generates the underlying code required for the front end and back end application components. This negates the need for developers to learn the multiple languages typically associated with such development.|$|R

Apart from the damage {{typically associated with}} storms, such as winds, hail, and flooding, the lightning itself can damage buildings, ignite fires and kill by direct contact. Especially deadly lightning incidents include a 2007 strike in Ushari Dara, a remote mountain village in northwestern Pakistan, that killed 30 people, the crash of <b>LANSA</b> Flight 508 which killed 91 people, and a fuel explosion in Dronka, Egypt caused by lightning in 1994 which killed 469.

In November 1946, the aviation authority requested the inspection of construction of the new airport [...] "El Limón", located in Pasoancho. In early 1947, the works were completed at the airport, which was put in service equipped with the most modern facilities and equipment available at the time.
