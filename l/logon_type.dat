40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials responses {{in patients with}} Behçet’s disease. Materials and Methods: Thirty-three patients (66 ears) with the diagnosis of Behçet’s disease and 33 (66 ears) age and sex matched healthy volunteers {{were enrolled in the}} study. <b>Logon</b> <b>type</b> stimulus; 500 Hz frequency at an intensity of 120 dB HL with a 4 /s stimulation rate was delivered to elicite the VEMP responses. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was chosen as the target to record the VEMPs. During the recording period subjects were in supine position with head elevation and simultaneous binaural acoustic stimulations were used. Results: The response rate of p 1 n 1 wave was 69. 7 % for Behçet group and 89. 4 % for the control group (X 2, p = 0. 009). For Behçet group, the mean latencies of p 1 and n 1 were 13. 7 ± 1. 2 ms and 19. 7 ± 1. 4 ms, the mean amplitude of p 1 n 1 wave was 12. 2 ± 5. 9 µV. For control group, these values were 14. 2 ± 1. 3 ms; 20. 8 ± 2. 1 ms and 14. 1 ± 6. 1 µV, respectively. Although {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups with respect to p 1 latency and p 1 n 1 amplitude, n 1 latencies were significantly shorter in Behçet group. Conclusion: This preliminary report notify that in Behcet’s disease, the VEMP response rate is lower and n 1 latency was shorter than the healthy subjects...|$|E

The user would <b>logon</b> by <b>typing</b> the word <b>logon</b> {{followed}} by their identifier, e.g. their account name, a comma, and their user name. If they had a password on their account, they would type a comma followed by their password, which could be from 1 to 4 characters. If it contained one or more spaces (other than trailing spaces, which could be omitted), it had to be typed in single quotes. If it contained non-printable or binary characters, it had to by typed in by using the letter X followed by a quote and the 8-character hexadecimal value of their password. So if the account S0103 had the password (in hexadecimal) A0B0C0 and a space, then user LESLIE would logon to the system by typing ...|$|R
