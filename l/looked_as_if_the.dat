25|$|It <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Romans {{were going}} to pay for their failure to {{capitalize}} from the victory at the Metaurus river by conquering the Cisalpine Gauls once and for all, but the danger caused by Mago’s landing was not to be overestimated. Even when he received reinforcements from Carthage in the form of about 7,000 troops, 7 elephants and 25 warships his strength was still far from enough to break the Roman defences. This is why Mago did not seem to actively pursue the goal set by Carthage – to march south and join Hannibal.|$|E
25|$|With the Connecticut Huskies {{trailing}} by 8 {{points with}} less than 3 minutes to go, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Duke Blue Devils were going to spoil Jim Calhoun's chance at a second national title. Connecticut's All-American center Emeka Okafor was limited to just 22 minutes because of early foul trouble, but he came up clutch with several big plays down the stretch and finished with 18 points and only 3 fouls. By contrast, all three of Duke's centers fouled out, including Shelden Williams, who committed his fifth foul with 3:04 to play. In addition, Duke went without a field goal for the last 4½ minutes until Chris Duhon's meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was denied his 65th NCAA Tournament victory which would have tied him with Dean Smith for the all-time record. He later broke that record.|$|E

25|$|August and September 1922 saw {{widespread}} {{attacks on}} Free State {{forces in the}} territories that they had occupied in the July–August offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on them. Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins {{was killed in an}} ambush by anti-treaty Republicans at Béal na mBláth, near his home in County Cork, in August 1922. Collins' death increased the bitterness of the Free State leadership towards the Republicans and probably contributed to the subsequent descent of the conflict into a cycle of atrocities and reprisals. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president, had also died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving the Free State government in the hands of W. T. Cosgrave and the Free State army under the command of General Richard Mulcahy. For a brief period, with rising casualties among its troops and its two principal leaders dead, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Free State might collapse.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated {{it sounded as}} if one shot had been fired. “One witness said it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E
25|$|For {{a moment}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> police would manage to push home their attack, {{but some of the}} squatters were armed with tear-gas grenades and threw three of them into the shop. The police were {{carrying}} gas masks but it was impossible to don them without breaking their shield wall and thus exposing themselves to the incoming stones. The police attack broke. Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police gave up trying to storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area. The police now focused on keeping the squatters inside the barricaded area. The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|E

25|$|However, {{just when}} it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> new gun {{was about to become}} a great success, a great deal of {{opposition}} to the gun arose, both inside the army and from rival arms manufacturers, particularly Joseph Whitworth of Manchester. Stories were publicised that the new gun was too difficult to use, that it was too expensive, that it was dangerous to use, that it frequently needed repair and so on. All of this smacked of a concerted campaign against Armstrong. Armstrong was able to refute all of these claims in front of various government committees, but he found the constant criticism very wearying and depressing. In 1862 the government decided to stop ordering the new gun and return to muzzle loaders. Also, because of a drop in demand, future orders for guns would be supplied from Woolwich, leaving Elswick without new business. Compensation was eventually agreed with the government for the loss of business to the company. The government would not release the company from its agreement not to sell armaments abroad, so that avenue was closed to it. Eventually, the restriction was relaxed, and the company was able to sell guns to both sides in the American Civil War.|$|E
500|$|In September 1901, William McKinley was at {{the height}} of his power as president. Elected in 1896, during the serious {{economic}} depression resulting from the Panic of 1893, he had defeated his Democratic rival, William Jennings Bryan. McKinley led the nation both to a return to prosperity and to victory in the Spanish–American War in 1898, taking possession of such Spanish colonies as Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Re-elected handily in a rematch against Bryan in 1900, according to historical writer Eric Rauchway, [...] "it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> McKinley Administration would continue peaceably unbroken for another four years, a government devoted to prosperity".|$|E
500|$|In spring 1796, drafts {{from the}} free {{imperial}} cities, and other imperial estates in the Swabian and Franconian Circles augmented the Habsburg force with perhaps 20,000 men at the most. [...] The militias, {{most of which were}} Swabian field hands and day laborers drafted for service in the spring of that year, were untrained and unseasoned. As he gathered his army in March and April, it was largely guess work where they should be placed. [...] In particular, Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location. [...] Consequently, in May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by Mainz and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the French army would cross there—they even engaged the imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)—Charles felt few qualms placing the 7000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl.|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, Universal Studios and Howard's Imagine Entertainment {{bought the}} script for Howard to direct. The film was on a {{shortlist}} of projects for Howard after coming off the commercial success of The Da Vinci Code. In , Universal fast-tracked the production. When Howard chose Frost/Nixon and Angels & Demons as his next two directing projects, it became clear he could not direct Changeling until 2009. After Howard stepped down, it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> film would not be made, despite admiration for the script in the industry. Howard and Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director to helm the project; they pitched the film to Eastwood in , and he agreed to direct immediately after reading the script. Eastwood said his memories of growing up during the Great Depression meant that whenever a project dealing with the era landed in his hands, he [...] "redoubled his attention" [...] upon it. Eastwood also cited the script's focus on Collins—rather than the [...] "Freddy Krueger" [...] story of Northcott's crimes—as a factor in deciding to make the film.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} there was {{something}} of unexpected interest. Waving their school flag in triumph from the gable window of the old building the lads from the South Side High School shouted their school yell and BAD DEFIANCE TO ALL COMERS. [...] At this point the Central High School scholars were billed to relieve the South Siders, and consequently surrounded the building. [...] The spirit of school rivalry broke out, strong and bitter. The South Siders refused to surrender the fortress and flaunted their banner from the window {{in spite of all}} entreaties and orders. Contractor Pratt could not oust them. Supt. Jordan could not oust them, and finally Sergeant Martinson called for a detail of police and made a rush for the house. But the South Side lads were still game, and did not give up until several had been made to feel the force of police authority. Then they made a break. As they dashed from one door the Centrals entered by the other, and their banner was soon flying from the gable amid vociferous cheers. The South Siders were chased up the street by a detachment of Centrals, and for a moment it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> rush would result in some bruised heads. However, good nature was restored and again the house started on its way.|$|E

The Bodley Head were anxious to sign a new contract with Christie, now recognising her potential, {{but she wanted to}} move on, feeling that [...] "they had not treated a young author fairly."

2500|$|But by {{this point}} Maclean {{had had enough of}} high {{politics}} and garrison life. He wanted {{to be back in the}} action, and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Germans were planning to withdraw from Yugoslavia. Accordingly, he came up with a plan known as Operation Ratweek, in which the Partisans and Allies were to harass the Axis troops in close co-ordination for seven days, destroying their communication lines. [...] Bill Elliot, in command of the Balkan Air Force, supported the plan, as did the Navy and General Wilson. Tito committed himself too, although, as Maclean points out, it would have been understandable had he wished to let the Germans leave as soon as possible. [...] Maclean got permission from Churchill to go to Serbia, previously a stronghold of the Chetniks, to supervise Ratweek from there.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, a {{year before}} his death, Osborne wrote that the opening night was [...] "an {{occasion}} I only partly remember, but certainly with more accuracy than those who subsequently {{claimed to have been}} present and, {{if they are to be}} believed, would have filled the theatre several times over". Reviews were mixed. Most of the critics who attended the first night felt it was a failure, and it <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> English Stage Company was going to go into liquidation. The Evening Standard, for example, called the play [...] "a failure" [...] and [...] "a self-pitying snivel". But the following Sunday, Kenneth Tynan of The Observer – the most influential critic of the day – praised it to the skies: 'I could not love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger,' he wrote, [...] "It is the best young play of its decade". Harold Hobson of The Sunday Times called Osborne [...] "a writer of outstanding promise". During production, the married Osborne began a relationship with Mary Ure, and would divorce his wife, Pamela Lane, to marry Ure in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|Between 3 and 4 {{o'clock in}} the {{afternoon}} of the said 29th, it began to rain mud and ashes at Caysasay ( [...] from the volcano) and this rain lasted three days. The most terrifying circumstance was that the whole sky was shrouded in such darkness that we could not have seen the hand placed before the face, {{had it not been for}} the sinister glare of incessant lightnings. Nor could we use artificial light as this was extinguished by the wind and copious ashes which penetrated everywhere. All was horror those three days, which appeared rather like murky nights and we did not occupy ourselves with anything but see to it that the natives swept off the roofs the large quantities of ashes and stones which kept on accumulating upon them and threatened to bring them down upon us, burying us alive beneath their weight. But fearing that even these precautions might prove unavailing, we 3 Europeans – viz. Fr. Prior, the Alcalde, and myself – the only ones who were at the time in the Convento of Caysasay, took refuge on the landing of the stairs; as the safest place, and awaited there whatever God might dispose with regard to us. To all this was added incessant thunder and lightning, and it really <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> world was going to pieces and its axis had been displaced.|$|E

2500|$|Iuppiter Stator {{was first}} {{attributed}} by tradition to Romulus, who had prayed the god for his almighty help at {{a difficult time}} the battle with the Sabines of king Titus Tatius. Dumézil opines the action of Jupiter is not that of a god of war who wins through fighting: Jupiter acts by causing an inexplicable change in {{the morale of the}} fighters of the two sides. The same feature can be detected also in the certainly historical record of the battle of the third Samnite War in 294 BC, in which consul Marcus Atilius Regulus vowed a temple to Iuppiter Stator if [...] "Jupiter will stop the rout of the Roman army and if afterwards the Samnite legions shall be victouriously massacred...It <b>looked</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> gods themselves had taken side with Romans, so much easily did the Roman arms succeed in prevailing...". In a similar manner one can explain the epithet Victor, whose cult was founded in 295 BC on the battlefield of Sentinum by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges and who received another vow again in 293 by consul Lucius Papirius Cursor before a battle against the Samnite legio linteata. The religious meaning of the vow is in both cases an appeal to the supreme god by a Roman chief at a time of need for divine help from the supreme god, albeit for different reasons: Fabius had remained the only political and military responsible of the Roman State after the devotio of P. Decius Mus, Papirius had to face an enemy who had acted with impious rites and vows, i.e. was religiously reprehensible.|$|E
