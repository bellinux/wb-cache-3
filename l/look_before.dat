5|$|A {{comparison}} of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished <b>look.</b> <b>Before</b> cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this <b>look</b> <b>before</b> passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test <b>look</b> <b>before</b> principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While shooting for the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good <b>look</b> <b>before</b> entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of cosmetic lenses is {{not knowing how}} they will <b>look</b> <b>before</b> physically trying them on.

Virtual Dressing Room technology offers users the option to upload a photo so they can virtually try on different lenses and experience how they will <b>look</b> <b>before</b> committing to a purchase. Examples of retailers that currently offer this technology are Freshlook Color Studios and Colorful Eyes.|$|E

When considering why this service was so popular, Mack noted that consumers usually feel more confident in a purchase when there are few unknowns. At the time, selling products over the Internet was not a popular concept outside the United States, but Mack was confident in expanding GoodHome.com's portfolio to include foreign companies: [...] "We're already getting so many requests from companies about expanding our website abroad...

She performed three of her songs—"Million Reasons", [...] "You and I" [...] and [...] "The Edge of Glory". The singer wore a white pantsuit, silver statement earrings, and opted for a blonde bob wig for the performance; some journalists likened her appearance to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's <b>look.</b> <b>Before</b> [...] "Million Reasons", Gaga told the audience that [...] "it's about pain, and sometimes life gives us a million reasons why to give up, but we stick around." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{initially}} described Jo as an [...] "innocent {{girl who}} wanted to be a hunter" [...] and who tends to <b>look</b> <b>before</b> she leaps; she is also [...] "enthusiastic" [...] and very [...] "girl-next-door" [...] in her approach to hunting the supernatural. He later regretted writing Jo in this way, as he felt that it was the wrong characterization for a female character on Supernatural. However, Jo grows throughout the second season as she rebels against her mother by running away to be a hunter, which Kripke believed made her harder and tougher. Regarding her character's capture by a vengeful spirit in [...] "No Exit", actress Alona Tal felt that Jo was a [...] "badass" [...] who handled the situation well. Tal commented, [...] "She fought and risked her life and stayed there as bait. It took a lot of guts." ...|$|E

500|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} begin breeding {{from four}} {{years of age and}} mate for life. Mature wandoo and salmon gum woodlands provide important breeding habitat for the cockatoos as they need large hollows in tall trees. The nests are generally located about [...] above the ground, and spaced [...] away from each other, on average. There is competition for nest hollows with western corellas (Cacatua pastinator), galahs (Eolophus roseicapilla), and feral honeybees (Apis mellifera). Galahs seek out hollows at any time of year, unlike the Carnaby's black cockatoos, which only <b>look</b> <b>before</b> breeding. Mated pairs return to a breeding locale in late winter and begin preparing to breed, the female choosing a suitable hollow in a tree. She becomes highly territorial, driving off other females from the vicinity of the nest. After a bushfire burnt out much of the species' breeding habitat in 2009, local wildlife officers of the Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia constructed artificial breeding hollows. After some experimentation by authorities, the survival rate of nestlings in these hollows increased to 75%.|$|E
500|$|Arthur's costume was {{the easiest}} to create, as the color scheme {{mirrored}} his comic book counterpart, and was constructed to give a [...] "wetsuit look". The costume was also designed to be more form-fitting, to complement Ritchson's physique. Victor and Arthur's tops were also hoodie variations. When designing Dinah Lance's Black Canary costume, {{certain aspects of the}} comic book character were kept, while others changed entirely. For instance, the character retains her classic fishnet stockings, but the external, black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask. Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary's costume, looking through the 1940s and 50s, to {{try to come up with}} the right version for the show. Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions. One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny, with a [...] "curvy, corseted, strapless thing that was not at all action-friendly". The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl, which is the route Cranstoun took. What Cranstoun created was a [...] "zipped, sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical". The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had, as well as the long gloves. The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character, including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character's <b>look,</b> <b>before</b> going with the painted variation.|$|E
500|$|The team {{distilled}} {{the original}} concept {{into the core}} gameplay mechanics that players preferred, namely the abilities to morph into characters and to fight. In what became the core gameplay, the player would {{use a combination of}} Kameo's elemental warriors to progress through levels. Rare later expanded the conceit to that of an adventure game, though its story was secondary to the gameplay. Kameo was designed for fluidity—the team tried to minimize player chores and player waiting times. The team simplified the set of characters from a hundred to a dozen, and expanded the skill sets of those remaining. Tossell designed these characters, and started with a boulder-like animal. These creature designs later became Kameo's morphing forms. As the game transitioned and Rare attempted to distance itself from its mawkish reputation for [...] "cute characters with big eyes", the team struggled to repurpose Kameo into an elf from the fairy of the original concept. Tossell felt that this task was impossible, as Microsoft simultaneously wanted to widen its base while it did not give Rare the room to grow out of its cutesy design. The Kameo character transitioned through a [...] "tribal" [...] <b>look</b> <b>before</b> becoming an elf, and her own attacks were ultimately repurposed into the elemental warriors'. Kameo became an Xbox 360 launch title (alongside Rare's Perfect Dark Zero) and received a graphics upgrade in the process. The game had been about 80% complete for the original Xbox, but the transition freed the game's vision from technical constraints.|$|E

The Cosmos article included the statement that [...] "Drastic, precipitous—and, especially, unilateral—steps to delay the putative greenhouse impacts can cost jobs and prosperity and increase the human costs of global poverty, without being effective. Stringent economic controls now would be economically devastating particularly for developing countries...". The article concluded: [...] "The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time. There is little risk in delaying policy responses." ...|$|E
