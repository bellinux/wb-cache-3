5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated <b>look</b> <b>is</b> a question of fashion rather than function.|$|E

I examined the effects of cosmetics on the appearance of the face using color theory. Three models were used for this project. Consultations were held with each model to discuss their previous experience with different types/colors of products, looks they would like to try, and any previous reactions to products. The same three makeup <b>looks</b> <b>were</b> applied on each model and analyzed for what was successful and unsuccessful. Areas that were examined are model’s skin tones, eye color, eye shape, and face shape. After each of these <b>looks</b> <b>was</b> applied and photographed, an individualized <b>look</b> <b>was</b> done on each model. This <b>look</b> <b>was</b> created from the information gathered during the consultation. Each of the four <b>looks</b> <b>was</b> photographed from different angles on each model.

The analysis was conducted by comparing and contrasting the three <b>looks</b> that <b>were</b> applied to all models, then each customized <b>look</b> <b>was</b> evaluated for its individual aspects.

25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages {{the breasts}} were {{minimized}} in dresses with straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and snugly {{to the body}} and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. This <b>look</b> <b>is</b> not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{propelling}} {{factors of}} the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, Tommy Hilfiger jeans and baseball caps. This macho <b>look</b> <b>is</b> even found on the women. In Tokyo you {{are most likely to}} find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. Shibuya is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced. Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the Bathing Ape line. Bape has been worn by Pharrell Williams and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive. Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.|$|E

Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack of concern about her appearance before she returns to Mumbai.

500|$|The episode {{marks the}} debut {{appearance}} of Lurleen on The Simpsons. She {{was created by}} one of the show's character designers, John Rice.

Rice and Kirkland then sent the character to Groening, who sent back a note saying [...] "wow". Reiss's show runner partner Al Jean said that [...] "one of the most difficult things when translating real people to a Simpsons <b>look</b> <b>is</b> for women to look beautiful", as the Simpson overbite and facial construction make it particularly difficult to design women's looks. Lurleen's last name, Lumpkin, came from the country bumpkin character Tony Lumpkin in the 1773 comedy play She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted by several of the series' {{designers}} that K' {{is one of the}} most difficult characters to illustrate, since his <b>look</b> <b>is</b> very different when he is drawn by different illustrators.

They also jokingly mentioned that the reason for his hair being bushier than it needed to be may be a reflection of the conditions around him. The King of Fighters '99 was developed at the same time as developers noted several similarities between K' and Mark of the Wolves main character, Rock Howard, which caused K's designer to become very nervous.
