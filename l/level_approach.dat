[...] Unsure of its {{position}} after such a long flight at low level over water, the commander (Flt Lt Martin Withers) of Vulcan bomber XM607 briefly climbed to gain a radar fix from the mountains east of Stanley. [...] In performing this manoeuvre, his aircraft was briefly detected by the crew of the AN/TPS-44 surveillance radar before descending once more to low level. [...] Initially the crew were uncertain that the aircraft they had detected was hostile, leading to delays in alerting the air defence system. [...] The air base was warned at 4:20 am local time but the low <b>level</b> <b>approach</b> of the Vulcan bomber combined with active jamming from DASH 10 ECM pod prevented the AAA defences from engaging the bomber. The reaction of the defences was therefore ineffective. The stick of 21 1000lb bombs damaged the airport tower, scored a single direct hit in the centre of the runway and killed two Air Force personnel. Nevertheless, the airstrip was still operational.|$|E

40|$|There are {{tradeoffs}} to high <b>levels</b> of <b>approach</b> motivation. On the one hand, high <b>levels</b> of <b>approach</b> motivation {{are thought}} to underlie positive emotional states such as excitement (Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999). High <b>levels</b> of <b>approach</b> motivation should also invigorate goal pursuit (Higgins, 1997) and potentially facilitate progress as a result (Carver & Scheier, 1998). On the other hand, Gray (1982) suggested that high <b>levels</b> of <b>approach</b> motivation predispose one to a certain class of dysregulated outcomes. Increasingly so, and consistent with the latter perspective, higher <b>levels</b> of <b>approach</b> motivation {{have been linked to}} addictive behaviors (Franken, Muris, & Georgieva, 2006), anger and aggression (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009), and bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2006). Nonetheless, high <b>levels</b> of self-reported <b>approach</b> moti-vation, considered alone, may often not predict its problem-atic manifestations. For example, higher levels of self-control should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation results in addiction (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994). Similarly, better neurological functioning should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation predicts bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2009).

5000|$|Until Dawn was re-introduced at Gamescom 2014. The title now {{served as}} a PlayStation 4 {{exclusive}} and would shift to a third-person perspective.

In addition, the torch feature was scrapped in favor of a more traditional <b>level</b> <b>approach,</b> with the characters becoming playable at different parts of the game. In addition to the trailer, a gameplay demo was released. According to Supermassive, the game's transition from PlayStation 3 to PlayStation 4 has led the developer to rebuild the game and to rewrite its story, so as to create a more cinematic experience, and to make the game to feel [...] "darker and fundamentally more terrifying". It was also revealed that Until Dawn would utilize the Decima engine that originated from Killzone Shadow Fall.|$|E
50|$|A {{communities}} <b>level</b> <b>approach</b> to {{this apparent}} invalidity {{is based on}} the evidence of a social group whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common culture and history. Community indicators are not a new concept; they have been in use since 1910, when the Russell Sage Foundation initiated the development of local surveys for measuring industrial, educational, recreational, and other factors. The processes used by the Sage Foundation are similar to those that reemerged during the 1990s. But the difference today is the use of indicators to consider the full spectrum of a community’s well-being, not just isolated factors. Nowadays, indicators are used by many constituencies within a community. After a decade of renewed attention to community indicators, they now represent a valuable mechanism to improve monitoring and evaluation in planning.|$|E

50|$|When the {{original}} {{bridge over the}} Sangamon River was built in 1915 a levee was constructed across the floodplain north of the river to form a <b>level</b> <b>approach</b> to the bridge. The entrance drive including the levee was paved with a single lane brick farm-to-market road running east from the Gate House, south to Allerton Road (Route 6; C.R. 1450N) and on into Monticello to accommodate fully loaded wagons going into town. An unpaved lane ran alongside the brick for the return trip. Both lanes were paved with asphalt in 1981. Two brick columns topped with statues of the goddess Diana and her companion, an Ephebe, were placed at the southeast gate on Allerton Road. When the old bridge {{was replaced by a}} new bridge in 2012 the entrance drive through the park was designated Old Levee Road.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1940, 22 Squadron {{equipped}} with Vildebeests, began to receive Beauforts. The Beaufort {{was a much}} faster, heavier aircraft than the biplane and the crews needed {{a great deal of}} training in torpedo-dropping, using new techniques required by the Beaufort. The lighter, slower Vildebeest was able to dive then flatten out before launching the torpedo; Beauforts carried too much speed after diving so it needed a longer, <b>level</b> <b>approach</b> to the torpedo drop. Because of this and because of a shortage of torpedoes the squadron's first operations consisted of laying magnetic mines ("Gardening" [...] in RAF parlance) and dropping conventional bombs. As an alternative to the torpedo, the Beaufort could carry a 2000 lb bomb using a purpose built carrier. On one of its first bombing sorties, on 7 May 1940, a Beaufort dropped the first British 2000 lb bomb, at a German cruiser anchored off Norderney.|$|E
