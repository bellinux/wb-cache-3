40|$|Soft tissue injuries, such as {{anterior}} cruciate ligament rupture, ankle sprain and foot skin problems, frequently occur during cutting maneuvers. These injuries are often regarded as associated with abnormal joint torque and interfacial friction caused by excessive external and in-shoe shear forces. This study simultaneously investigated the dynamic in-shoe localized plantar pressure and shear stress during lateral shuffling and 45 ¢X sidestep cutting maneuvers. Tri-axial force transducers were affixed at {{the first and second}} metatarsal heads, lateral forefoot, and heel regions in the midsole of a basketball shoe. Seventeen basketball players executed both cutting maneuvers with maximum efforts. <b>Lateral</b> shuffling <b>cutting</b> had a larger mediolateral braking force than 45 ¢X sidestep cutting. This large braking force was concentrated at the first metatarsal head, as indicated by its maximum medial shear stress (312. 2 ¡Ó 157. 0. kPa). During propulsion phase, peak shear stress occurred at the second metatarsal head (271. 3 ¡Ó 124. 3. kPa).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A custom moulded ankle {{orthosis}} with hinged joints potentially {{offers a}} better {{control over the}} subtalar joint and the ankle joint during <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movements, due to total contact design and increase in material strength. OBJECTIVES: To test the above hypothesis by comparing it to three other available orthoses. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated measures. METHODS: Eight subjects {{with a history of}} ankle sprains (Grade 2), and 11 subjects without such history performed <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movements in four test conditions: 1) non-orthotic, 2) custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges, 3) Sport-Stirrup, and 4) elastic ankle sleeve with plastic support. A VICON motion analysis system was used to study the motions at the ankle and subtalar joints. RESULTS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis significantly lowered the inversion angle at initial contact (p = 0. 006) and the peak inversion angle (p = 0. 000) during <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movements in comparison to non-orthotic condition, while the other two orthoses did not. The three orthoses did not affect the plantarflexion motions, which had been suggested by previous studies to be important in shock wave attenuation. CONCLUSIONS: The custom-moulded ankle orthosis with hinges could better control inversion and thus expected to better prevent ankle sprain in <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movements. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Custom-moulded ankle orthoses are not commonly used in preventing ankle sprains.

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track II: Transportation and BiofuelsGuadua angustifolia is {{a tropical}} American bamboo {{known for its}} rapid growth and abundant production of woody culms. This vigorous growing grass is considered the third largest bamboo {{in the world and}} has been observed to grow up to 21 cm a day and produce multiple culms that can reach a maximum height of 30 meters. Previous studies conducted in the bamboos native habitat have estimated a mean number of standing culms per hectare of 6, 940 with an oven-dry biomass of 311 ton/ha. This extensive amount of biomass has raised interest in the use of Guadua as a feedstock for the cellulosic biofuel industry. However, the establishment of successful bamboo plantations has been hampered by the lack of viable seed due to irregular flowering cycles and poor seed quality. This limitation poses a major problem for the development of Guadua as an energy crop by impeding the rapid multiplication of plant propagules, which are required for the establishment of breeding and research trials and ultimately for large-scale commercialization. Micropropagation constitutes a feasible alternative to traditional techniques utilized for the production of viable planting material.

40|$|Preparation of long bones {{such as the}} femur or tibia for {{placement}} of intramedullary devices {{for the treatment of}} fractures usually involves reaming with a series of central cutters driven by a drill-like device with a flexible shaft over a guide wire. The reamers sequentially enlarge the intramedullary canal into a tunnel of circular cross-section and a diameter appropriate for the procedure. The current technology is concentric, meaning that the system is self-centering within the original intramedullary canal and the expansion is symmetric with respect to the original centerline. A novel system for laterally deflecting the head of a 12 mm Stryker Bixcut reaming system has been designed in order to test the proof of concept for eccentrically reaming the intramedullary canal of a long bone. Reaming often precedes intramedullary nail placement following a long bone fracture or to induce ankle arthrodesis. Long bones do not always contain a regularly shaped intramedullary canal, thus creating a risk in navigating a reamer through the bone. Pockets of infected tissue and malformed fractures may also create obstacles for advancing a reamer through the canal. The newly developed reaming system is intended to allow the surgeon to be more selective in where the reamer head cuts while shaping the inner wall of the intramedullary canal to avoid or target certain areas of the canal. Development of the directional reaming system included two prototypes with three sets of experiments to quantify the success of the designs. The first experiment resulted in a prototype unable to achieve the specified 3 mm of <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> depth.

40|$|Stump wood is a {{possible}} source of renewable energy, but before its potential as a fuel can be utilised to a high degree, new harvesting techniques should be developed to reduce the environmental impact (notably ground disturbance) of harvesting stumps. The forces required to lift and drag stumps out of the soil are known. In this study, two unknown and important parameters were addressed: the torque required to uproot stumps by twisting them and the torque required to cut lateral roots around stumps. A new, improved stump-twisting rig was designed and used in trials with 28 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees (breast-height diameter over bark, 153 – 427 mm). The measured torque requirements ranged from 10 to 50 kNm. Twisting stumps required more torque than <b>cutting</b> <b>lateral</b> roots around stumps and the required torque increased with increases in stump size.

40|$|The {{emerging}} use of femtosecond lasers {{with high}} repetition {{rates in the}} MHz regime together with limited scan speed implies possible mutual optical and dynamical interaction effects of the individual cutting spots. In order to get more insight into the dynamics a time-resolved photographic analysis of the interaction of cavitation bubbles is presented. Particularly, we investigated the influence of fs-laser pulses and their resulting bubble dynamics with various spatial as well as temporal separations. Different time courses of characteristic interaction effects between the cavitation bubbles were observed depending on pulse energy and spatio-temporal pulse separation. These ranged from merely no interaction to the phenomena of strong water jet formation. Afterwards, the mechanisms are discussed regarding {{their impact on the}} medical application of effective tissue <b>cutting</b> <b>lateral</b> to the laser beam direction with best possible axial precision: the mechanical forces of photodisruption as well as the occurring water jet should have low axial extend and a preferably lateral priority. Furthermore, the overall efficiency of energy conversion into controlled mechanical impact should be maximized compared to the transmitted pulse energy and unwanted long range mechanical side effects, e. g. shock waves, axial jet components. In conclusion, these experimental results are of great importance for the prospective optimization of the ophthalmic surgical process with high-repetition rate fs-lasers...|$|R
40|$|A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) -based {{strain sensing}} system for {{minimally}} invasive telerobotic cutting applications {{is presented in}} this paper. Investigations assume that a scissor blade can be approximated as a uniformly tapered cantilever beam. A replica of the scissor blade is produced and strain characterization {{has been carried out}} using an FBG sensor system. Results are validated against measurements obtained using conventional electrical resistance strain gauges. The scissor blade experiences both direct and <b>lateral</b> forces during <b>cutting,</b> hence the system is characterized for a direct load range of 0 - 30 N and a lateral load range of 0 - 10 N. The results show a very good linear response for direct loading and some sensitivity to lateral loading. An actual sensorized scissor blade prototype is also characterized and results compared with that of the replica blade. The FBG interrogation system used was a macro-bend fiber filter-based ratiometric system. The use of FBGs together with macro-bend fiber-based interrogation system eliminates the influence of temperature on the sensing system and hence temperature independent strain information from the blade is obtained. The results obtained using the macro-bend fiber filter are compared with that of a commercial interrogation system and found to be in agreement. By implementing an all fiber sensing system based on fiber Bragg gratings and macrobend fiber filter interrogation system, remote operation of telerobotic cutting applications can be made more cost effective while providing a competitive accuracy and resolution solution. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

Two sizes of chemically pruned seedlings were treated with a copper based paint (PCT 5 - 12 and PCT 4 - 10). The other treatments were containerized Styroblock (PSB) 4 - 15 seedling that were knife pruned in four ways (i. e. bottom plug removal = RPB, bottom plug removal and two lateral cuts = RPB+ 2, and <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> with three cuts = RP 3 and six cuts = RP 6). Growths of pruned seedlings were compared to the un-pruned PSB 4 - 15 control group. While site soil conditions {{proved to be a}} stronger contributing factor to growth, pruning treatments induced different effects on seedlings particularly in root development. Root counts, root symmetry and proportion of direct large roots, showed greatest improvements. Root pruned seedlings also had better distribution of root growth throughout the plug. Among knife pruning treatments, <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> methods were more favourable to early root growth with greater root counts after a twenty-one day period than bottom plug removal. The most extreme knife pruning treatment, consisting of six laterial cuts (RP 6), had a mean of 60 % removal of roots within the plug and showed no differences in height growth regardless of site. Also the RP 6 seedlings had 100 % survival. It shows that the PSB 4 - 15 seedling is to a great extent resilient to knife pruning, which should be encouraged where chemical root pruning is less useful as it improves rooting development in the early establishment of confer seedlings. Improved rooting establishment of planted seedlings may result to better adaptation to environmental conditions and competitive stresses, as well as improve stem morphology and long-term growth.

40|$|An {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is a debilitating injury that occurs in {{tens of thousands of}} athletes per year, often requiring surgery and long stints of rehabilitation. A major sports movement that can cause an ACL tear is the noncontact, <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movement. Different variables associated with this movement have been shown to manipulate the stresses and body angles of the hip, knee and ankle joints. Some of these manipulations can lead to an increased risk of ACL injuries. One such variable, first tested by Mclean et al (2004), is the incorporation of a defender in front of the cutting participant. In our study, 10 participants performed the cutting movement at 45 ° at a controlled velocity under 4 different conditions: with no defender present, with a stationary defender present, with a defender moving slightly forward, and with a defender moving to the left. With the use of reflective markers, motion detecting video cameras and a force platform, kinetic and kinematic data were collected at the ankle, knee and hip joints. This data will determine if the presence of a defender increases the incidence of mechanisms that cause ACL injuries, particularly the knee valgus angle. Data is currently being processed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Fast medio-lateral movements, {{frequent}} in {{a number}} of sports activities, are associated with lower extremity injuries. These injuries may occur as a result of excessive musculoskeletal stresses on the joints and their associate structures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of running speed and turning movement on the three-dimensional moments at the ankle, knee, and hip joints. Data were collected using video cameras and force plate. Eight male recreational basketball players were tested during slow (1. 5 m/s), moderate (3. 0 m/s), and fast running (4. 5 m/s) and when cutting to the right or left (+ 60, + 30, 0, - 30, and - 60 °). The inverse dynamics approach was used to integrate the body segment parameter, kinematic and force plate data, and to solve the resultant joint moments. At the ankle joint, inversion/eversion, dorsi/plantar flexion, and internal/external rotation moments of the ankle joint increased with running speed (p<. 05). At the knee joint, flexion/extension and abduction/adduction moments increased with running speed except flexion moment that decreased with running speed (p<. 05). At the hip joint, internal/external rotation, flexion/extension, and abduction/adduction moments increased with running speed (p<. 05). In medial cutting movements, greater abduction moments of the ankle, adduction moments of the knee and external rotation and adduction of the hip were found (p<. 05). In <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> movements, greater inversion and adduction moments of the ankle, abduction moments of the knee and hip were found (p<. 05). These findings reinforce the intuitive notion that fast medio-lateral turning movements produce substantially greater musculoskeletal loading on the joint structures than does straight running and consequently have greater potential for inducing lower extremity injuries such as ankle sprain or anterior cruciate ligament injury...|$|E

A partial resection of the bladder was conducted because attempts of medical hemostasis were unsatisfactory. Path-ological examination indicated that the lesion was a spindle cell tumor of the bladder (Fig. 1).

40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{root system}} {{architecture}} for increased tree anchorage {{has not yet}} been determined and in particular, the role of the tap root remains elusive. In Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), tap roots may {{play an important role in}} anchoring young trees, but in adult trees, their growth is often impeded by the presence of a hard pan layer in the soil and the tap root becomes a minor component of tree anchorage. To understand better the role of the tap root in young trees, we grew cuttings (no tap root present) and seedlings where the tap root had (-) or had not (+) been pruned, in the field for 7 years. The force (F) necessary to deflect the stem sideways was then measured and divided by stem cross-sectional area (CSA), giving a parameter analogous to stress during bending. Root systems were extracted and root architecture and wood mechanical properties (density and longitudinal modulus of elasticity, E L) determined. In seedlings (-) tap roots, new roots had regenerated where the tap root had been pruned, whereas in cuttings, one or two lateral roots had grown downwards and acted as tap roots. Cuttings had significantly less lateral roots than the other treatments, but those near the soil surface were 14 % and 23 % thicker than plants (+) and (-) tap roots, respectively. Cuttings were smaller than seedlings, but were not relatively less resistant to stem deflection, probably because the thicker lateral roots compensated for their lower number. Apart from stem volume which was greater in trees (+) tap roots, no significant differences with regard to size or any root system variable were found in plants (-) or (+) tap roots. In all treatments, lateral roots were structurally reinforced through extra growth along the direction of the prevailing wind, which also improved tap root anchorage. Predictors of log F/CSA differed depending on treatment: in trees (-) tap roots, a combination of the predictors stem taper and %volume allocated to deep roots was highly regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 83), unlike plants (+) tap roots where the combined predictors of lateral root number and root depth were best regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 80). In cuttings, no clear relationships between log F/CSA and any parameter could be found. Wood density and E L did not differ between roots, but did diminish with increasing distance from the stem in lateral roots. E L was significantly lower in <b>lateral</b> roots from <b>cuttings.</b> Results showed that nursery techniques influence plant development but that the architectural pattern of Maritime pine root systems is stable, developing a sinker root system even when grown from cuttings.

40|$|Morphological and {{anatomical}} studies {{demonstrated the}} root formation characteristics of sweet potato. The presence {{and importance of}} preformed root primordia is recorded for the first time. On the vines root primordia are present in sets of four to ten adjacent to the leaf bases. These roots originate from the procambium {{on both sides of}} the leaf gap. Macroscopically the root tips of preformed root primordia protruding through the cortex and epidermis of the stems are prominent. The preformed root primordia produce adventitious roots, with pentarch, hexarch or septarch steles. Storage roots will under normal circumstances only originate from undamaged root primordia on the nodes of cuttings, or on nodes of newly formed vines, or from wound roots originating from the cut ends of the stem or leaf <b>cuttings.</b> <b>Lateral</b> roots originating from damaged root primordia, or directly from the adventitious roots, exhibit tetrarch steles and develop into fibrous roots without the potential to develop into storage roots. This understanding of the origin, anatomy and morphology of sweet potato roots should improve production practices, which will contribute to improved crop establishment and increased yield. Differences in the contribution of individual subterranean nodes to storage root yield were studied. On average cuttings with three subterranean nodes produced 3. 7 storage roots, with 33. 2 % on subterranean node 1, 30. 0 % on node 2 and 36. 8 % on node 3. However, in terms of fresh mass of the storage roots node 1 contributed 45. 4 %, node 2 contributed 27. 1 % and node 3 contributed 27. 4 %. The effect of temperature (20, 24, 28 and 32 oC constant), orientation of cuttings (vertical vs. horizontal) and size of cuttings (1 or 3 nodes) on the development of adventitious roots was observed in plant growth chambers. Twenty-one days after planting, the longest total root length of 4 m per plant was recorded from the 24 oC growth chamber. The effect of soil moisture content on early root development was investigated by wetting and equilibrating sandy soil to 100, 80, 60 and 40 % of field capacity. Although the 80 % of field capacity treatment resulted in the best root development, differences among treatments were small, demonstrating the capacity of cuttings to successfully establish under a range of soil moisture contents. Changes in dry mass of storage roots, stems, and leaves of three sweet potato cultivars (Awasa- 83, Bareda and Falaha) were studied at Awasa and Melkassa. At the final sampling the early maturing cultivar Falaha had diverted a higher proportion of the total dry mass into storage roots at Melkassa because of the early initiation and growth of storage roots. The late maturing cultivar Awasa- 83 had a smaller proportion of the total dry mass diverted into the storage roots at both locations because of late root initiation and growth. The high yielding cultivars Bareda at Melkassa, and Awasa- 83 at Awasa, had higher crop growth rates and higher net assimilation rates than the other cultivars. The effects of cultivar (Kudadie, Bareda and Awasa- 83), planting position (horizontal and vertical), type of planting material (terminal cuttings with and without leaves) and cutting length (20, 25 and 30 cm) on the number and yield of storage roots were quantified in field trials at Awasa and Melkassa. Cultivar Kudadie produced the highest storage root yield at both locations. Horizontal planting of cuttings resulted in the highest total storage root yield at both locations. Cutting length did not affect storage root number and yield. The effect of population density (50, 000, 55, 555, 75, 000, and 100, 000 cuttings per hectare) on the performance of the three Ethiopian sweet potato cultivars was studied at Awasa. The highest planting density consistently produced the best root yield, indicating the potential to increase yields with plant populations much higher than normally used. Early maturing cultivar Falaha produced more small and medium storage roots per plant, while the intermediate cultivar Bareda produced more large storage roots.

Group 1 : TF instruments were activated using the program TF continuous rotation at 500 rpm and torque set at 2 N; Group 2 : TF instruments were activated using the reciprocating TF Adaptive motion. Cutting efficiency was tested in a device developed to test the cutting ability of endodontic instruments. Each instrument cut 10 plastic blocks (10 uses) and the length of the surface cut in a plastic block after 1 min was measured in a computerized program with a precision of 0. 1 mm. Maximum penetration depth was calculated after 1 use and after 10 uses, and mean and standard deviation (SD) of each group was calculated. Data were statistically analyzed with a one-way ANOVA test (P. 05). TF instruments used in continuous rotation (Group 1) cut a mean depth of 10. 4 mm (SD = 0. 6 mm) after the first use and 10. 1 mm (SD 1. 1 mm) after 10 uses, while TF instruments used with the Adaptive motion cut a mean depth of 9. 9 mm (SD = 0. 7 mm) after the first use and 9. 6 mm (SD = 0. 9 mm) after 10 uses.

For {{a better understanding of}} Alpine rivercatchments considered as complex systems, we focused our research on the Guil River catchment (Queyras,Southern French Alps - 317 km 2). This catchment is prone to catastrophic summer floods (June 1957 (> R. I. 100 yr), June 2000 (R. I. 30 yr) [...] .) characterized by considerable sediment transport from tributaries to downvalley,very much facilitated by strong hillslope-channel connectivity (12, 000 m 3 volume of sediment aggraded duringthe June 2000 flood event). During the last flood events, several infrastructures and buildings were seriouslydamaged. Most of them were located at confluences and, at specific reaches such as canyon reaches constrainedby infrastructures. For risk mitigation some protection equipments were built after the 1957 event, but most ofthem are now poorly maintained and might be less effective in case of flood event. In the frame of SAMCO (ANR 12 SENV- 0004) project designed for mountain hazard mitigation in a context ofClimate Change, one objective is to understand the hydro-geomorphological functioning of Alpine catchmentsfor a sustainable management of sediment yield, transfer and deposition. Part of our study is aimed at a betterassessment of sediment transfers, especially on adjacent sediment supply (i. e. from hillslope to channel, and fromtributaries to the trunk river) for a better management of sediment fluxes in the frame of the local “River Scheme". For this reason, we decided to establish a sediment budget of the Guil River catchment, with a quantitativeassessment and a spatial analysis of erosion, transport, and deposition processes. The initial phase of our studyconsists in identifying contributive, erosion and deposition areas with a twofold approach: (i) assessment oflongitudinal sedimentary transfers in the floodplain, (ii) assessment of slopes contribution to sediment supply witha main focus on lower slopes where <b>lateral</b> <b>cutting</b> and landslides provide huge quantities of material to the valleybottom. The semi-automatic methodology proposed here is based on data directly derived from remote sensing,GIS analysis (e. g. interpretation of aerial photographs, measurement from regional scale Digital Elevation Model(DEM), high-resolution DEM derived from airborne-based LiDAR) and field surveys. This study highlights spatial differences in sediment storage and redistribution areas grounded on quantitativeand qualitative environmental parameters and index defined for 250 homogeneous sections (i. e. definition ofmorphological index, geometric measurement, rates and type of vegetation cover, hydraulic infrastructureslocation, urban development rates...). It also provides a useful classification of six distinct reach types andareas that will be susceptible to erosion, transport and deposition during the next flooding event (i. e. sedimentproduction areas, temporary and permanent sediment storage areas, areas sensitive to erosion [...] .) ...|$|E
