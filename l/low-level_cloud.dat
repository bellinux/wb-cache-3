The results indicate that the <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> must be sufficiently close to the surface for ship tracks to form.

The distributions of visible optical depths and cloud droplet effective radii for ambient clouds in which ship tracks are embedded are the same as those for clouds without ship tracks. Cloud droplet sizes and liquid water paths for <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> do not constrain the appearance of ship tracks in the imagery. The sensitivity of ship tracks to cloud altitude appears to explain why the majority of ship tracks observed from satellites off the coast of California are found south of 35 °N.

By analyzing the behaviour of <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> in a hierarchy of models (coupled ocean-atmosphere model, atmospheric general circulation model, aqua-planet model, single-column model) using the same physical parameterizations, this study proposes an interpretation of the strong positive low-cloud feedback predicted by the IPSL-CM 5 A climate model under climate change.

Cloud cover and cloud optical thickness of five different models, LM, Méso-NH, MM 5 (non-hydrostatic models), RACMO 2, and RCA (regional climate models) as well as corresponding retrievals from high resolution remote sensing observations of MODIS onboard the Terra satellite form the basis of a statistical analysis to compare the data sets. With the newly introduced patchiness parameters it is possible to separate differences between the two scenes {{on the one hand and}} between the models and the satellite on the other hand. We further introduce a new approach to spatially aggregate cloud optical thickness. Generally the models overestimate cloud optical thickness which can in part be ascribed to the lack of subgrid-scale variability.

Furthermore, we compare the standard operational output of the non-hydrostatic models to simulations of the same models including parameterised shallow convection.

The microphysical, chemical, optical, {{and lidar}} data {{collected}} during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) resulted in a self-consistent aerosol formulation for a multiple-scattering Monte Carlo radiation model. The model was used to simulate the direct aerosol radiative forcing, cloud radiative forcing, and heating rates for typical winter monsoon conditions over the tropical Indian Ocean. The focus {{of the study is}} to understand how the anthropogenic and natural aerosols partition the incoming solar energy between the ocean mixed layer and the overlying cloudy atmosphere. The observed aerosol single-scattering albedo,, was in the range 0. 8 – 0. 9 at 500 nm, mean aerosol visible optical thickness, A, was in the range 0. 1 – 0. 8 at 500 nm, and the <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> had horizontal scales of few kilometers and a cloud fraction of about 25 %, typical of <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> in the tropical oceans. The aerosol layer extended well above the <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> in many instances, which has {{a significant impact on the}} radiative forcing. Although contributing only about 10 % to the aerosol optical thickness, the soot transported from Asia and the Indian subcontinent significantly affects the aerosol direct forcing of the cloudy atmosphere. For monthly mean conditions (A 0. 4, 0. 9 and 25 % low-cloud fraction), the diurnal mean surface radiative forcing is about 25 W m 2 and the atmospheric forcing ranges from 22 to 25 W m 2. The top-of-the-atmosphere direct aerosol forcing is in the range of zero to 3 W m 2. The aerosol enhances the cloud atmospheric forcing by 0. 5 and by 2. 5 W m 2 when aerosol is mostly below and above the clouds, respectively. Furthermore, the trade wind boundary layer is subject to a heating of about 1 to 1. 5 K/d which might burn off the trade cumulus themselves. Thus the major impact of the predominantly anthropogenic aerosol over the tropical Indian Ocean is a substantial redistribution of the solar energy between the atmosphere and the ocean mixed layer...|$|R

The 7.3 -μm channel is dominated by atmospheric water vapor absorption. <b>Low-level</b> <b>clouds</b> produce temperatures at the 7.3 -μm channel lower than their actual cloud-top temperatures due to the absorption from water vapor above them. In contrast, their cloud-top temperatures at the 12.0 -μm window channel are representative of actual cloud-top temperature since the atmosphere is transparent to this wavelength. As a result, ∆T WV 7.3 –IR 12.0 tends to be very negative in sign for <b>low-level</b> <b>clouds.</b> In contrast, upper level thick clouds (being above most of this vapor and having absorption similar for both wavelengths due to ice crystals) produce temperatures at the 7.3 -μm channel close to their actual cloud-top temperatures. In this case, ∆T WV 7.3 –IR 12.0 usually takes very small negative values. Semitransparent ice clouds, such as cirrus, constitute an exception to this rule since their differential transmission cause larger negative differences. Positive differences may occur when water vapor {{is present in the}} stratosphere above the cloud top, which is a sign of convective cloud tops (Fritz and Laszlo 1993; Schmetz et al. 1997) as opposed to mere cirrus clouds.|$|R
