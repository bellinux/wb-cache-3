500|$|The 48-page {{prestige}} format one-shot comic took {{a considerable}} amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very hands-off sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive and Schticking" [...] {{was written}} by Bill Wrubel and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In July 2005, it was announced by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that Will & Graces season premiere for season eight would be performed live. It was also confirmed that actor Alec Baldwin would appear in the episode. This was Baldwin's third appearance, as he guest starred in two episodes from season seven, playing Will's boss. His initial decision to do the show was to work with Megan Mullally, who plays Karen; [...] "I just love Megan. And so I said, 'Well, if you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with Megan.' And they said 'You got it.' So I went and did that with them for four [...] It was fun. For me now, it's about who I work with." ...|$|E
2500|$|ABC invited Keith to sing [...] "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" [...] on a 2002 Fourth of July concert it was producing, then {{rescinded}} {{the invitation}} after host Peter Jennings heard {{the song and}} vetoed it. Jennings said the song [...] "probably wouldn’t set the right tone". [...] "I find it interesting that he's not from the U.S.," [...] Keith said of Jennings, who was Canadian. [...] "I bet Dan Rather'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on his special." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Philip,' <b>it</b> is soon <b>done,</b> {{and thank}} you for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> But, Amy, I would not alter your choice; yet there is one that seems to me more {{applicable}} [...] "Greater love hath no man--"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I am well, father," [...] said Tom; [...] "I wish you'd ask Mr. Stelling not to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> Euclid; <b>it</b> brings on the toothache, I think." ...|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by the {{publication}} of experimental series such as Camelot 3000 and the Epic Comics lineup, in 1983 DeMatteis again pursued publication for Moonshadow. While talking with his friend Karen Berger, he mentioned his idea for the series, and an enthusiastic Berger offered to have DC Comics publish it. Having already been considering going over to DC, DeMatteis was initially inclined to accept. However, when he discussed the upcoming expiration of his contract with Marvel with Shooter, Shooter offered to publish both Moonshadow and the Greenberg the Vampire graphic novel, another DeMatteis pet project that he had previously rejected. DeMatties recalled, [...] Jim said, [...] "Okay. You've been here long enough. You've paid your dues. You deserve {{to get a chance}} to do some things that you want to do." [...] And I respect him for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I wasn't one of Marvel's top-selling writers. Jim could easily have said: [...] "Fine. Go <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for DC." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{shall be}} made sorry for that!" [...] he resumed, his injured tone still remaining, as he flourished the whip anew. [...] "Unless, that is, you agree willingly to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again, and no handkerchief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, no doubt, no doubt; a cruel business! But how I am {{to manage}} {{some of them}} I'm sure I don't know. There's {{one of them in}} rhyme. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see, how <b>does</b> <b>it</b> go? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peace, sister!" [...] {{said the}} Abbot; [...] "let not their madness destroy our discretion--I pray thee, peace, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> mine office. <b>It</b> is the first, peradventure {{it may be}} the last time, I shall be called on to {{discharge}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS GEORGE [turning {{and seeing}} him] <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> catch you <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> again: thats all. How {{do you come}} there? I sent you away. [With great energy, {{becoming}} quite herself again] What the goodness gracious has been happening? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] exclaimed Dick; [...] "not {{quite so}} loud, mister pirate. You see {{there is some}} reason in my puttin' this on your mouth. It'll be as well to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> quietly, else I'll {{have to get a}} little help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Told ’er to buy {{the baby}} a bun with it?" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Dodds in a dazed voice. [...] "Told ’er to—— Wot did you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for? Wot was all you chaps standin’ by an’ doin’ {{to let me go}} an’ do it for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How delicious! And you mend for them? I wish I had any one to mend for. Please show me, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I {{tried to}} tear the nasty thing off, {{but it would not}} come. I wish Mamma would let me wear {{sensible}} print like yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Hamlin, quickly, [...] "you know--the poem everybody's talking about. Dear <b>me!</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see! how <b>does</b> <b>it</b> go?" [...] The rascal knit his brows, said, [...] "Ah, yes," [...] {{and then}} murmured the verse he had lately sung quite as musically.|$|R
60|$|Sir Mart. I {{have such}} a plot!--I care not, I will speak, an I were to be hanged for't. Shall I speak, dear Warner? <b>let</b> <b>me</b> now; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> so wamble within me, just like a clyster, i'faith la, and I can keep it no longer, for my heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd half a mind then {{to throw}} the stuff away, or drink it myself; it seemed a piece of bally nonsense, giving good ale to a four-year-old pony; but the moment the beggar smelt the bowl he reached out his head, and lapped it up as though he'd been a Christian; and I jumped into the cart and started off, amid cheers. We got up the hill pretty steady. Then the liquor began to work into his head. I've taken home a drunken man more than once and there's pleasanter jobs than that. I've seen a drunken woman, and they're worse. But a drunken Welsh pony I never want to have {{anything}} more to do with so long as I live. Having four legs he managed to hold himself up; but as to guiding himself, he couldn't; and as for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> he wouldn't. First we were one side of the road, and then we were the other. When we were not either side, we were crossways in the middle. I heard a bicycle bell behind me, but I dared not turn my head. All I could do was to shout to the fellow to keep where he was.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't see any pluck in it. That {{old fool}} Brown didn't {{know what he}} was talking about, and I wanted to tell them so. They wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and there's an end of it. It {{seems to me to be}} a stupid sort of a place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The other gentleman {{have been}} down, Sir," [...] said Mrs. Short. [...] "He asked {{me where the}} bread and butter were, so I said should I cut him a piece. But he wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I gave him a knife {{and he took it}} for himself, in the pantry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe, who did {{not like}} the {{position}} in which he stood as respecting Lee, here made an offer of aid. [...] "I don't suppose my word is any good now, but if you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> I'll go out and round up Judge Higley. I think I know where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 29. Now {{for your}} saucy, good dear letter: <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> say? come then. I dined to-day with Ford, {{and went home}} early; he debauched(8) me to his chamber again {{with a bottle of}} wine till twelve: so good-night. I cannot write an answer now, you rogues.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{psychodrama}} {{evident on}} the Spector-dominated Death of a Ladies Man, Recent Songs, which was recorded at A&M Studios in Hollywood {{in the spring}} of 1979, sounds lucid by comparison. In the book Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life, oud player John Bilezikjian recalls to author Anthony Reynolds, [...] "Sessions started in the afternoon and wed go into the evenings. No drinking, that I saw, no visitors. Finished at a reasonable time, no early hours stuff...He <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> whatever <b>it</b> was I wanted to do. He trusted my sense of musicality. He would be with a microphone and headphones and wed all be wired up in our separate booths and wed listen and add our part." [...] The album had a largely acoustic, Eastern-tinged flavor and was augmented by the singing of Jennifer Warnes and newcomer Sharon Robinson, who would go on to become one of Cohens favorite musical collaborators.|$|R
6000|$|Jim {{said the}} rock {{was worse than}} the logs; {{he said it would}} take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out. But Tom said he would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> help him <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] exclaimed {{the girl}} reproachfully, {{after a moment}} of swift {{reflection}} and recognition, [...] "I don't see how you could <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it!</b> You don't suppose that I should have talked so with every one? It was because you were another American, and such an old friend of Mrs. Bowen's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too hasty, sir," [...] she cried. [...] "You {{forget that}} I {{have made no}} answer. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the {{compliment}} you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but {{it is impossible for}} me to do otherwise than to decline them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} for what you are, Sir Charles, and that is a noble, slap-up Corinthian. But if I was to use this against you, d'ye see, it would be worth 'undreds in my pocket. But my 'eart won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> for Bill Warr's always been on the side o' good sport and fair play. If I use it for you, then I expect that you won't see me the loser." ...|$|E
60|$|In the advertised 'Blackwood,' {{do you see}} {{an article}} called 'Poetic Aberration'? It came into my head {{that it might be}} a stone thrown at me, and Robert went to Monaldini's to glance at it. Sure enough it is a stone. He says a violent attack. And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> him justice. <b>It</b> was only the {{misstatement}} in the 'Athenæum' which overset him, only the first fire which made him wink. Now he turns a hero's face to all this cannonading. He doesn't care a straw, he says, and what's more, he doesn't, really. So I, who was only sorry for him, can't care. Observe, Isa, if there had been less violence and more generosity, the poems would obviously have been less deserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have little}} more to tell," [...] she continued. [...] "Dear Dr McTougall had {{attended}} me in the hospital, and took a fancy to me. When I was well enough to leave, he took me home to be governess to his children. But my situation has been an absolute sinecure as yet, for he says I am {{not strong enough to}} work, and won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> anything. <b>It</b> was not till after I had left the hospital that I told my kind friend the mistake that had been made about my name, and about my lost grandmother. He has been very kind about that, and assisted me greatly at first in my search for her. But there are so many--so many people of the name of Willis in London--old ladies too! We called together on so many that he got tired of it at last. Of course I wrote to various people at York, and to the place where we had lived before going there, but nothing came of it, and now--my hopes have long ago died out--that is to say, almost--but I still continue to make inquiries." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I've got it at last, father! You know I've {{been trying}} to wheedle old Makitok into letting me open his mysterious bundle. Well, I prevailed on him to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> this afternoon. After {{unrolling}} bundle after bundle, I came at last to the centre, {{and found that it}} contained nothing whatever but this book, wrapped up in an old cotton pocket-handkerchief. The book is very old, father. See, 1611 on the first page. I did not take time to glance at more than that, but brought it straight away to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{said the}} dutiful son, [...] "if I'm {{to carry on}} this affair, I {{must be allowed to}} do it in my own way. You, I dare say, have more {{experience}} than I can boast, and if you choose to make the proposal yourself to Miss Wyndham on my behalf, I shall be delighted to leave the matter in your hands; but in that case, I shall choose to be absent from Grey Abbey.

6000|$|... "No {{one would}} see his face," [...] the woman said. [...] "I would wrap him up, and will give {{out that he}} is my own child.

6000|$|... "No? And yet I {{thought it}} so plain. My mother has {{told you that}} I am not religious--in her way, that is--that I am not a Christian.

But that is not her way, and through what she has said at the vicarage, and elsewhere about me I am now looked upon as one to be avoided.
