40|$|In Sub-Saharan Africa, 600 {{million people}} live without electricity. Despite the ambitions of governments and donors to invest in rural electrification, {{decisions}} about how to extend electricity access are being made {{in the absence of}} rigorous evidence. This dissertation combines four papers that address various aspects of the economics of rural electrification in Western Kenya. Chapter 1, which is based on joint work with Eric Brewer, Carson Christiano, Francis Meyo, Edward Miguel, Matthew Podolsky, Javier Rosa, and Catherine Wolfram, presents high-resolution spatial data on electrification rates in rural Kenya in order to quantify and visualize energy poverty in a novel way. Using a dataset of 20, 000 geo-tagged structures in Western Kenya, the chapter provides descriptive evidence that electrification rates remain very low despite significant investments in nearby grid infrastructure. The implication is that {{a substantial portion of the}} 600 million people without electricity may be “under grid” (as opposed to “off grid”), meaning that they are close enough to connect to a <b>low-voltage</b> <b>line</b> at a relatively low cost. This distinction is important because the policy implications for off grid and under grid communities are different. In under grid communities, it may be preferable to support policies that leverage existing infrastructure with the goal of increasing “last-mile” grid connectivity. There are active debates about whether increases in energy access should be driven by investments in electric grid infrastructure or small-scale “home solar” systems (e. g., solar lanterns and solar home systems). Chapter 2, which is based on joint work with Edward Miguel and Catherine Wolfram, summarizes the results of a household electrical appliance survey and describes how households in rural Kenya differ in terms of appliance ownership and aspirations. The data suggest that home solar is not a substitute for grid power. Furthermore, the environmental advantages of home solar are likely to be relatively small in countries like Kenya, where grid power is primarily derived from non-fossil fuel sources. Chapter 3, which is based on joint work with Edward Miguel and Catherine Wolfram, presents results from a field experiment that randomized the expansion of electric grid infrastructure to under grid households in rural Kenya. Electricity distribution is the canonical example of a natural monopoly. Randomized price offers show that demand for electricity connections falls sharply with price. Experimental variation in the number of connections combined with administrative cost data reveals considerable scale economies, as hypothesized. However, consumer surplus is far less than total costs at all price levels, suggesting that residential electrification may reduce social welfare. The chapter discusses how leakage, reduced demand (due to red tape, low reliability, and credit constraints), and spillovers may impact this conclusion. Based on the findings presented in Chapter 3, a question that follows is whether the gains from extending the grid to rural public facilities, such as secondary schools, are large enough to offset the costs of rural electrification. Chapter 4 presents an analysis on the impact of the rapid rollout of secondary school electricity connections in Western Kenya on the number of students writing the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination (“KCSE”), an important indicator for school completion in Kenya. The chapter presents some evidence that school electrification increases the number of KCSE examinees at boarding schools. In contrast, the effect at day schools is much smaller and is not statistically significant. The result suggests that school electrification may have a larger impact at schools where students are more likely to use electric lighting at night...|$|E

A {{frequency domain analysis}} on several commercially-available LEDs was performed to investigate the signature of the harmonic current injected into the power system. Four-core cables and four single-core cable arrangements (three phases and neutral) of small, medium, and large conductor cross sections, with the neutral conductor cross section approximately equal to the half of the phase conductors, were examined. The cables were modelled by using electromagnetic finite-element analysis software. High harmonic power losses (up to 2. 5 times the value corresponding to an undistorted current of the same rms value of the first harmonic of the LED current) were found. A generalized ampacity model was employed for re-rating the cables.

50|$|Differential {{signaling}} {{is often}} used in computers to reduce electromagnetic interference, because complete screening is not possible with microstrips and chips in computers, due to geometric constraints {{and the fact that}} screening does not work at DC. If a DC power supply <b>line</b> and a <b>low-voltage</b> signal <b>line</b> share the same ground, the power current returning through the ground can induce a significant voltage in it. A low-resistance ground reduces this problem to some extent. A balanced pair of microstrip lines is a convenient solution, because it does not need an additional PCB layer, as a stripline does. Because each line causes a matching image current in the ground plane, which is required anyway for supplying power, the pair looks like four lines and therefore has a shorter crosstalk distance than a simple isolated pair. In fact, it behaves as well as a twisted pair. Low crosstalk is important when many lines are packed into a small space, as on a typical PCB.|$|R

40|$|The grid in the {{northern}} part of Sweden is characterized by long radial lines with just a few customers. To secure electricity supply it is necessary to have a redundant feeding alternative. A loop structured grid which is used in the more populated urban area is a poor solution in the rural areas both regarding economy and technology due to the long distances. To feed {{the northern}} grid in Sweden a battery energy storage system (BESS) is therefore a solution that could secure the power delivery. An important aspect to investigate is how the electric power quality changes with the new feeder, but more importantly to secure disconnection of supply at fault occurrence.   This thesis investigates how a battery storage system installed at the end of a mid-voltage line affects the electric power quality and the protection system compared to a reference case which represents the line today. The mid-voltage line is an existing line {{in the northern}} grid and is a good representation of the general northern grid.     The results obtained from this study show that the loop impedance does not necessarily have to deteriorate with the new feeder, which means that the voltage quality in this aspect does not change. This is only true for this particular grid when the impedance contribution from the mid-voltage grid is small and the contribution from the low-voltage grid is large because of long and weak distribution <b>low-voltage</b> <b>lines.</b>     The inverter is the limiting factor for the short circuit currents, and the short circuit power and current decrease with the new feeder. At fault occurrence in the low voltage grid the short circuit current does not affect the fuse blow. However the inverter will disconnect for all fault occurrences in the mid-voltage grid, and for faults with high short circuit power in the low voltage grid. This means that the selectivity will decrease, but the system will have a high security level.   For this particular grid the results show that the transformer can be isolated from the ground. A residual overvoltage relay is enough for disconnection of grounding faults. Directional ground fault protection is not necessary for this line with this particular characteristics. If the sensitivity for the disconnection of grounding faults with high transition impedances is adjusted according to ground fault currents in island operation, the sensitivity then decreases at the event of a fault during normal operations when the battery storage system is charging. The sensitivity might also be tuned according to normal operation, which then results in a higher sensitivity than necessary during island operation. ...|$|R

As machine size scales upward, {{there are two}} important aspects of multiprocessor systems which will generally get worse rather than better: (1) interprocessor communication latency will increase and (2) the probability that some component in the system will fail will increase. Both of these problems can prevent us from realizing {{the potential benefits of}} large-scale multiprocessing. In this document we consider the problem of designing networks which simultaneously minimize communication latency while maximizing fault tolerance for large-scale multiprocessors. Using a synergy of techniques including connection topologies, routing protocols, signalling techniques, and packaging technologies we assemble integrated, system-level solutions to this network design problem.

We propose that this grid could utilize a complex multifunctional control unit capable of optimizing the working point and charging current of the system, while also implementing active power factor correction, lowering extant harmonic distortion and controlling the voltage level in the <b>low-voltage</b> power <b>lines.</b> The complex controller structure proposed in this paper contains the following novel components: an upper harmonic controller which (together with the connection voltage controller) minimizes the amplitudes of the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 9 th, and 11 th high order components in the output voltage; and a connection voltage controller which controls the energy flow between the low-voltage network, its renewable energy sources and the electrical vehicle batteries. Unlike other similar approaches, the harmonic controller proposed in this paper does not rely on a measured current signal but rather optimizes the voltage shape, the latter of which depends on the nonlinear distortion of the whole low-voltage transformer area and determines additional power losses. We analyzed the proposed controller via simulations in a Matlab environment and as a result, achieved substantial improvements to the output voltage, current waveform and energy flow of the system's low-voltage conditions.

We show that the proposed optimal solution improves the BER performance with respect to conventional systems and makes the receiver more robust against colored noise.

The first method considers no communication among the distributed generators and regulates the output voltage and frequency, ensuring acceptable load sharing. The droop equations are modified with a transformation matrix based on the line R/X ration for this purpose. The second proposed method, with minimal low bandwidth communication, modifies the reference frequency of the distributed generators based on the active and reactive power flow in the lines connected to the points of common coupling.

Parameters having major effect on the results, such as the lightning current amplitude and front time, the values of grounding resistances, the models of the loads and the lightning strike position were taken into consideration in the study. The results were obtained by simulations performed using the ATP (Alternative Transients Program). Waveforms are presented in order to provide information on the characteristics of the overvoltages in the consumers along the line. Currents, as well as energy absorbed by the low-voltage surge arresters are aldo presented and discussed, providing useful information about the performance of some protection alternatives...|$|R
