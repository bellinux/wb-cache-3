Several microstructure properties, namely, porosity, pore size distribution, surface fractal dimension and specific surface area have been investigated in this study to describe the effect of carbonation on microstructure. Both carbonated and non-carbonated <b>pastes</b> of <b>lime</b> and blended <b>pastes</b> of <b>lime</b> and cement having varying W/B (water/binder) ratios are studied.

Sometimes, air <b>lime</b> <b>pastes</b> and mortars were modified with two supplementary cementing materials (SCMs), namely nanosilica (NS) and metakaolin (MK).

A close relationship was found between the molecular architecture of the plasticizers and the flowability of the pastes. Zeta potential assessment allowed us to elucidate the main action mechanisms for these admixtures. In the case of polycarboxylate ethers, the large specific surface area of nanosilica led to a large SPs consumption as compared with metakaolin with lower surface area. However, polycarboxylate ethers in MK-lime samples were attached favourably to the C-S-H and aluminate hydrates, so that the dispersing action was greater with respect to NS-lime suspensions...|$|R

The reaction rates obtained from the net CO 2 uptake by Ca(OH) 2 and that obtained from the calcite precipitation were compared for lime putty and <b>lime</b> hydrate <b>pastes</b> carbonated in CO 2 atmosphere (7 mol/m 3, 17 mol/m 3 and 33 mol/m 3). The results indicate that the carbonation reaction is initially rapid and chemically controlled at the exposed surface with a strong limitation of CO 2 diffusion by the pore water. The reaction proceeds with a chemical reaction controlled regime at a much higher rate followed by a transition to a CO 2 -diffusion controlled regime by the carbonated sample depth. Partial drying and formation of amorphous CaCO 3 on the portlandite faces has been found to create a dormant effect for the calcite precipitation at the first stage. Lime putty indicates faster carbonation than lime hydrate due to its small particle size and morphology properties, both at a rate which is independent of the CO 2 gas concentration. These results will contribute to the understanding of lime carbonation in lime-based mortars for applications in heritage conservation, in renovation and in modern brick and stone masonry. status: publishe...|$|R

In addition, this enzyme favors the formation of stable calcite and significantly modifies its morphology by developing new crystal faces.

The extended range of pore sizes and the intrinsic heterogeneity of the medium do not allow {{the use of a}} single-scale percolation network for numerically describing the topology and the physical processes related to fluid retention and transfer. Three different scales are used for the numerical description of the cement and lime mortar studied in this paper. Electron scanning pictures are used for the geometrical modelling of the material in the three different scales. The heterogeneity is associ,~ed with the fissures network, represented in the first scale, where the medium was conceived as a series of cubic blocks separated by straight channels.

Previous investigations of tensile bond strength have shown that bond strength is affected by brick suction, brick surface texture, mortar flow and composition, and other factors.

Pre-wetting the brick was shown to have a beneficial effect on the bond strength;Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the interface region show that the preponderant materials present for untreated brick are calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) and calcium hydroxide. Micrographs of brick treated with NaOH and H(, 3) PO(, 4) show the presence of complex crystals at the interface, which may account for the increased tensile bond strength observed with these treatments.

The thickening effect took place because polymer molecules were adsorbed onto lime particles acting as a flocculant, as confirmed by zeta-potential and particle size distribution results.

XRD results indicated that carbonation reaction initiated immediately with the uptake of CO 2 by the water film and the precipitation of calcite crystals on the sample surface.

Upon drying, carbonation was accelerated through this diffusion process and resulted in a complete precipitation of calcite crystals on the sample surface while the reaction continued along the sample thickness at a reduced rate. Continuous measurement of RH during carbonation evidenced the acceleration of the reaction with the production of water. Higher reaction rates were recorded for the samples with a higher content of water due to an increase in the amount of dissolved CO 2.

Simulations of the pore solution chemistry for different stages and conditions of carbonation were performed using the PHREEQC code to investigate {{the evolution of the}} chemistry of the system. Results indicate initial precipitation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) which in turn transforms into scalenohedral calcite under excess Ca 2 + ions. Due to their polar character, scalenohedral faces (type S) interact more strongly with excess Ca 2 + than non-polar rhombohedral faces (type F), an effect that ultimately favors the stabilization of faces. Following the full consumption of Ca 2 + ions and further dissolution of CO 2 leading to a pH drop of the pore solution, scalenohedra are subjected to dissolution. This eventually results in re-precipitation of rhombohedra at close-to-neutral pH. This crystallization sequence progresses through the carbonated depth with a strong dependence on the degree of exposure to CO 2, which is controlled by the carbonated pore structure governing the diffusion of CO 2. Both the carbonation process and the scalenohedral-to-rhombohedral transformation are kinetically favored under high RH and high pCO 2. Supersaturation plays a critical role on the nucleation density and size of CaCO 3 crystals.
