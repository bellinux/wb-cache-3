25|$|Sticks: Sticks are the {{analogue}} to guns in {{the world}} of Derlavai. A stick emits a beam of energy which leaves behind a sharp scent like that of a nearby lightning strike. A soldier's stick is a <b>large</b> <b>device</b> and is activated when bare flesh such as an uncovered finger is inserted into its 'blazing hole'. The beam from a soldier's stick can burn a hole through a person with little difficulty, although they are largely ineffective against dragons and behemoths, which are not only naturally tough but also armored or painted silver to reflect beams. Smaller sticks are seen owned by civilians for blazing vermin or hunting game, or used by constables. Larger sticks, known as heavy sticks, are carried by behemoths on the battlefield, and can blaze through several men, another behemoth's armor or even take down dragons. Even larger heavy sticks can be used as fixed installations on the ground, used for air and sea defense, and carried on ley-line warships for use against ships, dragons and leviathans. Portable sticks used away from a power point or ley line require periodic recharging, which can be achieved in some unspecified way through the delivery of what is only described as 'charges' in supply wagons, or by the interventions of a mage drawing energy from a power point or sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|KFC {{initially}} used stove-top covered cooking pots to fry its chicken. In the 1960s, the officially recommended {{model was}} the L S Hartzog developed [...] "KFC 20-Head Cooker", a <b>large</b> <b>device</b> that cost $16,000. The Hartzog model had no oil filtration system, meaning that filtering {{had to be}} done manually, and the pressure fryers occasionally exploded, often causing harm to employees. In 1969, inventor and engineer Winston L. Shelton developed the [...] "Collectramatic" [...] pressurized fryer to overcome the problems KFC faced in quickly frying chicken to meet growing customer demand. The Collectramatic used precision time and temperature controls and self-filtered the cooking oil – all while meeting Colonel Sanders’ legendary high quality standards. Fred Jeffries, then vice president of purchasing at KFC, claimed that the invention helped fuel the company's rapid expansion and success: ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{scalable}} small signal HEMT model. We propose a general intrinsic model unit cell to build <b>larger</b> transistor <b>devices</b> according to our need and model the metal according to individual geometry using a lumped element network. The challenge we address is extraction of this network from measurement. The parameters of the intrinsic part of the transistor have been extracted from different size of transistors and scaling rule applied to the unit cell. We used MathCAD worksheet to de-embed the TriQuint transistor parameters.

5000|$|After styluses, pucks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. This is opposed to a mouse pointing device, which can only sense its relative velocity on a surface (most tablet drivers are capable of allowing a puck to emulate a mouse in operation, and many pucks are marketed as a [...] "mouse"). Pucks range in size and shape; some are externally indistinguishable from a mouse, while others are a fairly <b>large</b> <b>device</b> with dozens of buttons and controls. Professional pucks often have a reticle or loupe which allows the user to see the exact point on the tablet's surface targeted by the puck, for detailed tracing and computer aided design (CAD) work.|$|E

50|$|A version {{used by the}} U.S. Air Force, the U1050-II {{real-time}} system, {{had some}} extra peripherals. The most significant of these was the FASTRAND 1 Drum Storage Unit. This physically <b>large</b> <b>device</b> had two contra-rotating drums mounted horizontally, one above {{the other in a}} pressurised cabinet. Read-write heads were mounted on a horizontally moving beam between the drums, driven by a voice coil servo external to the pressurised cabinet. This high-speed access subsystem allowed the real-time operation. Another feature was the communications subsystem with modem links to remote sites. A Uniservo VI-C tape drive provided an audit trail for the transactions. Other Peripherals were the card reader and punch, and printer. The operator's console had the 'stop and go' buttons and a Teletype Model 33 teleprinter for communication and control.|$|E
5000|$|Booth {{created a}} <b>large</b> <b>device,</b> {{driven by an}} {{internal}} combustion engine. Nicknamed the [...] "Puffing Billy", Booth's first petrol-powered, horse-drawn vacuum cleaner relied upon air drawn by a piston pump through a cloth filter. It did not contain any brushes; all the cleaning was done by suction through long tubes with nozzles on the ends. Although the machine was too bulky to {{be brought into the}} building, its principles of operation were essentially the same as the vacuum cleaners of today. He followed this up with an electric-powered model, but both designs were extremely bulky, and had to be transported by horse and carriage. The term [...] "vacuum cleaner" [...] was first used by the company set up to market Booth's invention, in its first issued prospectus of 1901.|$|E
50|$|A {{partition}} editor (also called partitioning utility) {{is a kind}} {{of utility}} software designed to view, create, modify or delete disk partitions. Some partition software popular in market, such as diskpart, PartitionMagic and AOMEI Partition Assistant. A disk partition is a logical segment of the storage space on a storage device. By partitioning a <b>large</b> <b>device</b> into several partitions, it is possible to isolate various types of data from one another, and allow the coexistence of two or more operating systems simultaneously. Features and capabilities of partition editors vary, but generally they can create several partition on a disk, or one contiguous partition on several disks, at the discretion of the user. They can also, shrink a partition to allow more partitions created on a storage device, or delete one and expand an adjacent partition into the available space.|$|E

50|$|The first QED {{microprocessor}} was the R4600. The {{founders of}} QED, who were previously {{involved with the}} R4000, felt that the <b>large</b> <b>device</b> was too complicated and that a simpler implementation would give a better price/performance ratio. For that reason, the R4600 is a re-implementation of the 5-stage Classic RISC pipeline with large (for the time) caches. For a while, this small and low cost device {{was one of the}} highest performance microprocessors on the market. While the initial target market of a MIPS laptop computer never materialized, this device found success in several markets. It was the first RISC processor used within a Cisco Systems network router. It was used in several Atari/Midway arcade games such as the well-known original Mortal Kombat game. The R4600 was licensed by IDT and Toshiba who manufactured and sold the devices.|$|E
5000|$|The Treo 600 is {{a rather}} <b>large</b> <b>device</b> by cell phone {{standards}} but compact for a PDA. The 600 is slightly wider and deeper than its predecessor and is nearly half an inch slimmer, giving it a more cell-phone like feel. The new form factor {{has been compared to}} a bar of soap. The design is definitely an example of form-follows-function, the front of the phone consists of a full QWERTY keyboard at the bottom with menu and home buttons at the bottom right. Above the keyboard are the 4 application buttons with a [...] "five-way" [...] navigator in-between. Each application button can be mapped to two applications, {{with the exception of the}} last button which has one of its functions permanently mapped to the on/off. Above the buttons and navigator is a small Treo logo and the large 160x160 color touch screen.|$|E
50|$|A desktop-replacement laptop is a {{class of}} <b>large</b> <b>device</b> which is not {{intended}} primarily for mobile use. They are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer. Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops. They are capable of containing more powerful components and have a 15-inch or larger display. Desktop replacement laptops' operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops; in rare cases they have no battery at all. In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price {{at the expense of}} battery life, although this practice has largely died out. The names Media Center Laptops and Gaming Laptops are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.|$|E
