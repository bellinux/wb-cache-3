A core principle of Dream Farm is that sustainable systems are organisms, comprising the farmer, livestock and crops. In a Dream Farm, very little input is wasted or exported to the environment; most are recycled and kept inside the system by consciously integrating food and energy production. Mr. Chan has been a pioneer in the field of sustainable recycling of waste using agro-ecological systems. He developed the Integrated Farming and Waste Management System, which involves a sustainable cycle in which matter and energy circulate through different stages, dramatically increasing yields.Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008) of Japan lived a long and dutiful life in partnership with his environment. He was a farmer, activist, and author of the practices and theory of natural farming, on which he based his four core uncompromising principles: no cultivation, no (chemical) fertilizers, no weeding, and no pesticides. Among his teachings is that for a farmer to be successful, he must form a partnership with the natural environment, derive an intimate understanding of it together with the plants a farmer chooses to grow.

40|$|The Paspalum and Axonopus genera {{are among}} the main warm season grasses used for <b>lawns.</b> The <b>seed</b> {{propagation}} contributes to the decrease {{of the cost of}} establishment, besides maintaining the exact characteristics of the mother plant genotype, because they are apomictic species. The objective of this work was to evaluate the seed production potential of seventeen grass accesses of the species Paspalum notatum, P. lepton, P. lividum and Axonopus parodii. The experiment was conducted at Capão do Leão, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in a randomized block design, with four replications. The evaluated variables were: number of inflorescences per area, number of florets per inflorescence and seed production potential (SPP). In order to measure the seed production potential of the accesses, the equation proposed is: SPP = number of florets per inflorescence x number of inflorescences per m 2. There were year, access and interaction between years and accesses effect for the traits number of inflorescences per area and seed production potential. For the number of florets per inflorescence, there was no year effect. Potential production for the 2013 / 2014 harvest, ranged from 19, 152. 00 to 135, 062. 70 seeds m- ², with PN 09 of the P. notatum species standing out.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Comparisons {{were made}} of the {{abilities}} of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris and Streptococcus diacetilactis bacteriophages to endure various laboratory isolation and storage treatments. Neutralization of Cottage cheese whey containing phages offered no survival advantage over unneutralized samples, refrigeration of neutral and acid whey samples increased the survival of only the S. diacetilactis phage. About 50 percent of the phages could be recovered from milk coagulated by addition of lactic acid to provide casein-free, clear, phage-containing whey. Sterilization of phage lysates by membrane filtration allowed collection of 92 to 99 percent of the phages; Seitz filtration allowed collection of a maximum of 24 percent. Whey samples containing phages could be concentrated by removing water using polyethylene glycol. Lyophilization decreased phage titers at least 50 percent. Cross reaction patterns of phages for strains of lactic streptococci revealed that similar strains were present in cultures supplied by several companies. For example, phages which were lytic for strains isolated from one brand of commercial mixed strain starter cultures would lyse strains isolated from {{as many as three}} different brands of starter cultures. The lytic patterns of 60 bacteriophage races toward 100 single lactic streptococcal strains allowed the establishment of eight phage groups, A through H. The phages within a particular group were generally species specific. However several exceptions were noted. Group A phages attacked primarily strains of S. diacetilactis. Groups B through H phages mainly attacked strains of S. lactis and S. cremoris. Groups G and H consisted of one phage that attacked only the homologous host. Lytic reactions determined by multiple printing of phages on <b>lawns</b> <b>seeded</b> with possible hosts were employed for selecting strains to be used in mixed-strain starter cultures. A computer was used in selecting strains for blending into mixed-strain cultures with resulting maximum protection against phage. The strains selected by the computer were arranged in a sequence or rotation system suitable for use in dairy plant fermentations. Protection from phage infection as determined by a resistance index remained high for six successive cultures, but the addition of the seventh culture to the rotation system increased the likelihood of phage attack significantly. Neutralization of representatives of each host range phage group by standardized rabbit antisera prepared against four different phages revealed similarity among several groups. However the neutralization of phages was not constant within each group. Electron photomicrographs of a phage for S. diacetilactis revealed a tadpole-shaped particle. The head width and length were each about 60 mμ, the tail width was about 10 mμ and the tail length was about 170 mμ. There also were suggestions for a polyhedral head structure in enlarged (84, 000 X) pictures of the viruses. Chemical compositional studies of the phage studied by electron microscopy revealed that phosphorus represented 4. 45 percent of the phage dry weight. Nitrogen was found to constitute 12. 8 percent of the phage protein. A ratio of phage phosphorus to phage protein nitrogen of 2. 7 was determined. Bacteriophages prepared in broth medium were recovered by differential centrifugation and purified in cesium chloride density gradients. An amino acid analysis revealed the following mole percentages for the amino acids quantitated: lysine, 8. 1; histidine, 1. 7; arginine, 3. 8; aspartic acid and asparagine, 10. 0; threonine, 7. 5; serine, 6. 8; glutamic acid and glutamine, 12. 1; proline, 3. 4; glycine, 9. 0; alanine, 9. 5; valine, 8. 7; methionine, 1. 1; isoleucine, 7. 9; tyrosine, 2. 2 and phenylalanine, 2. 8. The nucleic acid of the phage was determined to be double-stranded DNA with a thermal melting point of 84. 3 °C, indicating an average base composition of 35. 7 percent guanine plus cytosine. Calculated values for percentage DNA and protein composition of the phage were 44 and 56 percent respectively. The density of the phage was calculated to be 1. 47 g/cc...|$|R
60|$|When, {{standing}} in the village street, your eye travels up that white band, you can distinctly make out even at that distance a small, solitary tree standing near the summit--an old thorn with an ivy growing on it. My walks were often that way, and invariably on coming to that point I would turn twenty yards aside from the road to spend half an hour seated on the turf near or under the old tree. These half-hours were always grateful; and conscious that the tree drew me to it I questioned myself as to the reason. It was, I told myself, nothing but mental curiosity: my interest was a purely scientific one. For how comes it, I asked, that a thorn can grow to a tree and live to a great age in such a situation, on a vast, naked down, where for many centuries, perhaps for thousands of years, the herbage has been so closely fed by sheep as to have {{the appearance of a}} carpet, or newly mown <b>lawn?</b> The <b>seed</b> is carried and scattered everywhere by the birds, but no sooner does it germinate and send up a shoot than it is eaten down to the roots; for there is no scent that attracts a sheep more, no flavour it has greater taste for, than that of any forest seedling springing up amidst the minute herbaceous plants which carpet the downs. The thorn, like other organisms, has its own unconscious intelligence and cunning, by means of which it endeavours to save itself and fulfil its life. It opens its first tender leaves under the herbage, {{and at the same time}} thrusts up a vertical spine to wound the nibbling mouth; and no sooner has it got a leaf or two and a spine than it spreads its roots all round, and from each of them springs a fresh shoot, leaves and protecting spine, to increase the chances of preservation. In vain! the cunning animal finds a way to defeat all this strategy, and after the leaves have been bitten off again and again, the infant plant gives up the struggle and dies in the ground. Yet we see that from time to time one survives--one perhaps in a million; but how--whether by a quicker growth or a harder or more poisonous thorn, an unpalatable leaf, or some other secret agency--we cannot guess. First as a diminutive scrubby shrub, with numerous iron-hard stems, with few and small leaves but many thorns, it keeps its poor flowerless frustrate life for perhaps half a century or longer, without growing more than a couple of feet high; and then, as by a miracle, it will spring up until its top shoots are out of reach of the browsing sheep, and in the end it becomes a tree with spreading branches and fully developed leaves, and flowers and fruit in their season.|$|R
