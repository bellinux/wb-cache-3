The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high <b>landing</b> <b>charges.</b> However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand.

50|$|Located in the Central Tablelands, Bathurst Airport {{is served}} by one airline, Regional Express Airlines (Rex). The airport's history dates to just prior the Second World War when local {{politicians}} campaigned for an airport for Bathurst.

Today several flying schools operate {{at the airport and}} it is used frequently by trainee pilots during their navigation training. There are no <b>landing</b> <b>charges</b> for aircraft under 2000 kg which makes it a popular option as a destination for many pilots, mostly trainee pilots from Bankstown and Camden Airports in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

50|$|Crown debt, in English law, a {{debt due}} to the crown. By various statutes, the first dating from the reign of Henry VIII of England (in 1541), the crown has {{priority}} for its debts before all other creditors. At common law the crown always had a lien on the lands and goods of debtors by record, which could be enforced even when they had passed {{into the hands of}} other persons. The difficulty of ascertaining whether lands were subject to a crown lien or not was often very great, and a remedy was provided by the Judgments Act 1839, and the Crown Suits Act Coronets of Viscounts and Barons 1865. Now by the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Act 1900, no debt {{due to the}} crown operates as a <b>charge</b> on <b>land</b> until a writ of execution for the purpose of enforcing it has been registered under the <b>Land</b> <b>Charges</b> Registration and Searches Act 1888. By the Act of 1541 specialty debts were put practically on the same footing as debts by record. Simple contract debts due to the crown also become specialty debts, and the rights of the crown are enforced by a summary process called an extent.|$|R
