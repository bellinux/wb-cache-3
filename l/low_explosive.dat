25|$|Gunpowder is {{classified}} as a <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low brisance. Low explosives deflagrate (i.e., burn) at subsonic speeds, whereas high explosives detonate, producing a supersonic wave. Ignition of powder packed behind a bullet must generate enough pressure to force it from the muzzle at high speed, {{but not enough to}} rupture the gun barrel. Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant, but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications. Gunpowder was widely used to fill artillery shells and in mining and civil engineering to blast rock until {{the second half of the}} 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use. Gunpowder is no longer used in modern weapons nor is it used for industrial purposes due to its relatively inefficient cost compared to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil. Today gunpowder firearms are limited primarily to hunting, target shooting, and bulletless historical reenactments.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{relatively}} low-yield, or <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> energy [...] "A-bombs" [...] dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which did {{result in a}} sizable proportion of injuries from prompt radiation, higher yield [...] "Hydrogen bombs"(thermonuclear weapons) {{are not expected to}} result in very many such injuries. As the range at which the ionizing radiation from higher yield devices is of primary concern, is already well inside the hyper-lethal blast and flash burn areas.|$|E
2500|$|Gunpowder is a <b>low</b> <b>explosive,</b> that is, it {{does not}} {{detonate}} but rather deflagrates (burns quickly). This is an advantage in a propeller device, where you don't want a shock that would shatter the gun and potentially harm the operator, however it is a drawback when some explosion is wanted. In that case, gunpowder (and most importantly, gases produced by its burning) must be confined. Since it contains its own oxidizer and additionally burns faster under pressure, its combustion is capable of bursting containers such as shell, grenade, or improvised [...] "pipe bomb" [...] or [...] "pressure cooker" [...] casings to form shrapnel.|$|E
5000|$|Class B <b>explosives</b> {{included}} <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> such as [...] "display fireworks" [...] {{which were}} the larger and more powerful fireworks used at most public displays.|$|R
50|$|An {{explosive}} {{is classified}} as a <b>low</b> or high <b>explosive</b> according to its rate of burn: <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> burn rapidly (or deflagrate), while high explosives detonate. While these definitions are distinct, the problem of precisely measuring rapid decomposition makes practical classification of explosives difficult.|$|R
50|$|<b>Low</b> <b>explosives</b> are {{compounds}} {{where the}} rate of decomposition proceeds through the material at less {{than the speed of}} sound. The decomposition is propagated by a flame front (deflagration) which travels much more slowly through the explosive material than a shock wave of a high explosive. Under normal conditions, <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> undergo deflagration at rates that vary from a few centimetres per second to approximately 400 metres per second. It is possible for them to deflagrate very quickly, producing an effect similar to a detonation. This can happen under higher pressure or temperature, which usually occurs when ignited in a confined space.|$|R
2500|$|Song {{established}} another {{capital in}} modern Hangzhou and the Jin forces followed. The fighting that ensued {{would see the}} first proto-gun, the fire lance, in action. Despite the <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> potential of 11th century gunpowder, it's possible that it was already being utilized in early projectile weapons such as the fire lance. There is some minor evidence of this based on an artistic depiction {{of it in the}} form of [...] slightly predating the Wujing Zongyao showing a demon pointing {{what appears to be a}} fire lance at the Buddha, trying to disturb his meditation. Although most Chinese scholars reject the appearance of the fire lance prior to the Jin-Song wars, a Song text from 1000 and the Wujing Zongyao do make brief mentions of the fire lance. The fire lance, as implied by the name, is essentially a long spear or pole affixed with a tube of gunpowder, and as it saw more usage, the tube's length became longer and pellets were added to the composition.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrocellulose: A {{nitrated}} polymer {{which can}} be a high or <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> depending on nitration level and conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... a {{propellant}} {{consisting of}} a secondary <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> that emits {{a large amount of}} gas as it deflagrates.|$|E
5000|$|Class C <b>explosives</b> {{included}} other <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> such as igniters, fuses and [...] "common fireworks", {{which were}} the smaller and less powerful fireworks available for sale to and use by the general public.|$|R
50|$|The {{containment}} {{provided by}} the pressure cooker means that the energy from the explosion is confined until the pressure cooker itself explodes, creating a relatively large explosion using <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> and generating potentially lethal shrapnel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{properties}} of the explosive indicate the class into which it falls. In some cases explosives {{can be made to}} fall into either class by the conditions under which they are initiated. In sufficiently large quantities, almost all <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> can undergo a Deflagration to Detonation Transition (DDT). For convenience, <b>low</b> and high <b>explosives</b> may be d by the shipping and storage classes.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{depends on}} the fact that black powder is a <b>low</b> <b>explosive,</b> which burns more rapidly when under pressure.|$|E
50|$|When {{cupric oxide}} is {{substituted}} for iron oxide in thermite the resulting mixture is a <b>low</b> <b>explosive,</b> not an incendiary.|$|E
50|$|Otto Fuel II, {{a mixture}} of the <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> {{propylene}} glycol dinitrate with a stabilizer, has also been tried in 37mm guns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Low</b> <b>explosives</b> are {{normally}} employed as propellants. Included {{in this group}} are petroleum products such as propane and gasoline, gunpowder (both black and smokeless), and light pyrotechnics, such as flares and fireworks, but can replace high explosives in certain applications, see gas pressure blasting.|$|R
5000|$|A {{triggering}} sequence, {{also called}} an explosive train, is {{a sequence of}} events that culminates in the detonation of explosives. For safety reasons, most widely used high explosives are difficult to detonate. A primary explosive of higher sensitivity is used to trigger a uniform and predictable detonation of {{the main body of}} the explosive. Although the primary explosive itself is generally a more sensitive and expensive compound, it is only used in small quantities and in relatively safely packaged forms. By design there are <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> and high explosives made such that the <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> are highly sensitive (i.e. their 'Figure of Insensitivity' is <b>low)</b> and high <b>explosives</b> are comparatively insensitive. This not only affords inherent safety to the usage of explosives during handling and transport, but also necessitates an explosive triggering sequence or explosive train. The explosive triggering sequence or the explosive train essentially consists of an 'initiator', an 'intermediary' and the 'high explosive'.|$|R
50|$|A pipe bomb is {{an improvised}} {{explosive}} device, {{which uses a}} tightly sealed section of pipe filled with an explosive material. The containment provided by the pipe means that simple <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> {{can be used to}} produce a relatively large explosion, and the fragmentation of the pipe itself creates potentially lethal shrapnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest type {{of bombs}} store {{energy in the}} form of a <b>low</b> <b>explosive.</b> Black powder is an example of a <b>low</b> <b>explosive.</b> Low explosives typically consist of a composition of an oxidizing salt, such as potassium nitrate, and solid fuel, such as charcoal or aluminum powder. These compositions deflagrate upon ignition producing hot gas. Under normal circumstances deflagration occurs too slowly to produce a significant pressure wave. Low explosives must, therefore, be used in large quantities or confined in a container with a high burst pressure to be used as a bomb.|$|E
50|$|The mine has a {{relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> content, so will maim rather than kill. Its blast resistance {{combined with the}} lack of metal in the mine make it extremely difficult to clear.|$|E
50|$|A <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> {{is usually}} a mixture of a {{combustible}} substance and an oxidant that decomposes rapidly (deflagration); however, they burn more slowly than a high explosive, which has an extremely fast burn rate.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, rocket candy motors {{are legal}} to make, but illegal to {{transport}} without a <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> users permit. Since they count as amateur motors, a user must launch {{them at a}} sanctioned Tripoli Rocketry Association research launch and must {{have at least a}} Tripoli Rocketry Association high power level 2 certification. Similar laws apply in Canada, the UK, and Australia.|$|R

5000|$|BLU-43/B and BLU-44/B (Bomb Live Unit) [...] "Dragontooth" [...] were air-dropped {{cluster-type}} {{land mines}} {{used by the}} United States during the Vietnam War. It is chemically activated and has a relatively <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> content, typically maiming rather than killing.|$|E
50|$|Gunpowder is a <b>low</b> <b>explosive,</b> best {{used as a}} propellant. Guncotton, {{the first}} high explosive, more useful for its {{destructive}} powers, was invented by Dr Christian Schonbein, of the University of Basel, in 1846. Under licence from him, it was first manufactured at Faversham’s Marsh Works in 1847.|$|E
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the detonation performance of an explosive charge can be gained by directly measuring pressure, temperature and velocity of detonation (VOD). This is particularly important with commercial explosives because their performance is directly influenced by the degree of confinement given by the borehole diameter and the surrounding rock mass. A project funded by the Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) was initiated in early 2009 with the view to design and build cost effective prototype instrumentation to measure the relative differences in detonation pressures and temperatures of commercial mining explosives. The project’s primary focus was on <b>low</b> density <b>explosives.</b> <b>Low</b> density (also referred to as <b>low</b> shock) <b>explosives</b> have been available in various forms for nearly 20 years. Identifying the pressure release patterns of both conventional and <b>low</b> density <b>explosives</b> under different geotechnical conditions should provide the necessary information to both validate detonation codes and better define input parameters for breakage and fragmentation models. This paper gives a general description of the prototype instrumentation developed and reports on the results obtained to date in testing the proposed instrumentation in laboratory scale conditions...|$|R
50|$|A small (VEI 2) {{eruption}} {{took place}} in 1824 on Saddle Island, with <b>low</b> level <b>explosive</b> activity. An eruption may have taken place on August 14, 1846, but this event is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|Fortifications of {{this type}} {{continued}} to be effective while the attackers were armed only with cannon, {{where the majority of}} the damage inflicted was caused by momentum from the impact of solid shot. Because only <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> such as black powder were available, explosive shells were largely ineffective against such fortifications. The development of mortars, high explosives, and the consequent large increase in the destructive power of explosive shells and thus plunging fire rendered the intricate geometry of such fortifications irrelevant. Warfare was to become more mobile. It took, however, many years to abandon the old fortress thinking.|$|R
50|$|While {{conventional}} bunker busters utilize several {{methods to}} penetrate concrete structures, these {{are for the}} purpose of destroying the structure directly, and are generally limited in how much of a bunker (or system of bunkers) they can destroy by depth and their relatively <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> force (versus nuclear weapons).|$|E
50|$|Albion Explosives Factory (MDK) - Deer Park, Brimbank City, Victoria (1940-?). Converted ammonia into nitric acid, {{which was}} then used to make cordite and TNT. It also made Carbamite - a <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> made from {{combining}} urea (or carbamide) and nitric acid - and Nitroglycerine, (a high explosive made from combining glycerol and nitric acid).|$|E
50|$|Fireworks are a {{class of}} <b>low</b> <b>explosive</b> {{pyrotechnic}} devices used for aesthetic and entertainment purposes. The most common use of a firework is {{as part of a}} fireworks display (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places.|$|E
5000|$|An {{explosion}} is a {{rapid increase}} in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures {{and the release of}} gases. Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves. [...] explosions are created by <b>low</b> <b>explosives</b> through a slower burning process known as deflagration. When caused by a human-made device such as an exploding rocket or firework, the audible component of an explosion is referred to as its [...] "report" [...] (which can also be used as a verb, e.g., [...] "the rocket reported loudly upon impact").|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of Sunday morning on 2 December 1984, in cold sleety conditions, Mac Giolla Bhrighde and Fleming stole a Toyota van in Pettigo, County Donegal. The van was then loaded with 9 beer kegs, each {{containing}} 100lbs of <b>low</b> <b>explosives.</b> They then crossed the border and travelled to nearby Kesh, a village in the north of County Fermanagh. At the Drumrush Lodge Restaurant, just outside Kesh, they planted a landmine in a lane leading to the restaurant and wired up a device which was connected to an observation point. From there a hoax call was made to lure the British Army to the restaurant on the pretence that there was a firebomb planted within the restaurant.|$|R
50|$|A {{blast injury}} {{is a complex}} type of {{physical}} trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives {{as well as the}} deflagration of <b>low</b> order <b>explosives.</b> These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.|$|R
