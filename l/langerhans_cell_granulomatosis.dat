40|$|Introduction. Pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> is a {{rare disease}} with a {{variable}} course. In pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> pulmonary hypertension is frequent and has an independent prognostic impact. A vasculopathy which ist not related to ventilatory disturbance and fibrosis has been identified. An arteriopathy and even a venulopathy have been described. Due to this possible venulopathy vasodilators carry a significant risk for pulmonary congestion and edema. No drugs have been approved until now. Case Presentation. One female with PLCG developed severe PH four years after primary diagnosis of pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis.</b> Retrospective analysis of lung biopsies revealed an arterial vasculopathy {{at the time of}} primary diagnosis without clinical signs of PH at this time. Sildenafil led to a sustained improvement of hemodynamic features and exercise capacity. Conclusion. This paper underlines that patients with PLCG with an arterial vasculopathy-related PH might improve under sildenafil. Further trials addressing treatment of PH and vasculopathy are needed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the differential diagnosis}} of unusual and distinct pathological changes in the skeletal remains of a + 40 year old female from 15 th- 20 th century Coimbra (Portugal). The most affected area {{seems to have been}} the skull, but multiple lesions, lytic and/or blastic, have been found throughout the post-cranial skeleton, more specifically, in the scapulae, clavicles, humerus, sternum, ribs, sacrum, innominates, and femurs. The differential diagnosis of the lesions gave rise to several possible pathological conditions, namely, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis (<b>granulomatosis</b> or Histiocytosis X), multiple myeloma, and metastatic carcinoma. Various macroscopic and radiological aspects lead us to consider metastatic carcinoma as the most probable diagnose. Despite the argumentative identity of the possible primary lesion, age, sex and the mixed nature of the osseous response are consistent with cancer of the breast but do not exclude other carcinomas, namely lung cancer. With temporal and regional differences emerging in the frequency of malignant tumours, the identification of new cases becomes important, particularly from geographic areas where few cases have been reported. In fact, the present report adds to the only case of metastatic carcinoma detected in non-identified Portuguese human skeletal remains until now...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) {{is known to}} infect <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> but controversy still exists about the occurrence of HIV-infected <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the skin of HIV-infected individuals and about the density of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> {{during the course of}} HIV disease. In this study, epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> population densities were analyzed quantitatively in serial biopsies from two burn patients acquired over an 11 -y period following infection with HIV from transfusions received during their acute treatment. At each biopsy time point, the density of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and the proportion that were infected with HIV were analyzed by immunostaining. In both patients, skin grafts were slow to repopulate with <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and did not attain normal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> densities until about 2 y after grafting. Thereafter, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> densities remained within normal limits with the exception of six biopsies at random times that showed a supernormal number of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> HIV-infected <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were first detected at about 2 y post-infection and comprised about one-third of the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> population. At subsequent times, HIV p 24 -stained <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were identified in most biopsies and typically constituted about one third to one half of the total <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> population. The findings show that HIV-bearing <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> constitute a significant proportion of the epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> population over long periods of asymptomatic disease but are unevenly distributed throughout the skin. Normal population densities of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> are maintained for years, although transient increases may occur randomly...|$|R

40|$|<b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> are MHC class II (Ia) {{positive}} antigen- presenting {{cells that}} {{play a crucial}} role in the induction of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). The topical application of a hapten modifies the cell surface moieties of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> and activates <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> to increase their size and Ia intensity. The haptenated and activated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> emigrate from the epidermis and thus the in situ density of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> usually decreases during 24 - 48 h after the hapten application in CHS. To determine whether the early activation pattern of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> is different between the afferent phase and the efferent phase of CHS, we compared the density and morphologic changes of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in CHS to trinitrochlorobenzene using nonsensitized and sensitized mice. We found that the application of a hapten induces more significant enlargement of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> size in the afferent phase than in the efferent phase, whereas the reduction of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> density is more marked in the efferent than in the afferent phase of CHS. Moreover, topical immunosuppressive drugs inhibit the in situ activation of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|CD 23 is a low-affinity {{receptor}} for immunoglobulin E {{and expressed}} on various hemopoietic cells. Although human epidermal cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> express CD 23, {{the study to}} identify CD 23 on murine <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> has so far failed. In this study, using highly enriched (> 95 %) <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from murine epidermis obtained by the panning method, we investigated whether murine <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> express CD 23. As {{the result of a}} series of experiments using fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis and the polymerase chain reaction method, it was revealed that CD 23 is expressed on cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> but not on freshly isolated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> Comparison of the DNA sequence of polymerase chain reaction products of CD 23 from cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> with that from spleen leukocytes demonstrated that there were the same sequences between the two polymerase chain reaction products. The expression of CD 23 on cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> was downregulated when <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured with keratinocyte-derived cytokines: interleukin- 1 α, interleukin- 18, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Moreover, it was shown that murine IgE bound to cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and this binding was partially inhibited when <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured with monoclonal antibody against CD 23 (B 3 B 4). Thus this study revealed murine cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> do express CD 23 and the discrepancy from previous reports {{may be due to the}} influence of cytokines derived from keratinocytes. Furthermore, the finding that murine cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> bind IgE through CD 23 suggests that CD 23 on murine <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> may be involved in IgE-mediated immune responses...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the morphogenesis of lung remodeling in pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> (LCG; previously called histiocytosis X or eosinophilic granuloma), lung tissues obtained by open biopsy from 62 patients with pulmonary LCG were studied by light and electron microscopy. Tissues from 20 patients were also studied by immunohistochemical methods {{for the detection}} of fibronectin, elastin, and S- 100 protein, and samples from six patients were studied using OKT 6 monoclonal antibody. In early stages of pulmonary LCG, the epithelial lining cells were detached and Langerhans cells, inflammatory cells, and myofibroblasts migrated into intraluminal spaces through gaps in the epithelial basement membranes in and around the granulomatous lesions. In late stages, intraluminal fibrosis led to obstruction of alveolar spaces and airways and to coalescence of alveolar walls in and around the granulomatous lesions. Adjacent to these lesions, irregularly dilated alveoli were found with degraded and disrupted elastic fibers. Together, these observations suggest that intraluminal fibrosis and elastic fiber degradation are important processes of lung remodeling in pulmonary LCG...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{transplantation}} {{evolved from}} heart-lung transplantation [1] and is performed as a single,[2, 3] bilateral single,[4, 5] or lobar transplant procedure. [6] Lung transplantation {{is considered an}} appropriate therapy for selected individuals with end-stage lung disease that is unresponsive to medical therapy and that results in progressive clinical deterioration. A recent publication endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), the American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, and the American Society of Transplantation produced international consensus guidelines on patient selection and evaluation for these procedures. [7] According to these guidelines, lung transplantation is a therapeutic option for patients with end-stage lung disease that falls into 1 of 4 main categories: pulmonary vascular disease, restrictive pulmonary disease, obstructive airway disease, or suppurative disease. Pulmonary vascular diseases include primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypertension secondary to systemic disease, and Eisenmenger's syndrome. Restrictive pulmonary diseases include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, and chronic allergic alveolitis. Obstructive diseases include emphysema with or without alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis,</b> and lymphangioleiomyomatosis...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> (LCG), {{also called}} {{histiocytosis}} X, is a disorder of unknown etiology {{characterized by the}} presence of destructive granulomas containing numerous Langerhans cells (LCs). The process may be localized or multifocal, and it remains unclear whether the same pathogenic mechanism is involved in all forms of the disease. It is often assumed that the massive accumulation of LCs at the sites of the lesions results from the abnormal proliferation of these cells, although {{it has been suggested that}} LCG in adults, at least in the lung, could be a reactive disorder initiated by activated LCs. Little is known, however, concerning the mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of large numbers of LCs in the course of the disease, and the relative contribution of recruitment and local proliferation of these cells remains to be established. To investigate this question, the proportion of replicating LCs was evaluated in biopsied granulomas from patients with localized or diffuse form of LCG by means of several histopathological techniques currently used in assessment of cell proliferation. The findings demonstrate that, except for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), all parameters measured are low in all forms of the disease. They are similar to those of renewing epithelial cells and clearly less than those of neoplastic cells. These data strongly suggest that LCs in LCG granulomas are not a rapidly dividing cell population and that local LC replication makes only a minimal contribution to granuloma maintenance. Caution appears to be necessary in the use of PCNA as a marker of growth fraction...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} activity of skin cells derived from an infant {{who died of}} multisystem <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> histiocytosis (LCH) was examined.

The {{functional activity}} of different populations of CD 1 a positive cells was assessed using the conventional six day allogeneic mixed cell reaction. Compared with <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from a healthy control, LCH cells showed minimal functional activity. However, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from non-involved skin showed normal and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> overlying involved skin showed augmented functional activity.

40|$|After hapten application, {{epidermal}} <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migrate {{into the}} regional lymph nodes through dermal lymphatics. Recently, we {{have demonstrated that}} some of them take the phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to those of in vitro cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> before disappearing from the epidermis. To analyze the mechanisms underlying the :migration of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> we studied the expression of several adhesion molecules on freshly isolated LC and cultured LC.

This up-regulation of α 4 integrin was also observed on in vivo activated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the epidermis and draining lymph nodes after hapten application.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Langerhans dendritic cells in tobacco smoke related human lung cancer, tobacco smoke induced Langerhans cells changes during cutaneous and pulmonary carcinogenesis in mice were investigated. While dendritic cells were rare in normal lung, their density was marked in bronchioalveolar, well and moderately differentiated {{squamous cell carcinoma}}s. Small cell lung cancer and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showed the lowest density. High density of dendritic cells in lung tumours was associated with marked tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and favourable survival. Exposure of mice to tobacco smoke increased the density of zinc-iodide-osmium positive pulmonary Langerhans cells. Pulmonary <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and a proliferative alveolar and bronchial epithelial tumour-like lesions were observed. The density of pulmonary Langerhans cells returned {{to that of the}} control level after ceasing exposure to tobacco smoke and the interstitial granulomatous lesions disappeared, but the bronchial epithelial metaplasia did not reverse. The ultrastructure of the zinc-iodide-osmium positive cells was similar to that of pulmonary Langerhans cells. Tobacco smoke condensate increased the density, changed the morphology and impaired the function of epidermal Langerhans cells. This was associated with skin tumour development. While examining human lung lesions S 100 positive DC were observed migrating into tumours. So these cells and their relation to LDC were further examined in blood. Metrizamide enriched dendritic cells isolated from human blood, were S 100 positive, co-expressed CD 45 and were non-phagocytic. Their diameter was larger than that of CD 3 positive T lymphocytes and smaller than CD 14 positive monocytes. The ultrastructural features were consistent with that of blood dendritic cells. Their number slightly decreased with age, equal numbers were observed in both sexes and formed 0. 09 ± 0. 07 cells x 10 9 per litre of blood...|$|E
40|$|The murine {{epidermis}} {{contains two}} types of dendritic cells (DC), Thy- 1 + dendritic epidermal T <b>cells</b> (DETC) and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> In this review, we introduce our data obtained using a skin organ culture system to examine the migratory capacity of DETC and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> into the epidermis. DETC or <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were depleted by topical application of clobetazole propionate (CP) solution onto the murine ears. CP-treated or untreated ear skin was co-cultured with syngeneic (semisyngeneic, or allogenic, in experiments with <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells)</b> epidermal cell suspension.

We mention other molecules that may participate in the migration of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> such as chemotactic cytokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, TGF-β and skin-homing molecule, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) on <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Protozoan parasites of {{the genus}} Leishmania exist as {{obligatory}} intracellular amastigotes and invade macrophages and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> the dendritic cells of the skin. <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> are much more efficient in presenting Leishmania major antigen to T cells than macrophages are and have the unique ability to retain parasite antigen in immunogenic form for prolonged periods. To analyze the mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} this potency, we defined the synthesis, turnover, conformation, and localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> Hence, <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were pulse-labeled; immunoprecipitation of MHC class II molecules and gel electrophoresis followed. In addition, the subcellular distribution of MHC class II molecules in L. major-infected <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> was analyzed by confocal microscopy. The results show that (i) newly synthesized MHC class II molecules are required for L. major antigen presentation by <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> (ii) MHC class II-peptide complexes in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> are long-lived, (iii) phagocytosis of L. major modulates MHC class II biosynthesis by reducing its downregulation during <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation, and (iv) newly synthesized MHC class II molecules are associated with the parasitophorous vacuole of infected <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings support the conclusion that the traits of MHC class II expression correspond to the highly specialized functions of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the immunoregulation of cutaneous leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet B {{radiation}} can suppress cellular immunity. One of {{the mechanisms}} {{related to this}} immunosuppression is the disappearance of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from the epidermis. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the mechanism of ultraviolet B-induced <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> disappearance in healthy individuals. The two most likely mechanisms for <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> disappearance are apoptosis and migration. Apoptosis was assessed in vivo by exposing buttock skin of 10 healthy volunteers to six minimal erythema doses of ultraviolet B. Only very few apoptotic <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> could be observed in sections from the ultraviolet B-exposed skin. Migration of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> cannot be established in skin sections and suction blisters were therefore raised in an attempt to trap migrating <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the sub-basal membrane blister fluid. Blisters were raised on the flexor side of the lower arm of 30 healthy volunteers at several time points after exposure of the skin to six minimal erythema doses of ultraviolet B. Blister fluid was collected and blister roofs were removed to check for <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> disappearance. <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> were detected in the blister fluid of the ultraviolet B-exposed skin and not of the unexposed skin. The number of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the blister fluid peaked at about 18 h after ultraviolet exposure, which coincided with the largest depletion of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the blister roof. A fraction (20 – 30 %) of the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the blister fluid stained positive for DNA damage (cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers), showing that they originated from the epidermis.

40|$|CD 86 (B 70 /B 7 - 2) has {{recently}} been identified as an alternative CD 28 /CTLA- 4 ligand on activated B cells. CD 86 has also been demonstrated as possibly serving as a primary costimulatory molecule in the initial immune response. Since the human <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cell</b> {{is one of the}} most potent antigen-presenting cells, we examined whether CD 86 expression and function are found on organ-cultured skin, freshly isolated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in normal human epidermis. Immunohistochemical study in situ revealed that CD 86 was expressed on dendritic cells with CD 1 a antigen in organ-cultured but not fresh skin. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that no staining for either CD 80 or CD 86 was observed in freshly isolated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> but that both CD 80 and CD 86 were expressed on cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> The actual expression of CD 86 on cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> was further confirmed by the detection of 70 -kDa glycoprotein on Western blot analysis. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that both CD 80 and CD 86 were specifically amplified from purified cultured and freshly isolated <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> but not from <b>Langerhans</b> cell-depleted epidermal <b>cells,</b> indicating that both CD 80 and CD 86 genes were expressed by <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> The functional importance of CD 86 on <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> was confirmed by the allogeneic CD 4 T cell proliferative responses with enriched <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> A monoclonal antibody against CD 86 caused 81 % inhibition in contrast with 29 % inhibition produced by anti-CD 80 monoclonal antibody. This inhibitory effect was enhanced to 85. 3 % inhibition when a combination of anti-CD 86 and anti-CD 80 was administered. These results indicate that CD 86 is predominantly expressed on the surface of cultured <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and may transduce a primordial costimulatory signal in the interaction of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and T cells...|$|R

Normal human skin was irradiated ex vivo with single doses of ultraviolet B. For assessment of T-cell stimulatory function, cells that spontaneously migrated from epidermal sheets were used, whereas full-thickness skin biopsies were used to investigate alterations in migratory properties. The cells migrating from ultraviolet B-exposed epidermal sheets demonstrated {{a decrease in the}} percentage of HLA-DR positive <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> as well as a reduced capacity to induce proliferation of allogeneic T cells, when compared with cells migrating from nonexposed sheets. When a correction was made for the decreased number of HLA-DR positive <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migrating from ultraviolet B-exposed epidermis, however, it appeared that the capacity to induce T-cell proliferation was identical for <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migrating from ultraviolet B-exposed and nonexposed epidermis. The presence of ultraviolet B-induced DNA damage could be demonstrated in the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from ultraviolet B-treated skin, indicating that the cells had received significant doses of ultraviolet B. As regards the effect of ultraviolet B on migratory properties of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> we found not only that reduced numbers of CD 1 a-positive <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migrated from the ultraviolet B-exposed full-thickness skin, but also that there was a reduction in CD 1 a-positive <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the epidermis. This implies that ultraviolet B induces death of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> as well as loss of cell surface molecules rather than altering <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> migration, whereas the <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> that were still able to migrate fully retained the capacity to activate allogeneic T cell...|$|R

40|$|The trimeric high-affinity IgE {{receptor}} (FcεRI) {{on human}} epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> mediates IgE-dependent antigen uptake and subsequent antigen focusing. Its expression is upregulated on <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> (FcεRIhigh <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells)</b> and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (FcεRIhigh inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells) {{in the skin}} of patients with atopic dermatitis. In {{the absence of the}} amplifying β-chain in these cells, FcεRI signaling (indicated by calcium mobilization and activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB) is only detectable in FcεRIhigh <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from atopics, but not FcεRIlow <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from nonatopics. Therefore we investigated protein-tyrosine kinases putatively involved in FcεRI signaling in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and asked whether differences in their expression and FcεRI-induced activity could explain the dichotomic responses observed in atopic vs nonatopic individuals. First, we found the src protein-tyrosine kinases p 53 / 56 lyn, p 59 fyn, p 56 / 59 hck, p 55 c-fgr, and p 60 c-src to be expressed in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from all donors. In addition, whereas p 56 lck was lacking, p 72 syk and the negative regulatory p 50 csk were detected. Upon terminal maturation of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, no significant change of the protein- tyrosine kinase expression profile except downregulation of p 56 / 59 hck was observed. In contrast, significant upregulation of all protein-tyrosine kinase expressed except p 50 csk was detected in FcεRIhigh <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> but not in FcεRIhigh inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells. Finally, the important protein-tyrosine kinases substrate phospholipase C-γ 1, which is also essential for downstream calcium mobilization, was only phosphorylated upon FcεRI triggering in FcεRIhigh <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from atopics, but not in FcεRIlow <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from nonatopics. Therefore, upregulation of FcεRI and protein-tyrosine kinase expression as well as subsequent protein-tyrosine kinase activity may explain, at least in part, that an efficient signaling pathway in terms of calcium mobilization is restricted to FcεRIhigh <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> from atopic individuals...|$|R
40|$|Claudin- 1 (CLDN 1) is a {{structural}} tight junction (TJ) protein and {{is expressed in}} differentiating keratinocytes and <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in the epidermis. Our objective was to identify immunoreactive CLDN 1 in human epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and to examine the pattern of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> in genetic human CLDN 1 deficiency [neonatal ichthyosis, sclerosing cholangitis (NISCH) syndrome]. Epidermal cells from healthy human skin labelled with CLDN 1 -specific antibodies were analysed by confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Skin biopsy sections of two patients with NISCH syndrome were stained with an antibody to CD 1 a expressed on epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> Epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and a subpopulation of keratinocytes from healthy skin were positive for CLDN 1. The gross number and distribution of epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> of two patients with molecularly confirmed NISCH syndrome, however, was not grossly altered. Therefore, CLDN 1 is unlikely to {{play a critical role}} in migration of <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> (or their precursors) to the epidermis or their positioning within the epidermis. Our findings do not exclude a role of this TJ molecule once <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> have left the epidermis for draining lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|Toll-like receptors are key {{elements}} in pathogen recognition by the host immune system. Although the expression pattern {{and functions of}} Toll-like receptors have been studied {{in a variety of}} cytokine-induced dendritic cells, it remains unknown whether Toll-like receptor stimulation influences maturation and cytokine production of authentic <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> We purified murine epidermal <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> along with splenic dendritic cell using a panning method. <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> expressed Toll-like receptor 2, 4, and 9 but not 7, the pattern of which suggests <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> are the closest to one of the murine dendritic cell lineage, CD 11 c+ 11 b+ 8 α– 4 –. Then we stimulated Toll-like receptor 2, 4, and 9 with the corresponding ligand, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, lipopolysaccharide, and CpG, and found that all of these stimuli upregulated expression of B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2 in splenic dendritic cells but not in <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells.</b> As in human <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells,</b> stimulation of murine <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, lipopolysaccharide, and CpG overall resulted in T helper 1 -polarizing cytokine production (namely, induction of IL- 12 p 40 and inhibition of TARC (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine) /CCL 17). Exceptionally, lipopolysaccharide exhibited no effect on IL- 12 p 40 production by <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and inhibited IL- 12 p 40 production by splenic dendritic cells. These results may represent the functional heterogeneity between <b>Langerhans</b> <b>cells</b> and splenic dendritic cells, and are important for better understanding of innate immunity to bacterial infections differentially regulated in the skin and spleen.
