5|$|By law, a valid unexpired <b>Lebanese</b> {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (and {{not just}} prima facie) proof of <b>Lebanese</b> citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of <b>Lebanese</b> citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a <b>Lebanese</b> citizen for the full period allowed by law. The <b>Lebanese</b> law does not prohibit <b>Lebanese</b> citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their <b>Lebanese</b> passport to enter and leave the country. An expired <b>Lebanese</b> passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. <b>Lebanese</b> passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the <b>Lebanese</b> Government upon demand.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir did {{not play}} a major role in the <b>Lebanese</b> Civil War; he {{confined}} himself primarily to strengthening the <b>Lebanese</b> National Movement, the PLO's main ally in the conflict. During the fall of the Tel al-Zaatar camp to the <b>Lebanese</b> Front, al-Wazir blamed himself for not organizing a rescue effort.|$|E
5|$|All <b>Lebanese</b> {{citizens}} habitually {{resident in}} the Republic of Lebanon and aged 15 or above are obliged by the <b>Lebanese</b> law {{to apply for}} a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card, whilst it is optional for those under 15 or those who are residing abroad.|$|E
5|$|All the {{information}} that are stated in the <b>Lebanese</b> passport {{are included in the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card and are given in Arabic, French, and English.|$|E
5|$|However, {{more than}} one valid <b>Lebanese</b> {{passport}} of the same type may not be held, except if authorized by the <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS).|$|E
5|$|<b>Lebanese</b> {{passports}} are navy blue, {{with the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Cedar emblazoned in {{the centre of}} the front cover.|$|E
5|$|Passport Acquisition: Any time a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder applies for a passport, their Personal Identification Number (PIN) is {{captured}} on the passport and their personal information cross-checked {{with the existing}} data in the National Identification System. A <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder {{may not be able}} to acquire a passport if they do not possess a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card. This is because only people who qualify to hold <b>Lebanese</b> Passports will be issued with one since the individual’s nationality can be properly checked from the National Identification System.|$|E
5|$|People who owe 3,800,000 <b>Lebanese</b> Pounds ($2,500) or more {{in child}} support, are not {{eligible}} to receive a <b>Lebanese</b> passport. Therefore, they should make arrangements to pay the agency where child support is owed before they submit their application for a <b>Lebanese</b> passport. All questions about their child support arrears or {{the status of a}} payment should be directed to the appropriate child support enforcement agency.|$|E
5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder {{can use the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It is easier for a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> Air Force {{operated}} Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014. A <b>Lebanese</b> Hunter {{shot down}} an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki {{in the early}} 1960s; its pilot was captured by the <b>Lebanese</b> Armed Forces. One Hunter was shot down {{on the first day}} of the Six-Day War by the Israeli Air Force. They were used infrequently during the <b>Lebanese</b> Civil War, and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) started issuing {{biometric}} passports to <b>Lebanese</b> citizens {{starting from}} 1 August 2016.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) stopped issuing the old {{navy blue}} non-biometric <b>Lebanese</b> {{passports}} and started issuing biometric passports to <b>Lebanese</b> citizens starting from 1 August 2016. The old non-biometric navy blue passports are valid until their expiry dates when will be renewed {{with the new}} navy blue biometric passports.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> {{identity}} card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (bițāqat al-hawiya); French: Carte nationale d'identité) is a compulsory Identity document issued to {{citizens of the}} Republic of Lebanon by the police {{on behalf of the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Ministry of Interior or in <b>Lebanese</b> embassies/consulates (abroad) free of charge. It is proof of identity, citizenship and residence of the <b>Lebanese</b> citizens.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Lebanese</b> {{passport}} {{is invalid}} if the passport is not signed, and normally the bearer affixes his/her signature on the signature field, whose position has varied with various incarnations of <b>Lebanese</b> passports. Persons {{too young to}} sign a passport previously may have a parent or legal guardian sign the passport on their behalf, although this has since been prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Access to Social Services: The <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card authenticates a persons {{entitlement}} to government services. Services such as LEAP payments and free {{national health insurance}} schemes registration for persons below 18 years or above 70 years is made dependent on {{the presentation of the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|According to Bakhos Assaf, {{mayor of}} Hardin, Lebanon, 93 {{passengers}} originated {{from what is}} today Lebanon, with 20 of them from Hardin, {{the highest number of}} any <b>Lebanese</b> location. Of the Hardin passengers, 11 adult men died, while eight women and children and one adult man survived. Kamal Seikaly, an individual quoted in an article from the <b>Lebanese</b> publication Daily Star, stated that according to a May 16, 1912 issue of the Al-Khawater magazine stored in the American University of Beirut, of the 125 <b>Lebanese</b> aboard, 23 survived. The magazine states that 10 people from Kfar Meshki died on the Titanic.|$|E
5|$|As of November 24, 2015 all {{citizens}} that possess the burgundy red <b>Lebanese</b> passport must submit {{them to the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) or at any <b>Lebanese</b> embassy {{as well as any}} of the various diplomatic missions and consulates of the Republic of Lebanon abroad. These passports will no longer be valid since they are not machine-readable. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has decided that November 24, 2015 will be the deadline to implement the use of machine-readable passports only in travel through airports. Those who possess the red <b>Lebanese</b> passport must apply for the navy blue (machine-readable) passport as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|Education: The PIN of a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder's {{child is}} {{captured}} during enrollment into primary {{school and the}} number is used for admission into every school level until the child completes tertiary education. This helps in tracking the progress of a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder's child in the educational sector for necessary policy interventions. Students who qualify for student’s loan are {{able to use the}} <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card to establish their identities to eliminate fraud. Data from the NIA database enables the Ministry of Education to plan effectively for the provision of targeted educational infrastructure and other resources for their community.|$|E
5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist <b>Lebanese</b> party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a <b>Lebanese</b> parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian <b>Lebanese</b> figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the <b>Lebanese</b> Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah is, therefore, deeply {{embedded}} in the <b>Lebanese</b> society.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Jeita {{became a}} {{national}} symbol when <b>Lebanese</b> authorities issued a stamp featuring the lower cavern to promote national tourism. Mr. Maroun Hajj, the oarsman shown on the stamp, still leads boat tours forty years after the stamp was issued. The Jeita Grotto is also featured on the 1964 one Lira (<b>Lebanese</b> pound) verso.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a <b>Lebanese</b> company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the move for biometric passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender. Jacques Seif, General Manager of Inkript, said: “We will handle all the programming and software development in-house, while Gemalto will be in charge of manufacturing the passports and matching the program’s interface with the coding machines.”. The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million <b>Lebanese</b> biometric passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant. The <b>Lebanese</b> Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) announced that it would be issuing biometric passports to all of its citizens starting from July 2016.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, a pro-Palestinian <b>Lebanese</b> MP, Maarouf Saad, {{was shot}} and killed, {{reportedly}} by the <b>Lebanese</b> Army. His death, from his wounds, the following month, and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and <b>Lebanese</b> travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces, precipitated the <b>Lebanese</b> Civil War. Arafat was reluctant to respond with force, but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise. For example, the DFLP carried out several attacks against the <b>Lebanese</b> Army. In 1976, an alliance of Christian militias {{with the backing of}} the <b>Lebanese</b> and Syrian armies besieged Tel al-Zaatar camp in east Beirut. The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour, a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more. The Tel al-Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six-month siege in which thousands of Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed. Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a <b>Lebanese</b> man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The <b>Lebanese</b> man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the <b>Lebanese</b> man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the government of}} the People's Republic of China's (PRC) modification to the requirements for the issuance of Chinese visas to <b>Lebanese</b> citizens born in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan the PRC will not issue visas to <b>Lebanese</b> passport holders whose place of birth is inscribed as being Hong Kong HKG, Macau MAC or (city name) TWN. Accordingly, passports issued to <b>Lebanese</b> born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan now only list the place of birth, without an accompanying three-letter country code, unless upon request.|$|E
5|$|Pension Claims: As {{identity}} theft occurs when someone uses a persons personal information, such as Social Security number without their permission to commit fraud by claiming their benefits {{or that of}} a relation. The <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card identifies a <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder as the rightful and only person authorized to receive their pension benefits. In the event of the <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card holder's death, only their children or spouse will benefit from their pension claim.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{over the}} age of 15, and who do not have a valid ID, can pay a fine from 300,000 up to 500,000 <b>Lebanese</b> Pounds. Failure to show a valid ID to a police officer in a public place can result in a fine of 20,000 <b>Lebanese</b> Pounds.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the <b>Lebanese</b> Civil War of 1975–90, {{the party}} was closely allied to the Phalangist Party of Pierre Gemayel and {{generally}} ran joint tickets with the Phalangists, especially in Beirut constituencies with large Armenian populations. The refusal of the ARF, along with most Armenian groups, to {{play an active role}} in the civil war, however, soured relations between the two parties, and the <b>Lebanese</b> Forces (a militia dominated by Phalangists and commanded by Bachir Gemayel, Pierre Gemayel's son), responded by attacking the Armenian quarters of many <b>Lebanese</b> towns, including Bourj Hammoud. Many Armenians affiliated with the ARF took up arms voluntarily to defend their quarters. In the midst of the <b>Lebanese</b> civil war, the shadowy guerrilla organization Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide emerged and carried out assassinations from 1975 to 1983. The guerrilla organization has sometimes been linked to the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|Since April 1976, {{the policy}} has been that <b>Lebanese</b> {{citizens}} born in Jerusalem have their birthplace identified only by the city's name, with no national designation, due to the unresolved legal status of Jerusalem. <b>Lebanese</b> citizens born prior to 1948 may have their birthplace identified as Palestine if they were born in what was the British Mandate of Palestine (including Jerusalem).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> Identity card {{is issued}} {{free of charge}} for all the <b>Lebanese</b> {{citizens}} however a monetary tax is paid for the issuing of the identity card; the price depends on the selected type of issuing which is basically the time needed for the card to be issued (the prices are listed in District Police Stations). The standard time for issuing a <b>Lebanese</b> identity card is 5 working days. The Ministry of Interior has provided an e-service and a smart app {{that allows you to}} check whether your ID card is ready.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lebanese</b> {{identity}} card {{may be used}} to verify identity and nationality having the same effect as a valid <b>Lebanese</b> passport, and may also be used as a travel document within Syria and Jordan in lieu of a <b>Lebanese</b> passport. In domestic non-electronic identification the driving licence has remained in a leading position. A driving licence is valid for almost every situation where non-electronic personal identification is needed even though they are not officially recognized as such.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} over 100 <b>Lebanese</b> diplomatic missions overseas.|$|E
5|$|Travelling: The <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card {{is used to}} {{validate}} a persons identity at airports, borders, police check posts and while booking tickets. However, the <b>Lebanese</b> Identity Card can only be used in neighboring countries Syria and Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of <b>Lebanese</b> territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be <b>Lebanese</b> territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three <b>Lebanese</b> prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 the <b>Lebanese</b> {{government}} {{started a}} massive campaign to recover antiquities that were stolen or traded {{during the civil}} war. Many artifacts were recovered from warehouses or private homes since <b>Lebanese</b> law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was moved and a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Lebanon-born singer Mika, {{stated that}} he was {{interested}} in entering the contest for Lebanon in 2008, but for one of the other <b>Lebanese</b> television stations not serving a ban, such as the <b>Lebanese</b> Broadcasting Corporation International or Future Television, either of which could have joined the EBU. His participation never came to be and the country has not made another attempt to join the contest following the conclusion of its broadcaster's ban.|$|E
