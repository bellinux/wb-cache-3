5|$|Ownership of the Brierfield {{plantation}} was {{embroiled in}} court cases, with {{the politics of}} the state judges playing a key role. Only after the Democrats took control of the state supreme court in 1881 did Davis, {{for the first time in}} his life, gain <b>legal</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on the claimant having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> has been transferred to the defendant, or the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on the claimant having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six blocks for $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E

5|$|In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an {{alliance}} of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and {{the custody of the}} king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion. Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the castle was finally confirmed the following year. Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government. Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year. A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign and, when that failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king. Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1326. As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less than ideal location to imprison Edward. The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed to be trying to rescue him. Henry's loyalty was also coming under question. In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.|$|E

40|$|Can a {{real estate}} market operate without <b>legal</b> <b>titles?</b> Th e answer has {{conventionally}} been no. But in Shenzhen, the iconic city of China's market economy, an opposite phenomenon exists: half of the buildings within the city, which has 1, 993 square kilometers of land and over 10 million people, have no <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> and have been rented or sold {{to millions of people}} illegally. Th ese illegal buildings are called small properties, because their property rights are "smaller" (weaker) than legal properties. Based on my one-year fieldwork, this paper is a first step toward explaining the small-property market. It reveals that legitimate organizations and professionals have developed a network to facilitate impersonal transactions of illegal small properties. Set against the backdrop and context of China's transition, this paper presents a feasible plan for building a market economy in transitional countries, where property laws are oft en less than ideal. © 2014 Canadian Journal of Law and Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Co-ownership: Ownership of {{property}} {{by more than}} one person is facilitated by a trust. In particular, ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one, or both, owning the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> as trustee.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{occupation}} — requires physical {{occupation of}} the property, {{in the sense that}} some use is made of it or control exercised over it. It is treated as a matter of fact, so the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> may not always be relevant.|$|E

50|$|For many years, the Wichí {{have been}} {{struggling}} to get <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> to the land they traditionally own, constantly seized and fenced by non-indigenous cattlers and farmers. Their main claims are centered in two large public land areas in eastern Salta, known as Lote 55 (about 2,800 km²) and Lote 14. The Wichí rights to that land have been recognised by law, but no practical enforcement actions have been taken by the Salta provincial government.|$|R

25|$|The {{arbitrator}} {{chosen by}} both nations was U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who on November 12, 1878, recognized the just and <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> of Paraguay to the territory between the Pilcomayo River and the Verde River. On May 14, 1879, the Argentine armed forces left the Chaco Boreal region. The Presidente Hayes Department, the largest {{department in the}} nation, was {{named in honor of}} President Hayes.|$|E
25|$|Díaz {{created an}} {{effective}} centralized government that helped concentrate wealth {{and political power}} among the elite upper class, mostly criollo. The economy was characterized by the construction of factories, roads, dams, and better farms. The Díaz administration passed new land laws that virtually unraveled all the rights previously recognized and the land reforms passed by President Benito Juárez. No peasant or farmer could claim the land he occupied without formal <b>legal</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prices paid {{to water}} vendors. In some slums the {{majority}} of residents does not have legal access to water, and most people get water from tankers or water points. Because residents lack <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> over the land that they occupy, {{they are unable to}} connect legally to the water and sanitation network. Water provided by tankers costs two to three Egyptian pounds for 25 litres, approximately 300 times more than the tariff for piped water.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of beliefs in a squatter settlement in the outskirts of Buenos Aires exploiting a natural experiment that induced an allocation of property rights that is exogenous to {{the characteristics of the}} squatters. There are significant differences in the beliefs that squatters with and without land titles declare to hold. Lucky squatters who end up with <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> report beliefs closer to those that favor the workings of a free market. Examples include materialist and individualist beliefs (such as the belief that money is important for happiness or the belief that one can be successful without the support of a large group). The effects appear large. The value of a (generated) index of "market" beliefs is 20 percent higher for titled squatters than for untitled squatters, in spite of leading otherwise similar lives. Moreover, the effect is sufficiently large so as to make the beliefs of the squatters with <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> broadly comparable to those of the general Buenos Aires population, in spite of the large differences in the lives they lead.

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers {{developed}} a primitive form of trust called ‘the use’ that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> of the land {{for the use of}} another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.|$|E
25|$|Exclusive {{occupation}} – Also {{a matter}} of fact, although <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> will often play a part. The courts have laid down that where there are competing occupations, the facts must be considered to establish where paramount control lies. For example, in Westminster City Council v Southern Railway Co & Others , the court had to consider the level of control exercised by operators of various stalls and shops on a railway station, {{compared to that of}} the railway company.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{circumstance}} where a fiduciary duty will arise is between a trustee, whether real or juristic, and a beneficiary. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal—i.e., common law—owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the trust; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress {{their own interests}} and administer the property only {{for the benefit of}} the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the use of property without being its technical owner.|$|E

5000|$|For Engels, the {{obligation}} of the husband in the traditional two-parent familial structure is {{to earn a living}} and support his family. This gives him a position of supremacy. This role is given without a particular need for special <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> or privileges. Within the family, he represents the bourgeois, and the wife represents the proletariat. Engels, on the other hand, equates the position of the wife in marriage with one of exploitation and prostitution, as she sells her body [...] "once and for all into slavery".|$|R
25|$|The Lacandon in Chiapas is {{also home}} to a number of {{important}} Mayan archeological sites including Palenque, Yaxchilan and Bonampak, with numerous smaller sites which remain partially or fully unexcavated. This rainforest, especially the area inside the Biosphere Reserve, is a source of political tension, pitting the EZLN or Zapatistas and their indigenous allies who want to farm the land against international environmental groups and the Lacandon Maya, the original indigenous group of the area and the one who has <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to most of the lands in Montes Azules.|$|E
25|$|The {{corporate}} LCMS is formally constituted of {{two types}} of members: autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles, and clergymen who qualify by similar means. Congregations hold <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to their church buildings and other property, and call (hire) and dismiss their own clergy. Much of the practical work of the LCMS structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together; it also allows the congregations {{to work together on}} projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish, such as foreign mission work.|$|E
25|$|Vacationing Uruguayans of {{more modest}} means were {{concentrated}} in smaller resorts such as Piriápolis and Atlántida, which {{are closer to}} Montevideo. Beyond Punta del Este in the still mostly undeveloped department of Rocha, a number of communities had sprouted along the unspoiled Atlantic coast with its kilometres of sandy beaches and huge breakers. These small vacation communities—such as Aguas Dulces and Cabo Polonio, both in Rocha Department—were entirely unplanned and lacked essential services. In many cases, simple holiday chalets had been built on public property adjoining the seashore without any <b>legal</b> <b>title</b> to the land. In 1990 the authorities in Rocha Department announced plans to regulate and improve this development in hopes of encouraging visits by higher-spending tourists.|$|E
25|$|Hitherto {{very little}} was {{known of the}} {{contents}} of this vast treasury; now its great wealth came to be widely appreciated - Briefs, Bulls, petitions, department records, reports of nuncios and other reports, diaries, documentary collections, privileges, <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> of the most miscellaneous kind, etc. Progress was at first rather slow, for no systematic use of the archives could be planned until the workers had familiarized themselves with the material at hand. The hasty treatment that, in the beginning, the thirteenth century material received, revealed how much there was to learn before the archives could be used to the best advantage.|$|R
2500|$|Since most land-owning {{families}} in Ireland {{had taken their}} estates by force in the previous four hundred years, very few of them, {{with the exception of}} the New English planters, had proper <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> for them. [...] As a result, in order to obtain such titles, they were required to forfeit a quarter of their lands. [...] This policy was used against the Kavanaghs in Wexford and subsequently elsewhere, to break up Catholic Irish estates (especially the Gaelic ones) around the country. Following the precedent set in Wexford, small plantations were established in Laois and Offaly, Longford, Leitrim and north Tipperary.|$|R
50|$|Feudal lordships of {{the manor}} exist today in English {{property}} law, being <b>legal</b> <b>titles</b> historically {{dating back to}} the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Being incorporated into property law (whether physical or non-physical) they can be bought and sold, as historic artifacts. The title itself as stated below can be separated from the physical property just as any other right can. Rights like the lordship, mineral and sporting can all be separate from the physical property. The title since 1922 cannot be sub-divided. Land, sporting rights, and mineral rights can be separated. Property lawyers usually handle such transactions.|$|R
