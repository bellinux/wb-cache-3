5|$|Tactically, SAWs {{are either}} carried with a {{maneuvering}} unit and fired while handheld, or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units. The usual load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1,000 rounds in five 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally get <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> 100-round soft pouches.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS {{cleared the}} Gypsy camp. A witness {{in another part}} of the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> trucks. The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E

5|$|The Dnepr rocket {{assigned}} to launch CryoSat-2 {{arrived at the}} Baikonur Cosmodrome by train on 29 December 2009. On 12 January 2010, the first two stages of the rocket were <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the launch canister, and the canister was prepared for transportation to the launch site. On 14 January, it was rolled out to Site 109/95, where it was installed into its silo. The next day saw the third stage transported to the silo, and installed atop the rocket.|$|E
5|$|The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, {{with the}} company {{originally}} operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse. The ice cream was packed in metal-lined wooden containers that the Hershey brothers designed and built. The containers were <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> trucks with ice packed around them to keep the ice cream fresh and cold. Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Although DuMont's {{programming}} pre-dated videotape, many DuMont offerings {{were recorded}} on kinescopes. These kinescopes {{were said to}} be stored in a warehouse until the 1970s. Actress Edie Adams, the wife of comedian Ernie Kovacs (both regular performers on early television) testified in 1996 before a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of television and video. Adams claimed that so little value was given to these films that the stored kinescopes were <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay. Nevertheless, a number of DuMont programs survive at The Paley Center for Media in New York City, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, in the Peabody Awards Collection at the University of Georgia, and the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E
5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.17minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> one. There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.|$|E

Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible. Like the first game, a music CD can be inserted and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played is <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.|$|E
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|The fitting {{shop was}} {{designed}} to manufacture 40 locomotives {{a year and a}} total of 300 were produced in the next eight years. The first locomotive, given its trial in May 1854, was named Lady Elgin, after the wife of the Governor General of Canada of the time, the Earl of Elgin. For the bridge hundreds of thousands of components were required and all were manufactured in Birkenhead or in other English factories to Brassey's specifications. These were all stamped and coded, <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail {{to the site of the}} bridge for assembly. The central tube of the bridge contained over 10,000 pieces of iron, perforated by holes for half a million rivets, and when it was assembled every piece and hole was true.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull {{close to the}} shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders {{made it clear that}} the Spanish would be killed if they did not withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in the stores to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave the stores. When the demonstrators refused to leave, they were arrested and <b>loaded</b> <b>into</b> police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E
