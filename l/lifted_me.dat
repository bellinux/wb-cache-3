In an interview entitled [...] "My Life in a Bush League", he criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later commented {{that he could}} see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image. However, contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain. Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court [...] "comical", and when 6ft 11in 250-pound (in his early years) Hall-of-Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: [...] "When Wilt Chamberlain <b>lifted</b> <b>me</b> up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position." ...|$|E
500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) <b>lifted</b> <b>me,</b> as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans are disappointed {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to give them something to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
