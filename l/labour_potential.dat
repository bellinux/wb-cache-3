40|$|The {{vocational}} qualification in Germany {{is crucial for}} a successful participation in the labour market. Persons without a vocational certification carry a clearly higher risk to become jobless and they have problems to gain a sustained foothold in the labour market. In contrast, at {{the upper end of}} the qualification scale we recognize a bottleneck in labour supply in some economic areas. During the last economic boom some enterprises complained about difficulties to find sufficiently qualified staff. The relations between {{vocational qualification}} and labour market are extensive and comprehensive. Hence there are many studies and research projects which deal mostly with detailed aspects of these connections. This is not the main focus of the following report. It rather aims for a more general perspective on the topic of vocational qualification. In addition it provides an overall stock-taking of the vocational education of the <b>labour</b> force <b>potential</b> in Germany. Qualification patterns are explored for all components of <b>labour</b> force <b>potential,</b> which comprises employed persons, registered unemployed persons and the hidden labour force. The structures of qualification are depicted and compared for each component of the <b>labour</b> force <b>potential.</b> It distinguishes between Western and Eastern Germany as well as between gender and different age groups. Besides, the employed persons are differentiated by their occupational status and their working time. The comparative analysis indicates clearly the narrow connection between labour market participation and vocational qualification. Nevertheless, this is not the main subject of the report. The following presentation rather gives an overview from a macroeconomic perspective and offers a quantitative basis for the discussion of working hours-politics and education politics.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the sociological {{assessment}} of the skills level and identification of its influence on some aspects of labour activity: the realization of <b>labour</b> <b>potential,</b> choice {{of the scope of}} activity, position and occupation. It suggests an approach based on the subjective evaluation of the population as an instrument of the skills level assessment. The received results are compared with the indirect estimates allowing to characterize some particular components of <b>labour</b> <b>potential</b> which are similar to the considered skills. A specific feature of the research is not only the determination of the professional sphere, occupation and position on the skills level, but also the accounting of the reverse effect. The methodological tools including the methods for the assessment of skills level, <b>labour</b> <b>potential</b> and extent of its implementation in a labour activity have been approved in the Vologda region. The study revealed that, at the present time, the most developed skills are the teamwork, communication and mutual understanding while the least developed ones are the initiative and creativity as well as ability to be retrained and readiness to increase the professional level. It shows that the employees of socially oriented spheres and also the representatives of state structures have more developed skills. At the same time, the development of innovative skills not only leads to the growth of <b>labour</b> <b>potential,</b> but also creates conditions for the employment in workplaces with higher skills requirements. The paper shows that higher skills level along with higher skills requirements leads to more complete implementation of cumulative potential in the labour activity.
