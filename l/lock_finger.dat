50|$|Implicit {{authentication}} (IA) is {{a technique}} that allows the smart device to recognize its owner by being acquainted with his/her behaviors. It {{is a technique}} that uses machine learning algorithms to learn user behavior through various sensors on the smart devices and achieve user identification. Most of the current authentication techniques, e.g., password, pattern <b>lock,</b> <b>finger</b> print and iris recognition, are explicit authentication which require user input. Comparing with explicit authentication, IA is transparent to users during the usage, and it significantly increases the usability by reducing time users spending on login, in which users find it more annoying than lack of cellular coverage.|$|E

50|$|Small joint manipulation, in grappling, {{refers to}} twisting, pulling or bending fingers or toes to cause joint locks {{in the various}} joints in those appendages. Joint <b>locks</b> on <b>fingers</b> and toes are {{respectively}} referred to as <b>finger</b> <b>locks</b> and toe locks.|$|R
25|$|Over 6,000 {{years ago}} the {{earliest}} form of a mixed martial art was invented in ancient China by Han Chinese military generals and soldiers called Shuai jiao. It is an ancient style of Wrestling and Kung-Fu that incorporated grappling techniques that are the earliest ancient precursors of modern jujitsu and judo combined with kicking, punching, throwing, joint <b>locks,</b> <b>finger</b> <b>locks,</b> leg sweeps, leg locks and close range trapping techniques used by elite ancient Han Chinese military forces to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield.|$|R

40|$|Two {{cases of}} <b>locked</b> index <b>finger</b> causing an {{intra-articular}} fracture of the metacarpal head due to forced passive extension are described. We suggest that any manipulation should be gentle {{and if this}} is unsuccessful, surgical exploration is necessary. The locked metacarpo-phalangeal joint of a finger, which is sometimes confused with a trigger finger, is characterised by loss of extension of the M. P. joint with no loss of flexion. It is usually sudden in onset. In 1949 Langenskidld reported the first two cases of <b>locked</b> index <b>finger.</b> Since then, 60 cases {{have been reported in the}} English literature and 145 cases in the Japanese literature: most were treated by operation but some authors recommended manipulation. We describe two cases in which forced passive extension to attempt to correct a <b>locked</b> index <b>finger</b> caused an intra-articular fracture of the metacarpa...|$|R

50|$|The kappa {{from the}} above story {{is said to have}} sat on this stone. Kawatarō would take the shape of a human child and sit upon the stone, {{inviting}} passersby to a game of kagihiki ('key (or hook) pulling'). In the game, the players makes their fingers into the shape of a hook (the Japanese words for 'key' and 'hook' are pronounced the same way), join them up with the other player and pull each other. Those unfortunate enough to play the game with Kawatarō would be dragged into the water by force once they <b>locked</b> <b>fingers</b> with him.|$|R

60|$|The hour grew later, {{and that}} dreamy period came round when ladies' fancies, that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day, begin to assert {{themselves}} anew. At {{this time a}} good guess at Ethelberta's thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes away. Instead of reading, entering notes in her diary, or doing any ordinary thing, she walked to and fro, curled her pretty nether lip within her pretty upper one a great many times, made a cradle of her <b>locked</b> <b>fingers,</b> and paused with fixed eyes where {{the walls of the}} room set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but a picture within her mind.|$|R

50|$|To execute, one brings their palms {{together}} (slightly off-centre), <b>locks</b> the <b>fingers</b> downward, then swings at {{an opponent}} {{as if they}} were holding a club-weapon (like a bat). When performed properly, the strong muscle {{on the side of the}} hands can cause a great deal of damage especially against bony protrusions on the face. When grappling, the hammerblow can be performed directly upwards (like an uppercut) and will likely shatter the chin.|$|R

60|$|It chanced that Elvira {{was so much}} tired by all {{the little}} excitements of the night, that for once she laid aside her company manners, which were both easy and correct, and in the most natural manner in the world leaned her head on Leon's shoulder.

I had the sense to get my hands round his neck at once, and it's about all I could do to <b>lock</b> my <b>fingers</b> tight under his jaw. You saw the beauty's neck, didn't you? Hard as iron, too.

50|$|Locking forceps, {{sometimes}} called clamps, {{are used to}} grasp and hold objects or tissue. When {{they are used to}} compress an artery to forestall bleeding they are called hemostats. Another form of locking forceps is the needle holder, used to guide a suturing needle through tissue. Many <b>locking</b> forceps use <b>finger</b> loops to facilitate handling (see illustration, below, of Kelly Forceps). The finger loops are usually grasped by the thumb and middle or ring fingers, while the index finger helps guide the instrument.|$|R

One surface of the rack includes teeth along its entire surface which mesh with teeth of one of the fingers. The teeth at the remote end of the rack engage teeth of a gear wheel. The wheel includes a worm which meshes with a worn drive shaft of the drive motor providing a ninety degree self-locking drive for <b>locking</b> the <b>fingers</b> in a desired position. A similar drive provides a self-locking drive for positioning the telescoping arm...|$|R

He had spoken from a sense that the truth was due to the generous girl, but each word had been intense pain. He wrote on, often interrupted by little riots among the children, and finally by a sharp contention, the twins having possessed themselves of a paper-knife, which Kitty, with precocious notions of discipline, considered as forbidden; and little Mercy was rapped over the fingers in the struggle. The roar brought down interference, and Kitty fell into disgrace; but when, after long persuasion, she was induced to yield the paper-cutter, kiss and make friends, Mercy, instead of embracing, <b>locked</b> her <b>fingers</b> into her dark curls, and tugged at them in a way so opposite to her name, that all Kitty's offence was forgotten in her merit for stopping her scream half-way {{at the sight of her}} father's uplifted finger, and his whisper of 'Poor mamma!' ...|$|R

From the day that I was brought to the hotel, when you came to see me, I could see that you looked upon me as a foolish, petted boy. When I tried to catch your eye, you looked at the doctor, and took your speech from him. And yet I thought I had never seen a woman so great and perfect as you were, and whose sympathy I longed so much to have. You may not believe me, but I thought you were a queen, for you were the first lady I had ever seen, and you were so {{different}} from the other girls I knew, or the women who had been kind to me.

That ever was the burden of its tidings--youth in the shady woods, waders through the wet meadows, boy and girl at the hedgerow stile, bathers in the booming surf, sweet, idle hours on grassy, windy hills, long strolls down moonlit lanes--everywhere in far-off lands, <b>fingers</b> <b>locked</b> and bursting hearts and longing lips--from all the world tidings of unquenchable love.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Trigger finger is {{a common}} finger aliment, thought {{to be caused by}} {{inflammation}} and subsequent nar-rowing of the A 1 pulley, which causes pain, clicking, catching, and loss of motion of the affected finger. Although it can occur in anyone, it is seen more frequently in the diabetic population and in women, typically in the fifth to sixth decade of life. The diagnosis is usually fairly straightforward, as most patients complain of clicking or <b>locking</b> of the <b>finger,</b> but other pathological processes such as fracture, tumor, or other trau-matic soft tissue injuries must be excluded. Treatment modalities, including splinting, corticosteroid injection, or surgical release, are very effective and are tailored to the severity and duration of symptoms...|$|R
5000|$|IBM PC AT and PS/2 keyboard: F1 to F12 {{usually in}} three 4-key groups {{across the top}} of the keyboard.

Some IBM compatible keyboards, e.g., the Northgate OmniKey™/102, also featured function keys on the left, which on examples with swapped left Alt and Caps <b>Lock</b> keys, facilitate <b>fingers</b> of a single hand simultaneously striking modifier key(s) and function keys swiftly and comfortably by touch even by those with small hands.

With a roar of pain Numa wheeled again, the personification of bestial rage.

5000|$|Most {{people have}} hypermobility {{with no other}} symptoms. Approximately 5% of the healthy {{population}} have one or more hypermobile joints. However, people with [...] "joint hypermobility syndrome" [...] are subject to many difficulties. For example, their joints may be easily injured, be more prone to complete dislocation due to the weakly stabilized joint and they may develop problems from muscle fatigue (as muscles must work harder to compensate for weakness in the ligaments that support the joints). Hypermobility syndrome can lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases. Musical instrumentalists with hypermobile fingers may have difficulties when fingers collapse into the <b>finger</b> <b>locking</b> position. Or, conversely, they may display superior abilities due to their increased range of motion for fingering, such as in playing a violin or cello.|$|R
