50|$|In Italy, clams {{are often}} an {{ingredient}} of mixed seafood dishes or are eaten together with pasta. The {{more commonly used}} varieties of clams in Italian cooking are the Vongola (Venerupis decussata), the Cozza (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the Tellina (Donax trunculus). Though Dattero di mare (<b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga)</b> was once eaten, overfishing drove it to the verge of extinction (it takes 15 to 35 years to reach adult size and could only be harvested by smashing the calcarean rocks that form its habitat) and the Italian government has declared it an endangered species since 1998 and its harvest and sale are forbidden.|$|R

40|$|Colonization {{patterns}} of the date mussel <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga</b> (L., 1758) on limestone breakwater boulders of a marina Background and Purpose: The European date mussel (<b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga)</b> is widespread along the whole Mediterranean rocky coastline where it is frequently but illegally harvested. It {{is well known that}} the growth of the date mussel is very slow; however, {{patterns of}} recolonization of ex-ploited surfaces have been scarcely investigated. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess colonization {{patterns of the}} date mussel on limestone boulders which have been in the sea for 19 years. These results could be useful in predicting the reconstitution of natural populations of the date mussel after harvesting. Materials and Methods: Limestone breakwater boulders were placed along the dike of the Marina of Rovinj (northern Adriatic, Istrian penin-sula, Croatia) in 1984. Sampling was carried out in summer 2003 by SCUBA diving from six habitats of different inclination and topography: horizontal, inclined, vertical, sheltered, vaults, and whole stones. The abundance and biomass of L. <b>lithophaga</b> at the Marina were compared with those in natural control locations. Results: At the Marina, no date mussels were found on the horizontal and inclined sides of the boulders, and very few date mussels were found on the vertical side. On the contrary, sheltered and vault sides of boulders and whole stones were intensively colonized by L. <b>lithophaga.</b> In vaults, the abundance was similar to that in nature. In these habitats, L. <b>lithophaga</b> biomass was generally lower than in nature. However, large date mussels, of lengths from 50 to 70 mm, were already present on boulders of the Marina. They amounted to 35 % in the sheltered habitat, 24 % in vaults, and 3 % of the total number in whole stones. Conclusions: An unexpected high colonization rate and growth of date mussels was detected in certain unexposed rocky habitats at the boulders of the Marina. However, on the natural rocky Istrian coast, the date mussel was mostly collected on exposed inclined and vertical rocky surfaces where repopulation after harvesting may require very long periods...|$|R

40|$|Settlement characteristics, like timing, depth, {{microhabitat}} {{and density}} of European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas are described {{for the very}} first time. Regular SCUBA-diving surveys were conducted from July 1998 to January 2000 on rocky bottoms of three different geologic origins to assess substratum-dependent differences in recruitment density. Settlement of pueruli took place in June-July, a few weeks after sea surface temperature started to rise. The highest density of juveniles was found at 10 - 15 m depth. Most spiny lobsters settled in limestone rocks, into empty holes of the date mussel <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga,</b> which provided daytime refuge. As they grew, individuals were increasingly found in larger holes and crevices of the rock surface. Sizes were estimated from photographs taken at night when the animals were actively foraging.

40|$|Recognising {{the need}} for data {{gathering}} at taxon level besides the taxa of commercial interest and those listed as endangered in the Protocol of the Barcelona Convention, but still exploited by Man, the present study attempts to gather and review the available scientific information on molluscs of minor commercial importance in order {{to assist in the}} adequate management and protection of their populations. Forty one species (18 gastropods, 13 bivalves, and 10 cephalopods) of minor commercial interest are treated in the present work with details on their biogeographic distribution, exploitation and conservation status in Hellas. Apart from a few species (e. g., Pinna nobilis, <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga,</b> Donacilla cornea), and these only at a local scale, there is no population assessment in Hellenic seas. The existing legislation for eleven of these species is not enforced in practice, and seems insufficient to guarantee their conservation. It is suggested that targeted collection data, networked nationally and internationally, should be promoted so this invaluable source of biodiversity information can be accessed for conservation and planning purposes...|$|R
40|$|Poor chronological control hampers {{efforts to}} {{constrain}} uplift event frequency in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin and develop regional tectonic models. Borings {{of the colonial}} marine mollusc <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga</b> are commonly associated with uplifted Mediterranean shorelines and the suitability of its fossil shell for uranium-series dating is investigated to assess its potential for refining uplift chronologies. Living specimens contain very little uranium but Holocene fossils suggest rapid post-mortem uptake from a marine source. However, in common with many other mollusc species, Pleistocene samples show clear evidence of subsequent exchange with uranium from groundwater and although two out of eight samples returned ages compatible with their stratigraphic locations, these may be chance results given the compelling evidence for general open system behaviour. Detrital contamination appears {{not to be a}} significant problem in pre-Holocene samples. Open system modelling, using techniques developed to correct for alpha recoil effects in reef corals, shows that the recoil mechanism is inadequate to explain the magnitude of the isotopic alterations observed. Our results show that whilst uranium-series dating of Holocene L. <b>lithophaga</b> shells may be possible, Pleistocene specimens suffer from significant geochemical alteration and cannot be used to refine crustal uplift chronologies over longer timescales...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga</b> is an endolithic mussel {{from the}} family Mitilidae, which inhabits {{limestone}} rocks. This species needs specific substrate for its growth and owing to its particular biology (slow growing) it is not suitable for commercial breeding. L. <b>lithophaga</b> has a very distinctive and well known date-like appearance. L. <b>lithophaga</b> is distributed throughout the Mediterranean Sea. In the Atlantic Ocean {{it can be found}} on the Portugal coast and on the North African coast down to Senegal. It also inhabits the northern coast of Angola. The sole purpose of L. <b>lithophaga</b> exploitation is human consumption. It is known that the harvesting of the species from the wild for international trade has detrimental impact on the species. The collection of L. <b>lithophaga</b> for the purpose of trade poses a direct threat to this species due to the loss of its habitat. When L. <b>lithophaga</b> is harvested, the rocks it inhabits are broken into small pieces, often by very destructive methods such as pneumatic hammers and explosives. Broken rocks thus become unsuitable for colonisation by marine organisms. In addition to the direct threat to L. <b>lithophaga,</b> its collection reduces topographic heterogenity, macroalgal cover and epibiota. The destruction cause...|$|R

40|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, infralittoral and circalittoral rocky bottoms (from 15 to 120 m) are {{characterized}} by a biogenic habitat, named "coralligenous", formed by the concretion of calcareous organisms, mainly algal thalli, and- to a lesser extent- by animal skeletons. This complex habitat is inhabited by a rich fauna that belongs to different taxonomic groups. Sponges, bryozoans, cnidarians and ascidians {{are the most common}} sessile organisms that inhabit the area while crustacean and molluscs are the common mobile organisms. Little information on the diversity of the molluscs that thrive in the coralligenous habitat is known while this information is highly important for biodiversity management purposes. After thoroughly studying the available and accessible published literature, a database for the molluscs of the coralligenous habitat has been designed and implemented for the collection and management of this information. From its index compilation more than 511 species of molluscs have been recorded so far from the coralligenous formations, the majority of which belongs to the class Gastropoda (357 sp.) followed by the Bivalvia (137 sp.), Polyplacophora (14 sp.), Cephalopoda (2 sp.) and Scaphopoda (1 sp.). Among these, the gastropod Luria lurida (Linnaeus, 1758) and Charonia lampas (Linnaeus, 1758), the endemic bivalve Pinna nobilis Linnaeus, 1758 and the endolithic bivalve <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga</b> (Linnaeus, 1758), are protected by international conventions...|$|R

Relationships between shell length and shell width, shell height as well as volume-related variables (shell dry weight, soft tissues dry weight and total wet weight) showed negative allometries in both sexes except for shell width in males (isometry) and shell height in both sexes (positive allometry). The sex ratio was unbalanced, within the length range of 6 - 48 mm, 49. 43 % of the animals were males, 24. 39 % females and 26. 17 % sexually undifferentiated; within the length range of 49 - 92 mm, the respective values were 41. 19, 52. 7 and 6. 1 %.

However, enforcement of existing legislation in Greece is ineffective and many populations of “protected” species continue to decline, mainly due to poaching. The extent of illegal trading of protected bivalves and gastropods in Greek seafood restaurants was investigated by interviewing owners or managers of 219 such restaurants in 92 localities. Interviews were based on questionnaires regarding the frequency of availability in the menus and the origin of twenty-one species or groups of species, among which eight are protected - illegally exploited. Forty-two percent of the surveyed restaurants were found to serve {{at least one of the}} protected ¬- illegally exploited species. Among the illegally traded species, <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga,</b> Pecten jacobaeus, and Pinnanobilis were served in a relatively high proportion of the surveyed restaurants (22. 8 %, 19. 2 %, and 16. 4 % respectively), outrunning many commercial species.

40|$|In AD 365 a great (Mw> 8) {{earthquake}} {{lifted up}} western Crete, exposing a shoreline encrusted by marine organisms, {{and up to}} 10 m of marine substrate beneath it. Radiocarbon ages determined for corals and bryozoans exposed between the paleo-shoreline and present sea level are consistent, within measurement error, {{with each other and}} with the date of the earthquake. But radiocarbon ages determined for the boring bivalve <b>Lithophaga</b> <b>lithophaga</b> found on the same substrate are at least 350 years, and up to 2000 years, older than the date of the earthquake that lifted them above sea level. These observations reveal two important effects that limit the use of radiocarbon lithophagid ages in tectonic and paleoseismological studies. The first is that the exceptional preservation potential of lithophagids allows them to remain intact and in situ long after natural death, while the substrate continues to be colonised until eventual uplift. The second, which we confirm with radiocarbon analysis of museum specimens of known age, is the incorporation of old (14 C-free) carbon into lithophagid shells from the limestone host rock into which the lithophagids bored. The two effects are both significant in Crete and central Greece, and can cause the radiocarbon lithophagid ages to be up to 2000 years older than the uplift event which exposed them. Understanding these effects is important because lithophagids are far more abundantly preserved, and used to date uplift, than most other marine organisms. This study shows that they can rarely be used to distinguish uplift events, or date them to better than 1000 years, or even to distinguish whether observed uplift occurred in a single or in multiple events. After taking account of these uncertainties, the ages of the lithophagids are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that the highest prominent marine notches and exposed lithophagid holes within a few metres of sea level in Greece formed when sea level became relatively stable ~ 6000 years ago, following rapid rise after the last glacial maximum. © 2010 Elsevier B.

Sea urchin biomass was evaluated only at the scale of locations. Average density of P. lividus did not significantly change between impacted locations and controls, whereas A. lixula showed a greater density at the impacted locations. Distribution patterns of A. lixula, in addition, differed at the spatial scale of a few metres between impacted locations and controls, being generally more aggregated at the controls. The size-frequency distribution (test diameter) of P. lividus showed a mode at 3 - 4 cm at the impacted locations compared to a mode at 2 - 3 cm in the controls. The size-frequency of A. lixula was bimodal at the damaged locations (with modes at 1 - 2 and 4 - 5 cm, respectively) and unimodal (with the mode at 4 - 5 cm) at the controls.
