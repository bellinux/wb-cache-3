50|$|A {{multi-purpose}} vessel (MPV) is a {{seagoing ship}} that is {{built for the}} carriage {{of a wide range}} of cargoes. Examples of these cargoes are: wood, steel, building materials, rolls of paper and bulk cargo. Multi-purpose vessels can be divided into four categories: vessels with and without cargo gear, coastal trade liners and sea-river vessels. Bigger multi-purpose vessels are able to carry different kinds of loading on the same voyage. Smaller multi-purpose vessels do not have this advantage but they are employed to get into smaller harbours because of their limited draught. Because of their varying operating conditions, these ships have complex designs that are difficult to build. Their all-round design must be able to carry heavy loads, large objects and unitised cargo as bulk cargo. These cargoes can be rolled or lifted on board so this requires different types of <b>loading</b> <b>gear,</b> as well.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Gear {{adaptive}} transmission represents {{itself as the}} gear variator with the variable transfer ratio. Unsuccessful attempts of creation of a gear variator were undertaken repeatedly. The main problem is- maintenance of constant gearing of cogwheels of a variator. The decision of this problem is based on use of science discovery in the kinematic chain with two degrees of freedom. The gear variator {{in the form of}} the closed differential mechanism has definability and allows changing the transfer ratio in the set range. Thus external variable technological loading changes the transfer ratio itself. The adaptive to variable <b>loading</b> <b>gear</b> variator works without the control mechanism. The gear variator opens essentially new concept of creation of adaptive techniques for machines with variable technological resistance (for example, adaptive gearboxes). The theory of a gear variator is based on a discovery «Effect of force adaptation in mechanics», published in leading editions of world press. According to this discovery the kinematic chain with two degrees of freedom, containing the mobile closed contour, becomes the definable mechanism at presence only one input link. Such mechanism gets property independently to change speed of motion of an output link depending on variable loading. The discovery is based on mechanics laws. In work the bases of the theory of a gear adaptive variator are stated...|$|E
40|$|Micropitting {{damage is}} one of the failure modes {{commonly}} observed in gears leading to destructive failures, which in turn results in unplanned shutdown and expensive replacement, such as those observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This study investigates gear micropitting initiation and propagation when subjected to varying torque loads under a constant rotational speed. The study employs both experimental gear testing and analytical evaluation based on the ISO Technical Report of Gear Micropitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010 and the recently revised ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2014. Initiation and propagation of micropitting are assessed in testing by quantifying the development of micropits and their progressive rate after specific numbers of running cycles at step-up torque levels. The analytical study is conducted to validate the prediction of micropitting using the ISO/TR recommended procedures by comparing the results with the occurrence of micropits in the tested gears. The gear test results show that micropitting initiates at the pinion dedendum but escalates at the addendum, because of the greater severity of progressive micropitting at the dedendum of the mating wheel where the tip relief area first comes into mesh. The analytical results, based on varying surface roughness measurements obtained from the tested gears, confirm that the maximum contact stresses and minimum specific lubricant film thicknesses occur in these regions. The specific lubricant film thickness varies considerably because of changes of surface roughness after gears are subjected to various running cycles under varying torque levels. It has found that the excessive <b>loading,</b> <b>gear</b> tooth micro-geometry, surface roughness and lubricant film thickness are the main factors affecting micropitting...|$|E

40|$|Power {{transmission}} is traditionally achieved with a mechanical gear. These gears require maintenance, cause vibration, {{and have no}} overload protection. Magnetic gears (MGs) offer an innovative solution to these drawbacks as they do not require regular maintenance, have no need for lubrication, create very little acoustic noise, have built in overload protection {{and as a result}} of these advantages, have a longer lifetime of operation. The flux focusing axial magnetic gear (FFAMG) was assembled for future testing of power transmission, conversion, and generation applications. Gears are used to transmit power by converting low speed-high torque rotary motion into high speed-low torque rotary motion, or conversely, converting high speed-low torque rotary motion into low speed-high torque rotary motion, through a gear ratio. On a traditional mechanical gear this ratio is the ratio of teeth on the <b>load</b> <b>gear</b> to the teeth on the drive gear. The innovative FFAMG uses a ratio of magnetic poles on the driver <b>gear</b> to <b>load</b> <b>gear</b> to accomplish the power transmission that a traditional mechanical gear would achieve. As a result of this research the FFAMG was assembled successfully, magnetic flux density measurements were collected and compared with simulations.
