Because of the absence of broader and more complete sources the author came to the study of archival journals, analysis of different anarchist materials and the use of several interviews. In the end the thesis describes the overall history <b>of</b> <b>AFA</b> and creates conclusion that AFA is in its current development dynamic organization, which experienced its period of stagnation and at least two booms that have a direct connection with the development on the far-right scene.
