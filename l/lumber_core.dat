5000|$|The {{north and}} south walls of the one-story living room are wood framed 4 x 8 in columns. The columns are carried beneath the floor line to rest on {{concrete}} block foundation walls. 2 x 8 in floor joists on 16 in centers carry the rough floor.The full-height exterior bay walls are of plate glass. The glass was shipped from Pittsburgh, on special order, by rail and delivered to the contractor at the site for erection. One of the panels, on the screen porch or {{south side of the}} living room wall, is capable of sliding open to a full door of 8 x 9 ft, by means of a continuous steel slide and steel barn door hangers.As stated above, the exterior materials used in the Horner House include naturally bleached heart redwood, bevelled joint cladding, always used vertically, and plate glass. The two-story core of the main house contains manufactured casement windows, transite spandrels and heads with redwood corners and facias. The doors are solid <b>lumber</b> <b>core,</b> stained and varnished.The screened porch is constructed of four built-up columns, suspended from the cantilevered ceiling joists. The floors are pine varnished. The copper screen has been attached with copper-headed nails to the uprights in 36" [...] horizontal bands and then hand-sewn with copper wire at the selvage edges to form a floor-to ceiling screen [...] "wall", in four bays, along its 32 ft length. The screens presently in place on the porch are original.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} look into the causes of fire {{response}} and post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubular columns protected with different materials, the fire test was conducted for a set of circular steel tubes protected with different materials such as gypsum fireproof panel, bamboo plywood and the ordinary <b>lumber</b> <b>core</b> plywood, and the steel tube without any protective material. The fire response temperature of surface of steel tubes is measured and the axial compressive bearing capacity of the specimens after fire are tested and analyzed. The test results show that gypsum fireproof panel has the best fire protection characteristics, the ordinary <b>lumber</b> <b>core</b> plywood and bamboo plywood can also retard rising of the surface temperature of the steel tubes during the initial 35 min although they are combustible materials. It is found that the post-fire bearing capacity of the steel tubes protected with different materials varies evidently, and the maximum value of response temperature has the greatest effect...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of recent {{developments}} in post-tensioned multi-st orey timber buildings using un bonded tendons, this paper aimed at investigating the potential of implementing a similar technology for innovative solutions for timber bridges. In particular, several technological solutions are proposed for future development, using several different cross sections and longitudinal profiles suitable for shortto- medium bridge spans, with {{both internal and external}} longitudinal ten dons, in some cases supplemented by transverse post-tensioning. In add ition, a feasibility study of a short-span timber brid ge is presented, with longitudinally posttensioned lami nated veneer <b>lumber</b> (LVL) hollow <b>core</b> beams {{as an alternative to the}} existing concrete solution. The discussion includes a comparison between newly proposed and traditional solutions based on the evaluation of long-term post-tensioning losses, a cost analysi s and some considerations on sustainability issues...|$|R
40|$|The severe {{recession}} and the housing and lumber market {{collapse in the}} 2007 to 2011 period has led to increased interest in market diversification {{in an attempt to}} cushion the impact of market swings in the United States. An international market diversification strategy has been implemented by several lumber manufacturers in Oregon and Washington that allowed them to be well positioned to shift sales to the Asian market during this domestic lumber market collapse. By diversifying a portion of sales into new international markets, Montana sawmills may be able to stabilize demand for their products instead of being subject to domestic market demand swings. To determine if Montana sawmills can participate in the Chinese export market and to identify the best export opportunities, a strategic assessment was conducted {{through the use of a}} SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. For this process, Montana's <b>lumber</b> industry <b>core</b> competencies were identified and aligned with Chinese wood product demand to highlight potential export opportunities for the Montana sawmill industry. It was found that the optimal export opportunity consisted of dimension lumber from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) species with nominal 2 by 4 dimensions and with No. 3 utility and No. 4 economy product grades. This product mix provided the best fit with Montana's timber supply, manufacturing capabilities, and Chinese product demand. By incorporating this strategy with the help of international lumber brokers and experienced exporters, Montana sawmills will be well positioned to respond to domestic market fluctuations and future Chinese product demand opportunities.

40|$|Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a {{prefabricated}} solid {{engineered wood}} product made {{of at least three}} orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber that are laminated by gluing longitudinal and transverse layers with structural adhesives to form a solid panel. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} CLT buildings can perform well in seismic loading and are recognized as the essential role of connector performance in structural design, modelling, and analysis of CLT buildings. When CLT is composed of high-grade/high-density layers for the outer lamellas and low-grade/low-density for the core of the panels, the CLT panels are herein designated as hybrid CLT panels as opposed to conventional CLT panels that are built using one lumber type for both outer and core lamellas. This paper presents results of a testing program developed to estimate the cyclic performance of CLT connectors applied on hybrid CLT layups. Two connectors are selected, which can be used in wall-to-floor connections. These are readily available in the North American market. Characterization of the performance of connectors is done in two perpendicular directions under a modified CUREE cyclic loading protocol. Depending on the mode of failure, in some cases, testing results indicate that when the nails or screws penetrate the low-grade/low-density <b>core</b> <b>lumber,</b> a statistically significant difference is obtained between hybrid and conventional layups. However, in other cases, due to damage in the face layer or in the connection, force-displacement results for conventional and hybrid CLT layups were not statistically significant.
