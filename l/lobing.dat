25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation <b>lobing,</b> phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1975, {{to address}} {{problems}} of beamwidth changing at different frequencies, D. Broadus [...] "Don" [...] Keele, Jr. of Electro-Voice introduced a hybrid horn with an exponential expansion rate near the throat {{followed by a}} conical expansion section and ending with a rapidly flaring flange at the mouth. The flange at the mouth solved some remaining problems with <b>lobing</b> at higher frequencies. Don Keele specified in one version of his design a wider horizontal flare for pattern control appropriate to public address purposes. Keele's paper set forth the relationships between mouth size, frequency and coverage angle, providing a basis for many future developments of horn design. One problem found with constant directivity horns is that the horizontal coverage pattern cannot be narrowed without making the vertical coverage pattern {{too small to be}} useful.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relative}} importance of climate, <b>lobe</b> morphology and <b>lobe</b> interactions in determining the radial growth of individual <b>lobes</b> in foliose lichen thalli. The radial growth of 75 <b>lobes</b> from thalli of Parmelia conspersa (Ehrh. Ex Ach.) Ach. and Parmelia glabratula ssp. fuliginosa (Fr. ex Duby) Laund. was measured over 22 successive months in relation to climatic factors. Individual <b>lobes</b> showed a fluctuating pattern of radial growth with alternating periods of fast and slow growth. In 17 / 75 (23 %) of <b>lobes</b> studied, monthly radial growth was correlated with a climatic factor, usually total rainfall or the frequency of sunshine hours. In addition, the radial growth of 54 <b>lobes</b> of P. conspersa was measured over four months in relation to <b>lobe</b> morphology and the radial growth and morphology of adjacent <b>lobes.</b> Radial growth was correlated with <b>lobe</b> length and with the radial growth of adjacent <b>lobes.</b> In addition, the pattern of <b>lobe</b> branching appeared to be related to <b>lobe</b> width {{and to a lesser extent}} to <b>lobe</b> length and the width of adjacent <b>lobes.</b> The radial growth in one year of exceptionally long <b>lobes</b> which had grown beyond the thallus margin was similar to more normal <b>lobes,</b> but experimentally bisected <b>lobes</b> had significantly reduced radial growth compared with control <b>lobes.</b> These results suggested that the fluctuating pattern of radial growth in individual <b>lobes</b> may be determined by climate and the pattern of <b>lobe</b> branching.

Ach. <b>Lobe</b> division was studied in sequences of adjacent <b>lobes</b> using spatial pattern analysis. In five large thalli, <b>lobe</b> division within the thallus margin was randomly distributed. Correlations between the degree of <b>lobe</b> division, the radial growth of the <b>lobe</b> and <b>lobe</b> morphology were studied in six thalli. <b>Lobe</b> division {{was positively correlated with}} either <b>lobe</b> width or area in four thalli. Correlations were observed with radial growth or morphology of the adjacent <b>lobes</b> in two thalli. Dividing and non-dividing <b>lobes</b> were removed from large thalli and glued to pieces of slate with their tips either at the same level or in front of neighbouring <b>lobes.</b> Dividing <b>lobes</b> divided more rapidly when their tips were glued in front of their neighbours. The levels of ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were measured within a 2 mm region of the tip in dividing and non-dividing <b>lobes</b> on four occasions in 1994. Carbohydrate levels were significantly increased in dividing compared with non-dividing <b>lobes.</b> In addition, the mean size of the algal cells was greater in non-dividing compared with dividing <b>lobes</b> especially at the <b>lobe</b> base. However, the percentage of zoosporangia and aplanosporangia did not vary significantly in dividing and non-dividing <b>lobes.</b> These results suggest that: 1) the pattern of <b>lobe</b> division within the thallus margin may be random, 2) <b>lobe</b> division may be determined by <b>lobe</b> size and the location of the <b>lobe</b> tip relative to the neighbouring <b>lobes</b> and 3) there may be an increase in the productivity of <b>lobes</b> associated with <b>lobe</b> division...|$|R

40|$|The radial {{growth of}} {{individual}} <b>lobes</b> of the foliose lichen, Parmelia conspersa (Ehrh. Ex Ach.) Ach. was studied {{to determine whether}} (1) adjacent <b>lobes</b> exchange carbohydrate and (2) marginal competition between <b>lobes</b> influences radial growth. In a survey of thalli of different size, the number of marginal <b>lobes</b> was linearly related to thallus circumference. However, the relationship between mean <b>lobe</b> width and thallus circumference was fitted by a second order polynomial. Hence, mean <b>lobe</b> width may reach a maximum in thalli approx. 3 cm in diameter. The interactions between marginal <b>lobes</b> were studied by either painting single <b>lobes</b> with acrylic paint or by removing <b>lobes</b> from the thallus. Painting the whole <b>lobe</b> virtually stopped its radial growth while partially painted <b>lobes</b> grew less than control <b>lobes.</b> The radial growth of a <b>lobe</b> was unaffected by either completely painting or removing its neighbour. Removal of both neighbouring <b>lobes</b> did not influence the radial growth of a <b>lobe</b> but severing the <b>lobe</b> from the thallus reduced its radial growth. In addition, <b>lobe</b> width increased significantly when both neighbouring <b>lobes</b> were removed. These results suggest that adjacent <b>lobes</b> have a considerable degree of independence {{and that there is}} little exchange of carbohydrate between them. In addition, marginal competition between adjacent <b>lobes</b> may restrict the lateral extension of the <b>lobe</b> and this may maintain a more constant mean <b>lobe</b> width in larger thalli. It is possible that the intensity of marginal competition between adjacent <b>lobes</b> may vary with thallus size and this could be a factor determining the growth curve of a foliose lichen throughout its life...|$|R

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the MTM {{configuration}} is {{the interaction between the}} two midwoofers. For any frequency (over the operating range of the midwoofers), the off-axis response exhibits different <b>lobing</b> patterns because of the vertical distance between the midwoofers, and {{as a function of the}} frequency and horizontal distance from the speaker. At any off-axis listening position, although both midwoofers operate in phase (are time-aligned), the waves from each reach the listening position at different times (and therefore have a relative phase difference) - at frequencies where the time displacement between the two midwoofers corresponds to one-half of one wavelength, the outputs of the two midwoofers will null. However, the time displacement itself is a function of the distance from the speaker and frequency, which means that the <b>lobing</b> for a given listening distance and off-axis position will be different at different frequencies. Since the basic reason for this is the distance between the midwoofers, again the solution is to use as small drivers as possible, placed as close as possible. With this, for listening distances much greater than the distance between the drivers the <b>lobing</b> effects are much less obvious.|$|E

40|$|The {{margins of}} foliose lichen thalli {{comprise}} individual <b>lobes</b> which grow radially and divide.
