5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> differential to improve traction.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Motion {{planning}} {{is a necessary}} step before automation in road con-struction. This paper deals with motion planning for compactors. The compactor is an articulated frame steering vehicle used in road construction. Generally, motion planning uses the kinematic model of the robot. In {{the case of the}} compactor, this model is far away from reality because it {{does not take into account}} compactor masses and particular drum-soil contact forces. A motion planning which uses both the kinematic and the dynamic model of the compactor is presented in this paper. The advantages of this motion planning are: • To generate feasible motion for the robot which implies a smoother control law for mechanics, • <b>Limited</b> <b>slips...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{critical}} breakdown displacement, Dc, {{in which}} friction drops to its sliding value, {{can be made}} dependent on event size by specifying friction to {{be a function of}} variables other than slip. Two such friction laws are examined here. The first is designed to achieve accuracy and smoothness in discrete numerical calcula-tions. Consistent resolution throughout an evolving rupture is achieved by specifying friction as a function of elapsed time after peak stress is reached. Such a time-weakening model produces Dc and fracture energy proportional to the square root of distance rupture has propagated in the case of uniform stress drop. The second friction law is more physically motivated. Energy loss in a damage zone outside the slip zone has the effect of increasing Dc and <b>limiting</b> peak <b>slip</b> velocity (Andrews, 1976). This article demonstrates a converse effect, that artificially <b>limiting</b> <b>slip</b> velocity on a fault in an elastic medium has a toughening effect, increasing fracture energy and Dc proportionally to rupture propagation distance in the case of uniform stress drop. Both the time-weakening and the velocity-toughening models can be used in cal-culations with heterogeneous stress drop...|$|R

Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the tachometer.|$|E
40|$|A novel 'Elastic Engagement and Friction Coupled' (EEFC) {{mechanical}} transmission {{has been proposed}} recently in which the power is transmitted through elastic tines on the surfaces of the driving and driven wheels. This study introduces new variations of EEFC mechanical wheel transmission (broadly emulating a gear-pair) with small contact areas for use under light duty conditions. Because a drive of this type inevitably has a strong statistical component, theoretical analysis of the geometrical and mechanical relationships has been attempted by using linear modeling and empirical weightings. Several simple forms of the EEFC wheel transmission are tested under <b>limiting</b> (<b>slip)</b> conditions for transmission force and transmission coefficients against normal load. Normalized standard deviation of these parameters is used to summarize noise performance. Models and experiments are in reasonable agreement, suggesting that the model parameters reflect important design considerations. EEFC transmissions appear well suited to force regimes of a few tenths of a newton and to have potential for use in, for example, millimetre-scale robots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We study dynamic rupture {{propagation}} on flat faults using 2 D {{plane strain}} models featuring strongly rate-weakening fault friction (in a rate-and-state framework) and off-fault Drucker–Prager viscoplasticity. Plastic deformation bounds stresses near the rupture front and <b>limits</b> <b>slip</b> velocities to ∼ 10 m=s, a bound {{expected to be}} independent of earthquake magnitude. As originally shown for ruptures in an elastic medium (Zheng and Rice, 1998), a consequence of strongly rate-weakening friction is {{the existence of a}} critical background stress level at which self-sustaining rupture propagation, in the form of self-healing slip pulses, is just barely possible. At higher background stress levels, ruptures are cracklike. This phenomenology remains unchanged when allowing for off-fault plasticity, but the critical stress level is increased. The increase depends on the extent and magnitude of plastic deformation, which is influenced by the orientation of the initial stress field and the proximity of the initial stress state to the yield surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of fretting and fretting corrosion of electrical or electronic contacts is described. A for-mula is given that permits prediction of the <b>limit</b> where <b>slip</b> starts to occur. The effects of connector design and application parameters such as coefficient of friction, normalforce, spring rate, size of displacement and lubrication are considered. Measurements {{carried out on}} the Micro-MaTchTM contact system confirm {{the validity of the}} approach...|$|R
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active <b>Limited</b> <b>Slip</b> Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal <b>Limited</b> <b>Slip</b> Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
25|$|The 86, BRZ and FR-S {{are offered}} with two 6-speed transmissions, an {{in-house}} developed Toyota TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that {{used on the}} Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch gearbox. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torque sensing <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> differential is standard on most models.|$|E
25|$|BMW, {{working with}} Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental Automotive Systems, {{developed}} {{a system to}} reduce engine torque to prevent loss of control and applied it {{to most of the}} BMW model line for 1992 excluding the l3 series (E30 and some E36 chassis codes) which could be ordered with the winter package, which came with a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> differential, heated seats and mirrors. From 1987 to 1992, Mercedes-Benz and Robert Bosch GmbH co-developed a system called Elektronisches Stabilitätsprogramm ("Electronic Stability Programme", trademarked as ESP) to control lateral slippage.|$|E
40|$|The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) {{model has}} been shown to exhibit many {{properties}} of human walking, and therefore has been the starting point for studies on robust, energy-efficient walking for robots. In this paper, the problem of gait variation during walking on the SLIP model is addressed by controlling the leg stiffness and the angle-of-attack in order to switch between gaits and thus regulate walking speeds. We show {{that it is possible to}} uniquely describe <b>SLIP</b> <b>limit</b> cycle gaits in fully normalised form. Using that description, we propose both an instantaneous switching method and an interpolation method with an optimisation step to switch between <b>limit</b> cycle <b>SLIP</b> gaits. Using simulations, we show that it is then possible to transition between them, after which the system converges back to zero-input limit cycle walking...|$|R

50|$|The DPC {{differential}} features clutch packs on both output sides {{that are}} actuated by an electric motor. The clutch pack activates a planetary gearset which causes one wheel to be overdriven. A conventional control system, such as BMW's typical xDrive system without Dynamic Performance Control, relies on brakes {{to reduce the}} speed of the faster-moving wheel (which is the one with less traction) and reduce engine power to <b>limit</b> <b>slip</b> at that wheel. This leads to increased brake wear, and slows the vehicle's optimal progress. By contrast, xDrive when integrated with DPC will speed up the slower-moving, not slipping wheel (the one with the most traction) in order to maintain stability when needed. For example, during vehicle turning, the outer wheel is overdriven to provide greater acceleration, using the traction advantage through the dynamic loading of the outboard wheel in cornering. Meanwhile, in an oversteer situation, the inner wheel is overdriven to regain traction balance. This provides additional traction across the axle of the vehicle, {{while at the same time}} maintaining more of the vehicle's optimal progress through turns.|$|R
25|$|In 1994 the Toyota Curren came in two models, the ST206 and the ST207. The ST206 {{had four}} {{different}} trim levels. The FS, XS, ZS and the ZS Sport Selection.

The ZS Sport Selection had {{the added benefit of}} a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> differential and a leather steering wheel.

25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo charged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles can be {{customized}} by the player, both visually and performance-wise. In {{addition to}} adding body parts such as hood scoops and body kits, players can add {{multiple layers of}} decals to the vehicles.

Vehicles can be realistically damaged, from both a cosmetic and a performance standpoint. This changes the way the game is played, as collisions with barriers and other cars will alter the car's handling, top speed and acceleration.
