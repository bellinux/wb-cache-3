40|$|The {{annually}} laminated {{record of}} Lake Belau offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate with high temporal resolution Holocene environmental change, aspects of climate history and human {{impact on the}} landscape. A new chronology based on varve counts, 14 C-datings and heavy metal history has been established, covering the last 9400 years. Based on multiple varve counting on two core sequences, the easily countable <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> spans about 7850 varve years (modelled age range c. 9430 to 1630 cal. BP). Not all of the record is of the same quality but approximately 69 % of the varves sequence is classified to be of high quality and only c. 5 % of low quality. The new chronology suggests dates generally c. 260 years older than previously assumed for the <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> of the record. The implications for the vegetation and land-use history of the region as well as revised datings for pollen stratigraphical events are discussed. Tephra analysis allowed the identification of several cryptotephra layers. New dates for volcanic eruptions are presented for the Lairg B event (c. 6848 cal. BP, 2 s range 6930 – 6713 cal. BP), the Hekla 4 event (c. 4396 cal. BP, 2 s range 4417 – 4266 cal. BP), and Hekla 3 eruption (c. 3095 cal. BP, 2 s range 3120 – 3068 cal. BP) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tidewater lakes on Baflin Island in {{the eastern}} Canadian Arctic offer an {{excellent}} opportunity to study interannual to century-scale Arctic climatic change. Freeze-cores were analysed from three lakes in southeastern Baffln Island: Upper Soper Lake, Ogac Lake and Winton Bay Lake. The sediment record in each lake consists of massive sediments overlain by an organic-rich, finely <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> which continues to the surface. The laminae in Ogac Lake were studied in detail and consist of two types. The light layers are composed almost entirely of intact diatom frustules, primarily Chaetoceros spp. The darker layers are dominated by clay and silt-sized terrigenous mineral grains, including abundant quartz and feldspars. These couplets are probably deposited {{as the result of}} diatom blooms in the late spring/summer growing season followed by settling of grains introduced by summer runoff. Sedimentation rates based on 21 ~ dates agree well with rates based on laminae counts in both Ogac and Winton Bay Lakes, indicating that the laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Our experience suggests that shallow-silled tidewater lakes with varved sediments may be relatively common along the coast of Batiin Island. It should thus be possible to create a network of sites with annually dated palaeoclimate r cords...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand and}} {{application}} of composites are increasing nowadays. Composite materials {{in the form of}} plate or plate-like structures are widely used in wind turbine blades and ship building due to its high specific strength and stiffness. For high thermal applications, Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are used in preference to laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal field. The pre-twisted cantilever plates have major use in turbine blades, fan blades, compressor blades, chopper blades, marine propellers and chiefly in gas turbines. These structures are often subjected to thermal environments, and hence FGMs are a good alternative to metal plates. The present work deals with the study of buckling analysis of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates. The analysis is done by using ANSYS, and the results are validated using ABAQUS. A SHELL- 281 element having six degrees of freedom per node is employed in ANSYS. The functionally graded material plate with a uniform variation of the material property through the thickness is estimated as a <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> containing number of layers, and each layer is taken as isotropic. The power law is used to determine material properties in each layer. From convergence studies, ten by ten mesh and twelve number of layers are found to give good accuracy.

The recent part of the core was dated {{using a combination of}} 210 Pb and spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) techniques. Extrapolating this chronology dated the <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> of the core, between 723 and 881 mm, to {{the first half of the}} 18 th century and this section was selected for detailed study. The thicknesses of the laminae were measured using reflecting and polarizing microscopes whilst geochemistry was determined by an electron probe. The thickness of the dark layers was found to be positively correlated with titanium concentrations, and negatively correlated with aluminium and potassium concentrations. The thickness of the light layers was found to be negatively correlated with the concentrations of titanium. It is concluded that the dark layers were deposited from the Fushui River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, under periods of normal flow whilst the light layers were mainly deposited from the Yangtze River itself during flood periods. Documentary evidence for floods occurring in the lake catchment corresponded with thick laminations of high titanium concentration. Further, two of the three thickest, light laminations with low titanium concentrations were found to be synchronous with recorded flood dates of the main Yangtze River in its Middle Reaches, but one was synchronous with a local drought. These data suggest that the lake sediment provides an archive of the relative water levels of the Yangtze and Wanghu including floods of both the main Yangtze River and the local hydrological regime. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The use and {{applications}} of composites are expanding these days. Due to light weight,high specific strength and stiffness,composite materials are being widely {{used as a}} part of wind turbine blades and ship building. For high temperature applications,Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are preferred over laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal field. Chopper blades, turbine cutting blades,marine propellers,compressor blades, fan shape blades,and mostly gas turbines use pre-twisted cantilever plates. Often they are subjected to thermal environments,and thus FGMs are a decent option to metal plates. Composite structures with cut-outs are usually employed in engineering structures. In structural components cut-outs are provided sometimes to lighten the structure and for proper ventilation. Cut-outs in aircraft components (for example,fuselage,ribs and wing spar) are required for inspection,access,fuel lines and electric lines or to minimize the general weight of the aircraft. Study of buckling of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates with and without holes and with varying applied in-plane loads is dealt in the present work. The analysis is carried out by using ANSYS. An element having six degrees of freedom per node SHELL- 281 is used. The FGM plate is assumed to be a <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> containing a number of layers with a steady variation of the material property through the thickness,where each layer is taken as isotropic.

While the stitches were the source of damage initiation, they also slowed damage propagation both along the length and across the width and affected through-the-thickness damage growth.

40|$|The {{aims and}} {{objectives}} of this study are to examine the role of mouthguards and the materials that are used for their manufacture, the heating process they undergo during manufacture and how the lamination of different materials into a multi-layered system to form a composite structure may affect the impact absorbing capabilities. The effect of heat on pEVA during the manufacturing process was investigated using an instrumented dropweight impact testing rig and a polariscope to observe internal stress as it was felt that the physical properties of the material could be adversely affected by this part of the process. Laminated structures, using several different materials, (pEVA, PMMA, silicone rubber, synthetic wax, modelling clay, soft denture lining material and a semi-solid synthetic rubber) were tested as it was felt that the lamination of different materials with a range of physical properties would exhibit less deformation and transmit less of the impact energy. To ascertain how a mouthguard may react during an impact event by simulation tests in the impact test rig. Methods: For the heat treatment of pEVA a furnace was used to heat the test material to near its' glass transition temperature (Tg) of 84 'C ± 3 'C. The material was brought up to Tg and held at that point for 10 minutes. The specimens were then removed from the furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature. Heat treated and non-heat treated samples were placed in a polariscope to observe stress within the material. Dropweight impact tests were conducted on all samples using an instrumented impact testing rig. All samples were circularly clamped and force-time and displacement-time plots obtained. The samples were placed again in the polariscope and any changes in stress were noted. To observe the processing effects of the manufacturing procedure five mouthguards were made on the same cast and were brought to various stages of completion. Different 'lay-ups' of pEVA along with laminations and sandwiches of pEVA, PMMA, silicone rubber, synthetic wax, modelling clay, semi-solid synthetic rubber and denture soft lining were also tested using the dropweight impact tester. For the impact simulation tests samples of 50 mm. diameter were placed on top of a PMMA substrate, that was clamped in the impact rig, to see how the test sample would protect the substrate during impact. Results: The Peak Impact Force (PIF) of heat treated pEVA was lower (PIF 18 mm centre displacement, heat treated pEVA > 30 mm centre displacement). Digital photographic images from the polariscope show that the heat treatment of pEVA virtually eliminates stress and following impact the amount of stress, seen photoelastically, was also reduced. Images of material in the polariscope also indicate that the finishing techniques employed during the manufacturing process have a direct effect on the stress distribution within the mouthguard. A 5 mm laminated structure of pEVA, PMMA and silicone rubber was able to absorb more impact energy (PIF = 275 N) and exhibited less deformation (1. 4 mm than that of a monolithic structure of 5 mrn heat treated pEVA (PIF 30 mm). Simulation tests showed that the 5 mm. thick pEVA protected the PMMA better (PIF = 325, displacement 6. 8 mm) than the Imm pEVA (PIF = 340, displacement 7. 7 mm). Conclusions: The mouthguard forming process has a direct effect on the internal stresses of pEVA and therefore its physical response. When pEVA is laminated with PMMA and silicone rubber the impact absorbing capabilities are better than a monolithic structure of pEVA. Mouthguards for use in contact sports, therefore, should incorporate a <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> of pEVA, PMMA and silicone rubber. Simulation tests show that 5 mm thick samples protect a substrate more effectively than I- 4 mm test samples...|$|E

40|$|Thick <b>laminate</b> <b>sections</b> can {{be found}} from the tip to the root in most common wind turbine blade designs. Obtaining {{accurate}} and reliable design data for thick laminates is subject of investigations. Due to the poor thermal conductivity properties of composites and the material self-heating that occurs during the fatigue loading, high temperature gradients may appear through the laminate thickness. In the case of thick laminates in high loads regimes, the centre section temperature might exceed the material operational range, leading to premature failures. In the present work a method to forecast the self-heating of thick laminates in fatigue loading is presented.

At a centennial scale coccolith assemblages indicate low primary production in the basin from 35 to 11. 5 ka B. P., whereas the Holocene is characterized by high-productivity conditions. This pattern demonstrates {{the influence of the}} glacial-interglacial cycles on productivity and, by inference, on the nutrient supply by the upwelling cell off Point of Conception. On a shorter scale, laminations associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events appear to be due to an injection of poorly oxygenated waters in the deepest part of the basin rather than anoxia due to high primary production.

40|$|Piston, gravity, and multicores {{as well as}} hydrographic {{data were}} {{collected}} along the Pacific margin of Baja California to reconstruct past variations in {{the intensity of the}} oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ). Gravity cores collected from within the OMZ north of 24 °N did not contain laminated surface sediments even though bottom water oxygen (BWO) concentrations were close to 5 µmol/kg. However, many of the cores collected south of 24 °N did contain millimeter- to centimeter-scale, brown to black laminations in Holocene and older sediments but not in sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum. In addition to the dark laminations, Holocene sediments in Soledad Basin, silled at 290 m, also contain white coccolith laminae that probably represent individual blooms. Two open margin cores from 430 and 700 m depth that were selected for detailed radiocarbon dating show distinct transitions from bioturbated glacial sediment to laminated Holocene sediment occurring at 12. 9 and 11. 5 ka, respectively. The transition is delayed and more gradual (11. 3 - 10. 0 ka) in another dated core from Soledad Basin. The observations indicate that bottom-water oxygen concentrations dropped below a threshold for the preservation of laminations at different times or that a synchronous hydrographic change left an asynchronous sedimentary imprint due to local factors. With the caveat that <b>laminated</b> <b>sections</b> should therefore not be correlated without independent age control, the pattern of older sequences of laminations along the North American western margin reported by this and previous studies suggests that multiple patterns of regional productivity and ventilation prevailed over the past 60 kyr...|$|R

40|$|The use of fibre-reinforced {{polymer matrix}} {{composite}} materials {{is growing at}} a faster rate than GDP in many countries. An improved understanding of their processing and mechanical behaviour would extend the potential applications of these materials. For unidirectional composites, it is predicted that localised absence of fibres is related to longitudinal compression failure. The use of woven reinforcements permits more effective manufacture than for unidirectional fibres. It has been demonstrated experimentally that compression strengths of woven composites are reduced when fibres are clustered. Summerscales predicted that clustering of fibres would increase the permeability of the reinforcement and hence expedite the processing of these materials. Commercial fabrics are available which employ this concept using flow-enhancing bound tows. The net effect of clustering fibres is to enhance processability whilst reducing the mechanical properties. The effects reported above were qualitative correlations. Gross differences in the appearance of <b>laminate</b> <b>sections</b> are apparent for different weave styles.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine experimentally the flexural behaviour of laminated composite sandwich beams based on orientation {{and the number of}} laminations. The failure modes and loads were numerically modelled and predicted analytically. The sandwich beams were fabricated using a new generation of sandwich composite with biaxial glass fibre/resin skin and an innovative phenolic based core material. The laminated beams were subjected to 4 -point static bending tests to determine the strength and failure mechanisms. The beams tested consist of one to four laminates in the flatwise and edgewise orientation. Strains to failure in the face sheets were measured through the use strain gauges and beam deflections were recorded for each specimen. The results of the experimental investigation demonstrated that the <b>laminated</b> <b>sections</b> tested in the edgewise orientation failed at a higher load than those in the flatwise orientation. The flatwise specimens had a brittle type failure. This was primarily due to the compressive failure of the skin followed by debonding between the skin and the core. The vertical skins in the edgewise orientation caused a difference in the failure mode and ultimately facilitated the increase in ultimate strength. The vertical skins prevented the tension cracks in the core from propagating and caused ductile type failure mode through the progressive failure of the skins. The analytical predictions from the constituent material data confirmed the experimental results. The analytical investigation conducted predicted the load deflection behaviour and initial failure loads. The results from the linear numerical modelling are in agreement with those observed in the experimental data. The experimental data established that for a higher number of laminations the beam sections in the edgewise orientation provides an optimal alternative to the flatwise orientation. It was found that the edgewise orientation provides a higher ultimate strength, ductile type failure and comparable stiffness to the flatwise orientation. The results indicated a high potential for the use of laminated sandwich beams as structural elements in both the flatwise and edgewise orientation...|$|R

Near term tasks include screening composites and adhesives for 589 K service, developing fabrication procedures and specifications, developing design allowables test methods and data, design and test of structural elements, {{and construction of}} a full scale aft body flap for the space shuttle orbiter vehicle for ground testing. Far term tasks include research efforts directed at new materials, manufacturing procedures and design/analysis methodology. Specific results discussed include: (1) identification of four GR/PI composites and three PI adhesives with 589 K service potential for periods ranging from 125 to 500 hours; (2) development of an adhesive formulation suitable for bonding reusable surface insulation (RSI) titles to 589 K (GR/PI) substructure; (3) the capability to fabricate and nondestructively inspect <b>laminates,</b> hat <b>section</b> shaped stiffeners, honeycomb sandwich panels, and chopped fiber moldings; and (4) test methods for measuring design allowables at 117 K...|$|R
40|$|The impact {{characteristics}} of cross-ply and angle-ply composite laminates were investigated, with an instrumented impact drop tester by performing gravity assisted drop tests on [0 / 90] 6 s and [0 / 45 / 90] 4 s laminates. The impact energy was kept constant at 12 J {{for all the}} tests. From the dynamic responses presented here as force history, energy history and force-displacement plots, relevant characteristics such as contact time, delamination load, absorbed energy, bending stiffness, after impact deflection etc were obtained. The plots were non-smooth, disclosing the salient features of the composites. It was {{important to note that}} the [0 / 45 / 90] 4 s was more resistant to impact bending, but incurred more damage as exhibited by its higher contact time and absorbed energy. The <b>laminates</b> were <b>sectioned</b> through the impact point and magnified macro and micro photographs were taken to show the failure modes, which include delamination, matrix cracking etc...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs. Using a large concrete mold, a single {{half of the}} fuselage shell was <b>laminated</b> in <b>sections</b> with glue between each layer and then a rubber bladder was lowered into the mold and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape against {{the inside of the}} mold. The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. With the fuselage constructed in this fashion, the wing spar couldn't cut through the fuselage, so the single spar cantilever wing was mounted atop the aircraft. Only the engine and landing gear remained essentially unstreamlined, and on the production versions the undercarriage had teardrop shaped [...] "spats" [...] covering the wheels, while only the earliest versions lacked NACA cowlings and had the engine cylinders exposed to the airstream. It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine, which delivered 225 horsepower (168 kW).|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} glacial termination, the upper North Pacific Ocean {{underwent}} dramatic and rapid changes in oxygenation {{that lead to}} the transient intensification of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), recorded by the widespread occurrence of laminated sediments on circum-Pacific continental margins. We present a new laminated sediment record from the mid-depth (1100 m) northern Bering Sea margin that provides insight into these deglacial OMZ maxima with exceptional, decadal-scale detail. Combined ultrahigh-resolution micro-X-ray-fluorescence (micro-XRF) data and sediment facies analysis of laminae reveal an alternation between predominantly terrigenous and diatom-dominated opal sedimentation. The diatomaceous laminae are interpreted to represent spring/summer productivity events related to the retreating sea ice margin. We identified five <b>laminated</b> <b>sections</b> in the deglacial part of our site. Lamina counts were carried out on these sections and correlated with the Bølling-Allerød and Preboreal phases in the North Greenland Ice Core (NGRIP) oxygen isotope record, indicating an annual deposition of individual lamina couplets (varves). The observed rapid decadal intensifications of anoxia, in particular within the Bølling-Allerød, are tightly coupled to short-term warm events through increases in regional export production. This dependence of laminae formation on warmer temperatures is underlined by a correlation with published Bering Sea sea surface temperature records and d 18 O data of planktic foraminifera from the Gulf of Alaska. The rapidity of the observed changes strongly implies a close atmospheric teleconnection between North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. We suggest that concomitant increases in export production and subsequent remineralization of organic matter in the Bering Sea, in combination with oxygen-poor waters entering the Being Sea, drove down oxygen concentrations to values below 0. 1 ml/l and caused laminae preservation. Calculated benthic-planktic ventilation ages show no significant variations throughout the last deglaciation, indicating that changes in formation rates or differing sources of North Pacific mid-depth waters are not prime candidates for strengthening the OMZ at our site. The age models established by our correlation procedure allow for the determination of calendar age control points for the Bølling-Allerød and the Preboreal that are independent of the initial radiocarbon-based chronology. Resulting surface reservoir ages range within 730 - 990 yr during the Bølling-Allerød, 800 - 1100 yr in the Younger Dryas, and 765 - 775 yr for the Preboreal...|$|R
40|$|The 3000 and 3500 orebodies {{form part}} of the world class copper deposit at Mount Isa. The Deep Copper Mine (now renamed Enterprise Mine) came into {{production}} in 1993 and provided the opportunity to study the characteristics of these orebodies and the structural controls on copper and cobalt mineralisation. In the Enterprise Mine orebodies, chalcopyrite and silica rich breccia cores are surrounded by a halo of recrystallised dolomitic shales and siliceous shales with lesser dolomite breccias. A distinctive talc+pyrrhotite alteration zone occcurs on the footwall of the 3500 Orebody adjacent to a band of sub-economic Ag-Pb-Zn mineralisation, which has associated phyllosilicate alteration. The Ag-Pb-Zn mineralisation is unrelated to the chalcopyrite and silica-dolomite alteration. The two orebodies are situated on the west dipping limb of the Mount Isa Fold, which formed during the third period of regional deformation (D 3). There are two main structural controls that localised the copper bearing hydrothermal fluids: (1) The basement contact fault is a large scale regional fault that has been affected by all three regional deformation periods. It separates the Urquhart Shale (orebody host sequence) from the older Eastern Creek Volcanics. The position of D 3 related flexures in the basement contact fault are a major control on the localisation of copper mineralisation and possibly of cobalt mineralisation. (2) Bedding parallel shear zones and associated splay shear zones form an anastomosing network within the orebodies. The orientation of bedding and faults, and indicators that bedding plane slip was an important process, suggest that the shear zones formed towards the latter stages of development of the Mount Isa Fold and that the shear zone geometry strongly influenced the position of the orebodies. The bedding parallel shear zones were pathways for the hydrothermal fluids, especially in the up-dip direction. They have a strong influence on local variations in copper distribution. The shear zones flatten in dip towards the basement contact fault and propagate from D 3 flexures. The shear zone networks are most extensively developed in the more <b>laminated</b> <b>sections</b> of the. original stratigraphy, and occur as contacts between different layers variously affected by the carbonate and silica bearing hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
