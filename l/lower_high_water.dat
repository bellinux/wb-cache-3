50|$|A beaver dam has {{a certain}} amount of {{freeboard}} above the water level. When heavy rains occur, the river or lake fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of {{the surface of the water}} table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their head waters have <b>lower</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> and higher low water levels.|$|E

Vertical transects in the same block, facing north, east, west, and south (<all with the same wave exposure) were denuded and later sampled by analyzing the species composition and estimating the density of the cover- sometimes quantitatively as chlorophyll content. Daily tidal curves were calculated and records of the daylight hours of clear and overcast skies were made. The upper limit of the diatom cover, the vertical species pattern, and the species present depended principally on the time exposed to direct sunlight during emergence and, thcre-fore, on the sky conditions and position of the sun during low water.

Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition.

40|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Hong Kong Island {{are one of}} the most {{extensively}} urbanized areas in the world. Groundwater samples in natural slopes and developed spaces in the regions centered by the Mid-Levels area, Hong Kong Island, were collected and analyzed to investigate the natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the groundwater chemistry. The results presented may be of value to other coastal areas in the world for the identification of possible groundwater contamination sources. Groundwater samples in the natural slopes were in low total dissolved solid (TDS) (< 100 mg/l), indicating that the waters were in the early evolutionary stage. Using chloride as a normalizing factor, the "non-marine" components of different major ions in the samples were calculated. The correlation analysis indicated the occurrence of weathering of plagioclase feldspars in the natural slopes. However, the breakdown of biotite and K-feldspar seems to be limited by short groundwater residence time and high resistance to weathering. The high variety in hydrochemical facies may suggest the presence of extremely heterogeneous subsurface geological conditions. In the developed spaces, groundwater samples exhibited a high range of TDS (∼ 100 - 5300 mg/l) and were mainly dominated by Na-Cl and Na-Ca-Cl water types. Besides water-rock interactions, the groundwater chemistry was significantly affected by leakage from service pipes and the dissolution of concrete materials. Some chemicals were used as signatures to identify the leakage from various service pipes. The area generally suffered from widespread, but small amount of leakages, and no obvious leakage was discovered. The strong correlations among major cations and chloride suggested that even a small amount of leakage from salty flushing water pipes can significantly affect the groundwater chemistry. Groundwater is found to be highly aggressive toward concrete as supported by three commonly used aggressiveness indices. Additional Ca 2 + may be released to groundwater by corrosion of subsurface concrete materials such as building foundations and basements. The strength of those subsurface engineering structures may be weakened. Besides, excess Ca 2 + may deposit in the dewatering systems in the area, which may affect their performance in <b>lowering</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> tables. The findings regarding leakage from service pipes will be useful for various government organizations such as the Water Supplies Department and Drainage Services Department.

40|$|I {{completed}} {{atmospheric transport}} modeling studies into distributions of subtropical water vapor, {{to identify the}} mechanisms by which humidity varies over distinct temporal scales: inter-annual time-scales associated with the El Nino – Southern Oscillation, over the next century in response to global warming, and over periods of about 2 to 7 days. The latter study on 2 to 7 day variability is a modeling component of a field campaign from October – November, 2008, involving continuous in-situ measurement of water vapor stable isotope compositions at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. These studies were conducted from a last saturation perspective, considering humidity and water vapor isotope composition of sub-saturated air to have effectively been set by the conditions at which the air parcels last encountered saturation. During El Nino northern winter, the free troposphere over the subtropical north Pacific is both drier and warmer than during La Nina. For instance, during El Nino (La Nina) northern winter, 57 % (49 %) of the air at 20 ˚N and 633 hPa over the north Pacific was last saturated poleward of 20 ˚N and above 500 hPa. ENSO humidity variability can be {{explained in terms of}} changes in the location of last saturation, and not by changes in the temperature field. Modeled specific humidity at the subtropical relative humidity minimum is projected to increase by about 0. 2 - 0. 3 g/kg, {{by the end of this}} century, in the simulations completed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4). Most of this projected increase can be attributed to last saturation within what will be a warmer free troposphere. The increase in specific humidity is partially offset by a poleward and upward shift of baroclinic instability and saturation patterns that effectively yield drier air to the RH minimum via isentropic transport. Two to 7 day variability of nighttime water vapor δD values at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, range from - 365 ‰ to - 137 ‰. Last saturation of air at Mauna Loa Observatory occurs primarily in the extra-tropical middle-upper troposphere, along mid-latitude baroclinic zones, and secondarily near Hawaii within mesoscale convective systems. Two to 7 day periods of <b>lower</b> (<b>higher)</b> <b>water</b> vapor δD values at MLO correspond to extra-tropical (near-Hawaii) last saturation.

The SPMW is fed by subtropical and subpolar waters advected by the branches of the North-Atlantic Current. The SPMW acquires its properties when its source waters enter the winter mixed layer in the Iceland Basin. The SPMW temperature variability is mainly explained by variations of the relative contributions of the subtropical and subpolar water transports to the total transport. Compared to the 1966 - 2004 mean, <b>lower</b> (<b>higher)</b> subtropical <b>water</b> relative transport ontribution leads to colder (warmer) SPMW in the early 1990 s (in the late 1960 s and late 1990 s). The intensity of the winter convection in the Iceland basin also influences the SPMW temperature through the amount of relatively cold intermediate waters of subtropical origin integrated in the SPMW layer. Strong convection partly explains the cold SPMW of the early 1990 s. The large increase in the SPMW temperature in the late 1990 s is due to both a decrease in the winter convection and an increase in the relative transport of the subtropical waters...|$|R

In one of the oldest, erg deposits, the ~ 2. 0 Ga Makgabeng Formation, facies association changes reflect {{one of the earliest}} recordings of short-term climatic shifts in a continental setting. The Makgabeng Formation is separated into lower and upper erg deposits by a playa or saline pan deposit. The lower erg deposit consists of dune sets with thin lenses of dry and deflationary interdunes that transitions vertically to thicker damp to wet interdunes. A laterally persistent playa deposit {{in the middle of the}} section consists of mudstone with deep and shallow penetrating mud cracks and subordinate siltstone and sandstone interbeds. Above this lower mudstone interval, the playa strata are sandy. Overlying the playa deposit, the upper erg deposit consists of thick eolian sets with thin lenses of dry interdune deposits. Grain size change near the top of the upper erg deposit corresponds to the appearance of fluvial, sheet flood, eolian cross-beds sculpted by mass flows, and thin playa deposits. The vertical facies association demonstrates shifts in precipitation and fluctuating water tables. Fluvial and playa deposits record <b>high</b> <b>water</b> tables whereas low-water tables are reflected in the core erg. The transition from a <b>lower</b> to <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> table is recorded by wet interdune interspersed within the dune strata towards the top of this interval.

As such, short-term inundation may be more beneficial to Missouri River benthic invertebrate (mainly chironomid larvae) and zooplankton production than more prolonged inundation lasting a month or more. Furthermore, restoration projects may be designed at elevations allowing more short-term inundation, which would likely benefit native fishes with additional spawning, nursery, and foraging habitat. Levee setbacks may be an effective restoration option for {{increasing the amount of}} habitat available for short-term inundation while potentially providing socioeconomic, flood-risk reduction benefits by enhancing flow conveyance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Field crop {{production}} at paddy field is great concern {{due to the}} declining of rice consumption and low crop self-sufficiency ratio in Korea. Groundwater management system will make optimal soil conditions and crop growth possible. The present study was evaluated the effect of groundwater management practice on soil characteristics including soil water distribution and soybean growth at paddy field. Methods: Groundwater management system was installed with two drain spacing (3 m & 6 m) at silt loam field at the experimental station in National Institute of Crop Science, Korea. It was managed with two ground water level (0. 3 m & 0. 6 m) during the growing season. Results: The depth of groundwater table was significantly influenced on drainage amount from the soil profile through the drains. Soil water content, electrical conductivity and plant available nitrogen content in soil was significantly greater with 0. 3 m water table management plot compared to 0. 6 m plot and the control. At the vegetative stage chlorophyll concentration was significantly <b>lower</b> with <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> table control, but it was recovered at the post-flowering stage. Soybean yield was increased with groundwater management system and soybean yield with 6 M drain spacing and 0. 6 m water table level was 3. 38 ton/ha, which was 50 % greater compared to the control. Discussions: Groundwater management system directly influenced on drainage amounts, which significantly delayed the infiltration rate and nutrient loss. These results are comparable to other researches, which reported that the reductions of drain flow and nutrient loss are the major mechanism to better crop development. Conclusion: The {{results of this study}} indicate that groundwater management system can influence on soil characteristics and it is an important practice of high yielding soybean production at paddy field, which should be considered crop development stages for stable {{crop production}}...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} re-vegetation on soil {{moisture}} dynamics was investigated by comparing five land cover types. Soil moisture and temperature variations under grass (Andropogon), subshrub (Artemisia scoparia), shrub (Spiraea pubescens), tree (Robinia pseudoacacia), and crop (Zea mays) vegetation were monitored {{in an experiment}} performed {{during the growing season}} of 2011. There were more than 10 soil moisture pulses during the period of data collection, and the surface soil moisture of all of the land cover types showed an increasing trend. Corn cover was associated with consistently higher soil moisture readings than the other surfaces. Grass and subshrubs showed an intermediate moisture level, with that of grass being slightly higher than that of subshrub most of the time. Shrubs and trees were characterized by lower soil moisture readings, with the shrub levels consistently being slightly higher than those of the trees. With the exception of the corn land cover type, the average soil temperature showed the same regime as the average moisture content, but exhibiting a downward trend throughout the observation period. Three typical decreasing periods were chosen to compare the differences in water losses. In periods of both relatively <b>lower</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> soil moisture contents, subshrubs lost the largest amount of water. The daily water loss associated with corn was most variable. The tree and shrub sites presented an intermediate level, with that of tree being slightly higher compared to shrub; the daily water loss trends of these two land cover types were similar and were more stable than those of the other types. The amount of water loss related to the grass land cover type is determined by the initial moisture content. Soil under subshrubs acquired and retained soil moisture resources more efficiently than the other cover types, representing an adaptive vegetation type in this area...|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{was used}} to study the conformational changes of the polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer, Pluronic P 104, in a large concentration range in a polymer-water system {{as a function of}} temperature. The melt in which the conformational transition of the PEO blocks occurs gives remarkable changes in the spectral behavior. A small amount of water in Pluronic P 104 can induce the PEO block amorphism. The addition of more water only swells the PEO dominant region and gives {{no significant difference in the}} conformational structure of the block copolymer in the ordered phases of Pluronic P 104 -water mixtures. The PPO blocks of Pluronic P 104 are hydrated only in a condition of <b>lower</b> temperature and <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> content. The temperature dependent micellization of Pluronic P 104 in water was analyzed by a FTIR spectroscopic method. The appearance of the symmetric deformation band of the anhydrous methyl groups at temperature below the CMT indicates the existence of a hydrophobic microenvironment. The appearance of the symmetric deformation band of the hydrated methyl groups at higher temperatures indicates that the micellar core must contain some amount of water. The results of FTIR data show that the proportion of the anhydrous methyl groups increases and water content in the micellar core decreases during the micellization process.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of BRIOS (Bremerhaven Ice Ocean Simulations) a coupled ice-ocean model of the Southern Ocean was adapted to investigate the variability of the ice-ocean system in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean with a particular focus on the factors affecting dense water formation on the Ross Sea continental shelf. The sea ice regimes in the western and eastern Ross Sea were shown to be decoupled from each other with sea ice characteristics in the western Ross Sea determined predominantly by the local atmospheric conditions {{and those in the}} eastern Ross Sea by ice import from the Amundsen Sea. The resulting strong gradient in sea ice formation provides the thermohaline driving force for the shelf circulation. The cooling, salt input and subsequent deep convection during the seasonal cycle modifies the waters of the shelf inflow so that their density is sufficient participate in Antarctic Bottom Water formation. Model results show that the region around Ross Island and McMurdo Sound has a key role in controlling the exchange between the ice shelf cavity and the open ocean in the Ross Sea. Drainage of <b>High</b> Salinity Shelf <b>Water</b> through McMurdo Sound into the cavity in winter prevents brine accumulation and thus <b>lowers</b> <b>High</b> Salinity Shelf <b>Water</b> salinities to the range observed. This also affects the balance of Ice Shelf <b>Water</b> and <b>High</b> Salinity Shelf <b>Water,</b> the two parent water masses for the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water in the Ross Sea. The interannual variability of dense water characteristics is, however, predominantly controlled by variations in the shelf inflow through a sub-surface salinity and a deep temperature signal whose origin can be traced into the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The temperature anomalies are induced in the western Bellingshausen Sea where the meridional transport of Circumpolar Deep Water causes temperature anomalies at the continental shelf break...|$|R
40|$|The {{tensile force}} {{existing}} in the pericarp {{of a growing}} citrus (Citrus sinensis) fruit 17 to 19 centimeters in circumference was sufficiently high to cause a 3 % shrinkage of the pericarp when it was excised. When a fruit was cut along the equator to the central axis, shrinkage of the pericarp resulted {{in the formation of}} a wedge-shaped gap at the cut. Stretch modulus of the pericarp was determined by measuring the force required to stretch excised strips of tissue to 1 % longer than their excised length. Measurements were made on successive layers of pericarp tissue 5 millimeters wide and 1 millimeter thick taken from the fruit equator. All layers required more force for extension at <b>lower</b> temperatures and <b>high</b> <b>water</b> potentials than at high temperatures and low water potentials. The stretch modulus ranged from 0. 88 to 2. 16 kilograms per square millimeter depending upon the layer, temperature, and water potential. The inner layers, consisting primarily of mesocarp, had stretch moduli only 60 to 70 % as great as the outer layer which consisted of exocarp tissue. Measurements of the stretch modulus of tissues from the pericarp support the hypothesis that changes in the tension existing in the pericarp depend upon conditions in the pericarp and are not related to changes in volume or pressure in the juice vesicles...|$|R
40|$|The prevalence, {{number of}} species affected, and {{geographical}} extent of coral diseases have been increasing worldwide. We present ecological data on the coral disease Porites bleaching with tissue loss (PBTL) from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu (Hawaii, USA), affecting P. compressa. This disease is prevalent throughout the year, although it shows spatio-temporal variability with peak prevalence during the warmer summer months. Temporal variability in disease prevalence showed a strong positive relationship with elevated water temperature. Spatially, PBTL prevalence peaked in clearer <b>waters</b> (<b>lower</b> turbidity) with <b>higher</b> <b>water</b> flow and <b>higher</b> densities of parrotfish, together explaining approximately 26 % of the spatial variability in PBTL prevalence. However, the relatively poor performance of the spatial model suggests that other, unmeasured factors {{may be more important}} in driving spatial prevalence. PBTL was not transmissible through direct contact or the water column in controlled aquaria experiments, suggesting that this disease may not be caused by a pathogen, is not highly infectious, or perhaps requires a vector for transmission. In general, PBTL results in partial tissue mortality of affected colonies; on average, one-third of the tissue is lost. This disease can affect the same colonies repeatedly, suggesting a potential for progressive damage which could cause increased tissue loss over time. P. compressa is the main framework-building species in Kaneohe Bay; PBTL therefore has the potential to negatively impact the structure of the reefs at this location...|$|R
