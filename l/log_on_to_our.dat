DMSAs after UTI—scan more children, not less EDITOR,—Deshpande and Verrier Jones have recently concluded that it is not worth under-taking dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans in children over 1 year of age who present with a “simple ” urinary tract infection (UTI). 1 Their argument has three strands. First, they interpret their data as indicating a very low chance of children over 1 year having a renal scar, especially if the UTI is diagnosed by a general practitioner at home rather than in hospital. Second, they argue that subjecting children to DMSA scanning is financially and emotionally very costly. Third, they feel there is little value in identifying renal scars. We disagree with all three points...|$|E

Infantile colic and chiropractic spinal manipulation EDITOR,—We congratulate Olafsdottir et al on their article. 1 The sum of the evidence on spi-nal manipulative therapy (SMT) in the treat-ment of infantile colic now is that there are 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the subject. Two RCTs demonstrated a significant positive eVect of SMT, 2 3 and 1 RCT was unable to demonstrate any treatment eVect. 1 The reasons for this discrepancy are not known, but Olafsdottir et al suggest that their finding of no eVect of SMTmay be due to the blinding of the infants ’ mothers. Another equally likely explanation could be that we are witnessing a dose response phenomenon. In their trial, Olafsdottir et al used a treat-ment protocol of a maximum of 3 sessions of SMT, whereas the other 2 RCTs, which found a positive treatment eVect, used a treatment protocol relying more on the treat-ing chiropractor’s clinical judgement. This more pragmatic approach resulted in 64 % of the infants in one RCT receiving 4 or more sessions of SMT (with a maximum of 7), 2 and the majority of infants in the other RCT receiving up to 6 sessions. 3 We believe that this dose response problem should be addressed in future trials of SMT for infantile colic...|$|E

Sedation versus general anaesthesia for MRI scanning in children EDITOR,—We read with interest the article concerning the sedation of children for mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI), 1 and would like to support Dr Bray’s view that general anaesthesia is a safer and more reliable method of managing children undergoing this procedure. In our trust we have a large number of children undergoing MRI scanning, the great majority of whom have general anaesthesia. We have three or four planned half day general anaesthesia sessions per week, all covered by a consultant paediatric anaesthet-ist. We do still occasionally sedate patients when they require a short scan; because of the urgency {{it is not possible to}} schedule them into a fixed general anaesthesia session. Previously, we relied mainly on sedation techniques, but found a large failure rate due to restless patients moving during the scan. In fact, since general anaesthesia has superseded sedation, the quality of scan has markedly improved and scan times have been reduced. For patients undergoing cardiac MRI scans, periods of breath holding are required during several scan sequences; this would be impossible to achieve unless the patient was paralysed and ventilated...|$|E

You sometimes hear people saying that senior house officers (SHOs) in emergency depart-ments are not what they used to be. We studied data collected over a five year period (1996 – 2001) on the number of patients seen by all SHOs who completed a six month post in our A&E department. The 118 SHOs (62 male and 56 female) worked a full shift rota averaging 52 hours per week. The influence of the sex of the doctor and their future career plan on the num-ber of patients they saw was also assessed. The number of patients seen by each SHO in six months ranged from 1069 to 2659 (mean 1774, SD 346). On average the SHOs working between August 1996 and January 1999 saw 154 more patients than those working between February 1999 and July 2001 (p= 0. 015; unpaired t test). Male SHOs saw on average 217. 5 patients (range 1121 to 2659) more than female SHOs (range 1069 to 2644) (p= 0. 001; unpaired t test). The med-ian number of patients seen by SHOs with a surgical interest was 1831 (interquartile range 1624 to 2024), and by those with a medi-cal one was 1684 (interquartile range 1497 t...|$|E

Imaging the less seriously head injured child EDITOR,—I read with interest the recent paper by Glasgow and McGovern which sug-gested that bruising with a yellow hue suggests that injury occurred at least 48 hours earlier. 1 Unfortunately, this statement is not referenced. However, I am aware of three papers on the age and colour of bruising. 2 – 4 Langlois and Gresham 4 studied the colour changes of bruises with time and found it was possible to conclude only that a bruise with a yellow colour was more than 18 hours old. The significance of the appearance of other colours in terms of estimating the time of occurrence was not helpful. Stevenson and Bialas 2 also found that aging of bruises was much less precise than text books imply and found that green or yellow hues suggest an injury that is at least 24 – 48 hours old. Finally, Schwartz and Ricci 3 concluded that the available literature does not permit the estimation of a bruise’s age from colour with any precision. I should be grateful to know if Glasgow and McGovern found any further research to assist them in aging bruises as I make a par-ticular point of urging extreme caution on statements which specify the age of injuries based on their colouring when I teach child protection and when I write medicolegal reports...|$|E
40|$|On World Heart Day, 29 September 2011, the Public Health Agency {{is urging}} all smokers {{to stop smoking}} and reduce their risk of {{developing}} heart disease (cardiovascular disease - CVD) or suffering a stroke or a heart attack. Heart disease {{is one of the}} leading causes of death and illness in the UK. Research shows that smoking is one of the main contributors of the disease, causing around 25, 000 deaths a year in the UK. Cigarette smokers are two times more likely than non-smokers to suffer a heart attack. The majority of people who suffer a heart attack before the age of 50 are smokers. Cigarette smoke causes heart disease by:Â· reducing oxygen to the heart;Â· increasing blood pressure and heart rate;Â· increasing blood clotting;Â· damaging cells that line coronary arteries and other blood vessels, causing narrowing of the arteries. From the moment smoke reaches your lungs, your heart is forced to work harder. Your pulse quickens, forcing your heart to beat an extra 10 to 25 times per minute, as many as 36, 000 additional times per day. Because of the irritating effect of nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke, your heartbeat is more likely to be irregular. This can contribute to cardiac arrhythmia and many other serious coronary conditions, such as heart attack. For smokers who already suffer from heart problems, quitting will dramatically help. Many heart patients notice an almost immediate improvement when they stop smoking. Often, they need less medication and can cope better with physical exertion. Gerry Bleakney, Head of Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement, PHA, said: "Smoking is one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease and smokers are almost twice as likely to have a heart attackas someone who has never smoked. One in every two long-term smokers will die prematurely from smoking-related diseases, many suffer very poor health before they die. However one year after successfully quitting smoking, an individual will have reduced their risk of having a heart attack to half that of a person continuing to smoke. "Across Northern Ireland, there are over 600 support services for people who wish to stop smoking, based in GP surgeries, community pharmacies, hospitals, community centres and workplaces. I would encourage everyone who is thinking about quitting to <b>log</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Want 2 Stop website: www. want 2 stop. info and order a 2 ̆ 7 Quit Kit 2 ̆ 7 free of charge alternatively contact the Smokers 2 ̆ 7 Helpline on 0808 812 8008. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, 31, 574 {{people were}} {{registered}} as having Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Northern Ireland. The {{most common cause}} of COPD is smoking and to mark this year 2 ̆ 7 s World COPD day, which takes place on Wednesday 16 November, the Public Health Agency is encouraging all smokers to make a decision to stop smoking today and reduce their risk of developing the disease. COPD refers to a group of diseases which includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and in some cases asthma. With COPD, the airways in the lungs become damaged, causing them to become narrower, therefore restricting airflow and thus making it harder to breathe. The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness, wheezing, abnormal sputum (a mix of saliva and mucus in the airway), and a chronic cough often mistaken for a 2 ̆ 7 smokers 2 ̆ 7 cough 2 ̆ 7. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending upon how advanced the disease is. In advanced cases, daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of stairs, can become very difficult. There is no cure for COPD. Stopping smoking is the single most effective wayto reduce your risk of developing COPD and avoid any further damage to the lungs. Gerry Bleakney, Head of Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement, PHA, said: "Smoking causes the lining of the airways to become inflamed and damaged and is the biggest cause of COPD. The risk of developing COPD increases the more an individual smokes and the longer they smoke. "The good news is that making changes to your lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing COPD. Stopping smoking reduces the risk of developing COPD and also slows down its progression. There is support available to help you quit and I would encourage everyone thinking about stopping smoking to <b>log</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Want 2 Stop website www. want 2 stop. info and order a 2 ̆ 7 Quit Kit 2 ̆ 7 free of charge. Alternatively contact the Smokers 2 ̆ 7 Helpline on 0808 812 8008 for help on planning to stop smoking or to find out where your nearest Stop Smoking Service is. "The Health Minister Edwin Poots said: "The impact of living with COPD can place a considerable strain on the lives of those suffering from the condition and their families. I understand that most smokers want to quit but it is not always easy to succeed and that several attempts are frequently necessary. I would therefore urge all smokers on world COPD day, to make that commitment to stop smoking. Professional help and support are readily available. There are almost 650 smoking cessation services provided all over Northern Ireland, mostly in community pharmacies, but also in GP surgeries, hospitals, community halls and schools. ...|$|E

40|$|Mouth cancer {{awareness}} week {{begins on}} the 13 - 20 November. With {{this in mind}} the Public Health Agency is urging everyone {{to be aware of}} the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and is encouraging all smokers thinking about stopping smoking to make the decision to stop today. In Northern Ireland 195 people were diagnosed with mouth cancer in 2009. The disease causes one death every five hours in the UK and yet it is one of the least well-known cancers. Smoking and excess alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of developing mouth cancer, which can occur in or on any part of the mouth, tongue, lips, neck and throat. In its very early stages, mouth cancer can be easy to ignore. Most people with mouth cancer have no early symptoms at all, but others may have:an ulcer in the mouth or on the lip that won 2 ̆ 7 t heal; constant pain or soreness; red or white patches in the mouth;a lump on the lip, tongue or in the neck; bad breath; unexplained bleeding in the mouth; numbness in the mouth; loose teeth. The earlier the disease is caught, the better. Survival rates rise to 90 per cent if the cancer is treated before it has spread. Gerry Bleakney, Head of Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement, PHA, said: "Certain lifestyle choices can increase an individual 2 ̆ 7 s risk of developing mouth cancer. Tobacco is considered to be the main cause of mouth cancer, with three in four cases being linked to smoking. Excess alcohol consumption is also a known factor, with those who both smoke and drink excessively being up 30 times more likely to be at risk. "Mouth cancer and the treatment required can be traumatic for the patient as this may affect functions such as speech, chewing and swallowing. The positive news is that stopping smoking is associated with a rapid reduction in the risk of oral cancers. Regular trips to the dentist are also a must because half of all mouth cancer cases are detected by dentists. "I would encourage everyone who is thinking about quitting to <b>log</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Want 2 Stop website www. want 2 stop. info and order a 2 ̆ 7 Quit Kit 2 ̆ 7 free of charge. Alternatively contact the Smokers 2 ̆ 7 Helpline on 0808 812 8008. "Health Minister Edwin Poots said: "Smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and premature death in Northern Ireland. It is a major risk factor for oral cancer, as well as coronary heart disease, strokes and other diseases of the circulatory system. Approximately 2, 300 people die each year in Northern Ireland from smoking related illnesses. Quitting smoking is the single most effective step people can take to improve their long term health. "A key objective of the Department 2 ̆ 7 s new ten-year tobacco control strategy, due to be published next month,is to prevent people from starting to smoke. Funding provided by the Department for smoking cessation services has resulted in around 650 such services being made available in Northern Ireland in a range of settings, including pharmacies, GP surgeries and community centres. These services have helped almost 80, 000 smokers to set a quit date between 2008 / 09 and 2010 / 11. "The Minister added: "It is also important for people to look after their oral health by regularly attending the dentist for check-ups, as any problems can be picked up and treated at an early stage. ...|$|E
