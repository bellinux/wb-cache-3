5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much <b>later</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15th century, {{by that time}} the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
5|$|At the {{following}} iPPV, 11th Anniversary Show on March 2, 2013, Hardy joined the villainous S.C.U.M. stable.

50|$|Heroldsberg's history {{goes back}} to <b>the</b> 11th {{hundreds}} <b>in</b> which it was founded as an administrative base for <b>the</b> German emperor. <b>Later</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> 1391 <b>the</b> territory was sold to the patrician family Geuder in whose possession it was for over 400 years. It was them who built the four manors and the fortified church at the village's market square.|$|R
5|$|From 1723 to 1733, Fort Manoel {{was built}} on Manoel Island in Marsamxett Harbour, so as to protect Valletta's western flank. The Baroque fort is square in shape, with four corner bastions. It was the last major fort to be built with the bastioned trace in Malta. The Order's last major {{fortification}} in the harbour area was Fort Tigné, built at Tigné Point between 1793 and 1795. It was built to protect the entrance of Marsamxett, along with Fort Saint Elmo. The fort's architecture {{is very different from}} the Order's earlier forts, and although very small by 18th century standards, it has been described as among the most revolutionary and influential of Malta's fortifications as it is a very early example of a polygonal fort. Many other polygonal forts were built by the British <b>later</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, the Ottomans {{attacked}} {{again in}} the Great Siege of Malta. Fort Saint Elmo fell after fierce fighting (in which the Ottoman general Dragut Reis was killed), but the knights held out in Birgu and Senglea until a relief force arrived. By {{the end of the}} siege, most of the fortifications had been destroyed in the attacks, so they were rebuilt. The Grand Master, Jean Parisot de Valette, decided to build a new fortified capital on the Sciberras Peninsula. The first stone of the new city was laid down in 1566, and it was called Valletta. The city walls, which were constructed mainly in the 1560s and 1570s, remain largely intact to this day, and they include bastions, cavaliers, counterguards and a ditch. The ruined Fort Saint Elmo was rebuilt and integrated into the city walls. The area around St Elmo was strengthened a number of times <b>later</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, especially by the building of the Carafa Enceinte in 1687.|$|E
5|$|In 1595, Sigismund Báthory staged an {{elaborate}} plot and had Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, removed from power. István Jósika (Báthory's chancellor and an ethnic Romanian) masterminded the operation. Ștefan Răzvan arrested Aron {{on charges of}} treason {{on the night of}} 24 April (5 May) and sent him to the Transylvanian capital at Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) with his family and treasure. Aron would die poisoned by the end of May in the castle of Vinc. Sigismund was forced to justify his actions before the European powers, since Aron had played {{an active role in the}} anti-Ottoman coalition. <b>Later</b> <b>on,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same city of Alba Iulia, Wallachian boyars signed a treaty with Sigismund on Michael's behalf. From the point of view of Wallachian internal politics, the Treaty of Alba Iulia officialized what could be called a boyar regime, reinforcing the already important political power of the noble elite. According to the treaty, a council of 12 great boyars was to take part alongside the voivode in the executive rule of the country.|$|E
50|$|From the 17th-19th centuries, {{the area}} was {{administered}} by the Khans of the Qajar tribes which were of Turkic origin, under the Safavids, Afsharids, and Qajar Iranians, while Armenians had autonomy under the immediate jurisdiction of the melik of Erevan. <b>Later</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> 1828, <b>the</b> administrative khanate was dissolved and {{became a part of}} the Russian Empire as an outcome of the Treaty of Turkmenchay.|$|R

On 31 October, his agent, Roger Wittman, {{confirmed}} that Rodríguez and Wolfsburg had opened contract talks to extend his current deal beyond 2016. Rodríguez scored twice in Wolfsburg's 3–0 win away to Lille on 11 December, a result which advanced his side into the Europa League knockout stage instead of their opponents. In January 2015, he signed a new contract up to June 2019. He scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot on 7 April, as Wolfsburg defeated SC Freiburg to reach the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal, also making a goalline clearance <b>later</b> <b>on.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final on 30 May, he played the full 90 minutes as Wolfsburg won their first cup, defeating Borussia Dortmund 3–1.|$|E
