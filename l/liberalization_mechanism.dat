40|$|The {{success of}} the Chinese {{economic}} reforms has been linked by many observers {{to the implementation of}} a dual track <b>liberalization</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This approach, relying upon the continued enforcement of existing contracts and the simultaneous creation of a free market sector, represents a powerful mechanism in economic reform. If not anticipated, it implements an outcome that is both Pareto improving and e?ciency enhancing as compared to the status quo. When the reform is instead anticipated, intertemporal arbitrage arises, potentially undermining these properties. Only when the original policy involves both price setting and quantity restrictions can anticipated dual track liberalization maintain its attractiveness. While these conditions correspond well to the circumstances faced by transition economies, our analysis invites some caution as for the further applicability of the Chinese approach to economic reform.

Even though China will have a stake in maintaining trade openness, an initiative that builds on but redefi nes the Doha Agenda would anchor China more fully in the multilateral trading system. Such an initiative would have two pillars. First, a new negotiating agenda that would include the major issues of interest to China and its trading partners, and thus unleash the powerful reciprocal <b>liberalization</b> <b>mechanism</b> that has driven the WTO process to previous successes.

40|$|There is an {{inherent}} contradiction between the regional integration projects in Latin America, albeit rhetorically conducted, and the staunch defense by most countries {{of their national}} sovereignty, which restricts and opposes many <b>liberalization</b> <b>mechanisms</b> implicit in, and necessary to, the integration processes, based on the rendition of sovereignty {{in some areas of}} economic relevance, including, and especially, trade and industrial policies, as well as other sectorial measures. The dilemma is historically compounded by a juridical tradition that places the retraction into an introverted version of the sovereignty principle into the context of conceptual elaborations well known in the international law, such as Calvo doctrine and the Drago principle. Brazil {{is one of the most}} resolute promoters of the national sovereignty principle among Latin American countries, clearly expressed in its constitutional chart and foreign policy stances, since the Second Hague peace conference of 1907. Other Latin American countries, mainly in Central America and the Caribbean, are much more motivated by real concerns over recurrent United States interventionism in the regional, in some cases by military means. This framework has somewhat infringed on integration projects, which is also hindered by economic nationalism and state interventionism...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s {{the idea}} that capital account <b>liberalization</b> {{represented}} a <b>mechanism</b> for disciplining the conduction of the monetary policy {{in the search for}} price stability was developed. Based on this argument a new version of Gruben e McLeod's (2001) model and an empirical analysis were made for the Brazilian case with the objective of evaluating if the increase in the capital account liberalization after the introduction of the Real Plan contributed to price stability. The findings denote that an increase in the capital account liberalization is capable of attenuating inflationary pressure. Notwithstanding, the relation found is valid only in the short run. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model {{to analyze the}} "dual-track" approach to market <b>liberalization</b> as a <b>mechanism</b> for implementing efficient Pareto-improving economic reform, that is, reform achieving efficiency without creating losers. The approach, based on the continued enforcement of the existing plan while simultaneously liberalizing the market, {{can be understood as}} a method for making implicit lump sum transfers to compensate potential losers of the reform. The model highlights the critical roles of enforcement of the plan for achieving Pareto improvement and full liberalization of the market track for achieving efficiency. We examine how the dual-track approach has worked in product and labor market liberalization in China. ...|$|R

40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} impact of short-term real interest rate on growth rate in India in a liberalized financial and trade regime (March 1993 to March 2005). Using ARDL approach to cointegration of Pesaran and Shin (1999), the study finds that interest rate {{does not have a}} direct impact; rather, it may have an indirect and adverse impact on growth rate through the transmission channel of bank credit, thereby neither supporting the arguments advocated by Keynesians nor the explanations offered by the proponents of Financial Liberalization School. This incredible result may be attributed to the poor quality of credit disbursal of the banking system in India or low credit offtake for productive investment purposes as investment, an important determinant of economic growth, is governed by several other factors.

40|$|Immigrant {{citizenship}} {{rights in}} the nation-state reference both theories of cross-national convergence and the resilience of national political processes. This article investigates European countries' attribution of rights to immigrants: Have these rights become more inclusive and more similar across countries? Are they affected by EU membership, {{the role of the}} judiciary, the party in power, the size of the immigrant electorate, or pressure exerted by anti-immigrant parties? Original data on 10 European countries, 1980 - 2008, reveal no evidence for cross-national convergence. Rights tended to become more inclusive until 2002, but stagnated afterward. Electoral changes drive these trends: growth of the immigrant electorate led to expansion, but countermobilization by right-wing parties slowed or reversed <b>liberalizations.</b> These electoral <b>mechanisms</b> are in turn shaped by long-standing policy traditions, leading to strong path dependence and the reproduction of preexisting cross-national differences. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

The liberalization of the electricity supply market in Portugal has raised some discussion on whether consumers will benefit, or if this good will be of more difficult access. In this dissertation, {{the goal is to}} answer the question: “What should happen to the regulated supply market of electricity?” In order to properly answer the question, and after a characterization of the Portuguese electricity system, the liberalization processes of Spain and the United Kingdom were analyzed, as to withdraw some conclusions and apply it to Portugal. The outcome was that the Portuguese market is not ready for full <b>liberalization,</b> and a <b>mechanism</b> is required in order to protect consumers from possible price increases. This mechanism is similar to the structure used in Spain, and could provide both the benefits of competition in the market, and the desired protection to the ultimate stakeholders who must benefit from this situation: consumers...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how financial, trade, {{institutional}} and political liberalization policies have affected financial sector competition in Africa using updated data to appraise second generation reforms. The ‘freedom to trade’ and ‘economic freedom’ indices are employed. Hitherto, unexplored financial sector concepts of formalization, semi-formalization, informalization and non-formalization are also introduced. The following findings are established. Firstly, relative to money supply: (1) {{with the exception}} of the economic freedom <b>mechanism,</b> <b>liberalization</b> policies have generally decreased the growth of the formal financial sector to the benefit of other financial sectors; (2) apart from the foreign direct investment and economic freedom channels, liberalization policies have been fruitful for semi-formal financial development at the cost of other financial sectors and; (3) {{with the exception of}} economic freedom, both the informal and non-formal sectors have developed owing to liberalization to the detriment of the formal financial sector. Secondly, relative to GDP, the semi-formal, informal and/or non-formal financial sectors have also generally improved as a result of liberalization. Policy implications are discussed. ...|$|R

However, the South Asian {{regional integration process}} is fraught with difficulties, especially {{due to a lack}} of understanding about the very economics of regional economic integration. Thus, this paper dwells upon some of the conceptual issues pertaining to regional economic cooperation in general and specific to the South Asian region. It also documents the progress made in SAARC, the SAFTA trade <b>liberalization</b> and associated <b>mechanisms</b> alongside the nature of safeguards provided for. In this respect, developmental perspectives of safeguards are put forth. Some fresh insights on the status of SAARC trade integration process in a dynamic setting are also brought out. The paper also highlights the potentials for deeper economic integration in the region. The paper further illustrates some of the areas wherein project-based cooperation is feasible in the region. Finally, the paper makes an objective assessment of the regional integration process and identifies certain policy-induced and structural constraints that have important policy-implications.

This paper presents evidence from highly disaggregated Chinese firm-product data that, given productivity, input tariff reductions induce an incumbent importer/exporter to increase product markups. We further investigate empirically the mechanisms underlying this trade liberalization effect, and find that input tariff reductions decrease marginal costs, and their effects on markup adjustments are more profound among firms with higher import dependence. Moreover, we exploit unique features of Chinese data by comparing results for two trade regimes: ordinary trade (wherein firms pay import tariffs to import) and processing trade (wherein firms {{are not subject to}} import tariffs). While the aforementioned trade <b>liberalization</b> effects and <b>mechanisms</b> only apply to ordinary trade, processing trade samples are used in a placebo test. The paper also shows that more productive firms charge higher markups for products. All these findings are robust to alternative markup measures including one estimate using physical-quantity output data, different production function specifications, a subsample consisting only of pure exporters, and estimations based on our theoretical derivations...|$|R
40|$|More {{than two}} decades, {{broadband}} {{has been recognized}} in the EU as having great benefits for economic and social development. This recognition {{is evident in the}} first EU policy document on the telecommunications market – the 1987 Green Paper – which assumed that harmonization and <b>liberalization</b> through competition <b>mechanisms</b> could be used as tools to bring all these benefits to European citizens. Although the policy emphasized the competition mechanism in the years that followed, many additional instruments were developed and implemented in order to make broadband available to all European citizens. Some of the instruments {{can be seen in the}} form of regulatory directives and some in more general policies. All of them make a considerable contribution to the growth of broadband deployment in the EU. However, with globalization, the policy impetus for broadband has shifted towards a means to increase the competitiveness of a nation or region. This changing emphasis, due to globalization and competitiveness, impacts the design of policy instruments. A question can be raised as to which instruments can serve as a new concept for future broadband policy. This paper presents an evolutionary concept for broadband policy in the EU by providing a conceptual framework for integrating the related broadband policy instruments.

However, the importance of broadband infrastructures is furthermore elevated in the context of an emerging information society representing a fundamental transformation of social and economic structures resulting from innovation in information and communication technologies. With globalization, the policy impetus for broadband has shifted towards a means to increase the competitiveness of a nation or region. In addition, concerns of sustainability have emerged as a central issue for the long-run development of modern societies, and questions have been raised about the role of broadband in this context. This changing emphasis, due to globalization, competitiveness, and sustainability, impacts the design of policy instruments. A question can be raised as to which instruments can serve a new concept for future broadband policy. This thesis aims to propose a conceptual framework for broadband policy that takes into account both traditional and new aspects of telecommunications sector in an information society by observing the empirical world, and analyzing literature and empirical studies. Particularly, this thesis presents an evolutionary concept for broadband policy in the EU by providing a model for integrating the related broadband policy instruments. A timeline of all the instruments and initiatives that are being implemented is explored.
