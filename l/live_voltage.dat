40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis was to lead two {{projects}} concerning <b>live</b> high <b>voltage</b> working. It {{has been}} proposed by RTE (Réseau de Transport d’Électricité, the French Transmission System Operator). <b>Live</b> high <b>voltage</b> working permits to carry out maintenance works without line or substation bay outage. Because it avoids losses in other lines or costs due to energy not supplied, live working is often worthwhile. In engineering units however, young engineers do not have much knowledge about live working and they ask therefore systematically for an outage {{when they have a}} work. To advertise live working, communication tools such as a guide have been elaborated during the thesis. Safety is the principal concern while carrying out live working. Particularly the working distances have to be respected at each moment. Hence work preparations are highly important. In order to visualise the working, drawings are done using a Computer Aided Design software called AutoCAD. Lots of actions have been done in order to make this very complete software easier for operatives who are not designers. They include the library updates, the writing of a graphic charter, the programming of a new library layout, the training specifications and lots of communication. The two projects have common points. At first they did not have precise specifications. As a consequence the chosen solutions are not the good or the bad ones. From an economical point of view, the two projects do not require a huge investment compared to what they could yield. From a technical point of view, both projects are feasible. Finally these projects will be developed in the coming year...|$|R

40|$|When Bon Scott died in London in 1980, AC/DC were on {{the brink}} of {{becoming}} the world's biggest rock band. As the lightning bolt of lyrical inspiration behind their songs and frontman for their high <b>voltage</b> <b>live</b> performances, Bon was already a legend. In death, he became the ultimate Australian rock icon. 'Highway to Hell' tells Bon Scott's story in two-fisted prose drawn from deep research and scores of interviews. It charts the long way to the top for a larrikin lad from Fremantle who rose out of the rubble of a primitive pop scene to become the voice of a generation - the raucous howl and mischievous glint in classic songs like 'TNT', 'Jailbreak', 'Let There Be Rock', 'Dirty Deeds' and 'Whole Lotta Rosie', which are still finding new fans to this day. Since it was first published to worldwide acclaim in 1994, Clinton Walker's 'Highway to Hell' has endured as the definitive book on Bon Scott and AC/DC.

40|$|AbstractAuxiliary β-subunits {{bound to}} the cytoplasmic α 1 -interaction domain of the pore-forming α 1 C-subunit are {{important}} modulators of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. The underlying mechanisms are not yet well understood. We investigated correlations between differential modulation of inactivation by β 1 a- and β 2 - subunits and structural responses of the channel to transition into distinct functional states. The NH 2 -termini of the α 1 C- and β-subunits were fused with cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins, and functionally coexpressed in COS 1 cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between them or with membrane-trapped probes was measured in <b>live</b> cells under <b>voltage</b> clamp. It was found that in the resting state, the tagged NH 2 -termini of the α 1 C- and β-subunit fluorophores are separated. Voltage-dependent inactivation generates strong FRET between α 1 C and β 1 a suggesting mutual reorientation of the NH 2 -termini, but their distance vis-à-vis the plasma membrane is not appreciably changed. These voltage-gated rearrangements were substantially reduced when the β 1 a-subunit was replaced by β 2. Differential β-subunit modulation of inactivation and of FRET between α 1 C and β were eliminated by inhibition of the slow inactivation. Thus, differential β-subunit modulation of inactivation correlates with the voltage-gated motion between the NH 2 -termini of α 1 C- and β-subunits and targets the mechanism of slow voltage-dependent inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Arc {{suppression}} coils {{provide a}} low cost method of increasing both {{the reliability and}} safety of high voltage transmission and distribution systems. Although the concept is not new, the advent of modern control equipment allows fresh opportunities {{for them to be}} used to save lives and to decrease the cost and inconvenience to industry and the community in general that is caused by electricity supply interruptions without incurring large expenditure. Earth fault currents are reduced to almost zero, thus eliminating many short time power supply interruptions and preventing damage to the electricity supply system {{at the time of the}} initial fault. Because of the reduction in damage at the time of the fault, many longer duration interruptions are avoided. It is common for <b>live</b> high <b>voltage</b> conductors to be close to the ground and for the fault not to be detected by conventional power system protection equipment. Arc suppression coil systems can detect high impedance earth faults and broken conductors which cannot be detected by conventional protection systems. There are many system abnormalities which can cause neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems. The appropriate action to be taken by the protection system depends on the type of system abnormality. The causes of neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Fully computerised power system protection systems are now being implemented. These modern protection systems will be able to utilise the criteria developed in this research to take immediate appropriate action based on the neutral voltage caused by the system abnormality. In existing distribution systems there is a widespread use of two single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in open-delta configuration to provide economic in-line three phase voltage regulation. An original method of representing open delta regulators in symmetrical component analyses is developed. It is shown that when open-delta regulators are used in a power system equipped with an arc suppression coil very high voltages can occur. A solution is proposed whereby three single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in a closed-delta arrangement are used. One of the potential problems with these systems is cross country faults caused by the neutral voltage displacement combined with the transient voltages at the time of the initial earth fault. These transient over-voltages are analysed in detail and a method of testing the capability of existing system components to withstand the over-voltages is developed. Simple methods to estimate the transient voltages on overhead power systems are derived. A new method of minimising the transient over-voltages is proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{realization}} of the first bipolar junction transistor in the year 1948 by Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley [1] sparked off the semiconductor industry, which gradually revolutionized the way we live. Nowadays, semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of every high-tech electronic device, most notably the computer which has become an inescapable part of our daily <b>lives.</b> Besides <b>voltage</b> and current control capabilities, semiconductors exhibit intriguing opto-electronic properties; the best known and commercially most successful applications are light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, charged coupled devices (CCD) and solar cells. [2, 3, 4] Due to the broad variety of material systems, they cover virtually the complete optical spectrum while simultaneously being cost-efficient and easy to miniaturize. Until the late 90 ies, commercially available devices were exclusively based on inorganic semiconductors, primarily on Silicon. However, over the last decade, the class of organic semiconductors has gained an increasing amount of interest, e. g., {{now one of the}} most popular smartphone’s display 1 is based on OLED 2 -technology. Flexibility upon stress and deeper color contrasts are typically named as their main advantages over conventional liquid crystal displays (LCD). While organic semiconductor devices are already well established as light emitters, they are still in research state as light harvesters. In general, organic solar cells offer high photon cross sections in combination with similar flexibility as OLED displays. Additionally, they exhibit the potential for low-cost mass-production, including innovative and versatile procedures such as ink-jet printing. [6, 7] However, two major challenges still exist which need to be addressed before organic solar cells become compatible: the long-term stability and the quantum efficiency. [8] The fast degradation of organic solar cells is caused by oxidation, reduction and thermal instabilities. Research in this field focuses on the synthesis of new organic molecules, thus, it can be assigned to the organic chemistry sector. Quantum efficiencies are determined by the microscopic photon to carrier conversion, i. e., the photovoltaic effect, therefore, it is predominantly a research topic of solid state physics. This thesis focuses mainly on aspects of the quantum efficiency in the polyacene Perfluoropentacene (PFP) and its underlying decay processes, namely the electronic relaxation dynamics after optical excitation. In particular, the process of singlet exciton fission is analyzed which promises to double the quantum efficiencies, as it converts one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons. [9] Excitons are correlated electron and hole pairs: neutral excitations of the crystal after absorption of a photon. Singlet exciton fission was first proposed in 1968 in order to explain the drastic photoluminescence quench of Tetracene crystals compared to Anthracene crystals. [10] It has gained renewed attention lately, due to its potential application in the growing field of organic solar cells. However, the microscopic understanding is still in its infancy which hampers essential progress in this field; for instance, the influence of the geometrical order of the molecules within the crystal on singlet exciton fission has only been analyzed theoretically. The reason is the lack of single crystal samples allowing for the correlation of molecular packing and electronic dynamics. [9] This issue is resolved in Chapter 5 for the model system of PFP single crystals, where for the first time the singlet exciton fission dynamics are observed along the three crystal axes by polarization-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. Moreover, the efficient coupling direction is identified as well as the preceding electronic species of the two triplet excitons. Although spectroscopic analysis on polyacenes date back to the 40 ies [11], lack of computational power and interest lead to the sad state that even interpretations of the linear absorption are still debated today. However, basic knowledge of the linear absorption is essential in order to interpret the non-linear dynamics. Therefore, Chapter 4 serves as a precursor, where the linear absorption of the PFP samples is interpreted using phenomenological models. Here, first indications are given for a dominant coupling direction within the PFP crystal which are then confirmed in Chapter 5. Furthermore, the amount of exciton splitting in PFP is determined, also known as the Davydov-splitting. [12] It is induced by dipole coupling between the two basis molecules of the crystal lattice during excitation. In Chapter 6 the focus is shifted to inorganic semiconductors. The chapter introduces a fast and convenient method to determine dephasing times of induced coherent exciton polarizations with more precision than a common lineshape analysis of the absorption spectrum. In pump-probe spectroscopy, the transients of the coherent oscillations are exploited to serve as phase indicators for the several excitonic transitions. These transients are observed during the coherent regime before pump and probe pulses perfectly overlap in time. [13] As a proof of principle, the methodology is applied to a set of Germanium quantum well samples and evaluated in respect to their optical quality. In addition, the main dephasing mechanism in Germanium quantum wells is identified. These three chapters capture the results of the thesis and are preceded by introductory chapters covering basic light-matter interactions and experimental details; they are succeeded by a conclusion chapter summarizing the essential findings...|$|R
