40|$|Associations among sexual victimization and {{the psychosocial}} {{functioning}} of African American and Latina pregnant and parenting adolescents were examined. Forty-seven (17. 7 %) of the 265 participants reported histories of sexual victimization, {{most of which}} was unwanted sexual intercourse. The victimized adolescents reported higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, and life stress and, although the two groups reported no differences in their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> social support, support {{was found to be}} differentially related to depression and anxiety in the two groups. In particular, victims derived benefits from social support at low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> but social support provided no protection against depression and anxiety at average or high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> For nonvictims, social support provided no benefits at low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> but protected against depression and anxiety at moderate <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and against depression at high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Implications <b>of</b> these findings for research, theory, and intervention are discussed.

All university students experience high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> due to the demands of the course, a new environment and learning to manage financially, emotionally, and socially with less parental support.

40|$|The {{literature}} on acculturative stress is discussed and an overview is provided {{of the main}} models of cultural adaptation, namely the U-curve pattern of adaptation and J-curve pattern of adaptation. Three different aspects <b>of</b> acculturative <b>stress</b> were examined. First, stress trajectories were analysed, and {{it was found that}} different exchange students in our sample had qualitatively different experiences in terms <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and adaptation. A total <b>of</b> 5 distinct <b>stress</b> trajectories emerged, namely U-curve, J-curve, mild stress, mild relief, and resilience patterns. Second, different antecedents <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> were examined, including adaption, personality, and coping. Adaptation was negatively related to stress, such that participants reporting being more adapted showed lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> For personality, neuroticism and openness were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> but extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and honesty -humility were all related to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> For coping, approach and acceptance coping were related to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> but avoidance and self-blame strategies were related to higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Support in the host country had a buffering effect on stress, but support from people back in the home country lead to an increase in stress. Third, we found that high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> or U-curve and J-curve trajectories were associated with high incidences of family changes and early return. In contrast, students that experienced the resilience trajectory were less likely to change families or return home early...|$|R

The first manuscript examines students’ self-reported <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and use <b>of</b> coping strategies to manage their stress. In this study, 120 students (82 females, 38 males) enrolled {{in the second year}} of medical, nursing, and pharmacy programs completed measures including the How I Deal With Stress survey, Perceived Stress Scale, and the SCOFF. Students reported high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> with those in nursing reporting significantly higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> than those in medicine, though neither group differed significantly from those in pharmacy. Gender was also found to be a significant contributor to student’s own reports <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> with females reporting higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and a multiple regression analysis revealed that gender accounts for more of the variance than any other factor on both measures <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> On the HIDS, 2. 5...|$|R

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that job-related stress affects correctional officers’ attitudes toward their work environment, coworkers, and supervisors, {{as well as}} their physical and mental health; however, very few studies have examined the relationship between stress and attitudes toward inmates. This study examined the relationship between correctional officers’ <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and their perceptions of inmates by surveying a sample of 501 correctional officers employed by a Southern prison system. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to test the principal hypothesis of this study—that more negative perceptions of inmates would result in higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> for correctional officers. Independent variables were grouped into four groups (demographic variables, supervisory support, job characteristics, and attitudes toward inmates) and were entered into the model in blocks. Lower supervisory support and perceptions of the job being dangerous were associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> job <b>stress.</b> More importantly, correctional officers who saw inmates as intimidated (not arrogant) and nonmanipulative reported lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> job <b>stress,</b> while officers who perceived inmates as being unfriendly, antisocial, and cold reported higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R
