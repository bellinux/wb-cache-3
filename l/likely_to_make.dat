5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked {{that it was one}} of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was very fond of Greinke.|$|E
5|$|With most Progressives having {{rejoined the}} Republican Party, their former leader, Theodore Roosevelt, was deemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a third {{run for the}} White House in 1920, and was the {{overwhelming}} favorite for the Republican nomination. These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6, 1919. A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, {{and a host of}} relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, and General John J. Pershing.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E

5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

50|$|The mountaintop Cronenberg is a {{relatively}} late founding whose placename prefix was originally Kranich. Although the modern meaning for this word in German is “crane”, the context is <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the meaning here “crown”, for Cronenberg “crowns” a mountain (Berg in German). Whatever the original meaning was, the name now has the prefix Cronen—, which does actually resemble the modern German word for “crown”, namely Krone. It is unknown whether Cronenberg began as a settlement near a small castle, but this cannot be ruled out. The name first appeared in a 1388 document (Walter von Cronenberg) and hardly changed at all through all the other instances in old documents.|$|R

25|$|The {{legality}} of the switch hit was questioned when first introduced, but cleared by the International Cricket Council as legal.

25|$|Another {{problem for}} the early twenty-first century is that during crime scene investigations, a {{decision}} {{has to be made}} at an early stage whether to attempt to retrieve fingerprints through the use of developers or whether to swab surfaces in an attempt to salvage material for DNA profiling. The two processes are mutually incompatible, as fingerprint developers destroy material that could potentially be used for DNA analysis, and swabbing is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fingerprint identification impossible.|$|E

Although there is still uncertainty about the motives of the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau—possibly a deranged outcast, possibly a religious extremist—the United States is reviewing security along the 5,525-mile (8,890km) line which separates the two countries (including the Alaskan land border).|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of patronage networks between local politicians {{and ethnic groups}} {{make it easier for}} politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them more responsive to calls of violence against other ethnic groups. Therefore, the {{existence of}} these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} research, we {{investigated}} helpless {{behavior and the}} responses it elicits from others. Study One used the act-frequency approach to develop a self-report measure of prototypically helpless behaviors. In a sample of college students (n = 75), this measure was validated against ratings by others. Many of the prototypically helpless behaviors we identified were interpersonal in nature, implying that they entail dependency and perhaps manipulativeness. In Study Two, we asked young adult (n = 249) Ss how they responded to people who showed varying amounts of helplessness. The most frequent response {{was trying to help}} the helpless individual feel better. As the frequency of helpless behavior increased, people were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him or her feel better, less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> go along with the helpless individual, more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become angry and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ignore or avoid this individual. Implications of these results for applications of the learned helplessness model were discussed, in particular the need to be cautious in assuming that all instances of observed passivity are good examples of learned helplessness...|$|R
