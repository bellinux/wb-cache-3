50|$|In {{photography}} and videography, a <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> is {{a device that}} {{enables the use of}} camera and lens combinations from otherwise incompatible systems. The most simple <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> designs, passive lens adapters provide a secure physical connection between the camera and the lens. Some passive adapters may include a mechanism for manual iris control. So called, active lens adapters will include electronic connections, enabling communication between the lens and the camera.|$|E

50|$|Another {{branch of}} <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> include an ND-filter to simplify {{changing}} lenses, which HolyManta introduced in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> {{include a}} special optical element called a telecompressor, focal reducer, or more {{recently}} a [...] "speed booster", a genericised trademark {{that refers to}} the Metabones Speed Booster line of <b>lens</b> <b>adapters.</b> This type of adapter is designed to reduce focal length, increase lens speed, {{and in some instances}} improve MTF performance. Another innovator in the field is KIPON, a German/Chinese co-operation between Kipon and IB/E Optics.|$|R

5000|$|The brightline framelines {{that show}} in the {{viewfinder}} are selected from one of three frameline pairings, depending on the lens (or <b>lens</b> <b>adapter)</b> mounted on the camera: ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{items like}} lens {{adapters}} may unintentionally {{have an effect}} similar to an extension tube. A lens designed for a small flange focal distance {{may not be able}} to focus to infinity when a <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> places the sensor too far away.|$|E
50|$|For other <b>lens</b> types, an <b>adapter</b> {{would act}} as an {{extension}} tube, causing the lens to lose the ability to focus to infinity. Alternatively, the <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> would include optical elements and act as weak teleconverters, as well as possibly losing optical quality.|$|R
50|$|Typical camera {{accessories}} are: spare batteries, <b>lens</b> <b>adapters,</b> matte boxes, optical filters, tripods, geared {{and fluid}} heads for smooth panning and tilting, follow focus systems, external microphone(s), and storage cases.|$|R
5000|$|Chrétien's Hypergonars {{proved to}} have {{significant}} optical and operational defects (primarily loss-of-squeeze at close camera-to-subject distances, plus {{the requirement of}} two camera assistants). Bausch & Lomb, Fox's prime contractor {{for the production of}} these lenses, initially produced an improved [...] "Chrétien-formula" [...] <b>adapter</b> <b>lens</b> design (CinemaScope <b>Adapter</b> Type I), and subsequently produced a dramatically improved and patented [...] "Bausch & Lomb formula" [...] <b>adapter</b> <b>lens</b> design (CinemaScope <b>Adapter</b> Type II).|$|R
50|$|The {{camera body}} {{is made of}} a {{magnesium}} alloy and has a swivelable touch screen, an electronic viewfinder with diopter correction, an internal flash light and a hot shoe. Due to the short flange focal distance of about 20 millimeters for the Micro Four Thirds system, almost all lenses with an appropriate image circle can be mounted to the body with a <b>lens</b> <b>adapter.</b> The normal focal length is at about 25 millimetres.|$|E
50|$|Adapting {{autofocus}} lenses to Sony's older E-mount cameras (such as the Sony α6000 and α7) {{can often}} be ineffective due to {{the inability of the}} camera body to effectively lock-on to a subject, resulting in either hunting or missed focus. This has largely been remedied in recent years with improved <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> performance, as well as the introduction of faster, more accurate autofocusing systems to Sony's more recent cameras (such as the Sony α6500 and Sony α9).|$|E
50|$|Lens {{adapters}} {{that include}} telecompressors have recently become popular with people using digital mirrorless cameras. By combining a telecompressor within a <b>lens</b> <b>adapter,</b> mirrorless cameras {{can use the}} lenses of both digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) and film-based SLR (Single-lens reflex cameras), whilst 'magically' gaining a stop (F-number) i.e. giving {{the performance of a}} more expensive lens on a cheaper lens. The most popular of these products are known by the company that makes them: metabones and KIPON.|$|E
50|$|The depth-of-field adapter (also {{called a}} DOF adapter or 35 mm adapter) is a largely {{obsolete}} device {{that uses a}} ground glass focusing screen to enable the use of interchangeable lenses on a fixed lens camcorder. There are also <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> made for other optical systems, including microscopes and telescopes.|$|R
50|$|It is {{currently}} marketed as the “Diana+” {{in the original}} 120 format as well as 35mm and 110 by Lomographische AG. The current iteration of the medium-format Diana F+ is actually a system camera, with interchangeable lenses, flashes, and film backs. Lomographische AG also makes Diana <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> for several major DSLR systems, including Canon EOS, Nikon F-mount, and Micro Four Thirds.|$|R

5000|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} May 2009 with Director of Photography Philip Bloom in Boston. Interview sequences were shot on Sony EX1 cameras with a Letus 35mm <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> and the Canon 5dmk2 DSLR camera. [...] Ruaridh Arrow travelled to Egypt to film the Egyptian revolution in February 2011 but his camera equipment {{was seized by}} Egyptian secret police on landing and key sequences had to be filmed on the iphone4. Arrow reported live from Tahrir Square for BBC News during this period.|$|E
50|$|Mounts {{used for}} Telescopes, microscopes and generic optics. The T-mount was {{initially}} developed by Tamron (1957) {{to allow the}} easy adaption of generic 35 mm SLR optics into multiple mounts. The T-mount is a 42 mm diameter 0.75 mm pitch screw mount with a 55 mm flange focal distance. Later versions (T2, T4, TX) were more advanced and complex. Several other manufacturers besides Tamron have used these mounts. Because the T-mount is still used for many telescopes and microscopes, they are still available new. Note that while both T-mount M42-mount are both 42mm screw-mount screw mount systems, and will mount if they are forced, they are not compatible. The difference in pitch can cause damage to the <b>lens,</b> <b>adapter</b> or camera mount if they are confused.|$|E
50|$|Light sensitivity: On {{sunny days}} {{the light is}} usually too intense for the camera which has a minimum {{aperture}} of f 8 and a minimum exposure time of 1/1000 second. It is necessary to add a polarizing filter of 3 f stops equivalent density (or a neutral density filter,) and this requires an adapter which extends the lens housing beyond the most extreme travel of the zoom lens. This adapter is available {{as part of a}} wide angle lens kit which while sold mainly for the Panasonic DMC-LC5, fiits the Digilux 1. The WA <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> makes a 28 mm equivalent focal length, and with the Leica 28mm optical finder which fits the flash bracket, it makes a good quality WA camera.|$|E
5000|$|Nikon F-mount (with AF and {{electronic}} aperture control, adapter variant with aperture ring for G <b>lenses</b> available, <b>adapter</b> variant with tilt available) ...|$|R
50|$|Wide {{angle and}} {{telephoto}} <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> {{are available from}} Panasonic. The wide angle converter shoots at 0.7x magnification (24.5 mm) with f/2.8 brightness, while the telephoto adapter provides 1.7× magnification (714 mm) with f/3.7 aperture. Maximum optical zoom available when taking photos at 3MP is thus 32.47x (1137.5 mm). It is also possible to achieve greater limits of wide angle/macro and zoom capability with third-party lens converters, which can {{be attached to the}} standard 55 mm filter thread.|$|R
50|$|With a view camera, tilt {{can usually}} be set with {{movements}} built into the camera; with a small- or medium-format camera, a tilt/shift <b>lens</b> or <b>adapter</b> is usually required.|$|R
50|$|As with Friday the 13th Part III and Jaws 3-D, {{which were}} also {{released}} in 3D in 1983, Amityville 3-D was filmed using the ArriVision 3-D process - coordinated, for this film, by cinematographer Tibor Sands. The Arrivision 3D system filmed 3D movies in standard color, {{with a single}} camera and one single strip of film. The process utilized a technique in which a special twin <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> was fitted to the camera and divided the 35mm frame in half down the middle - {{the result was that}} the right eye image was in {{the lower half of the}} frame and the left eye image was in the upper. The innovation was to allow a single camera to capture the image that could be merged when with the help of the special polarized glasses.|$|E
50|$|The Leica S1 Pro is {{a scanner}} camera {{with a very}} high {{resolution}} (26 megapixels) for stationary use introduced in 1996. On a 36×36 mm2 sensor 5140×5140 pixels get scanned and optically transferred to a connected computer. The object <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> system was exchangeable, thus object lenses of the systems Leica R, Leica M, Hasselblad, Mamiya 4, 5×6, and all mechanic object lenses from Canon (FD), Nikon, etc. {{can be used with}} the S1. The software for the S1 is a special SilverFast version, originally developed by LaserSoft Imaging for high-end scanners. Approximately 160 cameras were built and mostly sold to museums, archives and research institutes. Later on Leica introduced the S1 Highspeed with very quick scanning and the S1 Alpha with half the resolution to the market.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{preliminary}} testing experience and with subsequent technical and system improvements, we {{then proceeded to}} perform two cases of cholecystectomy {{and were able to}} achieve clinical success with an 8 K UHD endoscopic system, which consisted of an 8 K camera, a 30 -degrees angled rigid endoscope with a <b>lens</b> <b>adapter,</b> a pair of 300 -W xenon light sources, an 85 -inch 8 K LCD and an 8 K video recorder. These experimental and clinical studies revealed the engineering and clinical feasibility of the 8 K UHD endoscope, enabling us to have a positive outlook on its prospective use in clinical practice.|$|E
5000|$|Adapters for {{third-party}} or legacy <b>lenses,</b> including tilt-shift <b>adapters</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} the models were formed with a single lens reflex {{component}} combined with an interchangeable lens. And to give them flexibility, one or two versions also had <b>lens</b> mount <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to physically mount a lens with a short flange focal distance on a camera with a long flange focal distance, but this will {{make it impossible to}} achieve infinity focus. The effect will be similar to that of an extension tube, because the lens will be mounted further from the image plane than intended. Some <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> utilize an optical element to compensate for this, effectively acting as a teleconverter. This introduces the typical side effects of a teleconverter, namely decreasing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, and adding a crop factor to the lens.|$|R
30|$|We {{tested the}} imaging {{resolution}} of our 8 K camera {{head and the}} rigid endoscope in order to select the optimal <b>lens</b> <b>adapter</b> for 8 K imaging using an ISO resolution chart for electronic still cameras. This resolution chart was prepared {{for the work of}} ISO TC 42 WG 18 and is based on ISO 12233. We captured images of the chart and visually counted the black and white lines on the display. At first, we observed the resolution of the display showing the output by the 8 K camera itself with an AI Nikkor 50  mm f/ 1.2 S lens (NIKON CORP.). Next we observed the resolutions of reproduction on the display when showing the output as an 8 K UHD endoscope with the rigid endoscope with the lenses AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60  mm f/ 2.8 G ED, AI Nikkor 50  mm f/ 1.2 S or AI AF Nikkor 24  mm f/ 2.8 D (NIKON CORP.).|$|E
30|$|The imaging {{resolution}} of the display showing the output by the 8 K camera itself with AI Nikkor 50  mm f/ 1.2 S (NIKON CORP.) was about 4000 line widths per picture height on the 8 K display, which indicated an intrinsic performance of 8 K. The resolutions of reproductions on the display when showing the output as an 8 K UHD endoscope with the rigid endoscope were 2200 line widths per picture height with AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60  mm f/ 2.8 G ED, 2600 lines with AI Nikkor 50  mm f/ 1.2 S and 3600 lines with AI AF Nikkor 24  mm f/ 2.8 D. With AI AF Nikkor 24  mm f/ 2.8 D we could attain higher resolution but with a smaller field of view. For laparoscopic surgery, {{the field of view}} is required to be as large as possible. Therefore, with priority given to a greater field of view, in this study we selected AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60  mm f/ 2.8 G ED as the <b>lens</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Miranda {{cameras were}} {{equipped}} with a double lensmount consisting of a wide 44mm internal thread and an external bayonet—the Pentax/Praktica screw mount is 42mm. The flange to film plane distance was deliberately made as short as possible to accommodate as many different makes of camera lenses as possible using separately-sold <b>lens</b> <b>adapters.</b> The detachable finder prism was set in a sliding mount. The lenses for the Miranda were at first supplied by either Zunow or Ofunar. However, {{by the end of}} the 1950s, Soligor became the main supplier, and soon the lenses were labelled Auto Miranda.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable-lens camcorders {{can capture}} HD video with DSLR <b>lenses</b> and an <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Accessories: Genuine leather case, {{microscope}} <b>adapter,</b> M24 <b>lens</b> mount TO M39 <b>lens</b> mount <b>adapter</b> for Zenit SLR lenses, {{with flange}} to film plane distance of 45.2 mm. M39 LTM mount with flange to film plane distance 28.8 mm not applicable.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>lens</b> <b>adapters</b> {{feature a}} male fitting {{and a female}} fitting. The male fitting {{attaches}} to the camera, and the female fitting attaches to the lens. There is also {{an opening in the}} center to allow the light to pass through. Lens adapters can be shorter or longer, based on the respective flange focal distance of the lens and camera being adapted. Flange focal distance is the key specification in determining whether or not a particular type of lens can be adapted to any given camera. Generally speaking, cameras with a shorter flange focal distance can be adapted to a greater diversity of lenses. This is because there must be enough room to fit an <b>adapter</b> between the <b>lens</b> and the camera.|$|R
