500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is what it feels <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> religion." ...|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there.

2500|$|Critics {{were more}} temperate, but {{generally}} agreed the production was a failure. They were most divided over Pousseur's musical collage technique. Claudio Sartori found the quotations [...] "pointless", while the critic for La Stampa was noncommital, saying only that [...] "Pousseur is a musician of proven dexterity, {{aligned with the}} most up-to-date ranks of the avant-garde" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). Peter Heyworth, on the other hand, found the [...] "elaborate collage of citation, parody, pastiche and genuine composition" [...] to have been [...] "carried off with considerable panache", and admitted that Votre Faust is [...] "utterly unlike any opera I have ever heard, and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it represents a major attempt to bring music and drama into a new sort of relationship" [...] but, on the whole, found it [...] "nothing more than a box of tricks; full of sound and signifying precious little. In the worst sense of the word, an experiment" [...] Luciano Berio, a colleague and friend of Pousseur, was wholly enthusiastic about [...] "a score that I love deeply for innumerable reasons", but nevertheless admitted the production was a failure—a failure which he blamed partly on Butor's text, but more emphatically on the stage design and [...] "what is normally defined as directing but in our case is revealed as a gratuitous succession of inconsistent poses perpetrated {{by a pair of}} naïve amateurs inexplicably dragged to Milan by M. Butor" [...] Sartori concurred, describing the production as [...] "heavy" [...] and the sets [...] "ugly" [...] In an interview conducted shortly after the Milan performances, one of the singers confirmed that stage direction was practically nonexistent, so that the performers were forced largely to improvise their movements. After protracted wrangling that began with the first rehearsals in the theatre and continued through most of the run, it was finally agreed to do the fourth and last performance in concert form [...] The instrumentalists were described as [...] "bravissimi" [...] (talented) and the singers as [...] "strenui" [...] (stalwart) , and although Jean Topart in the role of Mondor was generally admired, the other actors' performances were scarcely mentioned. One exception was made by Berio, who paid Roger Mollien a backhanded compliment: [...] "The 'protagonist' Henri, ... is, in the words of Butor, a perfect cretin, equaled in this respect only by 'actor-director' Mollien trying to portray the part", who in the end, according to Berio, uttered only two coherent sentences: [...] "C'est que nous n'avons pas encore abordé la question du livret" [...] (We have not yet addressed the issue of the libretto), and [...] "s'il y a eu un coupable dans l'affaire, c'est moi, tu le sais bien, Maggy" [...] (If there has been a guilty man in this case it's me, you know that, Maggy) [...]|$|E
