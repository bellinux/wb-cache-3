However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to Leader of the House of Commons and future Prime Minister Bonar Law in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having [...] "all the glibness of Runciman and that is apt to take in innocent persons <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me...</b> Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and {{there is no room for}} funks in the modern world." [...] Stanley left the Board of Trade and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.|$|E
500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> {{but if you have a}} nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E

Gunn stated that Bates would write {{some of the}} score first {{so that he can}} film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E

"If Don Alonso de Carbajal thinketh to ride far in that guise," [...] {{observed}} the elder {{of the two}} idlers, [...] "he {{would do well to}} look sharp to his followers, for the army of Aragon never sent forth a more scurvily-appointed guard than that he hath this day led through the southern gate, notwithstanding the glitter of housings, and the clangor of trumpets. We could have furnished lances from Valencia more befitting a king's embassy, I tell <b>thee,</b> Diego; ay, <b>and</b> worthier knights to lead them, than these of Aragon.
