2500|$|Striae of Retzius are {{incremental}} {{lines that}} appear brown in a stained section of mature enamel. These lines {{are composed of}} bands or cross striations on the enamel rods that, when combined in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sections,</b> seem to traverse the enamel rods. [...] Formed from changes in diameter of Tomes’ processes, these incremental lines demonstrate the growth of enamel, similar to the annual rings on a tree on transverse sections of enamel. The exact mechanism that produces these lines is still being debated. Some researchers hypothesize that the lines {{are a result of}} the diurnal (circadian), or 24-hour, metabolic rhythm of the ameloblasts producing the enamel matrix, which consists of an active secretory work period followed by an inactive rest period during tooth development. Thus, each band on the enamel rod demonstrates the work/rest pattern of the ameloblasts that generally occurs over a span of a week.|$|E

30|$|It {{is easy to}} {{find and}} measure the {{parameters}} in Fig.  4 for existing landslides. But for the potential landslides, one must firstly detect {{the body of the}} potential landslide. According to the important topographical factors mentioned above, the largest slope gradient, gentle upslope gradient in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section,</b> the hollow in the cross-section, and the free-face of the slope in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section</b> are the key points to detect potential shallow landslides. To identify a potential shallow landslide one can start with the selection in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section</b> of a large slope gradient. Then one can connect this section with a gentler upslope gradient, or with a hollow in a cross-section, or a free-face of the slope in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section,</b> or a combination of two, or three of these important topographical factors. Some slopes without a large slope gradient, but with the presence of a gentler upslope gradient in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section,</b> or hollows in a cross-section, or a free-face of the slope in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section</b> are also chosen as potential shallow landslides.|$|R

60|$|Whether to Lord Shaftesbury or to Mr. Luttrell the embellishments of {{the garden}} of their {{residence}} are to be attributed can now be only matter for conjecture, unless some curious autograph-collector’s portfolio may by chance contain an old letter or other document to establish the claim. Their tastes, however, were very similar. They both loved their books, and their fruits and flowers, and enjoyed the study of them. [Picture: Summer-house] An account drawn up by Mr. Luttrell of several pears which he cultivated at Little Chelsea, with outlines of their <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sections,</b> was communicated to the Horticultural Society by Dr. Luttrell Wynne, one hundred years after the notes had been made, and may be found printed in the second volume of the Transactions of that Society.

60|$|I have {{examined}} fourteen skulls of POLISH AND OTHER CRESTED BREEDS. Their differences are extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different sub- breeds of English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of the frontal bones (7/68. See Mr. Tegetmeier's account with woodcuts {{of the skull}} of Polish fowls in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' November 25, 1856. For other references see Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Gen. des Anomalies' tome 1 page 287. M. C. Dareste suspects ('Recherches sur les Conditions de la Vie' etc. Lille 1863 page 36) that the protuberance is not formed by the frontal bones, but by the ossification of the dura mater.) {{may be seen in}} figure 34, in which (B) the skull of a white-crested Polish fowl is shown obliquely from above, with the skull (A) of (G. bankiva in the same position. In figure 35 <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sections</b> are given of the skull of a Polish fowl, and, for comparison, of a Cochin of the same size. The protuberance in all Polish fowls occupies the same position but differs much in size. In one of my nine specimens it was extremely slight. The degree to which the protuberance is ossified varies greatly, larger or smaller portions of bone being replaced by membrane. In one specimen there was only a single open pore; generally, there are many variously shaped open spaces, the bone forming an irregular reticulation. A medial, longitudinal, arched ribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one specimen there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance, and the skull, when cleaned and viewed from above, presented the appearance of an open basin. The change in the whole internal form of the skull is surprisingly great. The brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as is shown in the two <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sections,</b> which deserve attentive consideration. The upper and anterior cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided, is the one which is so greatly modified; it is evidently much larger than in the Cochin skull of the same size, and extends much further beyond the interorbital septum, but laterally is less deep. This cavity, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, is entirely filled with brain. In the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity; but this ridge is quite absent in the Polish skull here figured. The shape of the central cavity is circular in the Polish, and lengthened in the Cochin skull. The shape of the posterior cavity, together with the position, size, and number of the pores for the nerves, differ much in these two skulls. A pit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the Cochin is entirely absent in this Polish skull, whilst in another specimen it was well developed. In this second specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity likewise differs to a certain extent in shape. I made sections of two other skulls,--namely, of a Polish fowl with the protuberance singularly little developed, and of a Sultan in which it was a little more developed; and when these two skulls were placed between the two above figured (figure 35), a perfect gradation in the configuration of each part of the internal surface could be traced. In the Polish skull, with a small protuberance, the ridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present, but low; and in the Sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing on a broad raised eminence.|$|E
