50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, the distributed element {{model or}} transmission line model of electrical circuits {{assumes that the}} attributes of the circuit (resistance, capacitance, and inductance) are distributed continuously throughout the material of the circuit. This {{is in contrast to}} the more common lumped element model, which assumes that these values are lumped into electrical components that are joined by perfectly conducting wires. In the distributed element model, each circuit element is infinitesimally small, and the wires connecting elements are not assumed to be perfect conductors; that is, they have impedance. Unlike the lumped element model, it assumes non-uniform current along each branch and non-uniform voltage along each node. The distributed model is used at high frequencies where the wavelength becomes comparable to the physical dimensions of the circuit, making the <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> inaccurate.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDevelopment {{of models}} for {{industrial}} hydrocrackers {{has received a}} great amount of attention by the scientific community over the past decades. Two fundamentally different modelling approaches are compared in this paper: a continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> with three families (paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics) and a single events microkinetic model. The aim is to demonstrate the differences in the capabilities of the two modelling frameworks. Both models are capable of simulating experimental data from hydrocracking of a pre-treated Vacuum Gas Oil in a pilot plant at industrial conditions. The continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> provides better results of the macroscopic effluent characteristics, such as yield structure and PNA (Paraffin, Naphthene, Aromatic) distribution in the middle distillate cut. It requires only the feed SIMDIS (Simulated Distillation) and PNA composition to be known. The single events model, on the other hand, provides information which is not available in a simple continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> An analysis of the reaction kinetics of paraffins and mono-naphthenes is performed to demonstrate this aspect. The single events model is far more complex and computationally expensive than the continuous <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> In conclusion, the two approaches should be considered complementary rather than competitive. In conjunction, they can be used to balance the drawbacks of each individual modelling approac...|$|R
50|$|Another example where {{a simple}} {{one-dimensional}} model will not suffice is the windings of an inductor. Coils of wire have capacitance between adjacent turns (and also more remote turns as well, {{but the effect}} progressively diminishes). For a single layer solenoid, the distributed capacitance will mostly lie between adjacent turns {{as shown in figure}} 4 between turns T1 and T2, but for multiple layer windings and more accurate models distributed capacitance to other turns must also be considered. This model is fairly difficult to deal with in simple calculations {{and for the most part}} is avoided. The most common approach is to roll up all the distributed capacitance into one lumped element in parallel with the inductance and resistance of the coil. This <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> works successfully at low frequencies but falls apart at high frequencies where the usual practice is to simply measure (or specify) an overall Q for the inductor without associating a specific equivalent circuit.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} a comprehensive study {{to develop and}} assess the predictive capabilities of a <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> for the kinetics of complex reaction mixtures containing {{a large number of}} reacting components. Two types of <b>lumping</b> <b>models</b> were developed {{to reduce the number of}} reaction kinetics, namely a discrete and a continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> These models were applied on three different problems. In the first case study, a continuum model was developed for a mixture of n-paraffins (waxes) produced from the Fischer-Tropsch process; the paraffins range from C 5 to C 70 and undergoing catalytic hydrocracking. The model was run with two types of the reactant-type distribution functions to describe the yield of products from the isomerisation and cracking reactions. The model was used to study the effect of the operating conditions on the model parameters and the yield composition. Experimental data were used to optimise the model parameters. The optimal parameters were used to predict the product distribution of n-paraffins hydrocracking and their conversion. The new in this case study was used the carbon number as label in the continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> and to study how the effect of D(k) on the yield distribution. Good agreements have been obtained when running the model with D(k) employed a gamma function but it needs more time to solve the model than when employing a power law relation for D(k). In the second case study, both primary and secondary reaction kinetics of the pyrolysis of lignin were investigated by using the discrete lumping methodology. Two mathematical models were developed which consider the product as three lumps whilst the lignin was assumed to be an additional <b>lump.</b> The <b>model’s</b> results were validated against experimental data. In addition, a continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> was developed for the cracking of the tar to obtain lighter components. The novelty in this case study is to develop a kinetic model including primary and secondary reaction kinetics for the pyrolysis of lignin in a fluid bed pyrolyser and to study how the continuum <b>lumping</b> <b>model</b> for tar can be linked to the discrete <b>lumping</b> <b>model.</b> In the third case study, a model based on the continuum lumping approach was proposed to predict the molecular weight distribution of polymers during batch polymerisation. The result obtained from a continuum model was assessed, at this stage, only qualitatively; nevertheless, by analysing the weight distribution and the average of such distribution, conclusions were reached to assess the predictive capability of the lumping methodology. It is the first time that the continuum model with a yield distribution function is used to predict the molecular weight distribution of the polymerisation at various times...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Windkessel {{and similar}} <b>lumped</b> <b>models</b> {{are often used}} to repre-sent blood ow and {{pressure}} in systemic arteries. The windkessel model was originally developed by Stephen Hales (1733) and Otto Frank (1899) who used it to describe blood ow in the heart. In this paper {{we start with the}} one-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for time-dependent blood ow in a rigid vessel to derive <b>lumped</b> <b>models</b> relating ow and pressure. This is done through Laplace transform and its inversion via residue theory. Upon keeping contributions from one, two, or more residues, we derive lumped mod-els of successively higher order. We focus on zeroth, rst and second order models and relate them to electrical circuit analogs, in which current is equiv-alent to ow and voltage to pressure. By incorporating eects of compliance through addition of capacitors, windkessel and related <b>lumped</b> <b>models</b> are ob-tained. Our results show that given the radius of a blood vessel, it is possible to determine the order of the model that would be appropriate for analyz-ing the ow and pressure in that vessel.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we discuss two {{different}} approaches to model the flexible power consumption of heat pump heated households: individual household modeling and lumped model-ing. We illustrate that a benefit of individual modeling {{is that we can}} overview and optimize the complete flexibility of a heat pump portfolio. Following, we illustrate two disadvantages of individual models, namely that it requires much computational effort to optimize over a large portfolio, and second {{that it is difficult to}} accurately model the houses in certain time periods due to local disturbances. Finally, we propose a <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> approach as an alternative to the individual models. In the <b>lumped</b> <b>model,</b> the portfolio is seen as baseline consumption superimposed with an ideal storage of limited power and energy capacity. The benefit of such a <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> is that the computational effort of flexibility optimization is significantly reduced.

40|$|The {{degrees of}} freedom of multi-compartment {{mathematical}} models for energy metabolism of a neuron-astrocyte complex may offer a key to understand the {{different ways in which}} the energetic needs of the brain are met. In this paper we address the problem within a steady state framework and we use the techniques of linear algebra to identify the {{degrees of freedom}} first in a <b>lumped</b> <b>model,</b> then in its extension to a spatially distributed case. The interpretation of the degrees of freedom in metabolic terms, more specifically in terms of glucose and oxygen partitioning, is then leveraged to derive constraints on the free parameters needed to guarantee that the model is energetically feasible. We also demonstrate how the model can be used to estimate the stoichiometric energy needs of the cells as well as the household energy based on observed oxidative cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) of glucose, and the glutamate cycling. Moreover, our analysis shows that in the <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> the direction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cells can be deduced from the glucose partitioning between the compartments. The extension of the <b>lumped</b> <b>model</b> into a spatially distributed multi-compartment setting that includes diffusion fluxes from capillary to tissue increases the number of degrees of freedom, requiring the use of statistical sampling techniques.
