5|$|<b>Lambda</b> is an {{advanced}} lifeform created on Fodra. His mistreatment by humans fueled his hatred towards them. During the party's childhood, he resides inside Richard {{after he was}} injured by Sophie and as a result, saved Richard's life. Seven years later, <b>Lambda</b> is reawakened when Richard receives a fatal wound. <b>Lambda</b> empowers Richard and manipulates him to achieve his goals of destroying humanity. After he is defeated by the party, <b>Lambda</b> is absorbed by Asbel who convinces him to give humans a chance. In Lineage and Legacies, he absorbs Fodra's consciousness to dissuade her hatred as Asbel did for him. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara and dubbed by Keith Silverstein.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} buy- and sell-order illiquidity measures (<b>lambdas)</b> for {{a comprehensive}} sample of NYSE stocks. We show that sell-order liquidity is priced more strongly than buy-order liquidity in the cross-section of equity returns. Indeed, our analysis indicates that the liquidity premium in equities emanates predominantly from the sell-order side. We also find that the average difference between sell and buy <b>lambdas</b> is generally positive throughout our sample period. Both buy and sell <b>lambdas</b> are significantly positively correlated with measures of funding liquidity such as the TED spread as well option implied volatility...|$|R
5|$|The {{party is}} unable to heal Sophie with magic or {{medicine}} so Pascal suggests the party travel to Fodra, a nearby planet, where Sophie originates from to find a cure. After finding a space shuttle left by Pascal's ancestors, the party travel to Fodra where they meet Emeraude, the last remaining human on the desolated planet. Using advanced machinery, Sophie is healed and regains her memories revealing she is a biological humanoid engineered to defeat <b>Lambda,</b> the monster that attacked them in their childhood and is currently possessing Richard. Emeraude helps the party bypass the barrier on the Lastalia where they confront and defeat Richard. Emeraude betrays the party and attempts to absorb Lambda's power but dies in the process. <b>Lambda</b> begins to fuse with the Lastalia causing the party to see his memories and learn about his suffering caused by humanity. The party defeats the materialized Lambda; Since <b>Lambda</b> can not be killed by normal means, Sophie intends to sacrifice herself to kill him. Instead, Asbel absorbs and convinces <b>Lambda</b> to let him show humanity's worth. <b>Lambda</b> agrees before falling into a deep sleep.|$|E

5|$|At the {{southern}} {{limits of the}} constellation lie Kappa and <b>Lambda</b> Canis Majoris. Although of similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth, they are unrelated. Kappa is a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable of spectral type B2Vne, which brightened by 50% between 1963 and 1978, from magnitude 3.96 or so to 3.52. It is around 659 light-years distant. <b>Lambda</b> is a blue-white B-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from Earth. It is 3.7 times as wide as and 5.5 times as massive as the Sun, and shines with 940 times its luminosity.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{materials}} {{with very different}} saturation magnetostriction (<b>lambda(s))</b> were selected: Co 59 Fe 16 Zr 6 CU 1 Nb 2 B 16 amorphous alloy with low <b>lambda(s)</b> value (congruent to 10 (- 7)), Fe 62. 5 Co 6 Ni 7. 5 Zr 7. 5 Cu 1 Nb 2 B 15 amorphous alloy with <b>lambda(s)</b> congruent to 10 (- 5) and Tb 0. 27 Dy 0. 73 Fe 2. 0 (Terfenol) alloy with giant magnetostriction (<b>lambda(s)</b> congruent to 10 (- 3)). Magnetization intensity curves were obtained {{by means of a}} vibrating sample magnetometer from room temperature to 10 K. At low magnetizing field a reentrant magnetization behaviour was evidenced in all the investigated materials. This effect is proportional to magnetostriction value, going from a large effect in Terfenol to a small one in low magnetostriction materials. Saturation field, coercive field and hysteresis area behaviours as a function of temperature are in agreement with both the measured magnetization reentrance and stress-induced effects...|$|R

5|$|Liquid helium {{below its}} <b>lambda</b> point (called heliumII) {{exhibits}} very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when it boils, {{it does not}} bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less {{is known about the}} properties of the isotope.|$|E

5|$|Other Marines {{who have}} also been left behind team up with Shephard and attempt to reach another {{extraction}} point near Black Mesa's <b>Lambda</b> Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard {{makes it to the}} <b>Lambda</b> Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen {{in the final stages of}} Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.|$|E

5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline was appropriate for the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway <b>Lambda</b> one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway <b>Lambda</b> one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The neutron emission rates from five very pure actinide samples (Th- 232, Np- 237, Pu- 239, Pu- 241 and depleted uranium) were measured following equilibrium irradiation in fast and thermal neutron fluxes. The relative abundances (alphas) for the first four groups were calculated from the delayed neutron emission (counts vs. time) data using Keepin's 6 -group decay constants (<b>lambdas)</b> for Th- 232, Pu- 239 and depleted uranium (both fast and thermal neutron induced fissions). The relative abundances (alphas) for the first five groups were calculated for the fast neutron induced fission of Np- 237 using the 7 -group <b>lambdas</b> obtained by Charlton (1997). The relative abundances for the first five groups were also calculated using the 7 -group <b>lambdas</b> proposed by Loaiza and Haskin (2000), the 8 -group <b>lambdas</b> proposed by Campbell and Spriggs (1998) and the 8 -group <b>lambdas</b> proposed by Piksaikin (2000) for all of the samples (fast neutron induced fission only for Th- 232 and Np- 237, fast and thermal neutron induced fission for the remainder). Fission product yield and delayed neutron emission probability data from the ENDF- 349 and JEF 2. 2 nuclear data libraries were also used to simulate neutron emission data from the samples. The calculated neutron yield curves were used to obtain group relative abundances for each of the five actinide samples (fast neutron induced fission only for Th- 232 and Np- 237, fast and thermal neutron induced fission for the remainder) based on each set of proposed <b>lambdas.</b> The relative abundances obtained from the experiments and calculations are compared and the differences are noted and discussed...|$|R
