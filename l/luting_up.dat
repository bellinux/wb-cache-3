5000|$|The 11 frets of {{the neck}} are {{removable}} (and can be re-positioned for differing intervals) and made of nylon (resembling the gut/nylon frets of the <b>lute).</b> <b>Up</b> to 9 wooden frets, mounted on the soundboard, are fixed. The intervals of the frets may be more frequent {{than that of a}} guitar to permit the playing of maqams as found in the music of Byzantium.|$|R

2500|$|A bandura (...) is a Ukrainian, plucked string, folk instrument. It {{combines}} {{elements of}} the zither and <b>lute</b> and, <b>up</b> until the 1940s, was also often referred to by the term kobza. Early instruments (c. 1700) had 5 to 12 strings and similar to the lute. In the 20th century, the number of strings increased initially to 31 strings (1926), 56 strings - 68 strings on modern 'concert' instruments (1954).|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} in a fading aristocratic family in Shanghai. Around her, contradictions and aberrations are normal in Lute's family. <b>Lute</b> grows <b>up</b> {{watching}} the adults around her, and there is much to see. The sprawling, extended family and their ever-present servants exist in a sea of gossip, scandal, jealousy and fear. This is a household immersed in a decaying grandeur amid the intoxicating smell of opium. For Lute, the family was like a pagoda imprisoning her which she spent all her life to escape, albeit reluctantly.|$|R
5000|$|Fat Lute {{was made}} of clay mixed with oil and beaten until it had the {{consistency}} of putty. It could be stored in a sealed earthenware vessel, which retained moisture and kept the material pliable. An alchemical writer of the 16th century recommended a <b>lute</b> made <b>up</b> of [...] "loam mixed to a compost with horse dung" [...] while the French chemist Chaptal used a similar mixture of [...] "fat earth" [...] and horse dung, mixed in water and formed into a soft paste.|$|R
50|$|Dinghui Temple covers {{an area of}} 16 mu and {{the whole}} layout {{presents}} a shape like the Chinese character “回”. House churches are outer ring and temples are inside. The gate of the temple faces north, which is rare in China. Daxiong Palace and Scripture Library are both at south facing north. Now, a river surrounds the temple and makes the temple more beautiful. In Jingang Palace, there are four statues representing the Four Heavenly Kings. Virūḍhaka carries a sharp sword with angry eyes. Dhṛtarāṣṭra holds a <b>lute</b> looking <b>up</b> with pretension. Vaiśravaṇa takes an umbrella with a hideous face. Virūpākṣa seizes a dragon by his strong muscles.|$|R
50|$|Lute's sickly brother, Hill, as a boy, was the {{important}} child {{in this family}} because {{he would be the}} successor of his father, Yuxi. The young boy was cosseted, over-supervised and beaten so that he was weak and morose. Lute was often ignored and had more freedom to do what she wanted. She was given to those of no consequence. <b>Lute</b> grew <b>up</b> around servants, the sprawling, extended family existed in a sea of gossip, scandal, jealousy and fear. They were bound together by their need for money, and the terror of destitution. They lived on the family's ever-diminishing wealth and tarnished prestige, pretending loyalty while pursuing their own survival and pleasure. Through young Lute's child clear eyes, those adults sometimes were hypocritical; even her parents were relentlessly selfish.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave the}} animal his head, and he leaped cleanly and {{accurately}} to the ledge, striking with feet close {{together on the}} narrow space. On the instant he struck, Lute lightly touched his neck with the rein, impelling him to the left; and in that instant, tottering on the insecure footing, with front feet slipping over into the pool beyond, he lifted on his hind legs, with a half turn, sprang to the left, and dropped squarely down to the tiny gravel bed. An easy jump brought him across the stream, and <b>Lute</b> angled him <b>up</b> the bank and halted before her lover.|$|R
60|$|<b>Lute</b> almost caught <b>up</b> {{amongst the}} trees, but was hopelessly outdistanced on the fallow field adjoining, across which the mare tore {{with a fine}} {{disregard}} for heavy ground and gopher-holes. When she turned at a sharp angle into the thicket-land beyond, Lute took the long diagonal, skirted the ticket, and reined in Ban at the other side. She had arrived first. From within the thicket she could hear a tremendous crashing of brush and branches. Then the mare burst through and into the open, falling to her knees, exhausted, on the soft earth. She arose and staggered forward, then came limply to a halt. She was in lather-sweat of fear, and stood trembling pitiably.|$|R
6000|$|The date of {{this last}} letter marks, as nearly as need be, {{the date of}} {{publication}} of Miss Barrett's volumes. The letters which follow deal mainly with their reception, first at the hand of friends, {{and then by the}} regular critics. The general verdict of the latter was extremely complimentary. Mr. Chorley, in the 'Athenaeum,'[100] described the volumes as 'extraordinary,' adding that 'between her [Miss Barrett's] poems and the slighter lyrics of most of the sisterhood, there is all the difference which exists between the putting-on of [...] "singing robes" [...] for altar service, and the taking <b>up</b> <b>lute</b> or harp to enchant an indulgent circle of friends and kindred.' In the 'Examiner,'[101] John Forster declared that 'Miss Barrett is an undoubted poetess of a high and fine order as regards the first requisites of her art--imagination and expression.... She is a most remarkable writer, and her volumes contain not a little which the lovers of poetry will never willingly let die,' a phrase then not quite so hackneyed as it has since become. The 'Atlas'[102] asserted that 'the present volumes show extraordinary powers, and, abating the failings of which all the followers of Tennyson are guilty, extraordinary genius.' More influential even than these, 'Blackwood'[103] paid her the compliment of a whole article, criticising her faults frankly, but declaring that 'her poetical merits infinitively outweigh her defects. Her genius is profound, unsullied, and without a flaw.' All agreed in assigning her a high, or the highest, place among the poetesses of England; but, as Miss Barrett herself pointed out, this, in itself, was no great praise.[104] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Several commercially {{available}} luting agents {{are used to}} cement the dental restorations such as intra-coronal, extra-coronal, and fixed partial dentures. Tensile bond strength (TBS) and accurate marginal fit are the essential factors to determine the good clinical results in fixed prosthesis. The retentivity of the luting cements is assessed by their adhesive capacity over the tooth surface and metal surface. Generally, the adhesive ability has been evaluated with in vitro testing, with tensile bond tests. The failure of fixed prosthesis may be happened {{as a result of}} incomplete seating during cementation. Most research on cementation of crowns relates seating failure to the thickness of the cement film. Materials and Methods: The study is divided into four groups with 10 samples for each of the <b>luting</b> cement taken <b>up</b> for testing TBS and four groups with 5 samples for each luting agent chosen for assessing marginal fit. The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed. Results: In this in vitro study, the TBS of luting cements, and marginal fit in relation to luting cements were tested by using appropriate testing devices. The TBS of cement is measured using universal testing machine, and the results are tabulated. The marginal gap that exists between the margin of the cast metal crown, and the finish line is measured using travelling microscope before and after cementation. The difference between these two values gives the discrepancy that is due to the film thickness of cement used for luting the restoration. Summary and Conclusion: The TBS value of zinc phosphate cement and glass ionomer cement were found to be almost same. The chemical adhesiveness of the glass ionomer with calcium ions of enamel and dentin may be the attributed reason (ionic bonding). In this study, the polycarboxylate is the one that showed low TBS, and it may be attributed to the weakness of the cement due to reduced film thickness, though this cement has a chemical bonding nature. The observation of results of marginal fit in this study is the increased gap found in zinc phosphate cement followed by resin cement, zinc polycarboxylate, and glass ionomer cement. It is agreeable to estimate the marginal fit of the restoration, which could be affected by the film thickness of the luting cement along with other factors...|$|R
