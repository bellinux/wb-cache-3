40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of moisture migration in building materials and elements {{is crucial for}} its behaviour knowledge also affecting its durability, waterproofing, degradation and thermal performance. Based on this breach {{it is intended to}} analyse the interface effect in the capillary process in ceramic brick. Ceramic brick is a common material in Portuguese exterior walls, where usually it has mortar joints. In the foremost cases, Portuguese exterior walls are multilayer walls with materials in perfect contact and/or with an <b>air</b> <b>space.</b> Knowing that, in this paper, an experimental research using samples to capillary tests are used considering four different cases: monolithic and three interfaces: perfect contact, <b>air</b> <b>space</b> and hydraulic continuity (mortar). Since a long time, moisture is one of the primary causes for the observed damage on the buildings envelope, increasing the importance of this research with the goal of controlling the real moisture migration process. This paper has two special purposes:(a) The {{analysis of}} ceramic brick capillarity coefficient without interfaces (monolithic) and with three different interfaces: perfect contact, <b>air</b> <b>space</b> and hydraulic continuity (mortar) and (b) The calculation of the hydric resistance in the interface that conditions the maximum flow transmitted FLUMAX. This value is an important input in numerical simulations with multilayer building components and is a parameter to be obtained experimentally. In the first weights the water front is lower than the interface position so it would be expected that the capillary coefficient, calculated for the first step, is not to much influenced by the interface. It is expected that the maximum flow transmitted – FLUMAX, in the three different interfaces, is <b>lower</b> to <b>air</b> <b>space,</b> higher to hydraulic continuity, being the perfect contact in the middl...|$|R
40|$|Nodule {{permeability}} (P) {{controls the}} amount of O 2 entering the nodule and is an important determinant of N 2 fixation. Modulation of water volume in the intercellular spaces of the nodule cortex was hypothesized to change the effective thickness of a diffusion barrier and account for changes in P. This hypothesis was examined by evaluating physical traits of nodules that may affect P. The first test of the hypothesis {{was to determine whether}} alterations in P may result in changing both the density and the <b>air</b> <b>space</b> content of nodules as the water content of intercellular spaces was varied. Density of nodules exposed to 21 kPa O 2 increased as the time following detachment from the plant increased from 5 to 60 min. Nodules from soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) plants shaded for 48 h had a <b>lower</b> fractional <b>air</b> <b>space</b> content than nodules from control plants. Nodule detachment and prolonged shading decreased P, and the increase in density and decrease in fractional <b>air</b> <b>space</b> content associated with decreased P in these treatments supports the proposed hypothesis. The second test of the hypothesis was to determine whether nodules released water easily in response to water potential gradients. The intrinsic capacitance of nodules determined by pressure-volume analysis was 0. 29 MPa- 1 and indicated that the tissue can release relatively large amounts of water from the symplast with only small changes in total nodule water potential. Estimates of the bulk modulus of elasticity ranged from 0. 91 to 2. 60 MPa and indicated a high degree of elasticity. It was concluded that the physical properties of nodules were consistent with P modulation by the release and uptake of intercellular water in the nodule cortex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} there are differences in the radiological appearances at presentation between pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Correct recognition of the organism has important implications with regard to initial therapy and contact tracing. METHODS: The initial chest radiographs of 28 patients with pulmonary M kansasii infection were compared with those of 56 age, sex, and race matched patients with M tuberculosis infection. All patients in both groups were culture positive and none was known to be HIV positive. The radiographs were analysed independently by two radiologists who were unaware of the causative organism. RESULTS: Radiographic abnormalities in patients with M kansasii infection were more frequently unilateral and right side predominant, while those with tuberculosis more frequently involved a <b>lower</b> lobe. <b>Air</b> <b>space</b> shadowing involving more than one bronchopulmonary segment and pleural effusions were seen less frequently in M kansasii infection (four of 28 (14 %) versus 30 of 56 (54 %) and none of 28 versus 15 of 56 (27 %)). Cavitation (21 of 28 (75 %) versus 34 of 56 (61 %) was seen to a similar extent in patients with M kansasii infection and in those with tuberculosis. Cavities tended to be smaller in patients with M kansasii infection (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Differences are seen in the radiographic appearances of pulmonary infection caused by M kansasii and M tuberculosis. These differences are not sufficient to allow a positive diagnosis on the basis of radiographic findings alone, but the presence of a pleural effusion or lower lobe involvement makes M kansasii infection very unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Rice plant body is {{consisted}} of some ma t u red leaf sheaths and some growing young leaves, and the shoot apex {{exists in the}} most inner part of the plant body, i. e. the shoot apex is surrounded by those growing young leaves and matured leaf sheaths. In the plant body two kinds of <b>air</b> <b>space,</b> the interfoliar <b>air</b> <b>space</b> and the intercellular <b>air</b> <b>space</b> or lysigenic <b>air</b> <b>space,</b> exist. The former exists between matured leaf sheaths and growing young leaves, and the latter exists in matured leaf sheaths and in growing young leaves. The author thought that these <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> might have some effects on the growth of young leaves. In this study, the volume and percentage against the cross section of these <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> were examined. The following results were obtained. 1. Rice seedlings of 6. 0, 6. 3, 6. 5, 6. 7 and 7. 0 leaf stages were used to investigate the change of <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> {{from the beginning to}} the end of 1 plastochrone. The change of the volume of <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> within 1 plastochrone was great at the upper portion of the plant body and no significant change was observed at the basal portion. Each percentage of interfoliar and intercellular <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> against the cross section was little at the beginning of plastochrone and increased with the proceeding of plastochrone. 2. Rice seedlings of 3, 6 and 9 leaf stages were used to examine the change of <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> with the seedling growth. The volume of interfoliar <b>air</b> <b>space</b> in the plant body did not change with the growth of rice plant. On the other hand, the volume of intercellular <b>air</b> <b>space</b> somewhat increased with the growth of rice plant. The change of percentage of the <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> against the cross section with the growth of plant was the same as the volume of the <b>air</b> <b>spaces.</b> 3. The volume of interfoliar and intercellular <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> and the percentage of the <b>air</b> <b>spaces</b> against the cross section did not vary in three varieties (Norin No. 15; early maturing variety, Hoyoku and Norin No. 18; late maturing varieties). 4. The volume of interfoliar <b>air</b> <b>space</b> surrounding the shoot apex directly was almost the same in all cases. 1) イネ科植物において,葉と葉の間に存在する空隙を葉間空隙と呼ぶことにし,この空隙を葉の分化生長が行なわれる場であると考えた. 一方,葉の組織内に存在する空隙を葉内空隙と呼ぶことにし,これは葉間空隙および葉の分化生長に影響をおよぼす体内微環境の 1 つと考えた. そして,ここにおいては水稲を材料に用いてその実態を明らかにした. 2) 水稲葉鞘部各部位における全空隙(葉間空隙＋葉内空隙) のしめる割合は,部位 1 から 3 にかけて漸次増加したが,部位 4 でやや減少し,抽出葉の葉節部にあたる部位 5 でさらに減少して最少となり,部位 6, 7 では逆にやや増加する傾向がみられた. 3) 1 プラストクローン内における空隙の変動をみるために葉令 6. 0, 6. 3, 6. 5, 6. 7 および 7. 0 の 5 段階の水稲苗について調査した結果,葉鞘部上部においては大きかつたが生長点を直接とりかこむ空隙量は,葉令の変化に関係なくほぼ一定であつた. なお,全体としてみれば葉間空隙は 1 プラストクローンの始期では少なく,葉令がすすむにつれて増加する傾向がみられた. また,葉内空隙のしめる割合も葉令がすすむにつれて増加することがわかつた. 4) 苗令の違いによる空隙の変化を第 3 葉,第 6 葉および第 9 葉抽出時の苗について調査した結果,葉鞘部上部(部位 1 ～ 4) では葉間空隙にはほとんど差はなく,一方,葉内空隙は苗令がすすむにつれてそのしめる割合は増加する傾向がみられたが,第 6 葉抽出時の苗と第 9 葉抽出時の苗の間にはほとんど差がみられなかつた,葉鞘部基部(部位 5 ～ 7) においては葉間空隙と苗令との関係には一定の傾向はみられず,葉内空隙は葉令がすすむにつれて減少する傾向を示した. なお,生長点を直接にとりかこむ葉間空隙は第 3 葉抽出時で少なく,第 6 葉,第 9 葉抽出時では同じぐらいであつた. 5) 出穂期の異なる水稲品種間において,空隙の様相が変わるかどうかを農林 15 号,ホウヨクおよび農林 18 号を用いて調査した結果,葉間および葉内空隙のしめる割合は各部位において多少の違いはみられたが, 3 品種ともほぼ同じような傾向を示した. また,葉鞘部基部における葉間空隙を分解してみたところ,生長点ならびに分化後まもない稚葉をとりかこむ生長点近傍の空隙の量は 3 品種ともほぼ同じぐらいであつた. なお,生長のかなりすすんだ第(n+ 1),第n葉をとりかこむ空隙の量はホウヨクでやや多い傾向がみられた...|$|R

Four theories and approaches for establishing a delimitation between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> and outer space are examined. Spatial approaches include demarcation based on the division of the atmosphere into layers, demarcation based on aerodynamic characteristics of flight instrumentalities (von Karman Line), demarcation according to the lowest perigee of an orbiting satellite, and demarcation based upon the earth's gravitational effects. The functionalist approach is based on the delimitation or definition of the <b>air</b> space/outer <b>space</b> regime by the purpose and activities for which an object is designed in <b>air</b> <b>space</b> or outer space. The arbitrarist approach is supported by those who wish to draw an arbitrary line between <b>air</b> <b>space</b> and outer space.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} endogenous cortisol in the modulation of distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance in adult guinea-pigs.

After cortisol synthesis inhibition, distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance {{was measured by the}} increase in concentration of an instilled 5 % albumin solution after 1 h. Two days of metyrapone pretreatment resulted in a 46 ± 19 % decrease in plasma cortisol levels compared with control, which was paralleled by a 60 ± 13 % decrease in distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance. The Na+ channel inhibitor amiloride inhibited 40 ± 22 % of distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance in control animals but did not inhibit distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance in the metyrapone-pretreated group. Co-injection of dexamethasone prevented the inhibition by metyrapone and the amiloride sensitivity of distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance was greater than in control animals. After 7 days of metyrapone pretreatment, plasma cortisol levels and distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance were not significantly different from normal, but amiloride sensitivity was greater than in control animals (91 ± 37 %). Pretreatment with emetine, a protein synthesis inhibitor, reduced distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance in control animals and in dexamethasone-co-injected animals, but failed to inhibit distal <b>air</b> <b>space</b> liquid clearance after metyrapone pretreatment. Expression of the epithelial sodium channel α-subunit (αENaC) mRNA in lung tissue was decreased after 2 days of metyrapone pretreatment and after 7 days pretreatment or after co-injection with dexamethasone, αENaC mRNA expression was restored towards control levels.
