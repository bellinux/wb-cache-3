5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounds</b> through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

During the later stages of the advance, the battalion headquarters formed an ad-hoc group (Task Force Hail) to screen the southern flank of the division, commanding the battalion reconnaissance company and an infantry company from the division. They reached the Rhine on 25 March, and crossed the same night; the advance continued unbroken for several days.

25|$|The University of Hyderabad’s Study in India Programme (SIP) {{for foreign}} {{students}} {{began as a}} small experimental summer initiative where students from the University of Pittsburgh took nine credits over nine weeks {{in the summer of}} 1998.

The University Grants Commission (UGC), a governmental organisation in India tasked with determining and maintaining standards for university education, has hailed the Study in India Programme as a model initiative and has encouraged other universities in India to emulate the program’s approach. SIP’s strength is its flexibility and willing to innovate {{to meet the needs of}} universities and study abroad consortia. SIP has created specialised, tailor-made programs for partners such as Dartmouth College, Duke University and the Nordic Centre in India—a consortium of 15 Nordic universities. Students can apply on their own, through their home schools, or through study abroad consortia that are SIP partners.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} advance made in {{the early}} 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the secondary fermentation. Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused {{a considerable amount of}} carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounds.</b> During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|E

[...] Although Ponting extolled White in public, he once again often opted to use the part-time spin of Clarke before and more frequently than White throughout the series. [...] White's five wickets on the tour came at a bowling average of almost 70, and with Symonds named in Test squad to face New Zealand, there was no place in the squad for White.|$|E

The reviewers from the Japanese Shūkan Famitsū magazine, while giving the game an especially high score, noted that the gameplay could be considered insufficient compared to prior titles in the series. Bozon, while giving the game a more positive review than many others, felt that the thinness of the gameplay was bolstered by the multiplayer component, saying that [...] "the game's entertainment value goes up in <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounds</b> during multiplayer", a point with which Fahey agreed to a lesser extent.|$|E

500|$|The Final Symphony II concerts have {{received}} rave reviews from critics, who {{viewed it as}} a high-quality extension of the original Final Symphony concert series rather than a completely unique orchestral experience. A review of the premier concert in Bonn by Markus Roth of Video Game Music Online claimed that [...] "the Final Symphony series is a masterclass concert series, which easily lends itself to musical discussion and interpretation of the highest standards", and that the second concert series was the equal to the original. Joe Hammond of Video Game Music Online, {{in a review of}} the London performance, said that Final Symphony II [...] "wasn't reinventing the wheel or revolutionising what the team have already done, it was triumphantly expanding on previous success". He felt that the concert series was [...] "lighter and more accessible" [...] than the original due to its use of fewer and less complicated types of orchestral arrangements, and that Merregnon Studios did not [...] "try to push the boundaries" [...] but instead tried to [...] "expand on the success of the Final Symphony 1 programme with other games in the series", in his opinion successfully. Stephen Little of Cubed Gamers, reviewing the same concert, termed it [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "a pleasure to watch, listen and be involved in", while John Son of Cubed3 said that the concert was [...] "one of the best performances of video game music to have ever been showcased". A review of the Tampere concert by Nikolas Broman of Original Sound Version—his fifth Final Symphony II performance attendance—agreed with Hammond, stating that while he felt the original series was better, as it had more interesting arrangement styles and a more even quality, that audiences seemed to prefer the second series as [...] "the arrangements were safer, the melodies closer to the originals, and overall it was perhaps easier to follow". He felt that the Final Fantasy IX section was the best, with the Final Fantasy XIII section as the weakest as [...] "good... but nothing special". Regardless, he claimed that he could only compare Final Symphony II to the original series [...] "because it doesn't make sense to compare it to anything else. It is <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>bounds</b> above any other major game music concert series".|$|E
