40|$|Broadband digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) access for small business and residential customers {{is one of the}} most important new services currently being offered by network and service providers. To date, DSL service providers are still in need of an advanced <b>loop</b> <b>qualification</b> system that can minimize qualification errors. <b>Loop</b> <b>qualification</b> consists of determining whether a loop can support DSL services or not and, generally, the estimate of the loop transfer function is sufficient for such purposes. We propose here to solve a more ambitious problem: single ended automatic loop make-up identification (LMID), i. e. the determination of the length and the gauge of all loop sections (including bridged taps) via single-ended testing without human intervention. It is proposed here to use Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements, which are analyzed by a novel step-by-step ML algorithm, to achieve accurate LMID. This problem is equivalent to resolving via a single sensor experiment an unknown number of closely spaced echoes, some overlapping some not, which exhibit unknown amplitudes, unknown times of arrival and unknown shapes. 1...|$|E

The goal of the measurement system is to estimate the theoretical channel capacity of the local loop, which connects the customer premises (CP) to the central office (CO), based on TDR (time-domain reflectometry) measurements and noise PSD (Power Spectral Density) measurements at the CO. These measurements are processed using advanced digital signal processing (DSP), artificial intelligence (AI), and system identification to estimate the loop transfer function and noise PSD at the CP, which are needed for the estimation of the capacity.

Development is being conducted in order to achieve a high degree of realism and range of applicability of the simulation software, compatible with the expected cost reduction of the simulation hardware (ordinary PCs). The kinematics and dynamic models to support AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) simulation and testing with or without hardware-in-the-loop for Brazilian space missions are presented. Normally the dynamic equations are expressed in angular momentum components, due to the high complexity of these equations when derived in terms of the angular velocity. This, of course, is particularly important in satellites composed by several articulated rigid bodies as solar panels, robotic arms, space booms, deployable antennas, etc. Nevertheless, the inverse of the inertia matrix shall be calculated on the run, since it varies in time. This can be somewhat slow, mainly considering the high degree of freedom in dynamics of satellites with articulated panels and reaction wheels. In this case a more complex but fast set of equations in terms of the angular velocity is the best choice. This work describes the attitude dynamic equations expressed in angular velocities for satellites with appendages (solar panels, telescopes, directional antennas, etc.) and reaction wheels. They can be easily extended, however, to include nutation dampers and robotic arms. As usual, this formulation requires the knowledge of the acting torque in the connection joint, which is not always understood, modeled or known. So the dynamic model presented in this work uses the angular acceleration instead of the torque at the joint, which simplifies and reduces the order of the differential equations. Simulation results are presented, emphasizing the difference between the behavior of rigid body and articulated rigid bodies...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} single-storey {{structures for}} industrial buildings, made of {{an assemblage of}} precast components, have a large diffusion all over Europe, due to their low costs associated to a very good ser-viceability. In Italy they cover almost all the market of industrial buildings and an important percentage of commercial structures. In spite of the large use {{of this type of}} buildings, some uncertainties are still connected with their seismic behaviour. Since some years ASSOBETON, in close collaboration with Politecnico of Mi-lan and the ELSA Laboratory, participate actively to national and European research programmes devoted to the investigation of the seismic behaviour of precast structures. The first research project is dated 1994. As a part of the project twenty columns, characterised by different re-inforcement configurations and axial load, have been subjected to cyclic loads of increasing amplitude. The results of the experimental campaign demonstrated that precast columns are able to dissipate a large amount of energy up to important ductilities with stable <b>loops.</b> After the <b>qualification</b> of the seismic behaviour of sin-gle elements, a research programme aimed at demonstrating the equivalence between the behaviour factor of precast and cast in situ single-storey industrial buildings was carried out in collaboration with other associa-tions interested in the field. The results of the tests demonstrated the excellent capacity of precast buildings to behave during earthquakes without suffering important damage. The study of the seismic behaviour of single-storey precast buildings was extended to the investigation {{of the effects of the}} presence of cladding panels within the PRECAST STRUCTURES EC 8 project. The results of the study provided important data for the evaluation of the stiffening effect of panels together with information about the diaphragmatic behaviour of precast roofs. The results obtained within the previously mentioned research project will be extended to multi-storey structures as a part of the SAFECAST project recently financed by the European Commission. This paper is intended to provide an overview of the main results of these research projects. JRC. DG. G. 5 -European laboratory for structural assessmen...|$|R
