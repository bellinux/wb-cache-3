40|$|BACKGROUND: The City of Seattle has {{developed}} design guidelines to specifically address the <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail system under development by Sound Transit. The guidelines, entitled Seattle Design Guidelines for <b>Link</b> <b>Light</b> Rail, {{are being developed}} in two phases. The first phase contains design guidelines for the Royal Brougham and Lander stations, available as joint DCLU and SeaTran Director’s Rule 20 - 2000. Guidelines for the remaining stations in the <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail system will be prepared and made available by September 2000. As referenced in City Council Ordinance 119974 relating to the process to permit light rail transit facilities necessary to support {{the operation of the}} <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail system, the Director may impose conditions on Sound Transit during the permit process to ensure that its designs are consistent with the Seattle Design Guidelines for <b>Link</b> <b>Light</b> Rail. The guidelines therefore set the standards by which Link and related public improvements will be evaluated during the design, permit review, and construction process. The guidelines address site planning issues, streetscape compatibility, linkages, user comfort, an...|$|R

50|$|Major {{projects}} include producing trains for the Sound Transit Central <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail {{project in}} Washington state, USA.|$|R
50|$|Sound Transit's <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> {{rail system}} {{currently}} {{consists of two}} disconnected lines: Central Link between Seattle, Tukwila and SeaTac; and Tacoma Link between Tacoma Dome Station and downtown Tacoma. The system serves 22 stations and has a total of 21.95 mi of track. <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail trains carried 20 million passengers in 2016, or an average of 62,299 per weekday, making it the 11th-busiest light rail system in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 2023, Sound Transit {{will open}} its East <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line, with two stops in Bel-Red: Spring District/120th and Bel-Red/130th.|$|R
50|$|But {{by the end}} of 2002, Sound Transit {{decided on}} a route and became more financially stable. On August 22, 2003, the Tacoma <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line in Downtown Tacoma opened and quickly reached its {{forecast}} ridership. On November 8, 2003, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the Central <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line. Central Link opened between Westlake Station and Tukwila on July 18, 2009, and was extended 1.7 mi to SeaTac/Airport on December 19, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Downtown Redmond {{station is}} a {{proposed}} <b>Link</b> <b>Light</b> Rail {{station on the}} north side of Redmond Town Center shopping mall in downtown Redmond, Washington.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{expansion}} of Sound Transit services, a <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line to Issaquah from Bellevue is proposed to begin service by 2041.|$|R
50|$|In 2023, it will {{be served}} by an {{elevated}} light rail station on Sound Transit's Lynnwood Link Extension, part of the <b>Link</b> <b>Light</b> Rail system.|$|R
50|$|In 2023, it {{will become}} the eastern {{terminus}} of the Sound Transit East <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line and be renamed to Redmond Technology Center station.|$|R
50|$|SeaTac/Airport station {{would serve}} as the {{southern}} terminus of the <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail system until the opening of Angle Lake station on September 24, 2016.|$|R
50|$|Sound Transit and King County Metro rerouted many bus {{routes and}} added {{additional}} <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail service {{in anticipation of}} disruption to the city's transportation grid.|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, Sound Transit {{has begun}} {{demolition}} of some {{buildings in the}} neighborhood to construct the Roosevelt <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail station which will open for service in 2021.|$|R
50|$|The {{trail was}} {{constructed}} from the recycling of excavated soils and concrete from {{the construction of}} <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail along Martin Luther King Jr. Way in South Seattle.|$|R
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by light rail trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the transfer point between the north–south Central <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line and east–west East <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new line will include {{the construction of a}} turnback track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|R
5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{closure of}} the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel to buses in 2019 or 2020, forced by expanded <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail service as well as construction of an addition to the Washington State Convention Center at Convention Place station, will move route 41 to surface streets. In 2021, Sound Transit plans to begin operating <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail service to Northgate Transit Center {{as part of the}} Northgate Link Extension project. At that time, Metro plans to discontinue route 41 entirely and replace east–west service to Lake City with route 75.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, the Washington State Department of Transportation added {{a pair of}} high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) to Interstate 90 from Seattle to Bellevue, {{replacing}} the reversible express lanes. The express lanes were closed in June 2017 {{for the construction of}} the East <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail project, which will extend <b>Link</b> <b>light</b> rail service from Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond in 2023. On Mercer Island, WSDOT and Sound Transit are building direct access ramps to allow buses and HOVs to exit and enter I-90 from the HOV lanes.|$|R
