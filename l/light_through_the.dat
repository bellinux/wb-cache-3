5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

25|$|The {{propagation}} of <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> core of an optical fiber {{is based on}} total internal reflection of the lightwave.

25|$|Light {{confined}} in a resonator will reflect multiple times from the mirrors, {{and due to}} the effects of interference, only certain patterns and frequencies of radiation will be sustained by the resonator, with the others being suppressed by destructive interference.

25|$|Reflectors {{can also}} be used to {{selectively}} reduce or eliminate unwanted thermal emission. Incandescent lamps produce light through heating of the filament, while arc lamps produce <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heating and ionization of a gas. In either case, this heat is also emitted from the lamp as infrared light. The thermal energy is often projected onto the stage with the visible light, and thousands of watts of incandescent lighting can be uncomfortably hot for the actors on stage. Specially designed reflectors are able to absorb and dissipate infrared at the fixture before the visible light reaches the stage.|$|E

25|$|The reflex design {{scheme is}} the primary {{difference}} between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the view finder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> view finder – hence the name Single Lens Reflex. While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen {{to be used as}} an electronic viewfinder. However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.|$|E

Athletes are often concerned about endurance and intensity of exercise. Using the scientific technique of absorption spectroscopy with eight wavelengths of light. This method {{is similar to a}} pulse oximeter, which consists of a small sensing device that clips to the finger. The sensor uses light-emitting diodes that emit red and infrared <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tissue to a light detector, which then sends a signal to a processor to calculate the absorption of light by the hemoglobin protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works {{as symbols of}} service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen in a positive <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem , using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) {{is arguably the most}} famous donkey in Western literature.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing <b>light</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E
