5000|$|The idea of {{including}} {{the other in}} the self has been extended to include an entire ingroup in the self. An ingroup is an interdependent set of individuals with which a person identifies. The individual believes he or {{she is a member of}} this group. [...] In fact, several academic groups have found similar findings in the me/not me reaction time paradigm at a group level. [...] Participants showed a slower reaction time for traits that were incongruent between the self and ingroup. This was in comparison to quicker reaction times for traits that were congruent between the self and ingroup. The slow reaction times were consistent with the inclusion of the ingroup in the self claim as it suggested that the individual had included group characteristics in the self. As a result, there was difficulty recalling if a trait belong to the self or ingroup. Several researchers have examined the role of ingroup identification (i.e. a person's prolonged psychological connection to an ingroup) and self-expansion. In fact, Trop and Wright refined the meaning of ingroup identification and believed it was analogous to the inclusion of the ingroup in the self. The authors found that the degree of connectedness to the ingroup will affect confusion of self-descriptors. People who highly identified with an ingroup showed slower reaction times for self-descriptors that did not relate to the ingroup (this is consistent with previous findings). However, low ingroup identification lead to no differences in reaction times between whether or not the self-descriptors were also descriptive of the ingroup. This demonstrated that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with an ingroup can be conceptualized as the degree to which we will include the ingroup in the self.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the construction of}} a general theory for conditional models by making explicit the role of the exogenous randomness in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> conditional models. We start with a definition <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> in conditional models called weak identification, derived from the usual concept <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> in unconditional statistical models. A first theorem shows that such a natural definition coincides, under a separability condition, with that one repeatedly met in the statistical literature. The role of the exogenous randomness is next examined from two perspectives. Firstly by characterizing the probability that the realization of the exogenous variables provides the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the parameter of interest. We display a hierarchy <b>of</b> four <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> in conditional models and show that the weakest level may entertain rather peculiar properties, in particular {{about the role of the}} sample size. Secondly, we look at identification as a necessary condition for the existence of an estimator with suitable properties. Several theorems relate the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with the existence of estimators enjoying properties of unbiasedness or consistency at corresponding levels. Several examples illustrate these properties and conclusions are drawn concerning some implications for model building...|$|R

Also, in this condition, {{the impact of the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> on the ratings of psychologists proved to be mediated by the perceived typicality of the deviant.

40|$|International audienceCoral reefs {{around the}} world are facing {{increasing}} disturbance; however, the ability to monitor them is constrained by cost and experience factors. The Line Intercept Transect (LIT) method is usually used with an expert <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> (30 benthic categories and sometimes coral genera), but these are time-consuming, require a high level of expertise and are therefore expensive. Over the last 20 years, surveys performed by non-specialist volunteers have provided data for increasing numbers of reefs, using simplified sampling methods and more basic levels of identification. In between these extremes, new stakeholders (e. g. environmental assessment agencies, consultancy firms, marine nature reserves, etc.) requiring an intermediate level of expertise and resolution are now carrying out coral reef surveys. Across all levels, it is desirable to identify monitoring methods that optimize the data provided and the ease of implementation according to the users’ needs. In this study on surveys from Réunion Island collected between 2003 and 2013, we used multivariate analyses to compare four increasing levels of identification using the LIT method. For each level, we studied the structure of the benthic community and its spatial (reef flat vs. outer slope) and temporal (before vs. after a cyclone) variation. The most basic <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> showed differences between the reef flat and outer slope, but did not show a significant effect of the cyclone on the benthic community. The two highest levels of identification, both of which we rated ‘expert’, showed the highest differences in variation. The intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> supplied the same information as the expert levels, but required less effort and was therefore less expensive. Next, we compared the LIT with the Point Intercept Transect (PIT) method. At a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> appropriate to the interval used, PIT supplied an almost equivalent level of information as LIT, while reducing the time spent underwater. Thus, when managing coastal areas or carrying out impact studies to monitor disturbance, it may be useful to (i) perform surveys with an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> and (ii) using PIT rather LIT...|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} investigated {{the role of}} perceived similarity in cultural values (associated with diversity in cultural backgrounds) and an intercultural group climate in predicting identification with both the organization and the work team. The relevance of perceived similarity in cultural values for identification was shown in a questionnaire study among 124 employees from various organizations (Study 1). Study 2 among 75 employees from a diverse organization showed that perceived similarity in cultural values is positively related to identification with workgroups. In this vein, cultural diversity can hinder identification. Therefore, we focused on an intercultural group climate, in which cultural diversity is perceived as positive, as an alternative way to ensure employees' identification in diverse work groups. Results confirmed that employees report high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with both the organization and the work team, when the intercultural group climate is strong. In addition, when an intercultural group climate is strong, employees still report high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with the organization despite low perceived similarity in cultural values.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the entitativity of the ingroup moderates the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{identification}}</b> with the ingroup. Specifically, that high levels of entitativity are conducive to strong identification, whereas low levels of entitativity reduce identification with the ingroup. These hypotheses were tested across four studies using the European Union (EU) as the reference group. The four studies manipulated four different factors that, according to Campbell (1958), impact on group entitativity: common fate (Study 1), similarity (Study 2), salience (Study 3), and boundedness (Study 4). Across the four studies, we found evidence {{for the impact of}} these factors on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with the EU among European citizens holding moderate attitudes toward the EU but not (or much less) for citizens holding more extreme attitudes towards the EU. Mediational analyses further confirmed the viability of an entitativity-based interpretation {{of the impact of the}} manipulations on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> The findings are discussed in light of the current debate on the concept of entitativity, the motives for social identification, and the reduction of ingroup bias.

While the collegiate licensing business {{is expected to}} increase financial resources for the participating universities and textiles and apparel companies, little is known as to why people buy university licensed merchandise. Recently university alumni have been recognized as a substantial source of financial support for university (McAlexander, Koenig, & Schouten, 2006). In order to fill a gap in the current literature on collegiate licensing, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine key factors influencing university alumni's purchase decisions of university licensed merchandise. Using the theoretical framework of Social Identity Theory (Hogg, 2006) as well as the Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein, 1975), this study aimed to examine the relationships among <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with a university, integration with brand community, attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise, subjective norm, fan loyalty, and purchase behavior of university licensed merchandise. Online survey methods were used to examine the university alumni's purchasing behavior of university licensed merchandise. Recruitment emails containing the survey information and the link to the survey were sent to approximately 3, 000 randomly selected Oregon State University alumni from the Alumni Association. A total of 189 university alumni of Oregon State University participated in the online survey. The results showed that <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> was positively related to brand community and also to attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise. Integration with brand community was positively related to subjective norm and attitude. Furthermore, brand community was a significant mediator of the relationship between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and attitude. As hypothesized, fan loyalty was positively correlated with attitude. Attitude and subjective norm were found to be significant predictors of purchase behavior. These findings provide empirical evidence to support the importance of understanding why university alumni purchase university licensed merchandise. <b>Level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> university alumni have towards the university they attended affected their integration into a brand community and their attitude toward purchasing university licensed merchandise. Integration into a brand community was also found to be a mediator between <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and attitude. Results also showed that brand community has an effect on attitude and subjective norm. Purchase behavior was found to be influenced by attitude and subjective norm. Results showed that fan loyalty was influenced by subjective norm. Both retailers and those in charge of licensing at universities will benefit from this information.
