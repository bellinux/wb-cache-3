Hnaung revolted in 1595 during the Siamese siege of Pegu (Bago). His revolt started a string of other revolts by the major vassal states of the Toungoo Empire {{in the next two}} years. His attempts to take over territories beyond Prome's traditional vassals in the present-day Magwe Region were unsuccessful.

25|$|Despite his {{dependence}} on Syriam's revenues, Minye Thihathu did nothing when other rulers {{tried to take}} over the port.

Later in the year, the garrison came under siege by Binnya Dala, the Siamese appointed viceroy of Martaban, for seven months until May 1602. Binnya Dala then made peace with De Brito in a marriage of alliance between his daughter and De Brito's son Simon. All the while, Minye Thihathu kept a series of garrisons near Syriam and Martaban to prevent the warfare from spilling over but nothing else. By then, even the authority of the Arakanese king over the Portuguese led garrison was nominal. De Brito had been in contact with Aires de Saldanha, Viceroy of Goa, to make Syriam a Portuguese colony.|$|R
