40|$|Six {{types of}} blended <b>lenticular</b> {{aspheric}} <b>lenses</b> for the correction of aphakia were assessed {{with respect to}} mass, spectacle magnification, off-axis power errors, peripheral distortion, visual field size and cosmetic appearance. Relative to spherical surfaced lenses, these lenses showed considerably reduced mass, reduced peripheral distortion, increased visual field size and improved cosmetic appearance. All but one type showed considerably reduced off-axis power errors, {{but none of the}} lenses showed much reduction in spectacle magnification. In general, the manufacturers’ claims made in favour of the blended <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> were supported...|$|R

50|$|A <b>lenticular</b> <b>lens</b> is {{an array}} of {{magnifying}} lenses, designed so that when viewed from slightly different angles, different images are magnified. The most common example is the lenses used in lenticular printing, where the technology is used to give an illusion of depth, or to make images that appear to change or move as the image is viewed from different angles.|$|E
50|$|Currently, most flat-panel {{displays}} employ <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> or parallax {{barriers that}} redirect imagery to several viewing regions; however, this manipulation requires reduced image resolutions. When the viewer's head is {{in a certain}} position, a different image is seen with each eye, giving a convincing illusion of 3D. Such displays can have multiple viewing zones, thereby allowing multiple users to view the image at the same time, though they may also exhibit dead zones where only a non-stereoscopic or pseudoscopic image can be seen, if at all.|$|R
50|$|In {{stereopsis}} tests (short: stereotests), {{slightly different}} images are shown to each eye, such that a 3D image is perceived in case stereovision is present. This {{can be achieved}} by means of vectographs (visible with polarized glasses), anaglyphs (visible with red-green glasses), <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> (visible with the naked eye), or head-mounted display technology. The type of changes from one eye to the other may differ depending on which level of stereoacuity is to be detected. A series of stereotests for selected levels thus constitutes a test of stereoacuity.|$|R
50|$|The first image shows a cut which removed about 150 µm of {{the first}} lens, and which shows {{irregular}} cutting of the <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses.</b> The second image shows a cut which removed about 30 µm {{of the first}} lens. Defects in cutting such as these lead to a serious phase problem. In the printing press the image being printed is aligned relative {{to the edges of}} the sheet of material. If the sheet is not always cut in the same place relative to the first lenticule, a phase error is introduced between the lenses and the image slices.|$|R
50|$|The myodisc {{has been}} {{categorized}} as a <b>lenticular</b> <b>lens.</b> These are rarely prescribed sets of specialty lenses used {{in cases of}} extremely poor vision, or near blindness. The lenticular subrogate nomenclature has been extensively used in ophthalmology, requiring scope of context. Newer lens products {{can also be found}} using vague terminology. Low vision clinics in under-privileged cost-reducing centers list the myodisc for correction of high myopia.|$|E
50|$|Lenticular {{printing}} is a multi-step process {{consisting of}} creating a lenticular image from at least two existing images, and combining it with a <b>lenticular</b> <b>lens.</b> This process {{can be used to}} create various frames of animation (for a motion effect), offsetting the various layers at different increments (for a 3D effect), or simply to show a set of alternate images which may appear to transform into each other.|$|E
50|$|Integral imaging is an autostereoscopic or multiscopic 3D display, {{meaning that}} it {{displays}} a 3D image {{without the use of}} special glasses {{on the part of the}} viewer. It achieves this by placing an array of microlenses (similar to a <b>lenticular</b> <b>lens)</b> in front of the image, where each lens looks different depending on viewing angle. Thus rather than displaying a 2D image that looks the same from every direction, it reproduces a 4D light field, creating stereo images that exhibit parallax when the viewer moves.|$|E
40|$|A glassless type 3 D {{image was}} {{obtained}} in our lab {{by means of}} bonding the <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> array to the optically rewritable(ORW) electronic paper (E-paper). The two different but related images can be simultaneously seen by right eye and left eye respectively, thus forming the 3 D image in one's mind. Unlike other autostereoscopic 3 D LCDs, our glassless 3 D-ORW E-paper is actually a green technology which is without electrode and voltage. We can easily change a 3 D image by erasing and rewriting with photoalignment technology. The cost of the glassless 3 D-ORW E-paper is very cheap and the manufacture of it is simple...|$|R
40|$|This {{infinite}} {{moment is}} a series of three lenticular panels that each contains layers of highly saturated abstract colour swirls. As the viewer moves in front of the work, the <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> create a sense of movement within the frames, making visible various slices of multiple layers depending on their refraction through the lenses. The result is that from any given vantage point, one is unable to fully capture a single layer, and instead is offered an infinitely mutable field of abstract colour. This infinite moment continues Stevens’s ongoing interest in contemporary instruments of inner transformation and personal enlightenment. In a world increasingly consumed by quests for happiness and personal growth, This infinite moment brings together the means for both quiet contemplation and visual pleasure; it is an invitation to look blissfully and think deeply. Each of the three panels is subtitled with a positive affirmation, conjuring mantra-like repetition to aid processes of self-reflection. In addition, the shifting formal compositions actively combine the visual languages of abstract art and new age spiritualism, variously recalling colour-field painting, aura photographs, and psychedelic visualisations. In many ways, the sense of movement generated by the <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> gives material form to the impossibility of ever fully grasping the self and the present moment in their constant states of becoming. Through these means, This infinite moment invites modes of perceptual observation that are familiar to both artistic appreciation and meditation. Like the contemplation of a mandala or a colour-field painting, This infinite moment enables modes of private reflection that simultaneously draw attention to the present moment and open up a vast horizon of free association and thought. In so doing, This infinite moment seeks new manifestations of spiritual pursuit in today’s increasingly secularised and aestheticised contexts of art and self-reflection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Stereoscopic {{rendering}} and 3 D stereo dis-plays {{are quickly}} becoming mainstream. The natural extension is autostereoscopic multi-view displays, {{which by the}} use of parallax barriers or <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses,</b> can accommodate many simultaneous viewers without the need for active or passive glasses. As these displays, for the foreseeable future, will support only a rather lim-ited number of views, {{there is a need for}} high-quality interperspective antialiasing. We present a specialized algorithm for efficient multi-view image generation from a camera line using ray tracing, which builds on previ-ous methods for multi-dimensional adaptive sampling and reconstruction of light fields. We introduce multi-view silhouette edges to detect sharp geometrical dis-continuities in the radiance function. These are used to significantly improve the quality of the reconstruction. In addition, we exploit shader coherence by comput-ing analytical visibility between shading points and the camera line, and by sharing shading computations over the camera line...|$|R

5000|$|Autostereoscopy is any {{method of}} {{displaying}} stereoscopic images (adding binocular perception of 3D depth) {{without the use}} of special headgear or glasses {{on the part of the}} viewer. Because headgear is not required, it is also called [...] "glasses-free 3D" [...] or [...] "glassesless 3D". There are two broad approaches currently used to accommodate motion parallax and wider viewing angles: eye-tracking, and multiple views so that the display does not need to sense where the viewers' eyes are located.Examples of autostereoscopic displays technology include <b>lenticular</b> <b>lens,</b> parallax barrier, volumetric display, holographic and light field displays.|$|E

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} {{for a wide}} market acceptance of 3 D displays {{is the ability to}} switch between 3 D and full resolution 2 D. In this paper we present a robust and cost effective concept for an auto-stereoscopic switchable 2 D/ 3 D display. The display is based on an LCD panel, equipped with switchable LC-filled <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses.</b> We will discuss 3 D image quality, with the focus on display uniformity. We show that slanting the lenticulars in combination with a good lens design can minimize non-uniformities in our 202 ̆ 2 2 D/ 3 D monitors. Furthermore, we introduce fractional viewing systems as a very robust concept to further improve uniformity in the case slanting the lenticulars and optimizing the lens design are not sufficient. We will discuss measurements and numerical simulations of the key optical characteristics of this display. Finally, we discuss 2 D image quality, the switching characteristics and the residual lens effect...|$|R
40|$|A reduced-thickness backlighter for an autostereoscopic {{display is}} {{disclosed}} having a lightguide {{and at least}} one light source parallel to an edge of the lightguide so as to be substantially coplanar with the lightguide. The lightguide is provided with a first surface which has a plurality of reflective linear regions, such as elongated grooves or glossy lines, parallel to the illuminated edge of the lightguide. Preferably the lightguide further has a second surface which has a plurality of <b>lenticular</b> <b>lenses</b> for reimaging the reflected light from the linear regions into a series of thin vertical lines outside the guide. Because of the reduced thickness of the backlighter system, autostereoscopic viewing is enabled in applications requiring thin backlighter systems. In addition to taking up less space, the reduced-thickness backlighter uses less lamps and less power. For accommodating 2 -D applications, a 2 -D diffuser plate or a 2 -D lightguide parallel to the 3 -D backlighter is disclosed for switching back and forth between 3 -D viewing and 2 -D viewing...|$|R
