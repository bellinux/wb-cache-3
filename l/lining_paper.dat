She tested her designs on demonstration lengths of <b>lining</b> <b>paper.</b> Architects who saw these encouraged her to develop a hand-printed wallpaper business. This coincided with the 1960s expansion of DIY {{and the development of}} 'choose your own colour mix' vinyl emulsion paints which she used with hand-cut linoleum printing blocks. She won the Sanderson Centenary wallpaper prize but their subsequent commercial version, which had the regularity of a machine printed design, was far less restful to the eye than the subtle changes of pigment and pressure when done by her own methods. The artist always wanted her designs to be a sympathetic background on which to hang pictures. She continued to print her own designs {{with the help of a}} team of willing apprentices.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project presents {{new information about}} the permanence and durability of contemporary Korean handmade papers, explains the particular methods of traditional hanji papermakers while introducing the possibilities of utilizing the products of Korean papermills in conservation. Traditional Korean papermaking uses a unique technique, known as webal, to form a sheet which distributes fibers evenly in both directions theoretically resulting in less specific grain direction and an expansion/contraction rate which is even in both directions. In addition, Korean paper employs an exclusive use of paper mulberry known as chamdak or dak {{in contrast to the}} typically mixed fiber furnish of Chinese papers. Like most East Asian papers, the pH of Korean paper is alkaline or neutral. The typical alkalis used to prepare fibers are soda ash (Na 2 CO 3) or caustic soda (NaOH). A variety of contemporary samples of Korean papers have been artificially aged and evaluated according to TAPPI standards {{under the direction of the}} Research and Testing Laboratory of the Library of Congress. This project will present interesting data concerning tensile strength, brightness, and pH before and after aging as well as expansion and contraction measurements. The results are very promising for the possibility of using Hanji for conservation treatment. One of the suggested advantages of using Hanji may be in the lack of strong grain direction providing a stable and non competing repair or <b>lining</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|E
40|$|Paper manuscripts {{are among}} the most {{valuable}} historical artifacts, but they are also very fragile. Furthermore, they were often strengthened by gluing external materials (like wooden or cardboard <b>lining</b> <b>paper)</b> to the original piece and the used glue underwent to structural transformations that accelerates the degradation processes of the artwork itself. Wet cleaning {{is one of the most}} important and critical steps in a paper artwork restoration process, and in the last years innovative cleaning methodologies have been proposed based on application of suitable hydrogels. Unfortunately often, to remove contaminants from paper artworks like glues or hydrophobic material components, additional specific procedures are required. In this work we present innovative multi-component materials able to remove in a single, simple and not invasive treatment, specific contaminants from paper artworks. The materials are based on rigid Gellan hydrogel; after investigating the cleaning ability of the Gellan gel “per se”, indeed, we also evaluated the possibility of using Gellan gel as a carrier of tuned cleaning agent. More in detail, Gellan hydrogel carrying alpha-amylase or proteinase K enzymes has been applied on several paper samples to remove starch paste or animal glues respectively. In this system, the enzyme works as selective cleaning agent, hydrolyzing not easily removable glues into smaller fragments soluble into the gel, which, in turn, plays the role of support and removal matrix for the enzymatic products. Finally, Gellan gel could be a not suitable agent to remove hydrophobic contaminants, due to its hydrophilic nature; to this end, we performed preliminary experiments by preparing a “mixed Gellan gel” carrying opportune polimeric surfactants. To assess the effectiveness and safety of the proposed cleaning method on the several samples under examination, we have employed a multitechnique approach, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and pH measurements...|$|E
