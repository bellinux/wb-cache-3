50|$|<b>Leno</b> <b>weave</b> (also called Gauze weave or Cross weave) is a weave {{in which}} two warp yarns are twisted around the weft yarns to provide a strong yet sheer fabric. The {{standard}} warp yarn is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these twisted warp yarns grip tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. <b>Leno</b> <b>weave</b> produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads.|$|E
50|$|Karamiori or Japanese <b>Leno</b> <b>Weave</b> {{includes}} all loom techniques that {{make use of}} intertwining threads to create {{the structure of the}} weave. Karamiori is an old and highly respected textile production method. The Japanese divide karaori into three basic styles based on structure: sha (紗), ro (絽), and ra (羅). Sha is the basic <b>leno</b> <b>weave,</b> Ro adds additional areas of flat or twill weaves and Ra maintains the concept of twisted threads but allows both warp and weft to be freed and recombined to form highly intricate weaves.|$|E
50|$|To {{produce a}} <b>leno</b> <b>weave</b> the loom is {{threaded}} with the warp yarn and a doup yarn together. The doup yarn {{can be of}} similar or lesser weight and strength. The weft is woven in and for each weft shuttle the warp yarns are twisted interchangeably to produce a figure of eight pattern.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{documented in}} this thesis investigates the potential of <b>leno</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics to be developed for outdoor seating use, and to understand the influence that hand-­‐weaving of these fabrics has on the design process for the commercial textile designer. It investigates the potential of hand <b>woven</b> <b>leno</b> fabrics to be aesthetically pleasing and yet meet the physical requirements for a seating material exposed to the external climatic conditions. Themes of, material change over time and fabrics that blend into the landscape are explored {{through a series of}} samples produced on a handloom using a range of manmade and natural fibres. Contemporary weave practitioners, artists, product designers and an analysis of the current uses of leno fabrics has informed and guided the direction of this research. The hand <b>weaving</b> of doup-­‐controlled <b>leno</b> fabrics employing a mix of monofilament and wool yarns has resulted in the creation a range of dynamic, stable and open net-­‐likeructures that could be suspended within a seating frame. It has been demonstrated that this method of fabric production is capable of producing strong yet flexible substrates whose design successfully reflects the beauty in colour and forms found within the landscape. Reflection on the relationship between the handcraft of weaving, and the decision-­‐making process and knowledge of the textile designer has been recorded. The resulting knowledge of the design process and the insight into the mechanics of <b>leno</b> <b>weaving</b> on a table loom, are to be built into a programme of undergraduate workshop and weave theory lectures. This research has grown out of an interest in the slow decay of abandoned textiles in the landscape and forms a starting point for the exploration of how climatic conditions might affect the physical and visual appearance of a fabric used outdoors...|$|R
50|$|Filet lace is {{the general}} word used for all the {{different}} techniques of Embroidery on Knotted Net (or in French Broderie sur Filet Noué). It is a hand made needlework created by weaving or Embroidery using a long blunt needle and a thread on a ground of knotted net lace or Filet Work made of square or diagonal meshes of the same sizes or of different sizes. Lacis uses the same technique but is made on a ground of <b>Leno</b> (a <b>woven</b> fabric) or small canvas (not a knotted lace).|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the {{interest}} of scientists and practitioners towards increasing the performance of natural fibers as a reinforcement for composite materials, is constantly growing. Bast fibers, such as flax and hemp, offer biodegradability, low weight, good heat and sound insulation properties, and could offer an eco-friendly alternative to glass fibers. These could be replaced by basalt fibers due to similar chemical composition and resistance to high temperatures, strength and durability {{in a range of}} usages. Our research is focused on development of natural fiber reinforcement types and optimization of textile reinforcement based on <b>Leno</b> <b>woven</b> architecture. Flax and hemp yarns with linear density ranging from 105 to 1619 Tex, basalt fibers (linear density 68 / 2 Tex) were used to develop woven reinforcement structures with surface density between 102 and 606 g/m 2. Ultimate loads for samples from bast fibers range from 340. 6 N (105 Tex hemp yarns) and 376. 5 N (436 Tex hemp/ 66 / 2 Tex flax yarns) to 1108. 9 N (1619 Tex and 66 / 2 Tex flax yarns) and 1265. 4 N (1619 Tex flax/ 25 / 4 Tex cotton yarns). In contrast, samples including also basalt fibers range from 604. 1 N (68 / 2 Tex basalt/ 105 Tex hemp yarns) and 559. 6 N (68 / 2 / 2 Tex basalt/ 25 / 4 Tex cotton yarns) to 891. 4 N (68 / 2 / 2 Tex basalt / 277 Tex flax yarns). Among those hybrid fabric laminates the highest dimensional stability during tensile loading is shown by basalt/cotton yarns...|$|R
50|$|<b>Leno</b> <b>weave</b> fabric allows {{light and}} air {{to pass through}} freely so are used in any area where a sheer, open weave fabric is {{required}} that will not bruise (where the threads shift away from their woven uniformity disturbing {{the beauty of the}} weave). If a simple in-and-out flat weave were woven very loosely to achieve the same effect the threads would have a tendency to this bruising. Leno weaves are often used for window treatments and for sheer layers for fine clothing. When made with glass fibre or other strong yarns or when permeated with a strengthening compound it can be used as an engineering material in construction, though due to the openness of the fabric if a solid covering is required it is often used in conjunction with other weave styles.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using porous composite materials (Kevlar, Doweave, and <b>Leno</b> <b>Weave)</b> as lightweight, efficient laminar flow control (LFC) surface materials {{is compared to}} the metallic 319 L stainless Dynapore surfaces and electron beam drilled composite surfaces. Areas investigated include: (1) selection of the LFC-suitable surface materials, structural materials, and fabrication techniques for the LFC aircraft skins; (2) aerodynamic static air flow test results in terms of pressure drop through the LFC panel and the corresponding effective porosity; (3) structural design definition and analyses of the panels, and (4) contamination effects on static drop and effective porosity. Conclusions are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Provision of {{innovative}} treatment solutions to various problems {{has always been}} the motto of medical scientific brains. Dentistry is no exception to this endeavor. The acceptance of advances in material science has really helped this cause. Ribbond is one such material, which has occupied an important place in the dentist's repertoire. It is bondable fibre reinforced material, made from the same ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and ceramic fibers used to make bulletproof vests. The key to Ribbond's success is its patented <b>leno</b> <b>weave.</b> Designed with a lock-stitch feature, it effectively transfers forces throughout the weave without stress transfer back into the resin, providing excellent manageability characteristics. Having virtually no memory, Ribbond adapts to the contours of the teeth and dental arch. It is translucent, practically colorless and disappears within the composite or acrylic without show-through offering excellent esthetics. Ribbond's fibers are the standard in biocompatibility. The same material is also used in the construction of artificial hip and knee joints. By virtue of such wide spectrum of intended properties, it enjoys varied applications in day to day dentistry like: endodontic posts,periodontal splints, aesthetic space maintainers,bondable briges and single bridges and orthodontic retainers. This paper is an attempt to showcase the versatility and applicability of this wonderful material in day-to-day dental practice...|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the <b>leno</b> (or gauze) <b>weave,</b> all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this paper has grown out of a personal interest in the slow decay of abandoned textiles in the landscape and forms {{a starting point for}} the exploration of how climatic conditions might affect the physical and visual appearance of fabrics sited outdoors. Woven fabrics might respond to stimulants from the local environment, such as temperature or humidity, or the material memory of the cloth. Can <b>woven</b> <b>leno</b> fabrics be aesthetically pleasing, and be developed for use in an outdoor context? Themes of material change over time and fabrics that blend into the landscape are explored through a series of doup-leno samples produced on a Harris handloom using a range of manmade and natural fibres. Handwoven fabrics developed to mimic net-like structures observed in the landscapes of West Yorkshire and Wester Ross were created to produce dynamic yet stable structures in monofilament, viscose and wool. Exploring the notion that, in the case of “artists working directly in fibre and textile, the hand becomes the articulate sensor" (Seelig, 2005). Observations on the contrasting relationship between the handcraft of weaving, and the decision-making process and knowledge developed by a commercial textile designer have been documented throughout the process. The work of contemporary weave practitioners, artists, product designers and an analysis of the current uses of leno fabrics have informed and guided the direction of this research. The blend of the best of new material innovation and traditional craftsmanship echoes the approach of Patricia Urquiola (designer) whose work combines creative invention with a passion for {{research in}}to handcrafts. This research aims to reinterpret historical styles and techniques into fresh contemporary textile products, ultimately aimed at outdoor use...|$|R
40|$|A {{specific}} type of knowing comes from the handling of materials in the handcrafting of an artifact. This research looks at {{the relationship between the}} handcraft of weaving, and the decision-making process and knowledge of the textile designer. It investigates the potential for new design opportunities to be opened up for the commercial designer by moving out of the studio and back into the workshop environment. As an educator, manager and formerly a designer trained in textile design, this research explores an established industrial production method of weaving but revisited using a craft-like approach. Slowing down the creative process to engage with the materials themselves, this paper starts to explore the potential of hand <b>woven</b> <b>leno</b> structures to be used within the landscape and to explore the process of change in response to environmental factors. Architect Philip Beesleys’ work seeks to achieve a balance with nature, submitting itself to the natural cycles and inevitable decay, in which he deliberately designs mesh structures with weak and fragile links, whose materials soak up environmental forces. This paper starts to further explore the value of haptic intelligence and empathy for materials, also adopted by Beesley in his Haystack Veil (1997) and later Holozoic series. The process of creating leno structures on a handloom, has resulted in outcomes difficult to predict using digital software, confirming weaving as an emergent system (Philpott, 2011), where disparate threads are combined into dynamic structures. There is a delicate relationship between textiles and the landscape, in response to which the designer of performance fabrics is required to create, indestructible solutions, with a lifetime guarantee. By embracing the science of uncertainty, fresh ideas and new solutions have the potential to be created...|$|R
40|$|A {{piece of}} unusual fabric that is shiny black {{on one side}} and red-brown on the other laid {{unidentified}} among the Chinese textiles in the University of Rhode Island (URI) Historic Textile and Costume Collection for over half a century. Abby Lillethun’s interest in analyzing mud silks brought this cloth, identified as Xiang-yun-shā, from obscurity to notoriety. Its most obvious feature is the two-colored surfaces created by first dyeing the fabric and then coating one side with black mud as described in the preceding papers by Lillethun and Lin. The selvage of the URI fabric, seen from the backside in figure 1, has some iron-rich mud along the edge and some stitching holes from a previous use. The geometric leno-weave pattern creates a key design with a little openness in the structure. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrograph in figure 2 shows some open spaces {{on either side of the}} diverted warps of the <b>leno</b> <b>weave</b> that run diagonally across the picture. This backside of the fabric has some mud deposits, but the black front side that is in figure 3 has a heavy coating of mud that covers the yarns completely. The treated fabric does not need to be beaten or calendared; the dried surface of the mud is quite shiny. The textile’s hand is firm and somewhat stiff. A similarly colored plain-weave fabric makes up a contemporary pair of pants designed with the black side facing out except at the waistband, which has the brown dyed side exposed (pictured in Lillethun article). This newer fabric, which is named Jiāo-chou and could be up to 80 years younger than the URI fabric, has a lighter deposit of mud (Fig. 4), but still has a crisp hand. The mud coating contains carbon, silicon, calcium, iron, and aluminum—not an unusual combination of materials for mud and the same composition as the other coatings analyzed for this report...|$|E
