25|$|Tivat Airport is {{assigned}} 4D classification by ICAO, airspace class D, and is {{noted for its}} challenging approach and landing procedures. Landing at Tivat is considered demanding due to hilly terrain surrounding the valley in which the airport is situated, and strong prevailing crosswinds. Runway 32 approach requires a descent into the valley of Tivatsko polje, and a 20° turn for runway alignment just before <b>landing.</b> <b>Runway</b> 14 approach is even more challenging, because of the circle to land maneuver executed in the dramatic scenery surrounding the Bay of Kotor. It is known among pilots as the European Kai Tak because of its tricky approach and landing procedures. Passengers are awarded spectacular views of the bay, the surrounding mountains and a low flyby over Porto Montenegro luxury yacht marina. The airport is also popular among plane spotters, as end of the runway is easily accessible and offers unobstructed views of takeoffs and landings, with a scenic mountain backdrop.|$|E
25|$|When runway {{alternation}} was introduced, aircraft generated {{significantly more}} noise on departure than when landing, so {{a preference for}} westerly operations during daylight was introduced, which continues to this day. In this mode, aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over London, thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas. Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and departing aircraft to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the <b>landing</b> <b>runway</b> and 09R the departure runway due to {{the legacy of the}} now rescinded Cranford Agreement, pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.|$|E

2500|$|As Flight 2605 {{approached}} Mexico City International Airport, Mexican {{air traffic}} controllers cleared it for an instrument approach using the ILS of Runway 23L, with an expected <b>landing</b> <b>runway</b> of 23 Right. [...] With runway 23L closed for maintenance, what {{air traffic controllers}} expected Flight 2605 {{to do was to}} perform what is known as a sidestep maneuver to the (open) runway 23R. [...] This meant that the flight was to follow the instrument landing system's glide path toward Runway 23L, and, as soon as they sighted Runway 23 Right through the cockpit window, they would reorient their aircraft to land on it instead. [...] Between the time of their beginning the approach and the crash, they were advised that the <b>landing</b> <b>runway</b> was 23R four times by approach control or the tower. In any event, the phrase [...] "sidestep" [...] or [...] "sidestep approach" [...] common aviation parlance in the United States [...] was never used by Mexico air traffic controllers to describe the approach to Flight 2605. There was no published visual representation of the sidestep approach available to the pilots. Text remarks for the sidestep approach to 23R described only ceiling and visibility minimums.|$|E
2500|$|The Trident had a complex, {{sophisticated}} and comprehensive avionics fit which {{was successful in}} service. This comprised a completely automatic blind landing system developed by Hawker Siddeley and Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It was capable of guiding the aircraft automatically during airfield approach, flare, touchdown and even roll-out from the <b>landing</b> <b>runway.</b> The system was intended to offer autoland by 1970. In the event, it enabled the Trident to perform the first automatic landing by a civil airliner in scheduled passenger service on 10 June 1965 and the first genuinely [...] "blind" [...] landing in scheduled passenger service on 4 November 1966.|$|E

With this impact, the wing fuel tanks ruptured, spilling fuel and causing the fire. The survivors left aircraft by the door behind the cockpit and through openings in the fuselage. Due to the impact, emergency exits could not be opened, and a large amount of smoke accumulated in the cabin. The pilot, who survived the accident, could not organize nor conduct the passengers evacuation.|$|E
