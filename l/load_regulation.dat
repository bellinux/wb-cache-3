During fall, the NPP is not operational due to maintenance; therefore, the thermal power plants operate to provide the base load capacity, and also to meet the peak electricity demand in winter.|$|E
40|$|Low Dropout Regulators (LDRs) are {{commonly}} used in high performance applications due to their low noise, fast transient response characteristics. In LDR design, frequency response {{is the most important}} issue in the regulator performance. With conventional LDR, the bandwidth varies with load current. Thus, the regulator cannot satisfy the speed specification for wide load current range. Besides, due to the compensation characteristics, this design is unreliable and imprecise for high performance application. In this thesis, a new pole-zero tracking frequency compensation is proposed. A tracking zero is generated to cancel out the load current dependent pole. A low frequency dominant pole is also introduced to boost up the DC gain. With this compensation scheme, the frequency response becomes load current independent and the performance can be optimized for wide load current range. The precision is much higher due to the large DC loop gain. Reliability is ensured since the compensation only depends on well-controlled parameters and the ratio of the same component. A LDR using the proposed frequency compensation scheme is designed using a 0. 35 μm CMOS process. Load current varies from 0 μA to 100 mA. Simulation results show that the proposed design features a bandwidth variation of 2. 5 times as opposed to over 10, 000 times in conventional design. The 96 dB minimum DC loop gain leads to an excellent line and <b>load</b> <b>regulations</b> of 0. 67 mV/V and - 0. 43 μV/mA, respectively. Finally, a low power version of the proposed LDR compensation scheme is designed and fabricated. The bandwidth variation is 2. 3 times and the minimum DC gain is 72 dB. Measured line and <b>load</b> <b>regulations</b> are 0. 5 mV/V and - 6. 1 μV/mA, respectively...|$|R

50|$|An LDO is {{characterized}} by its drop-out voltage, quiescent current, <b>load</b> <b>regulation,</b> line regulation, maximum current (which is decided {{by the size of}} the pass transistor), speed (how fast it can respond as the load varies), voltage variations in the output because of sudden transients in the load current, output capacitor and its equivalent series resistance. Speed is indicated by the rise time of the current at the output as it varies from 0 mA load current (no load) to the maximum load current. This is basically decided by the bandwidth of the error amplifier. It is also expected from an LDO to provide a quiet and stable output in all circumstances (example of possible perturbation could be: sudden change of the input voltage or output current). Stability analysis put in place some performance metrics to get such a behaviour and involve placing poles and zeros appropriately. Most of the time, there is a dominant pole that arise at low frequencies while other poles and zeros are pushed at high frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|The Sola Hevi SCP {{series is}} a typical {{switching}} supply with approximately similar output specifications to the Lambda above. The family has a <b>load</b> <b>regulation</b> of ≤ 0.5% at [...] "10…90…10%" [...] nominal Iout. Defining the load change in terms of current is strictly the same as defining load change in resistance change. The [...] "10…90…10%" [...] specification states that the minimum load is 10% of maximum current and the full load is 90% and the specification test includes taking the load back to 10%. If we take the SCP 30D312, which has a 5 V, 3 A output equivalent to the Lambda example above, 10% of maximum load is 10% × 3 A = 300 mA minimum load, and 90% × 3 A = 2.7 A for full load. At 5 V output, full load is 5 V / 2.7 A = 1.85 Ω and minimum load is 5V / 300 mA = 16.7 Ω.

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a low−cost 90 W flyback switching power supply for a multi−sync color monitor. In order to minimize the screen interference from the switching noise, the power supply can be automatically synchronized at the fixed frequency of the horizontal scanning frequency (15 to 32 kHz) of the color monitor. The line and <b>load</b> <b>regulations</b> of the power supply are excellent. Also, a new universal input−voltage adaptor enables the power supply to operate at two input voltage ranges, 90 − 130 Vac or 180 − 260 Vac. It can minimize the ripple current requirement of the input bulk capacitors and the stresses on the power switch. The design demonstrates how to use recently introduced components in a low−cost power supply.
