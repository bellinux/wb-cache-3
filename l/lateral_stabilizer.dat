40|$|Background: Modifications defined to ease bending of {{the support}} bar and <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{placement}} during minimal invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) have not been reported. We herein report our experience with MIRPE including several technical modifications. Methods: A total of 87 patients who underwent MIRPE were evaluated retrospectively. Technical modifications are (1) a template drawn preoperatively according to the anthropometric measurements, (2) more laterally placed thoracal incisions, (3) single existing incision for multiple support bars, (4) to secure lateral stabilizers to support bar in inverted position. Results: The mean patient age was 11. 2 ± 3. 8 years. The mean operating time was 63. 7 ± 18. 7 min. The mean Haller index was 5. 4 ± 2. 1. Eight patients necessitated two support bars. The support bars were removed in 69 patients {{after the completion of}} treatment. Support bars were left in place 26. 8 ± 4. 3 months. Final chest contours of the 56 patients were evaluated as 12 months passed after support bar removal and excellent repair results were determined in 84. 2 %. Conclusion: Preoperative bending {{of the support}} bar according to anthropometric measurements and fixation of the lateral stabilizers to the support bar in inverted position facilitates bar shaping and <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> placement...|$|E
40|$|Medial {{patellofemoral}} instability is a rare, disabling {{condition that}} {{is often associated with}} the wrong indication for lateral retinacular release or overcorrection with medializing tibial tubercle osteotomy. It is an even less common complication after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The lateral patellofemoral ligament is an important <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of the patella against medial subluxation or dislocation. Until now, no report in the literature has described lateral patellofemoral ligament reconstruction with a free gracilis tendon autograft. Furthermore, {{there has not been a}} single case report of lateral patellofemoral ligament reconstruction after TKA. The authors describe a novel technique for reconstruction of the lateral patellofemoral ligament in a symptomatic medial subluxated patella resulting from TKA and extended lateral release in a 62 -year-old patient. The result 1 year postoperatively was deemed successful. Clinically, the patella was stable, with correct tracking, and radiologically the patella was correctly positioned. With a technique similar to that used for the medial patellofemoral ligament, the lateral patellofemoral ligament can be reconstructed with a gracilis tendon autograft to permit stabilization independent of resting scar tissue of the lateral retinaculum. This operation can be performed in a minimally invasive way, without opening the joint, therefore decreasing the risk of joint infection. The authors showed a successful clinical and radiologic outcome 1 year after lateral patellofemoral ligament reconstruction in a patient with medial patellar instability after TKA and lateral release...|$|E
50|$|Ostracoderms {{existed in}} two major groups, the more {{primitive}} heterostracans and the cephalaspids. The cephalaspids were {{more advanced than}} the heterostracans in that they had <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizers</b> for more control of their swimming.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{electrical}} activity of the Tensor fascia lata (TFL) and Vastus lateralis (VL) muscles as <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and the Vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle as medial stabilizer of the patella in athletes with and without patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Eleven healthy athletes (4 women, 7 men) and 9 athletes with PFPS (3 women, 6 men) ranging in age from 20 to 30 years performed the submaximal isometric knee extension contraction initiated from 45 °of flexion and an extended position to 30 ° and 15 °angles. The activation amplitude of the TFL, VL and VMO muscles were quantified from the recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals. The results showed that Electrical activity of the VMO muscle at 30 ° and 45 ° angles for the patients was significantly greater than those of the control subjects. No significant differences were demonstrated in VMO: VL and VMO: TFL across all knee flexion angles between groups. However, the mean value of the ratio of VMO: (TFL + VL) at an angle of 30 ° for the subjects with PFPS was significantly greater than that of the control group. It may be assumed that the higher electrical activity of the VMO at 30 ° angle in PFPS patients is an effort to prevent more lateral patella tracking. Since the TFL and VL muscles produce lateral force on the patella, both of them should be studied for consideration of <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizers</b> of the patella in the patients with PFPS...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of mechanised logging and log skidding on some components of farm tractors used under the Tractor Hiring Units (THU) of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty tractors of various makes and models were examined after a period under logging operations based on a template of eight key criteria and thirty four sub criteria related to vital tractor systems and components. Data collected were analysed to determine {{the percentage of the}} components that are good, damaged but repairable or damaged or missing parts. The results show that the highest occurrence of failure are with worn out tyres (80 %), followed by broken rear work lights, headlamps and road warning lights (60 %) and broken <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizers</b> (53. 3 %). Similarly, the least damaged components of tractors under the study were the tyre rims (66. 7 % good), wheel hubs and axle arms (56. 7 %) and hydraulic linkage arms and forks as well as brake pedal travel and release (46. 7 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The fibrous {{components}} of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint including the palmar plate, the collateral ligament and the dorsal plate were studied with particular attention paid to the fibrous structure of the fibrous tendon sheath and the deep transverse metacarpal ligament. The tough fibrillar structure around the MP joint, especially the force nucleus, consisted of three types of mixed fibers: the fibrous tendon sheath of the A 1 pulley, the deep transverse metacarpal ligament, and the palmar plate. The tendon sheath was located on the ulnar side in the index and middle fingers, on the central position in the ring finger, and on the radial side in the little finger. These fibrous connections among the fingers formed a transverse arch in the hand. The palmar plate of the MP joint was relatively rigid and appears {{to function as a}} cushion when flexed. A fold-like protrusion of the synovial layer of the palmar plate of the MP joint had a meniscoid function, which was larger than that of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The capsule of the MP joint was thicker at the dorsal area, forming a dorsal plate, which is a sliding floor of the extensor mechanism and has a meniscoid function for joint congruity. The main <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> consisted of collateral ligaments and accessory collateral ligaments anchored to the palmar plate. These structures act together as a &# 34;phalangeal cuff&# 34;, connecting the proximal phalanx to the metacarpal head and sta</p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Since the {{introduction}} of the Nuss technique for pectus excavatum (PE) repair, stabilization of the bar has been a matter of debate and a crucial point for the outcome, as bar dislocation {{remains one of the most}} frequent complications. Several techniques have been described, most of them including the use of a metal stabilizer, which, however, can increase morbidity and be difficult to remove. Our study compares bar stabilization techniques in two groups of patients, respectively, with and without the metal stabilizer. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective study on patients affected by PE and treated by the Nuss technique from January 2012 to June 2013 at our institution was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of metal stabilizers. Group 1 included patients who did not have the metal stabilizer inserted; stabilization was achieved with multiple (at least four) bilateral pericostal Endo Close™ (Auto Suture, US Surgical; Tyco Healthcare Group, Norwalk, CT) sutures. Group 2 included patients who had a metal stabilizer placed because pericostal sutures could not be used bilaterally. We compared the two groups in terms of bar dislocation rate, surgical operative time, and other complications. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included in the study: 37 in Group 1 and 20 in Group 2. Two patients from Group 2 had a bar dislocation. Statistical analysis showed no difference between the two groups in dislocation rate or other complications. Conclusions: In our experience, the placement of a metal stabilizer did not reduce the rate of bar dislocation. Bar stabilization by the pericostal Endo Close suture technique appears to have no increase in morbidity or migration compared with the metal <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> technique...|$|E
40|$|GAP- 43 is an {{intracellular}} growth-associated {{protein that}} appears to assist neuronal pathfinding and branching during development and regeneration, and may contribute to presynaptic membrane changes in the adult, leading to the phenomena of neurotransmitter release, endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, long-term potentiation, spatial memory formation, and learning. GAP- 43 becomes bound via palmitoylation {{and the presence of}} three basic residues to membranes of the early secretory pathway. It is then sorted onto vesicles at the late secretory pathway for fast axonal transport to the growth cone or presynaptic plasma membrane. The palmitate chains do not serve as permanent membrane anchors for GAP- 43, because at steady-state most of the GAP- 43 in a cell is membrane-bound but is not palmitoylated. Filopodial extension and branching take place when GAP- 43 is phosphorylated at Ser- 41 by protein kinase C, and this occurs following neurotrophin binding and the activation of numerous small GTPases. GAP- 43 has been proposed to cluster the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate in plasma membrane rafts. Following GAP- 43 phosphorylation, this phospholipid is released to promote local actin filament-membrane attachment. The phosphorylation also releases GAP- 43 from calmodulin. The released GAP- 43 may then act as a <b>lateral</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of actin filaments. N-terminal fragments of GAP- 43, containing 10 - 20 amino acids, will activate heterotrimeric G proteins, direct GAP- 43 to the membrane and lipid rafts, and cause the formation of filopodia, possibly by causing a change in membrane tension. This review will focus on new information regarding GAP- 43, including its binding to membranes and its incorporation into lipid rafts, its mechanism of action, and how it affects and is affected by extracellular agents...|$|E
40|$|Chronic rupture of both tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis is rare. Thus, it is {{difficult}} to diagnose and often overlooked. Since the peroneal tendons are the primary evertors of the foot and function as <b>lateral</b> ankle <b>stabilizers,</b> their rupture results in ankle sprain. We present a case with dynamic supination deformity during ambulation and hindfoot varus induced by chronic rupture of both tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis. We treated the patient with split anterior tibial tendon transfer and Dwyer calcaneal osteotomy. The dynamic supination deformity during ambulation and the hindfoot varus were improved, but a dorsal bunion remained, which was suggestive of residual dysfunction of the tendon of the peroneus longus...|$|R
40|$|Patella {{stabilizer}} muscle {{response and}} patellar kinematics were evaluated in 19 women with anterior knee pain (AKP) and 20 healthy women during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) with the knee positioned at 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees flexion during open (OKC) and closed (CKC) kinetic chain exercises. Patellar kinematics was evaluated through patellar tilt and displacement, and the electrical activity of patellar stabilizers through the {{root mean square}} normalized during MVIC and OKC with the knee at 90 degrees flexion. Data revealed that the vastus medialis oblique muscle (VMO) was more active {{in the control group}} compared to the AKP group during OKC exercises with the knee at 45 degrees flexion. However, no difference in the patellar kinematics was observed between these groups; nevertheless, the correlation between these parameters also showed, with the knee at 45 degrees flexion, that lateral patellar tilt increase was associated with a reduction in the activity of <b>lateral</b> patellar <b>stabilizers</b> in the control group and with an increase in the VMO activity in the AKP group. In conclusion, electrical activity {{is an important factor in}} evaluating AKP and in AKP treatment evolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Summary:. Even a mild {{degree of}} {{postoperative}} deviation {{of the nasal}} dorsum and/or columella from the midsagittal plane could be enough to displease a patient. Postoperative judgment of the nasal dorsum and the columellar positioning on the midsagittal plane is somewhat of a subjective decision determined by the surgeons’ naked eye. Most innovations tend to evolve from necessities. The risk and reality of misjudging the positioning for both the nasal dorsum and/or the columella led me to develop a device for the objective measurement of the midsagittal axis of the nose. I have called it the rhinoplasty setsquare device. This device is made from 316 quality stainless chrome. It is completely sterilizable. It consists of 4 main parts. During the finishing touches of the operation, the correct placement of the rhinoplasty setsquare device will provide the surgeon with an objective decision that will help make the positioning of the nasal dorsum and the columella more precise. When I conducted my research on literature and device catalogs for possible devices designed for measurement in rhinoplasty operations, I ran into devices such as the Castroviejo caliper, calibrated <b>lateral</b> crus <b>stabilizer,</b> Joseph measuring rod, and Thorpe Marchac caliper. All of them are unique in their function and design. However, as far as I could see, there is no device similar in form and function to my rhinoplasty setsquare device. I have been using this device for 8 months for all my rhinoplasty patients. I am more confident now in my postoperative results due to its objective measurement of the midsagittal line...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Falls are {{a common}} problem among older adults, {{including}} those who are relatively healthy and living independently. Exercise has been recommended as an intervention to reduce falls by slowing and/or reversing age-related declines in balance, strength, and mobility. However, it remains unclear which types or combinations of programs are most effective. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether exercise programs performed by healthy older adults were associated with superior balance, strength, and functional mobility measures that are pertinent to fall prevention. This study compared three distinct groups: participants of a balance- and strength-focused training program (i. e., Better Bones and Balance®), participants engaged in a general walking program, and sedentary individuals. Balance was measured using the Sensory Organization Test composite score and sensory ratios. Isometric strength of the <b>lateral</b> hip <b>stabilizers</b> (i. e., abductors and adductors) was measured in terms of maximum voluntary contraction and rapid torque production. Rapid torque measures included contractile impulse and rate of torque development evaluated at 0 - 100 ms and 0 - 300 ms from contraction onset. Functional mobility was measured by the time to complete the Four Square Step Test. Hip abduction contractile impulse (0 - 300 ms) was 1. 905 Nm*s and 1. 539 Nm*s higher for the Better Bones and Balance (BBB) group compared to the walking and sedentary groups, respectively. No differences were found among the groups for any of the hip adduction torque measures or Sensory Organization Test balance scores. The BBB group completed the Four Square Step Test faster than the walking and sedentary groups by 0. 90 s and 1. 06 s, respectively. In conclusion, participation in the balance- and strength-focused training program was associated with superior performance in some measures of strength and functional mobility that may be important for fall prevention...|$|R
40|$|Lateral ankle sprain is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} injury in soccer athletes. Enhanced by the variety of soccer cleats and by increased use of artificial turf, {{the interaction between the}} ground and the footwear has taken high importance as a lateral ankle sprain risk factor. The higher incidence of injuries {{in the second half of}} the match reflects the need of studying this interaction during tasks involving muscle fatigue. To evaluate the influence of different soccer cleats on kinetic, kinematic and neuromuscular ankle variables in artificial turf under two conditions: with and without fatigue of <b>lateral</b> ankle dynamic <b>stabilizers.</b> Study design: Experimental study within-subjects design. Twenty-four healthy athletes participated in this study. All subjects performed three sets of five medial-lateral unipodal jumps, each one with one of three models of cleats (Turf, Hard and Firm ground) on two conditions: with and without fatigue induced by the isokinetic dynamometer. The electromyographic activity of long and short peroneal heads, ground reaction forces and the movement of the rear-foot were collected and used to calculate kinematic (ankle eversion/inversion, centre of pressure displacement and velocity), kinetic (loading rate of the ground reaction forces) and neuromuscular variables (activation time of peroneal muscles). With the exception of decreased peroneal activation time with the Hard ground model (without fatigue vs. with fatigue), no statistically significant differences were identified in the ankle variables, between cleats, neither between the two evaluated conditions. In healthy soccer athletes, the contributor variables for ankle sprain were not influenced by the kind of soccer cleat in a functional test on a third generation artificial turf. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
