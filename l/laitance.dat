50|$|Excess {{water in}} newly placed {{concrete}} {{rises to the}} surface. This bleed water carries with it the finest aggregate and <b>laitance,</b> making it much softer than the slab's core. It also increases the water to cement ratio, which further weakens the surface. Densifiers address this problem by binding to available lime in a pozzolanic fashion, creating additional cementitious material and strengthening the surface. It {{is important to note}} that densifier cannot improve weak/sub-standard concrete to satisfactory levels.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Leander, my lord, {{has been}} {{dressing}} dinners for a week: dinners, I will be bound to say, which were never equalled in the Imperial kitchen, and the duke has {{never made a}} single observation, or sent him a single message. Yesterday, determined to outdo even himself, he sent up some escalopes de <b>laitances</b> de carpes à la Bellamont. In my time I have seen nothing like it, my lord. Ask Philippon, ask Dumoreau, {{what they thought of}} it! Even the Englishman, Smit, who never says anything, opened his mouth and exclaimed; as for the marmitons, they were breathless, and I thought Achille, the youth of whom I spoke to you, my lord, and who appears to me to be born with the true feeling, would have been overcome with emotion. When it was finished, Leander retired to his room--I attended him--and covered his face with his hands. Would you believe it, my lord! Not a word; not even a message. All this morning Leander has waited in the last hope. Nothing, absolutely nothing! How can he compose when he is not appreciated? Had he been appreciated, he would to-day not only have repeated the escalopes à la Bellamont, but perhaps even invented what might have outdone it. It is unheard of, my lord. The late lord Monmouth would have sent for Leander the very evening, or have written to him a beautiful letter, which would have been preserved in his family; M. de Sidonia would have sent him a tankard from his table. These things in themselves are nothing; but they prove to a man of genius that he is understood. Had Leander been in the Imperial kitchen, or even with the Emperor of Russia, he would have been decorated!' ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the laboratory measurement of shear interface properties between asphalt pavement and concrete bridge deck using the shear test. The main factors affecting shear strength are interface frictional resistance and adhesive stress from material of waterproof layer. Firstly, we simplify {{the whole system}} by considering the asphalt pavement as an elastic layer and the cement concrete deck a rigid base. And make a sensitivity analysis on interface contact state and the material modulus of waterproof layer. The maximum shear stress increases as interface contact state changes from continuous to smooth and as modulus of waterproof layer material decreases. Secondly, an interface shear experiment is conducted with the application of portable shear apparatus. With interface shear strength as evaluation indicator, shear strength of different interface treatments is arranged in descending order, i. e. cleaning up <b>laitance</b> and spreading aggregate between layers; only cleaning-up laitance; leaving the surface untreated. While the descending order for shear strength of different waterproof materials can be listed as follows: SBS modified asphalt, penetration grade of 70 asphalt. Therefore, based on the laboratory test results, {{it is recommended that}} before applying waterproof adhesive layer, <b>laitance</b> and dust on concrete deck surface should be cleaned up and keeping it dry. And the material for waterproof adhesive layer should be SBS modified asphalt with one-size aggregate of 4. 75 mm- 9. 5 mm spreading on...|$|E
30|$|While {{enclosed}} in moulds, samples remained in a damp environment, creating favorable {{conditions for the}} formation of early stage hydration products. Lithomex samples were kept in moulds for 24  hours and Conserv samples for 72  hours. Lithomex manufacturer’s guidance does not indicate the need to keep the material damp; this may indicate the presence of water retaining additives, although, if present, these are not declared in the manufacturer’s data. However, hydraulic lime mortars are required to be kept damp to ensure the progression of hydration reactions [7, 18] and this was the approach taken with the Conserv samples. When removed from the moulds both Lithomex and Conserv mortar prisms were lightly rubbed with a tungsten carbide abrasive pad. This process was undertaken to open the pore structure and remove <b>laitance</b> that is understood to inhibit carbonation in lime mortars [38]. All specimens were cured in a stable laboratory environment of nominally 55 % relative humidity and 20 °C until the time of testing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyses}} {{the results}} of several series of tests performed on composite concrete-steel slabs. The objectives of the tests are to: 1) determine the bending moment capacity 2) study the different failure modes 3) compare the theoretically calculated bending moment with the experimentally tested bending moment. The following variables {{are included in the}} test series: 1) length of the composite slabs, 2) width of the composite slab 3) thickness of the composite slab 4) steel plate cross sectional dimensions (width and thickness), 5) number of bonded steel plates and 6) loading configurations applied onto the simply supported slab (mid span line load or third span line load to simulate uniformly distributed loads). The reinforcing bars within the composite slab were kept the same for all series of tests. The composite concrete-steel slabs were formed by bonding steel plates to the soffits of reinforced concrete slabs by means of epoxy glue. In order to obtain full composite action the epoxy glue between the concrete slab and steel plate must be able to transfer the generated shear forces. To achieve the bond between the concrete and steel plate surfaces, the bonded surfaces had to be roughened. The concrete surfaces were roughened by either exposing the main concrete aggregate using brushes, chiselling the concrete paste layer to expose the main aggregate or by scabbeling the cement <b>laitance</b> to expose the main aggregate as per the epoxy supplier’s specifications. The mild steel plates were sand blasted with a dry grid to a white metal finish in order to obtain a 100 - 140 micron blast profile as per the epoxy supplier’s specification. Pro-StructLV low viscosity epoxy adhesive was used to bind the epoxy to the concrete surface and Pro-Struct 617 NS non-sag epoxy was used to bind the steel to the concrete surface. In tests where full composite action between the steel plates and the concrete slabs was realised, an increase of up to 200 % in the bending moment capacity of the slab was realised. The composite concrete-steel slabs failed either by debonding of the steel plate(s), flexural bending or vertical shearing of the composite syste...|$|E
