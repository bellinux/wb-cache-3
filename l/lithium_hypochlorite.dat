50|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> is the colorless, {{crystalline}} {{lithium salt}} of hypochlorous acid with the chemical formula of LiClO. It {{is used as}} a disinfectant for pools and a reagent for some chemical reactions.|$|E
50|$|Doses of 500 mg/kg cause {{clinical}} signs and significant mortality in rats. The use of chlorine-based disinfectants in domestic water, although widespread, {{has led to}} some controversy due {{to the formation of}} small quantities of harmful byproducts such as chloroform. Studies showed no uptake of lithium if pools with <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> have been used.|$|E
50|$|The {{alkali metal}} salts {{decrease}} in stability down the group. Anhydrous <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> is stable at room temperature; however, sodium hypochlorite has not be prepared drier than the pentahydrate (NaOCl·(H2O)5). This is unstable above 0 °C; although the more dilute solutions encountered as household bleach possesses better stability. Potassium hypochlorite (KOCl) is known only in solution.|$|E
40|$|Hydroxylation or ketonization of alkanes is {{achieved}} using <b>lithium</b> or sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> {{in the presence}} of catalytic amounts of ruthenium(II) complexes in a biphasic dichloromethane-water system, at room temperature. The oxidation of cyclooctane is first order both in substrate and in catalyst: a kinetic isotope effect (k(H) /k(D)) = 5. 6 was measured using cyclohexane-d 12. A discussion is included concerning the origin of the different regioselectivities...|$|R
40|$|Toxicity of {{hydrazine}} {{to early}} life stages of {{several species of}} California brown algae was demonstrated to occur at environmentally relevant concentrations. Effects of hydrazine on benthic organisms had not been previously studied. Preliminary studies evaluated toxicity of boric acid, chlorine (as <b>hypochlorite),</b> <b>lithium</b> ion, tributyltin chloride and Zn(II). A reliable bioassay technique was developed using digital image analysis to measure vegetative growth inhibition of brown algal gametophytes. Hydrazine toxicity threshold of Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes was almost constant in 10 96 -hour experiments, ranging from 3 - 5 ppb (96 - 160 nM). Differences in resistance to short-term hydrazine exposures were observed among three algal families of the order Laminariales. Two of three tested {{members of the family}} Alariaceae, Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea were among the most resistant species tested. The three tested species in the family Lessoniaceae, Macrocystis pyrifera, Nereocystis luetkeana and Pelagophycus porra, all fast-growing canopy-formers, were among the most sensitive tested species. Tested representatives of the family Laminariaceae varied in resistance. Laminaria farlowii was resistant. Laminaria dentigera and Laminaria ephemera were fairly sensitive. Hydrazine autoxidation rates varied by an order of magnitude in seawater sampled from different locations. Rates showed strong temperature dependence. Autoxidation at 10 °C and below was much slower and indicated a higher activation energy than autoxidation at 20 °C and above. Undiluted trace hydrazine powerplant emissions from a time period when algal community composition changed in the vicinity of an outfall were compared to growth inhibition results from multivariate hydrazine toxicity experiments on Macrocystis gametophytes. Results indicated that several trace hydrazine discharges were of sufficient duration and concentration to have inhibited algal microscopic stages...|$|R
50|$|Stability is the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} formation of hypochlorite salts and many simply cannot be formed. Only <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> LiOCl, calcium hypochlorite Ca(OCl)2 and barium hypochlorite Ba(ClO)2 have been isolated as pure anhydrous compounds, all of which are solids. A wider variety of compounds exist in aqueous solution and in general the greater the dilution the greater their stability.|$|E
5000|$|Coffee furnone was {{synthesized}} in 1963 by Wynberg via acid-catalyzed {{ring closure}} of β-alkoxy diazoketones. Coffee furanone {{has also been}} prepared via the condensation of ethyl lactate and methyl acrylate in DMSO solution and (under phase transfer conditions) in ionic liquids. A related lactic acid synthesis was described as having the advantages of a simple process, high conversion rate, low pollution, and low cost. [...] This compound has also been prepared in acceptable yield via oxidative hydroxylation of the 2-acetylbutyrolactone. Further approaches to the synthesis of coffee furanone involved the hydrolysis of the corresponding dithioketals and the oxidation of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran employing <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> {{in the presence of}} ruthenium catalysts.|$|E
5000|$|Values can {{be higher}} than 100% because {{hypochlorite}} ion have higher oxidation state (+1) than chlorine(0) and so high oxidation power [...]Percent active chlorine values have now virtually replaced the older system of chlorometric degrees: 1% active chlorine is equivalent to 3.16 °Chl. Taking the (reasonable) assumption that all active chlorine present in a liquid bleach {{is in the form}} of hypochlorite ions, 1% active chlorine is equivalent to 0.141 mol/kg ClO&minus;(0.141 mol/L if we assume density=1). For a solid bleach, 100% active chlorine is equivalent to 14.1 mol/kg ClO&minus;: <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> has a molar mass of 58.39 g/mol, equivalent to 17.1 mol/kg or 121% active chlorine.|$|E
50|$|Swimming pools can be {{disinfected}} with {{a variety}} of chlorine-releasing compounds. The most basic of these compounds is molecular chlorine (Cl2); however, its application is primarily in large commercial public swimming pools. Inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds frequently used in residential and public swimming pools include sodium hypochlorite commonly known as liquid bleach or simply bleach, calcium hypochlorite and <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite.</b> Chlorine residuals from Cl2 and inorganic chlorine-releasing compounds break down rapidly in sunlight. To extend their disinfectant usefulness and persistence in outdoor settings, swimming pools treated with {{one or more of the}} inorganic forms of chlorine-releasing compounds can be supplemented with cyanuric acid—a granular stabilizing agent capable of extending the active chlorine residual half-life (t½) by four to sixfold. Chlorinated isocyanurates, a family of organic chlorine-releasing compounds, are stabilized to prevent UV degradation due to the presence of cyanurate as part of their chemical backbone.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Mn(III) porphyrin-catalyzed epoxidation of olefins by <b>lithium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> is examined. The active oxidant {{is thought to be}} a high-valent manganese-oxo complex. It is shown that a relatively stable intermediate is reversibly formed upon interaction of the olefin and the oxo complex. The decomposition of this intermediate to Mn(III) porphyrin and epoxide is the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. Some analogies to the biochemical epoxidation of olefins catalyzed by cytochrome P- 450 are discussed...|$|E
