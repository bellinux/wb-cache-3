60|$|After {{dinner the}} two men walked on deck together. The night was dark, but fine, with a strong wind blowing from the north-west. The deck steward called their {{attention}} to a long <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> stealing up from the horizon on their starboard side.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the long}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> {{along the shore}} disappeared, and {{something}} thick, heavy and soft fell over Bertha's head. An arm was thrown round her, and Anna pressed tightly against her. In vain she struggled. There was a faint, strange smell, and she lost consciousness.|$|E

60|$|They {{neither of}} them moved. The {{atmosphere}} had suddenly become charged with a force indescribable, almost numbing. In the far distance they saw the level <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> from a passing steamer. Mr. Raymond Greene, {{with his hands in}} his ulster pockets, suddenly spotted them and did for them what they seemed to have lost the power to do.|$|E
60|$|The blind flew {{up at his}} touch. On {{the other}} side of the street was a row of houses over which they looked. Beyond, the river, whose dark waters were gleaming in the moonlight. On their left were the Houses of Parliament, all illuminated. On their right, the long, double <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> shining upon the water at which they had gazed so often.|$|E

60|$|They {{walked out}} of the shadows and up a long sloping path until Sandgate, as a little <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights,</b> came into view below. Presently they came out upon the brow and walked {{together}} (the band playing with a remote and sweetening indistinctness far away behind them) towards the cliff at the end. They stood for a little while in silence looking down. Melville made a guess at his companion's thoughts.|$|E
60|$|He wheeled the easy-chair up to {{the window}} which he had flung wide open. He placed a cushion {{at the back of her}} head and left her with a cheerful word. She heard his steps go down the corridor, the rattle of the lift as it descended. Then her lips began to tremble and the sobs to shake her shoulders. She held out her hands toward that <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> at which he had pointed, and her fingers were clenched.|$|E
60|$|John walked restlessly to {{the window}} and gazed at the curving <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> along the Embankment. This was the end, then--the end of his strenuous days, the end of his ideals, the end of a love-story which had made life for a time seem so wonderful! He could hear them talking about him in a few days' time--the prince's subtle sneer, the jests of his acquaintances. And Louise! His heart stopped for a moment as he tried to think of her face when she heard the news.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a little}} murmur of assent. The four men were seated {{together}} in the wonderfully decorated saloon of what was, beyond doubt, a most luxurious yacht. Through the open porthole were visible, every few moments, as the yacht rose and sank on the swell, the long <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> which fringed the shore between Monte Carlo and Mentone; the mountains beyond, with tiny lights flickering like spangles in a black mantle of darkness; and further round still, the stream {{of light from the}} Casino, reflected far and wide upon the black waters.|$|E
60|$|He {{unlocked}} the door and resumed his promenade of the deck. In the bows he stood for some time, leaning with folded arms against a pillar, his eyes fixed upon the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> ahead. The great waves now leaped into the moonlight, the wind sang in the rigging and came booming across the waters, the salt spray stung his cheeks. High above his head, the slender mast, with its Marconi attachment, swang and dived, reached out for the stars, and fell away with a shudder. The man who watched, stood and dreamed until the voyage was almost over. Then he turned on his heel {{and went back to}} see how his cabin companion was faring.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} room. Hamel looked after {{her for a}} moment with a frown. In some indescribable way, the woman half impressed, half irritated him. She had always the air of keeping {{something}} in the background. He followed her out on to the little ridge of beach, a few minutes after she had left. The mist was still drifting about. Only a few yards away the sea rolled in, filling the air with dull thunder. The marshland was half obscured. St. David's Hall was invisible, but like strangely-hung lanterns in an empty space he saw the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> from the great house gleam through the obscurity. There was no sound save the sound of the sea. He shivered slightly. It was like an empty land, this.|$|E

6000|$|Tavernake, {{with his}} hands thrust deep in his {{overcoat}} pockets, left the hotel and strode along the Strand. Some fancy seized him before he had gone many paces, and turning abruptly to the left he descended to the Embankment. He {{made his way to}} the very seat upon which he had sat once before with Beatrice. With folded arms he leaned back in the corner, looking out across the river, at the curving <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights,</b> at the black, turgid waters, the slowly-moving hulk of a barge on its way down the stream. It was a new thing, this, for him to have to accuse himself of folly, of weakness. For the last few days he had moved in a mist of uncertainty, setting his heel upon all reflection, avoiding every issue. To-night he could escape those accusing thoughts no longer; to-night he was more than ever bitter with himself. What folly was this which had sprung up in his life--folly colossal, unimaginable, as unexpected as though it had fallen a thunderbolt from the skies! What had happened to change him so completely! ...|$|E
6000|$|About two in {{the morning}} they saw a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights,</b> which the {{fisherman}} informed them was from the town of Worthing. Again before daybreak they scudded past another and far brighter and larger area of twinkling points, which marked the position of Brighton. They were nearly half-way upon their journey already. As the dawn approached the dark storm-clouds gathered away to the northern horizon and lay in a great shadow over the coast. On all other points the sky was clear, save that here and there a single puff of white vapour sailed along like the feather of some gigantic bird floating in the ocean of air. These isolated clouds, which had been pearly grey {{in the dim light of}} early day, gradually took a lilac tint, which deepened into pink, and then blushed suddenly to a fiery scarlet as the red rim of the sun rose majestically over the horizon. All the heaven was filled with colour from the palest, lightest blue at the zenith to the most brilliant crimson in the east, as though it were nature's palette on which she had dashed every tint that she possessed. The sea reflected the rich glow, and the tossing waves were gashed with scarlet streaks. [...] "It looks like a sea of blood," [...] the merchant remarked with a shudder, as he gazed at the wonderful spectacle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was, as I have said, in {{the very}} act of posting my copy at the pillar-box, and of glancing as I did so up the {{glittering}} curve of Pembridge Road, studded with the lights of Wilson's men. I don't know what made me pause to examine the matter, but I had a fancy that the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights,</b> where it melted into the indistinct brown twilight, was more indistinct than usual. I was almost certain that in a certain stretch of the road where there had been five lights there were now only four. I strained my eyes; I counted them again, and there were only three. A moment after there were only two; an instant after only one; and an instant after that the lanterns near to me swung like jangled bells, as if struck suddenly. They flared and fell; and for the moment the fall of them was like the fall of the sun and stars out of heaven. It left everything in a primal blindness. As a matter of fact, the road was not yet legitimately dark. There were still red rays of a sunset in the sky, and the brown gloaming was still warmed, as it were, with a feeling as of firelight. But for three seconds after the lanterns swung and sank, I saw in front of me a blackness blocking the sky. And with the fourth second I knew that this blackness which blocked the sky was a man on a great horse; and I was trampled and tossed aside as a swirl of horsemen swept round the corner. As they turned I saw that they were not black, but scarlet; they were a sortie of the besieged, Wayne riding ahead.|$|E

5000|$|In a subplot, {{after finding}} a {{typewriter}} {{in the school}} dumpster, Snoopy decides {{to write a novel}} about the World War I Flying Ace, trying to save Fifi from the Red Baron with Woodstock and his friends' help, using the key events and situations surrounding Charlie Brown as inspiration to develop his story. He ends up acting out his adventure physically, pulling himself across a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> and imagining it as a rope across a broken bridge, he comes across Charlie Brown and the gang several times along the way. Snoopy defeats the Red Baron and rescues Fifi from an airplane. When Lucy finishes reading, she calls it the dumbest story she has ever read, so Snoopy throws the typewriter at her in retaliation and kisses her nose causing her to run away in disgust yelling that she has [...] "dog germs".|$|E
50|$|As well as {{operating}} searchlights for {{the coastal}} defence guns, the RE fortress companies began to operate {{them in the}} Anti-Aircraft (AA) role as the war progressed and raids by airships and fixed wing bombers became more frequent. The North East coastal towns of England were particularly hard hit by Zeppelins during 1915 and 1916, and by mid-1916, the North Riding and East Riding Fortress Engineers had combined to provide the personnel for No 3 (Yorkshire) AA Company, RE. Later a barrage <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> was organised up the East Coast with the North Riding Fortress Engineers providing No 36 (North Riding) AA Company at Middlesbrough. By May 1918 the Tees AA Defence Control formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At {{this stage of the}} war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from the AA defences and sent to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front All TF units were demobilised in 1919 after the Armistice with Germany.|$|E
