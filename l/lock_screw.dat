40|$|Background: Proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> {{deformation}} {{and screw}} fracture is a frequently seen problem for femur interlocking nailing that affects fracture healing. We {{realized that there}} is lack of literature for the right level for the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw.</b> We investigated the difference of <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between the application of screws on different proximal femoral levels. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 80 proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> for eight groups, 10 screws for each group. Three-point bending tests were performed on four types of screws in two different trochanteric levels (the lesser trochanter and 20 mm proximal). We determined the yield points at three-point bending tests that a permanent deformation started in the <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> using an axial compression testing machine. Results: The mean yield point value of 5 mm threaded <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied 20 mm proximal of lesser trochanter was 1022 ± 49 (range 986 – 1057) (mean ± standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval). On the other hand, the mean yield point value of {{the same type of}} <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> applied on the lesser trochanteric level was 2089 ± 249 (range 1911 – 2268). Which means 103 % increase of screw resistance between two levels (P = 0. 000). In all screw groups, on the lesser trochanter line we determined 98 – 174 % higher than the yield point values of the same type of <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> in comparison with 20 mm proximal to the lesser trochanter (P = 0. 000). Conclusion: According to our findings, there is twice as much difference in <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> bending resistance between these two application levels. To avoid proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> deformation, <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> should be placed in the level of the lesser trochanter in nailing of 1 / 3 middle and distal femur fractures...|$|R

40|$|Background: Primary total elbow {{arthroplasty}} (TEA) is {{a challenging}} procedure for orthopedic surgeons. It is not performed {{as frequently as}} compared to hip or knee arthroplasty. The elbow is a nonweight-bearing joint; however, static loading can create forces up to three times the body weight and dynamic loading up to six times. For elderly patients with deformity and ankylosis of the elbow due to posttraumatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or comminuted fracture distal humerus, arthroplasty {{is one of the}} option. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the role of primary total elbow arthroplasty in cases of crippling deformity of elbow. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 11 cases of TEA, between December 2002 and September 2012. There were 8 females and 3 males. The average age was 40 years (range 30 - 69 years). The indications for TEA were rheumatoid arthritis, comminuted fracture distal humerus with intraarticular extension, and posttraumatic bony ankylosis of elbow joint. The Baksi sloppy (semi constrained) hinge elbow prosthesis was used. Clinico-radiological followup was done at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly basis. Results: In the present study, average supination was 70 ° (range 60 - 80 °) and average pronation was 70 ° (range 60 - 80 °). Average flexion was 135 ° (range 130 - 135 °). However, in 5 cases, there was loss of 15 to 35 ° (average 25 °) of extension (45 °) out of 11 cases. The mean Mayo elbow performance score was 95. 4 points (range 70 - 100). Arm length discrepancy was only in four patients which was 36 % out of 11 cases. Clinico-radiologically all the elbows were stable except in one case and no immediate postoperative complication was noted. Radiolucency or loosening of ulnar stem was seen in 2 cases (18 %) out of 11 cases, in 1 case it was noted after 5 years and in another after 10 years. In second case, revision arthroplasty was done, in which only ulnar hinge section, hinge screw and <b>lock</b> <b>screw</b> with hexagonal head were replaced. Conclusion: Elbow arthroplasty remains a valuable option for deformed and ankylosed elbows especially in the demanding patients with crippling deformity of the elbow...|$|E

This thesis investigates and determines the best construct with special <b>locking</b> and non-locking <b>screws</b> under both axial and torsion loading. Twenty femur constructs were assembled with 2 cm osteotomy gap between femur shaft and condyle, bridged with 4. 5 mm - 10 holes condyle plates. Femurs were divided in to 4 groups according to screw types and where they were placed. All screws were tightened to 4 Nm torque with a torque meter. Axial loads of - 50 N to - 700 N and ± 5 degree rotation were applied for 50, 000 cycles. Loosening torques of screws, stiffness and displacement of constructs were measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on <b>locking</b> plate and <b>screws</b> based on computed tomography images and Solidworks models. Analytical simulations were run under static and limited dynamic conditions were investigated with the experimental results. Axial load was applied and stresses induced were measured on the simulated models. <b>Locking</b> <b>screw</b> increased the torsional resistance of adjacent non-locking screw. Deformation and torsional stiffness in constructs with two <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> were higher compared to one <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> after 50, 000 cycles. <b>Locking</b> <b>screws</b> increased flexibility of the constructs allowing reduction in osteotomy gap.

The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the bone regions engaged by the <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> of a Proximal Humeral Nail (MultiLoc PHN), and to evaluate the influence of peri-screw bone quality on bone-nail construct stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cadaveric humeri were divided into two groups. The distal locking part of the PHN was fixed to the specimens. The nails were removed and the bones scanned using HR-pQCT. Bone properties were evaluated at the locations where the proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> would have been positioned after complete instrumentation. A three-part fracture model was used for mechanical testing of the instrumented bones, considering axial displacement and varus deformation as parameters of interest. RESULTS: The secondary <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> targeted bone volumes in the posteromedial part of the humerus with statistically significant higher quality, thus reducing varus deformation. Significant correlation was found between axial displacement and bone properties at the primary proximal screws.

40|$|Endomedullary femur nails with a head-neck implant {{offer an}} {{up to now}} unused point of {{reference}} for the determination of rotation during osteosynthesis.

30|$|Use of a glenosphere implant {{with a more}} {{lateral center}} of {{rotation}} was met with controversy based on historical implant failures seen with earlier generation implants [14 – 21]. The first modern reverse shoulder replacement to revisit a more lateralized center of rotation utilized a central screw baseplate and four peripheral non-locked 3.5 -mm screws. Using all peripheral non-locked screws, the glenoid baseplate failure rate was 11 % [22]. With continued understanding of surgical technique and replacement of the 3.5 -mm peripheral non-locked screws with 5.0 -mm <b>locked</b> <b>screws,</b> the incidence of glenoid baseplate failures was reduced to 0 % in a 5 -year minimum follow-up study [33]. This clinical experience validated the mechanical study reported by Harman et al. [11] which showed how peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> were superior to non-locked screws at maximizing baseplate fixation < 150 µm micromotion threshold. Surgeons have thus gained comfort using a glenoid baseplate with four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws.</b> There are certainly cases where four peripheral <b>locked</b> <b>screws</b> are either not possible {{or may not be}} of optimal surgical preference. Included in these scenarios are cases where there is limited bone remaining, such that a screw would capture minimal bone or result in a prominent screw; or cases where a larger <b>locked</b> <b>screw</b> might not be optimal, creating a potential stress riser for an acromion spine fracture [34]. Additionally, there are situations when further glenoid component compression is desirable, which can only be achieved by using a non-locked screw. In these cases, the surgeon may elect to utilize a non-locked screw rather than a <b>locked</b> <b>screw.</b> This concept of hybrid fixation is now commonplace in fracture management using locked plates, but prior to this study had not been tested for applicability in the reverse shoulder replacement glenoid component.|$|R

Methods: Four proximal <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> configurations were examined in a synthetic composite tibia model with a 2 -cm gap simulating a comminuted proximal third tibia fracture with no bony contact: 1) two proximal screws not compressed to the nail; 2) one of two proximal screws compressed to the nail; 3) two proximal screws compressed to the nail; and 4) three proximal screws with only the most proximal screw compressed to the nail. An 11 -mm tibial nail with two distal <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> was used. Stiffness was measured in axial and torsional loading. An analysis of variance was performed to compare results of the screw configurations for each testing mode. Results: Compressing two screws to the nail produced 22 % to 39 % greater (P # 0. 01) axial and 16 % to 29 % greater (P # 0. 03) torsional stiffness than securing neither or only one of the screws.

This requires stimulation by interfragmentary micromotion. Recent data suggest that up to 20 % of fractures fixed with locking plates may encounter suboptimal fracture healing. Three main systems have been developed to improve bone healing, thereby reducing the risks of delayed or nonunion: overdrilling the near cortex; far cortical locking (FCL) screw; and dynamic <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> (DLS). Overdrilling the near cortex offers a cheap alternative to screw technology by reducing construct stiffness; overdrilling potentially causes repetitive loading and thus has consequences postoperatively such as failure and fatigue. FCL screws reduce construct stiffness and maintain construct strength but cannot be used in dynamic compression mode and therefore, require adequate fracture reduction.

The most common mode of failure of a DHS is {{cut out of the}} lag screw from the femoral head. The second most common mode of failure is lift-off of the plate from the femur. The aim of this laboratory-based experimental study was to determine whether a DHS secured to an osteoporotic femur with a <b>locking</b> <b>screw</b> plate would provide a stronger construct than the standard DHS plate. METHOD: The standard DHS design was compared to a DHS with fixed angle <b>locking</b> <b>screws</b> holding the DHS plate to the femur. Standard dynamic compression plates (DCP) and locking compression plates (LCP) were attached to synthetic, osteoporotic bone. A load was applied to replicate the forces occurring following the fixation of unstable, intertrochanteric hip fractures. A bracket on the proximal end of the plate replicated the lag screw in the femoral head. The constructs were cyclically loaded by a screw-driven material-testing machine and the number of cycles before failure occurred was determined.
