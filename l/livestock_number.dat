40|$|Historically, rangelands were {{managed to}} reduce brush and {{increase}} livestock grazing habitat. As {{with much of}} the southwestern United States, the seemingly endless ?free grass? of Texas rangelands was overgrazed during the late 1800 s. Overgrazing reduced fine fuel loads and, combined with disruption in fire regimes, allowed woody plants populations to invade grasslands. Consequently, livestock carrying capacity ultimately declined. Because livestock overgrazing has a central role in land degradation and woody plant encroachment, I analyzed historical <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> to identify potential trends that can generate and be integrated into future hypotheses of land use change. The counties included in four ecoregions of Texas (Edwards Plateau, Lampasas Cut Plains, South Texas, and West Texas) were selected based on the existence of historically uncultivated rangelands. I collected data from the U. S. Census of Agriculture and graphically explored trends in <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers.</b> Although <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> varied across time and by region, three general hypotheses could be identified: a) <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> are direct drivers of degradation and indirect drivers of woody plant encroachment; b) for rangelands threatened by woody plant encroachment, decreasing <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> may be associated with recovery of rangelands in an ecoregion; and, c) given transformation of the landscape from rangelands to woodlands, decreases in <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> over time are related to increases in key indicators of ecosystem health (e. g., ground water flow).

Officially, participation of nomads on governmental programs such as this is voluntary, nevertheless in some places such as Zeku or Hongyuan County the executive officials made clear to the nomads that a refusal to participate would lead to denial of any future governmental help. Therefore, the nomads usually accepted even those less advantageous conditions included in a resettlement or settlement contract, in order to avoid possible trouble with the local government.|$|E

A one unit increase in labor force suggested about 16.1 % decrease in the choice of livestock selling as coping strategy in Afar pastoral areas of North-East of Ethiopia. The non-intervened pastoral households had more preference (3.78 %) to practice herd splitting than those pastoral households in the intervened district. Similarly, the non-intervened pastoral households had 4.43 % more preference to use crop residue for livestock feeding than pastoral HHs in the intervened areas.|$|E

However, pastoralists’ perception in terms of reduced precipitation was not confirmed by the meteorological-based data records for the short rainy season (SRS). Afar pastoralists’ experience showed that the short rainy season was the best indicator for the occurrence of droughts as compared to other seasons in Afar. Our results suggest that most coping strategies are labor force demanding, and the situation worsens during the long rainy season (LRS). We suggest that differences in intervention between the study areas should not be overlooked as a policy tool in tackling the impact of climate change.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a heterogeneous-agent model {{to assess the}} impacts of removing lucerne growing subsidies, increasing <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> and including district-level equilibrium conditions on optimal farm plans in the Qingyang district of Gansu Province, China. The model is a five-year dynamic linear program that solves across 96 farm households whilst incorporating district-level constraints. The approach used allows us to observe seasonal variations in incomes, infer the distribution of a policy shock among households and highlight trade patterns at the district level. The results suggest that without lucerne growing subsidies the total area of lucerne grown by all modelled households falls by 18 %. Increasing <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> by 25 % reduces net household incomes by 17 % as changes to labour allocations reduce off-farm employment opportunities. When external trade in forages {{is included in the}} model, total <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> held by all 96 households rise from 502 to 838, this highlights the benefits of integrated feed markets.

The findings of this study confirmed that pastoralists’ perceptions are well-matched with the existing meteorological analysis in terms of the increased trend of temperature during the two Afar rainy seasons. Pastoralists’ perceptions of downward trend in precipitation were not supported by the existing meteorological analysis.

30|$|This {{survey of}} {{pastoral}} livelihoods of Fulani herders is {{set against a}} backdrop of agricultural change and general insecurity. The survey showed that the majority of pastoral households in the study area are better off or in the middle wealth categories and only a few are poor in terms of livestock holdings. However, many households are poor in terms of land holdings. Income diversity is significant but as many as 30 % of households still rely on one source of cash revenue: livestock sales. Pastoralists are less vulnerable to livestock disease but increasingly vulnerable to the risks of conflict and poor access to natural resources. Cattle productivity parameters are more stable, but the overall productivity has decreased and reproductive rates were particularly low. The amount of wealth concentrated in <b>livestock,</b> <b>number</b> of land-poor households and those still reliant on one source of income suggest that there is still a degree of vulnerability to the risks of disease, drought/dry season and conflict in pastoral livelihoods in the area.|$|E

In their model, Boone et al. (2005) showed reduced <b>livestock</b> <b>numbers</b> in fragmented landscapes {{as a result}} of curtailed mobility. As reported in areas where nomadic pastoralism dominates, mobility allows sustainable utilization of rangelands and supports large herds.

We selected two livestock camps that for many years have had different numbers of livestock, with approximately six times more sheep-equivalents at site 1 than at site 2. Vegetation was sampled in 10 quadrats on five transects along the grazing gradient at each site. In each quadrat, we recorded percent cover of each plant species. Our findings suggested that vegetation changes along the grazing gradient under different livestock numbers were characterized by changes in the cover of life forms: perennial species were replaced by annual species near the camps (10 – 50 m).

It {{is important to note that}} pastoralists’ perceptions are all about the knowledge that is available in connection with their local environment, which is critical in decision-making based on those verifiable truths. Increasing land use changes, as human demand for food and natural resources rise in dry land ecosystems, eventually contributes to climate change (Grover et al. 2011).
