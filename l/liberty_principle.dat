50|$|Rawls derives two {{principles}} of justice {{from the original}} position. The first {{of these is the}} <b>Liberty</b> <b>Principle,</b> which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a personal property right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect, rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the classical liberalism of John Locke and the libertarianism of Robert Nozick).|$|E
50|$|Rawls {{arranged}} the fundamental {{principles of the}} Original Position in lexical priority: the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle,</b> fair equality of opportunity and lastly the difference principle. This prioritisation encounters criticism, as {{the importance of the}} first principle is awarded greater weighting and must be satisfied prior to subsequent principles. So whilst liberty {{is said to be the}} dominant principle, the difference principle that results from the acceptance of inequalities (the second principle) operates in violation of the first principle. This is exemplified by redistributive taxes as discussed by Robert Nozick in Anarchy, State and Utopia which criticises the use of this tax as a levelling mechanism, impinging upon an individual’s basic liberties, the mainstay of the original position's principles.|$|E

50|$|In chapter forty-seven, Rawls {{makes his}} final {{clarification}} {{on the principles}} of justice in one paragraph:"First Principle: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.

The first principle is often called the greatest equal <b>liberty</b> <b>principle.</b> The second, until (b), the difference principle and the final addendum in (b) the equal opportunity principle.|$|E

Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical <b>liberty.</b> <b>Principle</b> 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article interprets Friedrich Hayek {{as having}} been {{constrained}} by the statism and modernism of his times, and as writing {{in a way that}} obscured some of his central ideas. I suggest that between the lines we can see a focus on liberty understood hardily as others not messing with one’s stuff – even though Hayek in The Constitution of Liberty defined liberty in ways that tended to obscure this hardy definition, and Hayek often used code words like “competition, ” “the market, ” and “spontaneous ” where “liberty ” or “freedom ” would have been plainer, albeit more offensive to the culture. Seeing the hardy definition of liberty between the lines in Hayek enables us to see his focus on the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> and his case for a presumption of liberty. That focus, then, enables us to interpret his thoughts on spontaneous order, with its distinction between noncentral and central decision making, for the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> enables us to see that certain frames of that distinction are focal in Hayek. In its focal frame, the word “spontaneous ” is essentially code for free or freer. Meanwhile, “order, ” in context, usually carries a judgment of better, more desirable, or better coordinated. Such reading of Hayek, I suggest, is true to Adam Smith, who expounded a central message that by and large the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> holds, and that it deserves the presumption in our culture and politics...|$|E

40|$|Mill s {{free speech}} {{doctrine}} is distinct from, yet compatible with, his central principle of purely self-regarding liberty. Using the crucial analogy with trade, I {{claim that he}} defends a broad laissez-faire policy for expression, even though expression is social or other-regarding conduct and thus legitimately subject to social regulation. An expedient laissez-faire policy admits of exceptions because speakers can sometimes cause such severe damage to others that coercive interference with the speech is justified. In those relatively few contexts where interference is called for, however, the central principle of self-regarding liberty sets absolute limits to the scope of society s regulatory authority. Regulation can never amount to an outright ban of any type of expression that can be consumed by the individual without direct and immediate harm to others. Nevertheless, and perhaps surprisingly, the central <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> admits censorship of certain extraordinary types of expression which necessarily harm others. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} social order based strictly on market and <b>liberty</b> <b>principles,</b> thus without a state hegemony. Firstly It's said that the rules of social order don't have to be necessarily products of legislation. That implies that stateless society doesn't mean that rules don't exist at all. Next the thesis explains fundamental principles of libertarian ethics [...] self-ownership, homesteading and non-aggression principle. These principles give us the answer why state is an institution incompatible with individuals' rights. In the last chapter, thesis {{discusses the}} possibilities of private providing of some public services and goods, which are provided by the state these days. Conclusion is that these public goods don't differ from any other goods provided on private basis, so institution of state isn't that vital as {{we are forced to}} believe...|$|R

40|$|By banning {{payments}} to donors, government has limited organ supply to barter and charity. Economists have generated a growing literature on organ policy. Starting with Econlit and fanning out from there, I survey and compile the published judgments of economists {{to see whether}} they preponderantly support liberalization. I classify 72 economists and find that most of those economists who publish a judgment favor liberalization to one extent or another. This consensus among the surveyed economists pretty well fits opinion of economists in general. The consensus is not universal, however. The organ issue raises interesting analytic issues in the meaning of “liberalization,” for quite a few economists favor reforms of “presumed consent” or “mandated choice,” both of which, in themselves, {{would seem to be a}} contravention of the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle.</b> These complications notwithstanding, a consensus in favor of liberalization remains quite clear.

40|$|The {{criminal}} clause is {{an accessory}} convention {{through which the}} parts evaluate in advance the prejudiceinterestswhich come from the inexecution lato sensu of the contractual obligations. This convention named criminalclause is {{the expression of the}} contractual <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> and presents a singular practical utility but also someinconveniences.

The criminal clause has also a strongcomminatory purpose, exercising a pressure on the debtor to make all possible to execute precisely the contractualobligation. Due to these reasons it is seen in doctrine by some of the authors as one of the main guarantees in our law. Also in the doctrine however, it is shown that the debtor can be constrained in some situations to accept establishing avery high amount in the criminal clause, sometimes with inequitable consequences, with damaging effect for thedebtor...|$|E

40|$|May {{a doctor}} treat a patient, despite that patient's refusal, when in his {{professional}} opinion treatment is necessary? This is the dilemma which must {{from time to}} time confront most physicians. An examination of the validity of such a refusal is provided by the present authors who use the case history of a patient refusing treatment, for cancer as well as for a fractured hip, to evaluate the grounds for intervention in such circumstances. In such a situation the patient is said to have a 'false belief' and it is the doctor's duty to try to change that belief in the patient's interest. The false belief is considered here in terms of the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle,</b> the patient's mental competence and on what is called the 'harm principle' (harm to other individuals or to society). Finally the concept of paternalism is examined. The authors conclude that the doctor must attempt to change a false belief, and if this fails he must examine the patient's mental competence to make the decision to refuse treatment. But in the last analysis the doctor may be under an obligation to respect the patient's refusal. Readers might like to look at (or read again) the papers on 'Liberty' and 'Conscience' published in this Journal under the heading Analysis...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the on-going controversy between supporters of minimal government, or minarchists, {{and supporters of}} no government, or anarchists. Both lay claim to the Libertarian principle, which holds that the only justification {{for the use of}} force is to deal with aggressive force initiated by someone else. Both agree that force is justified in dealing with aggressors. The only question is, who wields it, and how? The essay explains, briefly, the role of private property in all this. Private property is really just the operation of the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> {{in the area of the}} use of things outside ourselves: those who initiate use of such things will have their activities subject to continual invasion unless property is recognized, and so property is the natural outcome of liberty, taken seriously. But the trouble is, states are monopolies, and maintain themselves at public expense, by taxation. This inevitably means interference with private property rights. And so, if we deal with aggressors via the state, we turn into partial aggressors ourselves, it seems. The essay points out that and why both minarchism and anarchism are virtually impossible in contemporary circumstances, but at the level of basic theory, at any rate, the anarchist appears to have the better of it...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to outline a {{political}} theory of criminal law, that is, a theory that does not rely on any controversial moral view on fault and punishment. The argument is based largely on John Rawls's work but also addresses some inconsistencies regarding crime and punishment therein. The paper will make a case for a mixed theory of criminal law and punishment along the following lines: The fair terms of social cooperation generate duties for the violation of which one can be held properly responsible. However, nothing in this determines what the accountability-seeking measure may be or its intensity. These are matters of appropriateness to be determined in terms of the assurance of the participants in a well-ordered society and the long-term stability of social cooperation. Criminalization and punishment are contingent, historically qualified means of achieving stability and assurance serving only as last resort. Although the institution of punishment is subject to the constraints of the rule of law, which stem directly from the <b>liberty</b> <b>principle</b> questions such as the intensity of punishment or the proportionality between offenses and penalties depend on the proper workings of the utilitarian calculus in combination with the requirements of democratic decision-making...|$|E
