25|$|Slacklining {{refers to}} the act of walking or {{balancing}} along a suspended length of flat webbing that is tensioned between two anchors. Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes {{in the type of}} material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires {{in order to create a}} dynamic line which will stretch and bounce <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Slacklining is popular because of its simplicity and versatility; it can be used in various environments with few components.|$|E

500|$|The Ambrose {{leader cable}} was an armored cable {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that acted <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 miles down the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E
500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), one becomes what one thinks, metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world. Following renunciation from this universe, which is also called a Sankalpa, the meditating mind is {{to be focused on}} the Nirvikalpa (the unchangeable) or the unchangeable part (metaphysical reality). Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E

She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this.

In the winter of 1996, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. By 1997, she had become very weak, was speaking and eating very little, and it was feared she would die. She showed signs of dementia in her final years. In May 2003, an aggressive tumor was found in Hepburn's neck. The decision was made not to medically intervene, and she died on June 29, 2003, a month after her 96th birthday at the Hepburn family home in Fenwick, Connecticut. She was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Hepburn requested that there be no memorial service.|$|E

She added, [...] "New Directions' sectionals performance wasn't a total fumble, but it wasn't the touchdown you might've hoped for either", and of the long-awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition: [...] "the anticipated shining moment {{turned out to be}} so dull." [...] Reiter was one of a very few critics to note the absence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in the episode, and only when she lamented the [...] "relative lack of humor". Futterman merely remarked on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "we got a spazzy, unfocused hour at the expense of emotional investment", and though Anthony Benigno of the Daily News complimented the [...] "solid acting", he also wrote that [...] "this is the first time the show's started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to, you know, gleeful." [...] He made a general complaint as well: [...] "This show is starting to suffer in a big way from making the music secondary to the plot." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He said that the show [...] "tried to make it all work, and while the hour was enjoyable enough, each storyline felt just a little bit shy of going from good to great." ...|$|E

The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: [...] "marriage is sort of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all.

2500|$|Smith's {{strategy}} is encapsulated in a motto: [...] "Kick {{and wait for}} the breaks." [...] He became known for his emphasis on the kicking game and defense-oriented strategy out of the short punt formation. During this era, the ball was often moved up the field not through offensive plays, but rather through punting. For Smith this was standard when the ball was held deep in one's territory. And once the opposing team got the ball, the defense was relied on to make the other team's offense lose yards or fumble. To confuse the opponent, the punting could be done on first or second downs. If the opponent's safeties were close to the line of scrimmage, anticipating a short pass or a run, then the ball could be kicked over their heads resulting in a longer punt. This was repeated until a breakthrough play <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> yard rush would eventually occur and flip the field position. It was not uncommon for a team to kick more than 40 punts a game.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2005, Takei {{revealed}} in {{an issue of}} Frontiers magazine that he is gay and {{had been in a}} committed relationship with his partner, Brad Altman, for 18 years; the move was prompted by then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto of same-sex marriage legislation. He said, [...] "It's not really coming out, which suggests opening a door and stepping through. It's more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long walk through what began as a narrow corridor that starts to widen." [...] Nevertheless, Takei's sexuality had been an open secret among Star Trek fans since the 1970s, and Takei did not conceal his active membership in LGBT organizations, including Frontrunners, where he developed public friendships with openly gay couples such as Kevin and Don Norte. In an on-air telephone interview with Howard Stern in December 2005, Takei explained, [...] " [...] are masculine, we are feminine, we are caring, we are abusive.
