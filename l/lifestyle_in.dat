5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E
5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album.

Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> front of it.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} in Maʿarra {{for the rest}} of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town. Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded <b>lifestyle,</b> <b>in</b> his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area.

5|$|As a {{daughter}} of the Queen, Louise was a desirable bride; more so as she {{is regarded as the}} Queen's most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers. However, she was accused by the press, without substantiation, of romantic affairs. This, coupled with her liberalism and feminism, prompted the Queen to find her a husband. The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise, and the Queen insisted that her daughter's husband should live near her, a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena, Louise's sister. Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but the Queen was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise Prussia. Victoria, Louise's eldest sister, proposed the tall and rich Prince Albert of Prussia, but Queen Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England. Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required. William, Prince of Orange was also considered a suitor, but because of his extravagant <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> Paris, where he lived openly with a mistress, the Queen quickly vetoed the idea.|$|E
5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> exchange for signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines {{due to his}} father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising {{as one of}} {{her main}} residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had {{increased}} to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time that she took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> a series of campaign ads, {{one of which was}} based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{was born}} in Prague in 1619, {{at the start of}} the Thirty Years' War, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, and was {{declared}} a prince by the principality of Lusatia. He was given his name in honour of King Rupert of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor. Rupert's father was a leading member of the Holy Roman Empire and the head of the Protestant Union, with a martial family tradition stretching back several centuries. Rupert's family was at the heart of a network of Protestant rulers across the north of Europe, as Frederick had close ties through his mother to the ruling House of Orange-Nassau in the United Provinces, and Elizabeth was the daughter of James I of England and Anne of Denmark. The family lived an extremely wealthy <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> Heidelberg, enjoying the palace gardens—the Hortus Palatinus, designed by Inigo Jones and Salomon de Caus—and a lavish castle with one of the best libraries in Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{was dismayed}} by Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he would rather have received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E
5|$|Original Stories {{was first}} {{published}} anonymously in 1788, {{the same year as}} Wollstonecraft's first novel , and cost two shillings. When the second edition came out in 1791, Wollstonecraft’s name was printed on the title page; after the publication in 1790 of her Vindication of the Rights of Men, she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales. Joseph Johnson, the publisher of Original Stories and all of Wollstonecraft's other works, commissioned William Blake to design six illustrations for the second edition, which cost two shillings and six pence. It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print. According to Gary Kelly, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, the last edition of Original Stories was published in 1820, but without Wollstonecraft’s name on the title page; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband, William Godwin, had revealed her unorthodox <b>lifestyle</b> <b>in</b> his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798). According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the Masterworks of Children's Literature series, Original Stories was published until 1835. It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of how a field {{analytical}} understanding of urban <b>lifestyles</b> <b>in</b> the city district Ørestad of Copenhagen can contribute to new approaches in urban planning. The point of departure is a general critique of urban planning ideals, where physical oriented planning approaches or a priori conceptions of urban lifestyles constitutes the underlying basis for the planning of cities. Applying a Bourdieu-based field analysis on urban <b>lifestyles</b> <b>in</b> Ørestad, it is shown that the individual has very different urban practices, preferences and expectations towards the city it lives in, depending on the urban environment it is situated in, its possession of different forms of capital, and its phase of life. Through a multiple correspondence analysis carried out {{on the basis of}} a quantitative questionnaire, four main urban <b>lifestyles</b> <b>in</b> Ørestad are constructed and subsequently the relationship between the space of lifestyles and the space of positions in Ørestad is examined. It is found that phase of life to a greater extent than the individuals’ possession of capital differentiates urban <b>lifestyles</b> <b>in</b> Ørestad. Furthermore, the field analysis of Ørestad points out that the individuals’ urban practices are also affected by the field - the urban environment - it is a part of. The findings from this thesis’ field analytical understanding of <b>lifestyles</b> <b>in</b> Ørestad implicates, that future urban planning has to take into account a multiplicity of social conditions, including both the individuals’ possession of capital, its phase of life and the urban environment that the <b>lifestyle</b> is located <b>in,</b> if it is desired to plan cities where individual differences and requirements is recognized, and where the symbolic violence upon specific urban lifestyles communities is thus attempted diminished...|$|R
