Minogue enters a small room in the spacecraft, wearing a pink spacesuit, and subsequently takes off her helmet and gloves; intercut scenes through the video has the spacecraft travelling through different space fields and atmospheres. By the first chorus, Minogue starts taking off parts of her spacesuit whilst spaceman from different rooms witness her. Next, she turns on a machine that projects smoke and distracts them. She then becomes fully nude by the second chorus; this marks Minogue's first video {{that she has been}} nude in until her 2001 advert campaign with Agent Provocateur. Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the <b>lights</b> <b>off,</b> and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox {{and some}} Conservative {{authorities}} rule that turning electric devices {{on or off}} is prohibited as a melakhah; however, authorities are not in agreement about exactly which one(s).

If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may {{be considered as a}} type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11).

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the <b>lights</b> <b>off</b> to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

The cruiser was steaming with her <b>lights</b> <b>off,</b> and when the torpedo boats approached, Undine turned her search lights on, which blinded the crew of S26. The torpedo boat inadvertently ran in front of Undine, and the latter rammed and sank the former. One officer and thirty-two enlisted men aboard S26 were killed in the accident.|$|E

She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings.

It was later released as a digital download and radio-only single in Australia, Belgium, and France.|$|E
500|$|During {{one scene}} at the art show, a {{character}} named Orin {{stands in front of}} a blank canvas and stares straight ahead without moving.

500|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was also radically changed. The celebrated key visual feature of the building, its exterior vertical white marble ribbing, was completely removed after it {{was found to be}} bowed from age and weather. Although this fundamentally changed the nature of Durrell's building, there was almost no public outcry. It was replaced by an energy-efficient, all-glass facade. Perhaps the most significant renovation feature was the structure's use of a chilled beam HVAC system, which uses chilled or heated water circulated in strategically placed columns in the interior space to cool and warm the building. To test the efficiency of the chilled beam technology, the system was installed in the penthouse of the building and tested for a full year. The architect agreed to use the system after the test outperformed specifications. The installation represented the first large-scale use of the chilled beam technology in the United States. Other energy-saving enhancements included motion and daylight detectors to turn <b>lights</b> <b>off</b> when not needed, and special exterior windows which automatically dim to prevent daytime heating. The building's ventilation system was also upgraded. The renovation left the structure with [...] of interior space. The final cost of the renovation was pegged at $250 million.|$|E
