40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three different}} liquid valving methods for the centrifugal microfluidic platform, namely vacuum/compression wax valve, passive <b>liquid</b> <b>valve</b> (PLV), and check valve. The {{mechanism of the}} proposed valves is simply based on sequencing the liquid flow by controlling air-flow inside the microfluidic network. Specifically, the wax valve and passive <b>liquid</b> <b>valve</b> utilize a volume of trapped air in the source chamber or the destination chamber to control the burst frequency of the liquid. In contrast, the check valve controls {{the direction of the}} air to control the flow direction of the pumped liquid. Compared with the previously proposed valves, this mechanism prevents any direct contact between the valving materials and the sample/reagents. This will reduce the chance of sample/reagents contamination, and allow the use of wider range of valving materials. As a proof of concept, liquid metering, liquid switching, and liquid swapping are conducted using the proposed valving methods. Furthermore, Bradford assay for protein concentration detection, and enzyme linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for dengue are demonstrated to show the capability of the developed valves to perform biomedical applications. The results illustrate that the valves reduce the required spinning frequency to perform the microfluidic processes on the centrifugal platforms. In addition, the presence of physical barriers improves the ability of the developed valves to reduce vapour and contamination effect. Furthermore, the proposed valves show additional advantages such as the simplicity of fabrication and implementation, reversibility and multi-actuation, and compatibility with biomedical applications. Finally, the demonstration of the ELISA and the Bradford assays illustrate the ability of the presented valves to be integrated in any multistep biomedical and chemical application on the centrifugal microfluidic platform...|$|E

Two kinds of devices {{have been used}} in our ~ laboratory and were found to be deficient. The standard drinkometer-equipped water bottle (with or without ball-bearing tips) was subject to leakage, particularly when ethanol-water solutions were used. This finding has also been reported by others (Amit, Amir and Corcoran, 1973). A second problem with water bottles is that intermittent reinforcement with liquid is dif-ficult. Also, intermittent reinforcement is not possible with the ''tamper [...] proof " fluid dispenser described by Mendelson and Mello (1965).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an easy-to-implement passive <b>liquid</b> <b>valve</b> (PLV) for the {{microfluidic}} compact-disc (CD). This valve {{can be implemented}} by introducing venting chambers to control the air flow of the source and destination chambers. The PLV mechanism is based on equalizing the main forces acting on the microfluidic CD (i. e., the centrifugal and capillary forces) to control the burst frequency of the source chamber liquid. For {{a better understanding of}} the physics behind the proposed PLV, an analytical model is described. Moreover, three parameters that control the effectiveness of the proposed valve, i. e., the liquid height, liquid density, and venting chamber position with respect to the CD center, are tested experimentally. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed PLV valve, microfluidic liquid switching and liquid metering are performed. In addition, a Bradford assay is performed to measure the protein concentration and evaluated in comparison to the benchtop procedure. The result shows that the proposed valve can be implemented in any microfluidic process that requires simplicity and accuracy. Moreover, the developed valve increases the flexibility of the centrifugal CD platform for passive control of the liquid flow without the need for an external force or trigger...|$|E
40|$|The liquid argon dewar and {{the three}} cryostats which contain the modules of the D-Zero {{detector}} are cooled and maintained at a low pressure equilibrium {{by the use of}} liquid nitrogen cooling loops. The dewar has one vacuum jacketed valve at the inlet of the cooling loop and one at the outlet.

The flow rate of the liquid nitrogen, and hence the valve sizes and corresponding flow coefficients (C{sub v}), is deter mined by the required cooling rate of each system. The large variance between the cooling rate required for cooldown and that required for operation, and the high control resolution required, makes the selection of a valve seat and plug difficult.

40|$|Saline nasal {{irrigation}} is {{a mainstay}} {{in the medical}} management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with proven efficacy. However, bacterial contamination of irrigation bottles has recently been reported and this may contribute to recurrent infections. Sterilization is effective but could a change in bottle design obviate the need for regular sterilization?A total of 20 stable CRS patients were given a NasalCare® (Techworld Corporation, Inc., Downington, PA) irrigation bottle to use regularly for 1 week. This bottle incorporates a 1 -way valve to prevent irrigant regurgitation. Swabs were taken from their sinonasal cavity and 3 sites on the bottle-nozzle, valve, and inner surface. This study cultured a range of organisms from all sites of the bottle, including common CRS pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. Whereas the bottle's inner surface had the lowest bacterial recovery rate, the frequent culture of organisms at this site suggests a 1 -way valve cannot completely prevent irrigant reflux. The high rate of organism detection at the nozzle and valve of the bottle is concerning, as bacteria at these sites may be transported to the nose during nasal douching. Saline irrigation {{will continue to be}} an essential component of CRS management. However, despite employing a 1 -way <b>liquid</b> <b>valve</b> in this study, nasal irrigation bottles can still become contaminated with bacteria. Thus, patient education, irrespective of bottle design, will be essential in preventing bacterial contamination of nasal irrigation devices.
