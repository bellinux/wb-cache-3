5|$|Much of the {{resulting}} many-sided dispute among the Parliamentarians and Covenanters was prompted by accounts very soon after the battle that all three allied generals-in-chief had fled the field. The Earl of Manchester left the field but he subsequently rallied some infantry and returned, although {{he was able to}} exercise <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
5|$|While {{the leaders}} of Congress languished in jail, the other parties {{supported}} the war and gained organizational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but it had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> events. At {{the end of the}} war, the British gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point Gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the Congress's leadership.|$|E

5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> lords, or required {{the construction of}} new castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E
5|$|Lacking {{military}} discipline, in what likely {{seemed to}} the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact {{they were still in}} Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at Belgrade, but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At Nish the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of Bohemians and Saxons did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.|$|E

The hero and his party journey to locate the Mana Tree, {{the focal point of}} the world's life energy. Anticipating their arrival, Thanatos {{positions}} the Mana Fortress over the Tree and destroys it. The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. However, the Beast has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> its rage and will likely destroy the world as well. The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero's father. The voice heard at Potos' waterfall was that of Serin's ghost.|$|E
5|$|The great {{majority}} of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons (No.460, No.462, No.463, No.466 and No.467squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, {{and the proportion of}} Australians in these units increased over time. No.464Squadron, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No.6Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> how they were used.|$|E
5|$|John's {{preparations}} have no effect, however, {{as he is}} tricked into {{killing the}} guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the {{events leading up to}} the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has <b>little</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.|$|E

Features of interest might evaporate in a physically different manner to the bulk sample, altering projection geometry and the magnification of the reconstructed volume. This yields strong spatial distortions in the final image.|$|E
