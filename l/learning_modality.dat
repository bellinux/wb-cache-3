This study was done in frame of survey research model. The subjects {{of this study were}} 642 sixth grade students and their 20 English teachers who were working at fifteen different primary schools in the central district of Edirne in 2010 - 2011 academic year. In order {{to determine the}} <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> of the students and the teachers, Grasha-Riechmann Learning Styles Inventory; and for the teaching modalities of the teachers Grasha Teaching Styles Inventory was used. Both scales were adapted to Turkish by the researcher. The obtained data were analyzed in the SPSS package program. To analyze the data collected, frequency, percentage, mean values were calculated and the independent t- test, one-way ANOVA and correlation tests were used. The findings of the study indicated that i) the students’ collaborative and participant <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> are more dominant than the other <b>learning</b> <b>modalities,</b> ii) gender is an important factor for avoidant, collaborative, dependent and participant <b>learning</b> <b>modalities,</b> iii) socio-economic status is not an important factor affecting the <b>learning</b> <b>modalities,</b> iv) students’ report card marks are determining factor for just the avoidant, dependent and participant <b>learning</b> <b>modalities.</b> When the <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> of the teachers were investigated, it was revealed that teachers’ participant and dependent <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> are more dominant than the <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> of collaborative, competitive, independent and avoidant. In terms of the teaching modalities of the teachers, it is identified that the teachers got the highest percentage point from the personal model sub-scale. Also, the findings showed that the sex variable {{is an important factor in}} favor of the females for the expert and personal model teaching modalities. The variable of seniority had no significant effect on the differentiation of teaching modalities of the teachers.

5000|$|Prior {{to opening}} KCC in 2003, Kilpatrick collaborated with several child {{development}} graduate students {{to create the}} Kid's Community College 1st Degree Learning System. The system incorporates the Multiple Intelligence Principles of Howard Gardner with a differentiated, individual, and developmentally appropriate approach. Students are tested {{in the beginning of}} the school year using a number of measures including the Multiple Intelligence Development Assessment Scales (MIDAS). The MIDAS results indicate the individual <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> of each student. KCC teachers then use the MIDAS and other assessments to tailor their classroom lesson plans to meet the individual learning styles of each child. Included in the 1st Degree Learning System are Individual Development and Education Plans (IDEPs) for every enrolled student. The IDEPs are completed three times throughout the school year through parent and teacher collaborations. Three goals are chosen for each student to accomplish with assistance of individual lesson plans created by the teacher specifically for each student's goal. The 1st Degree Learning System forms the foundation for the Kid's Community College mission statement, [...] "dedicated to the well-being and educational success of EVERY child." [...] The system is implemented with each student at each campus, preschool through middle school.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{modality}} theories; one is learning styles theory, the other is multiple intelligence. Learning style theory suggests that learning styles differ from student to student. A few examples of learning styles are active learners, verbal learners, and reflective learners. Learning styles theory is highly criticized and lacks empirical evidence to support it. Another type of modality is multiple intelligence, which was created by Howard Gardner. He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students' strengths are with words and language. Another type is visual/spatial in which a student would rather use graphs, charts and drawings. Students who enjoy sound, rhymes, and music are musical/rhythmical learners. Bodily/kinesthetic learners are better with their hands and have better control over their bodily motions. Another type is Naturalist/Environmental, these students are sensitive, nurturing and like to use all five sense. The seventh is interpersonal, a type of student who communicates well and can be an extrovert. Last, students who can self-reflect and are introverts they are intrapersonal learners. Multiple intelligence {{is a great way to}} separate students out and learn their best <b>learning</b> <b>modality.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of specific textual and contextual materials to bridge the gap between the student's present level o proficiency in a target language and the level of proficiency required to perform a listening comprehension task in that language. This study also tested for interaction between the use of the textual and contextual materials and the <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> of the students. In addition, confounding effects by either <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> and foreign language classroom anxiety were controlled. Listening comprehension was assessed by a fourteen-item multiple-choice test in Spanish developed by the researcher. <b>Learning</b> <b>modality</b> was established by the Edmonds Learning Style Identification Exercise developed by H. Reinert. Foreign language class anxiety was measured by the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale developed by Elaine Horwitz, Michael Horwitz, and Joann Cope. A group of 198 college students enrolled in nine second-semester Spanish classes at Anderson University, Anderson, Indiana participated in the study. Three classes were randomly assigned to each of the three treatments: the contextual cue, the textual cue, and neither one. A three factor 3 x 3 x 2 fixed effects factorial design was used to analyze the data gathered in the study. Four null hypotheses were tested. The. 05 level of significance was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of the hypotheses. Findings 1. There are significant effects attributable to a textual cue on recall measures of listening comprehension. 2. There are no significant effects attributable to a contextual cue on recall measures of listening comprehension. 3. There are no significant interactions between the use of the textual cue and the <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> of the students. 4. There are no significant interactions between the use of the contextual cue and the <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> of the students. 5. There are no significant effects attributable to <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> on recall measures of listening comprehension. 6. There are significant effects attributable to foreign language classroom anxiety on recall measures of listening comprehension. Conclusions 1. Textual cues support listening comprehension tasks but contextual cues do not. 2.

Current research investigating perceptual and cognitive variables is oriented toward determining how children receive and process information and if it is related to academic performance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> and academic achievement. <b>Learning</b> <b>modality</b> is the ability to receive and process information via specific sensory input channels. The major sensory modes used in learning are visual, aural, and tactile channels. The investigation addressed the following questions: (1) For seventh grade students, is there a relationship between <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, and Mixed) and Reading Comprehension, Vocabulary, Listening Comprehension, Spelling, Language, Concepts of Numbers, Mathematic Computation, Mathematic Applications, Social Science, Science, Using Information, Total Listening, Total Language, and Total Mathematics when analyzed by sex and IQ? (2) For seventh grade students, is there a relationship between <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> raw scores and achievement variables when analyzed by sex and IQ?The sample included 188 seventh grade students from two junior high schools in a suburban community northwest of Chicago who had been administered the Swassing-Barbe Modality Index, Stanford Achievement Test, and Otis-Lennon School Ability Test by the district. A three-way ANOVA and correlations were utilized to test the hypotheses at the. 05 level of probability. Based on the findings of this study, it would appear that <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> is related to academic achievement of seventh grade students in Listening Comprehension; Reading Comprehension and Using Information when analyzed by sex; and Language, Social Science, and Using Information when analyzed by IQ. <b>Learning</b> <b>modality</b> raw score was significantly related to the 14 achievement variables for all subjects. For all average IQ group analyses, no significant relationships occurred. Modality raw score would appear to be more predictive of achievement for above average IQ males, particularly in Language, Mathematics, and Science and for above average IQ females in Mathematics and Spelling. The significant findings of this study indicate a need for further research into learning modality's relationship to achievement at the junior high level. It may be necessary to analyze modality strengths and weaknesses more critically and develop educational programs accordingly...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Airway {{endoscopy}} is {{a difficult}} skill to master. A unique practicum was designed to help otolaryngology residents develop endoscopy skills. The <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> included lectures, an animal laboratory, high-fidelity manikins, virtual bronchoscopy simulation, and standardized patients. This study compares the relative subjective value of these <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> for skill development and realism. METHODS: Participants used a Likert scale (1 =disagree to 5 =agree) and open responses to anonymously rate the efficacy of 5 <b>learning</b> <b>modalities</b> for teaching airway management, endoscopy skills, and clinical leadership and for providing a realistic experience. RESULTS: The results in 2007 were uniformly positive, with mean scores for every category and modality greater than 4 for developing cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills; managing normal and abnormal conditions; preventing and managing complications; improving endoscopy skills; understanding team process; and experiencing overall and manual 2 ̆ 2 feel 2 ̆ 2 realism.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} differences among the dominant modalities displayed by kindergarten students, relationships between dominant modality and gender, and interactions between dominant modality and academic achievement. A total of 60 males and 60 females participated in this study. Subjects were randomly selected from 137 kindergarten students whose parents granted written permission for inclusion in the study. At the time of testing, subjects ranged in age from five years, seven months to seven years. During a three-week period of time, examiners administered the Swassing-Barbe Modality Index (SBMI) followed by the Skills Cluster of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery, to all subjects. Instruments were administered to each subject individually during two separate testing sessions. Subjects were divided into modality groups on the basis of SBMI modality percentage scores and modality raw scores. The. 05 level of confidence was established for testing statistical significance with each of the eight null hypotheses. The predominant <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> for kindergarten students was found to be audition, followed by vision and kinesthesia. The proportion of children identified as having a mixed modality strength was consistent with the proportion for the general population suggesting that integration of learning modalities may occur at an earlier age than that indicated by previous research. Essentially no relationship was found between dominant <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> and sex, or between ability to function within each modality (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) and sex. No significant differences were found among average achievement scores for visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and mixed dominance modality groups indicating significant relationship between a child's identified dominant <b>learning</b> <b>modality</b> and achievement. However, results did indicate significant relationships between ability to function within the dominant modality and achievement for children identified as having-either a visual or an auditory modality dominance. A significant relationship was also found between ability to utilize all learning modalities and achievement.
