5|$|Noted for the {{extensive}} interference of European powers, the conclave {{was to determine}} whether and on what terms the Council of Trent would reconvene (supported by Charles V and opposed by Henry II) and the fate of the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza (claimed by both Charles V and the House of Farnese). Although the conclave nearly elected Reginald Pole, the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of additional French cardinals pushed the conclave back into deadlock, and eventually Giovanni del Monte was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate.|$|E
5|$|Although her father, {{manager and}} {{various members of}} her touring team {{reportedly}} tried to dissuade her, Winehouse performed at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in Portugal in May 2008. Although the set was plagued by a <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> and problems with her voice, the crowd warmed to her. In addition to her own material she performed two Specials covers. Winehouse performed at Nelson Mandela's 90th Birthday Party concert at London's Hyde Park on 27 June, {{and the next day}} at the Glastonbury Festival. On 12 July, at the Oxegen Festival in Ireland she performed a well-received 50-minute set which was followed the next day by a 14-song set at T in the Park.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of the York garrison, it {{was late}} evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an oil rig tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{squadron}} {{consisting of}} seven ships {{of the line}} and three frigates and their assorted support ships under Admiral Gustav Wattrang had been delayed by the easterly winds arrived only after the Russian fleet had already left back for Saint Petersburg. Since they were unable to approach the town due to Russian defenses the Swedish squadron chose to arrange blockade of their own outside of Trångsund to trap the few Russian ships left behind. However, due to the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of the squadron the town had in effect already been lost and its surrender was only matter of time.|$|E

30|$|Each {{individual}} pallet has {{an acceptable}} window of arrival dates and a strict lower bound on its departure date. It is preferable for a pallet to arrive after its earliest arrival date and before its <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> date; no specific date within the acceptable window {{is preferable to}} any other. DALP-TS allows exploration of solutions with arrival dates outside the acceptable region by applying penalties to these violations. The approach used by [21] and [26] for temporal violations involved penalizing the objective function by {{a product of the}} number of days the item arrives after the required delivery date and the item’s weight. DALP-TS utilizes a similar approach by penalizing both early and late arrivals; however, rather than utilizing the required delivery date, DALP-TS considers the more restrictive <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> date. Pallets arriving prior to their earliest arrival date incur a penalty equal to the difference between the earliest arrival date and arrival date multiplied by the pallet weight and a scaling factor, which is detailed in Sect.  4.5. 5. Likewise, pallets arriving after their <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> date incur a penalty equal to the difference between the <b>arrival</b> date and <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> date multiplied by the pallet weight and a scaling factor.|$|R
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated {{under the cover of}} part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company was rushed to the spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> to Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E

5|$|Initially the new {{regiment}} {{was equipped}} with Churchill tanks, although this was only a temporary measure until Centurion tanks could be acquired. However, due to the perceived unsuitability of the Churchill and the <b>late</b> <b>arrival</b> of the new platform, the regiment was not deployed as part of Australia's commitment to the Korean War, although a number of officers served on exchange with British and US formations and the unit provided machine-gunners and signalers to Australian infantry battalions as reinforcements. The first Centurions finally began arriving in June 1952, with the regiment receiving 39 tanks. With the numbers of regular personnel steadily growing, {{it was possible to}} raise Regimental Headquarters, Headquarters Squadron and B Squadron, and the regiment was fully raised by 8 September 1952 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Graham.|$|E

By this time though British and Canadian armoured units were operating in sufficient strength in Korea and there was no scope for the deployment of Australian forces.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing {{him that he had}} seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst to assist with the wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice. Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' <b>late</b> <b>arrival,</b> which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt was {{recently}} demonstrated {{that one can}} reconstruct the impulse response between passive sensors, by cross-correlating diffuse waves or ambient noise. Using seismic waves recorded on the moon, we show here that not only direct waves can be retrieved but also <b>late</b> <b>arrivals</b> that have been scattered before reaching the seismometers. As these <b>late</b> <b>arrivals</b> propagate for longer time, they are more sensitive to weak perturbations of the medium such as velocity changes. This high sensitivity of scattered waves is used to monitor periodic velocity changes in the lunar soil by measuring small delays of the passively retrieved coda waves. The velocity changes result from temperature variations due to periodic heating of the lunar surface by the sun...|$|R

40|$|Kara and Tansel (Management Science, Volume 47, 2001, 1408 [...] 1420) {{introduce}} the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> hub location problem {{as a more}} realistic way of modeling cargo delivery. The key feature of the new model is that each link in the network is served by a single vehicle that makes exactly one trip. As a result, the traffic requiring a particular link {{may be forced to}} wait for all other traffic requiring the same link to arrive. Therefore, the travel time between a particular pair of nodes depends not just on travel times of the links on the path taken, but also on these forced "waiting times," which are called transient times in Kara and Tansel (2001). We show, however, that if the objective function depends only on the maximum travel time, this "new" model is essentially the same as the classical model that ignores the transient times. Our result implies that two of the three versions of the <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> hub location problem proposed by Kara and Tansel, including the one to which they devote most of their paper, are equivalent to their classical counterparts. hub location, minimax, hub cover, <b>latest</b> <b>arrival...</b>|$|R

40|$|A digital {{microfluidic}} biochip (DMFB) is {{a device}} that digitizes fluidic samples into tiny droplets and operates chemical processes on a single chip. Movement control of droplets can be realized by using electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology. DMFBs have high configurability, high sensitivity, low cost and reduced human error {{as well as a}} promising future in the applications of point-of-care medical diagnostic, and DNA sequencing. As the demands of scalability, configurability and portability increase, a new DMFB architecture called Microelectrode Dot Array (MEDA) has been introduced recently to allow configurable electrodes shape and more precise control of droplets. The objective of this work is to investigate a routing algorithm which can not only handle the routing problem for traditional DMFBs, but also be able to route different sizes of droplets and incorporate diagonal movements for MEDA. The proposed droplet routing algorithm is based on 3 D-A* search algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the maximum <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> time, average <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> time and total number of used cells. By enabling channel-based routing in MEDA, the equivalent total number of used cells can be significantly reduced. Compared to all existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can achieve so far the least average <b>latest</b> <b>arrival</b> time...|$|R
