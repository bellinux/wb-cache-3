We used a quantitative morphological and functional analysis to reconstruct intervertebral joint stiffness in the tail along the theropod lineage to extant birds. This provides new details of the tail’s morphological transformation, {{and for the first}} time quantitatively evaluates its biomechanical consequences. We observe that both dorsoventral and <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> decreased along the non-avian theropod lineage (between nodes Theropoda and Paraves). Our results show how the tail structure of non-avian theropods was mechanically appropriate for holding itself up against gravity and maintaining passive balance. However, as dorsoventral and <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> decreased, the tail may have become more effective for dynamically maintaining balance. This supports our hypothesis of a reduction of dorsoventral and <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> in shorter tails. Along the avian theropod lineage (Avialae to crown group birds), dorsoventral and <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> increased overall, which appears to contradict our null expectation. We infer that this departure in joint stiffness is specific to the tail’s aerodynamic role and the functional constraints imposed by it. Increased dorsoventral and <b>lateral</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> may have facilitated a gradually improved capacity to lift, depress, and swing the tail.

To {{investigate}} whether {{the increase in}} spinal flexibility after chymopapain injection is dose dependent and determine the "optimal" dosage of chymopapain to increase spinal flexibility in a rabbit model. Summary of Background Data. Spinal instability after chymopapain injection may result in severe back pain. However, this undesired mechanical effect in treating disc herniation may provide a safe minimally invasive approach for anterior spinal release in scoliosis correction. Methods. A total of 138 lumbar intervertebral discs from 46 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly injected with chymopapain at 6. 25, 12. 5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 picokatals (pKats) / 0. 05 mL/disc. The rabbits were killed 1 week after the injection, and the <b>lateral</b> bending <b>stiffness</b> of the spinal segments without posterior elements was determined. Results. The <b>lateral</b> bending spinal <b>stiffness</b> showed no significant change after injection of 6. 25 and 12. 5 pKats/ 0. 05 mL/disc but reduced significantly following chymopapain injection of 25, 50, 75, and 100 pKats (all P < 0. 05 by post hoc least significant difference tests). While the <b>lateral</b> bending <b>stiffness</b> was lowest at the 100 -pKats dose, {{there were no significant}} differences between the four higher dosages. Conclusion. The reduction in the <b>lateral</b> bending spinal <b>stiffness</b> after chymopapain injection is dose dependent, and an optimal dosage for spinal release existed; doses greater than the optimal dosage did not result in further significant decrease in <b>lateral</b> bending spinal <b>stiffness.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|Potential {{benefits}} of the Tweel include not only the obvious safety and convenience of never having flat tires, but also, in automotive applications, the Tweel airless tire {{has the potential to}} be able to brake better - a significant performance compromise that is inherent to pneumatic tires. Unlike a pneumatic tire, a Tweel can be designed to have high <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> while simultaneously having low vertical stiffness. This can be achieved because, in the design elements of a Tweel, the vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffness</b> are not inseparably linked and can thus be optimized independently. Because there is no air bladder under the tread, tread patterns can, if desired, even incorporate water evacuation through holes in the design thus eliminating or significantly reducing hydroplaning. Michelin expects the tread to last two to three times as long as a conventional tire. [...] Because the tread rubber around the outer circumference is replaceable when worn (as opposed to disposing of a whole worn tire), the potential environmental impact of a Tweel airless tire can be less than that of a conventional pneumatic tire.|$|E

50|$|Resistance to {{lateral forces}} is {{provided}} primarily by rigid frame action - that is, {{by the development}} of bending moment and shear force in the frame members and joints.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the seismic {{response}} of groups containing nonvertical piles are studied, including the <b>lateral</b> pile-head <b>stiffnesses,</b> the ""kinematic"" pile deformation, and the ""inertial"" soil-pile-structure response. A key goal is to explore {{the conditions under which}} the presence of batter piles is beneficial, indifferent, or detrimental. Parametric analyses are carried out using three-dimensional finite-element modeling, assuming elastic behavior of soil, piles, and superstructure. The model is first used to obtain the <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of single batter piles and to show that its results converge to the available solutions from the literature. Then, real accelerograms covering a broad range of frequency characteristics are employed as base excitation of simple fixed-head two-pile group configurations, embedded in homogeneous, inhomogeneous, and layered soil profiles, while supporting very tall or very short structures. Five pile inclinations are considered while the corresponding vertical-pile group results serve as reference. It is found that in purely kinematic seismic loading, batter piles tend to confirm their negative reputation, as had also been found recently for a group subjected to static horizontal ground deformation. However, the total (kinematic plus inertial) response of structural systems founded on groups of batter piles offers many reasons for optimism. Batter piles may indeed be beneficial (or detrimental) depending on, among other parameters, the relative size of the overturning moment versus the shear force transmitted onto them from the superstructure. © 2010 ASCE...|$|R

The rotor is laterally restrained in two orthogonal directions by linear springs and is accelerated by a constant applied torque. It is found that, for a fixed combination of rotor unbalance and <b>lateral</b> <b>stiffnesses,</b> the applied torque must exceed a limiting value in order to accelerate successfully through the critical speed region. With smaller applied torques, after initial acceleration from rest the speed oscillates ontinually about the critical speed and the lateral excursions grow steadily.

The effects of small amounts of viscous damping in the lateral directions are also obtained.
