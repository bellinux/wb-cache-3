Eight additional trains per hour would {{be added to the}} White Plains Road <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> fourteen additional trains per hour would be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line would make use of the third track for express service.|$|E

Up to five daily express trains along the Sørlandet <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the stop at Lysaker. It also serves an hourly headway of the R10 regional trains from the Drammen <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> Dovre Line. There are five hourly trains heading to Asker via the Asker Line, including the L12, L13 and L14. Westwards L12 runs to Kongsberg while they eastwards serve the Gardermoen Line, Trunk <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Kongsvinger Line. L1, a full-stop service on the Trunk- and Drammen Line, runs every thirty minutes. A rush-hour service line L2x, serving the Østfold Line, also serves Lysaker.|$|E

5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause <b>line</b> breakage <b>and</b> damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or the <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has}} been ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto <b>lines.</b> Snow <b>and</b> ice accumulation on <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> other hardware.|$|R

5|$|The initial {{use for the}} Di 3 was {{to operate}} the three non-electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Nordland Line. Following the {{delivery}} of the first batch in 1957, they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line, north of Otta to Trondheim, and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana. The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland <b>Line,</b> <b>and</b> reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted axle load. From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted axle load {{had been made to}} the Dovre <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> Nordland <b>Line,</b> <b>and</b> the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} built {{as part of}} the Chrystie Street Connection between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. The Chrystie Street Connection was first {{proposed}} in 1947 as {{the southern end of the}} Second Avenue Subway (SAS), which would feed into the two bridges, allowing Sixth Avenue Line trains to access the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Fourth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the BMT Brighton Line in Brooklyn. Construction started in 1962, and the first part of the connection, including this station, opened on November 26, 1967, when the link between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Manhattan Bridge north tracks opened. The connection was fully opened on July 1, 1968 with the opening of the 57th Street and the opening of the connection between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Williamsburg Bridge. With the connection completed, the most significant service changes ever carried out in the subway's history were introduced.|$|E
