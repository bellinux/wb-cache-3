2500|$|A first take of this song, {{unreleased}} until 2014's , {{features a}} stream of nonsensical lyrics, held together by the chorus, [...] "Now <b>look</b> <b>here</b> dear soup, you'd best feed the cats/The cats need feeding and you're the one to do it/Get your hat, feed the cats/You ain't goin' nowhere". For Heylin, this first version demonstrates Dylan's talent for delivering [...] "strings of pearls wrapped in riddles. ... Dylan had a tune, {{the last line of}} each verse (i.e., the title), and the chorus." ...|$|E

In giving evidence, Huxley states [...] "Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I finds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here's a hippocampus. No, there ain't says Owen. <b>Look</b> <b>here</b> says I.

2500|$|It {{will begin}} early – before {{some of us}} are up, no doubt, and it will {{continue}} late. [...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will <b>look</b> <b>here</b> and that piece in the other corner. The still [...] "younger ones" [...] will still more enjoy it. [...] Into the cellar and upon the roof, into the rat-holes and on the yard fence, into each room and prying into every cupboard, they mill make reprisals of many things [...] "worth saving," [...] and mark the day white in their calendar, as little less to be longed for in the return than Fourth of July itself.Keep your tempers, good people. Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.|$|E
