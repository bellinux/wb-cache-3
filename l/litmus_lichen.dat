50|$|Erythrolitmin (also called erythrolein) is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} extracted from the <b>Litmus</b> <b>lichen,</b> used in chemistry as a pH indicator. The erythrolitmin molecule {{is related to the}} orceins, and consists essentially of several phenoxazone and orcinol residues.|$|E
40|$|A new pH-sensing {{film was}} {{developed}} by using tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP) and natural dye extracted from <b>litmus</b> <b>lichen</b> (LLE). The addition of LLE from 0 to 2. 5 % decreased the tensile strength and elongation at break from 30. 20 to 29. 97 MPa and 69. 73 % to 60. 13 %, respectively, but increased the water vapor permeability from 0. 399 × 10 − 9 to 0. 434 × 10 − 9 g·s− 1 ·m− 1 ·Pa− 1. The UV–Vis spectra of the <b>litmus</b> <b>lichen</b> extract (LLE) in the pH range of 4 – 10 showed that the color clearly changed from orange to blue. The characterization results showed that TSP interacted with LLE through hydrogen bonds. The color of the film varied from orange (pH 4. 0) to blue-violet (pH 10. 0). The full cream milk spoilage test indicated that the film is suitable for application in full cream milk spoilage detection. The developed pH-sensing film {{could be used as}} a promising diagnostic tool for the detection of food spoilage...|$|E
