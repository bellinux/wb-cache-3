25|$|The IITs had {{initially}} a quota system, but the quota system was scrapped and the modified scheme described below {{was introduced in}} 1983. This procedure was evolved based {{on the experience of}} implementing a quota system for ten years (1973–1983). The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, there should not be any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved quota have no relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree. They are, however, allowed to complete the program at a slower pace (take <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the degree).|$|E
25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for eyewear in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture the buzz of times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E

500|$|A common {{criticism}} of Majora's Mask {{is that it}} is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time. GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place." [...] Game Revolution wrote that it [...] "takes a little <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into this Zelda", but also that [...] "there are moments when the game really hits you with all its intricacies and mysteries, and that makes it all worthwhile." ...|$|E

She added, [...] "It took us much <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> here than we anticipated. But we still have very big ambitions for the brand to go much farther." [...] Hewson herself has pale skin and very dark hair, wears little jewellery, and has eschewed cosmetic surgery.

2500|$|Gaskarth {{mentioned}} {{how they}} {{went from being}} one of the biggest groups on a label who had a small amount staff and could provide their complete attention, to a major label [...] "and we're definitely not the biggest fish in that pond. There's a lot going on, it takes a little bit <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things done and get things moving." [...] He added that the band thought they [...] "hit a ceiling" [...] with Hopeless Records since [...] "trying to tackle things like getting radio [...] and things like that was sort of becoming harder and harder {{based on the fact that}} the label hadn’t really done it before." [...] In December, the band began writing for their next album. The band demoed around 20 songs for inclusion on their next album before whittling the number down, with the aim of recording 15 or 16 of them. After touring in Australia as part of the Soundwave festival in February and March 2010, Gaskarth spent time writing new material in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Gardner pitched nine no-hit {{innings in}} a July 26, [...] game before losing 1–0 in the 10th inning to the Los Angeles Dodgers. [...] Two days later, also in Los Angeles, Dennis Martínez {{achieved}} a rare feat, throwing the 13th official perfect game in Major League Baseball history (based on MLB's 1991 redefinition {{of a perfect}} game), winning 2–0. Dave Van Horne's iconic call of [...] "El Presidente, El Perfecto!" [...] following the final out became a hallmark of Expos lore. Martinez's catcher, Ron Hassey, also caught Len Barker's perfect game ten years earlier and remains the only player to catch two perfect games in MLB history. The euphoria of the pitching feats did not last, as the Expos were rendered homeless for the final month of the season after a 50-ton beam collapsed from Olympic Stadium's structure and fell nine metres onto a public concourse hours before a motocross event on September 13. [...] The Expos hinted {{that they would have}} to open the 1992 season elsewhere unless Olympic Stadium was certified safe. [...] While the stadium itself was given a clean bill of health by engineers in November, it took <b>longer</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one for the roof since it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm. [...] Ultimately, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times; it had only been opened 88 times in a little more than four years.|$|E
