This {{was considered to be}} unfortunate by Robert Cailliau, one of the developers: [...] "I think in retrospect the biggest mistake made in the whole project was the public release of the <b>Line-Mode</b> <b>Browser.</b> It gave the Internet hackers immediate access, but only {{from the point of view}} of the passive browser â€” no editing capabilities" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, whilst {{working at}} CERN Tim Berners-Lee {{proposed}} {{to create a}} global hypertext project, which later {{became known as the}} World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple <b>line-mode</b> <b>browser.</b> [...] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. [...] The W3C was created in October 1994 to [...] "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability." [...] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.|$|E
