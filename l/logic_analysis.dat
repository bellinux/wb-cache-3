40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel test point insertion method for pseudorandom built-in self-test (BIST) {{to reduce the}} area overhead. The proposed method replaces dedicated flip-flops for driving control points by existing functional flip-flops. For each control point, candidate functional flip-flops are identified by using <b>logic</b> cone <b>analysis</b> that investigates the path inversion parity, logical distance, and reconvergence from each control point. Four types of new control point structures are introduced based on the <b>logic</b> cone <b>analysis</b> results to avoid degrading the testability. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed method significantly reduces test point area overhead by replacing the dedicated flip-flops and achieves essentially the same fault coverage as conventional test point implementations using dedicated flip-flops driving the control points.

50|$|Many digital designs, {{including}} those of ICs, are simulated to detect defects before the unit is constructed. The simulation usually provides <b>logic</b> <b>analysis</b> displays. Often, complex discrete logic is verified by simulating inputs and testing outputs using boundary scan. Logic analyzers can uncover hardware defects that are not found in simulation. These problems are typically too difficult to model in simulation, or too time consuming to simulate and often cross multiple clock domains.|$|E

5000|$|Functional {{analyses}} are needed as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or Piece-Part (hardware) FMEA. A FMEA {{is used to}} structure Mitigation for Risk reduction based on either failure (mode) effect severity reduction or based on lowering the probability of failure or both. The FMEA is in principle a full inductive (forward <b>logic)</b> <b>analysis,</b> however the failure probability can only be estimated or reduced by understanding the failure mechanism. Ideally this probability shall be lowered to [...] "impossible to occur" [...] by eliminating the (root) causes. It is therefore important {{to include in the}} FMEA an appropriate depth of information on the causes of failure (deductive analysis).|$|E

40|$|Completeness is {{important}} in approximated semantics design by abstract interpretation, ensuring that abstract computations are as precise as possible wrt concrete ones. The authors recently proved that any abstract domain can be systematically refined or simplified {{in order to provide}} its closest possible complete domain. The key problem here remains is to find efficient and appropriate representations for objects in complete abstract domains. In this paper we show that these domain trensformations, when applied on abstract interpretations of quantales, can all be explicitly characterized by elegant linear logic-based formulations. We apply our results to <b>logic</b> program <b>analysis,</b> where unification can be interpreted as multiplicative conjunction in a quantale of idempotent substitutions. We characterize the objects in optimal semantics for <b>logic</b> program <b>analysis,</b> viz. the most abstract concrete semantics for any static program analysis property, and the structure of condensing domains in <b>logic</b> program <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
30|$|The main {{contributions}} {{in this paper}} are twofold. First, a closed-loop control architecture based on automatic data flow between the cyber space and the physical space is built to support demand dispatch in the CPS of aggregated EWHs, including state awareness, real-time analysis, scientific decision-making and precise execution. Second, based on the closed-loop control architecture, the state awareness <b>logic,</b> real-time <b>analysis</b> <b>logic,</b> scientific decision-making logic and precise execution logic are designed to implement demand dispatch.|$|R
50|$|What is new {{in social}} {{software}} compared to older fields {{is the use}} of tools from computer science like program <b>logic,</b> <b>analysis</b> of algorithms and epistemic logic. Like programs, social procedures dovetail into each other. For instance an airport provides runways for planes to land, but it also provides security checks, and it must provide for ways in which buses and taxis can take arriving passengers to their local destinations. The entire mechanism can be analyzed {{in the way in which}} a complex computer program can be analyzed. The Banach-Knaster procedure for dividing a cake fairly, or the Brams and Taylor procedure for fair division have been analyzed in this way. To point to the need for epistemic logic, a building not only needs restrooms, for obvious reasons, it also needs signs indicating where they are. Thus epistemic considerations enter in addition to structural ones. For a more urgent example, in addition to medicines, physicians also need tests to indicate what a patient’s problem is.|$|E

The proposed architecture is particu-larly useful for in-field debugging of custom circuits that have sources of nondeterministic behavior such as asynchronous interfaces. In order to measure the tradeoff between the area overhead {{and the increase in}} the observation window, we also introduce a new compression ratio metric. We use this metric to quantify the performance gain of three lossless compression algorithms suitable for embedded <b>logic</b> <b>analysis.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Program theory evaluation, {{which has}} grown in use over the past 10 years, assesses whether a program is {{designed}} {{in such a way}} that it can achieve its intended outcomes. This article describes a particular type of program theory evaluation [...] <b>logic</b> <b>analysis</b> [...] that allows us to test the plausibility of a program's theory using scientific knowledge. <b>Logic</b> <b>analysis</b> is useful for improving the intervention or finding alternatives for achieving intended outcomes; it influences the choice of type of evaluation to conduct and strengthens the validity of subsequent evaluations. The objective of this article is to present the methodological principles and the roots of this type of program theory evaluation. We illustrate two types of <b>logic</b> <b>analysis</b> with two actual evaluation cases. There are very few published examples of program theory evaluation.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and validates {{the framework}} of a specialized maintenance decision support system for a discrete part manufacturing facility. Its construction utilizes a modular approach based on the fundamental philosophy of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). The proposed architecture uniquely integrates System Decomposition, System Evaluation, Failure <b>Analysis,</b> <b>Logic</b> Tree <b>Analysis,</b> and Maintenance Planning modules. It presents an ideal solution to the unique maintenance inadequacies of modern discrete part manufacturing systems. Well established techniques are incorporated as building blocks of the system 2 ̆ 7 s modules. These include Failure Mode Effect and Criticality <b>Analysis</b> (FMECA), <b>Logic</b> Tree <b>Analysis</b> (LTA), Theory of Constraints (TOC), and an Expert System (ES). A Maintenance Information System (MIS) performs the system 2 ̆ 7 s support functions. Validation was performed by field testing of the system at a Miami based manufacturing facility. Such a maintenance support system potentially reduces downtime losses and contributes to higher product quality output. Ultimately improved profitability is the final outcome. ...|$|R
