50|$|A {{series of}} {{examinations}} of language sought to find {{if there was}} a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., faggot) were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its <b>labelled</b> <b>category,</b> or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.|$|E

40|$|The {{category}} shift {{literature suggests}} that rule-based classification, an important form of explicit learning, is mediated by two separate learned associations: a stimulus-to-label association that associates stimuli and <b>category</b> <b>labels,</b> and a label-to-response association that associates <b>category</b> <b>labels</b> and responses. Three experiments investigate whether information–integration classification, an important form of implicit learning, is also mediated by two separate learned associations. Participants were trained on a rule-based or an information–integration categorization task and then the association between stimulus and <b>category</b> <b>label,</b> or between <b>category</b> <b>label</b> and response location was altered. For rule-based categories, and in line with previous research, breaking the association between stimulus and <b>category</b> <b>label</b> caused more interference than breaking the association between <b>category</b> <b>label</b> and response location. However, no differences in recovery rate emerged. For information–integration categories, breaking the association between stimulus and <b>category</b> <b>label</b> caused more interference and led to greater recovery than breaking the association between <b>category</b> <b>label</b> and response location. These results provide evidence that information–integration category learning is mediated by separate stimulus-to-label and label-to-response associations. Implications for the neurobiological basis of these two learned associations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to having communicative functions, verbal labels {{may play a role}} in shaping concepts. Two experiments assessed whether the presence of <b>labels</b> affected <b>category</b> formation. Subjects learned to categorize 2 ̆ 2 aliens 2 ̆ 2 as those to be approached or those to be avoided. After accuracy feedback on each response was provided, a nonsense label was either presented or not.

A follow-up study investigated differences between learning verbal and nonverbal associations and showed that learning a nonverbal association did not facilitate categorization.

40|$|A {{major feature}} that sets {{language}} {{apart from other}} communication systems {{is the use of}} categorylabels—words. In addition to providing a means of communication, there is growing evidence that <b>category</b> <b>labels</b> {{play a role in the}} formation and shaping of concepts. If verbal labels help humans acquire or use category information, one can ask whether it is easier to learn <b>labeled</b> <b>categories</b> compared to unlabeled ones. Normal English-speaking adults participated in a category-learning task in which <b>categories</b> were <b>labeled</b> or unlabeled. The presence of labels facilitated the learning of unfamiliar categories and resulted in more robust category representations. The advantage for acquiring named categories was observed even though the <b>category</b> <b>labels</b> did not convey any additional information and all participants had equivalent experience categorizing the stimuli. This work provides empirical support for the idea of labels as conceptual anchor points (Clark, 1997). 1...|$|R

The method is an extension of Maximum Margin Multi-Valued Regression (M 3 VM) to the case where those edges are characterized by different attributes. It is applied on a large-scale problem where an agent tries to learn unknown object-object relations by exploiting known such relations. The method can handle not only binary relations but also complex, structured relations such as text, images, collections of <b>labels,</b> <b>categories,</b> etc., which can be represented by kernels. We compare the performance with a specialized, state-of-the-art matrix completion method. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the influence of <b>category</b> <b>labeling</b> upon <b>category</b> clustering in free recall of pictures and words in kindergarten children. A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design was used, which incorporated {{the presence or absence}} of <b>category</b> <b>labeling,</b> the picture and word stimuli, and the number of trials(1 and 2). The last factor was a within variable. The Ss were 40 kindergateners with a mean of 6 years and 4 months, who were assigned to one of the following 4 conditions: Picture-labeling, Picture-control, Word-labeling, and Word-control. S was presented a list of 32 picture instances of that of 32 word instances. Each list was composed of 8 instances from each of four categories (animal, vehicle, vegetable, and stationery) as is shown in Table 1. The Ss assigned tothe labeling conditions were given 32 instances one by one with their category names such as E' saying, "A lion is an animal. " The remaining Ss were notgiven such categorynames. The study and free recall trials were run twice alternatively. Immediately after the 2 nd free recall trials, 5 s were required to recall instances from each of four categories in order to examine the effect of category cues upon the output process in free recall. The main results are given in Tables 2 and 3. (a) The main effect of <b>category</b> <b>labeling</b> was not statistically significant both for recall and clustering, which were not consistent with the present prediction.

30|$|Among them, {{the marker}} amount {{constitutes}} a hidden variable at the observation grid Z. To learn the distribution {{model of the}} observations by using observations, the relationship between observations, label classes, and offset measures on grid Z must be established. On V and Z, respectively, the position in the observed set V has a definite marker class 1 on the image. However, the <b>labeling</b> <b>category</b> Z on the unobserved position set is uncertain. Under the assumption of {{the continuity of the}} distribution model, the position where the marker category is indefinite should be understood as not observed, and the 0 marker cannot directly determine the corresponding observation result. The <b>label</b> <b>category</b> indicates whether the observation position belongs to the offset set under the level c. However, when estimating the overall offset measure using the observation data, it is necessary to further specify the mark relationship between the elements of the sets V and Z to integrate the mark relationships on the entire grid point Z. In connection with the data-extraction process in the previous article [30], the dependency relationship between grid observations can be established on Z using the mixture graph structure as a basis for subsequent inference learning using observation data. The relationship between marker categories and grid positions is established through a directed graph structure. At the same time, pairwise Markov random fields are used to establish a dependency relationship between the discrete grid points on the imaging domain, i.e., the distribution of p(⋅) on Z.|$|R
