40|$|Digestive {{disorders}} like coccidiosis, Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy and colibacillosis {{are responsible}} for severe economical losses in rational rabbit production. Robenidine hydrochloride is widely used to prevent coccidiosis, a disease which has detrimental effects <b>on</b> <b>zootechnical</b> performance and which acts synergistically with Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy. Although the exact cause of the latter disease is yet unknown, Clostridium perfringens is often isolated from diseased animals. The present study describes the in-vitro effect of robenidine hydrochloride on 39 Clostridium perfringens isolates from rabbits. Robenidine hydrochloride concentrations of 4 µg/ml were able to inhibit the in-vitro growth of all examined isolates, which might be relevant for the in-vivo situation...|$|R
40|$|Cika cattle is {{the only}} Slovenian {{autochthonous}} cattle breed. It originates from Bohinj where breeders bred their own "cow families" and by doing so they kept a relatively high milk yield of Bohinj cows. They did not buy cows outside of Bohinj, only the bulls were purchased by the cooperatives at the cattle breeding fairs. Cika cattle was a widely used breed until the sixties of previous century, primarily as a dairy breed. Political decision made in 1964 significantly reduced {{the population in the}} following years. Our research was focused on the study of historical sources which show the development of Cike cattle in the Republic of Slovenia. We have put special emphasis <b>on</b> <b>zootechnical</b> characterization, genealogy, livestock geography, morphology and milk production of Cika cattle...|$|R

Fingerlings of tilapia Oreochromis niloticus were bred {{in three}} types of fish farming of rural zone in Ivory Coast to {{determine}} impacts of the compliance of biosecurity measures <b>on</b> <b>zootechnical</b> parameters of these bred fishes. Fish farming were shared out in {{three types of}} farming based {{on the value of}} biosecurity measures compliance, which were 5 %, 55 %, and 83 %. No significant differences were observed between mean values of physic and chemical parameters of ponds water from three types of fish farming. Concerning mean values of zootechnical parameters, the fish breeding with 83 % of rate compliance of biosecurity measures had registered better values of zoo technical performance with significant differences compared with others types of fish farming...|$|R

The animals were divided into two groups (dEBC group = 9 animals and debt group = 10 animals) and, from the first reproductive cycle, fed two diets, similar for ingredients, protein and energy content, but characterized by different electrolyte balance (dEB = Na+ -+ K+ - Cl-, meq/ 100 g) : dEBC = 27 meq/ 100 g and dEBT = 35 meq/ 100 g. The higher dEB was achieved by adding sodium to the supplement of the dEBT diet. The rearing temperature was 15 deg C and the relative humidity was 79...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the issues {{pertaining to the}} adoption and development of <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular migration {{in the context of}} uncontrolled {{growth in the number of}} immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East to the EU. The article attempts at studying the EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular migration, classifying it, and analysing the prospects of EU migration legislation in the light of an increase in irregular immigration into the EU. The author systematises, classifies the current EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration, and analyses the conditions, in which this legislation was developed. Using the legislation analysis method, the author proposes the following system of EU <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration: rules preventing assistance to irregular immigration, rules preventing employment of irregular immigrants, rules on the return of irregular migrants and readmission, rules on border control, and rules on collaboration with third countries. The author pays special attention to analysing the current state of irregular immigration to the EU, which was dubbed the "greatest migration crisis in Europe". The conclusion is that the European Union succeeded in the development of pioneering <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration, which can serve as the basis for reception by other states. However, changes in the political and economic situation in the EU's southern borderlands made the current legal mechanisms incapable of withstanding new threats. It necessitates a radical reform of the <b>legislation</b> <b>on</b> irregular immigration...|$|R
