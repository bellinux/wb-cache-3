40|$|The Louisiana shrimp fishery has {{experienced}} a collapse {{in the price of}} shrimp since 2001. The principal reason for this collapse is increasing shrimp imports. Examining the political economy of agro-food systems and the interrelated household economies of Louisiana shrimp fisherpeople, this thesis asks how household commodity production, where fishers own their means of production and supply most labor themselves, is being restructured by the liberalization of seafood trade. Shrimpers have drawn increasingly on household resources (such as unwaged labor of family members) that are normally devoted to social reproduction to maintain their participation in household commodity production. In other words, households shift resources out of the family and into the economy in order to make good on <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> income they suffer from low prices. Households continue producing at de facto wage levels below that necessary to support the household on shrimping income alone...|$|E

In order to control these losses, retail companies {{use a combination}} of people, programs, and systems. A review of the literature indicates specialised loss prevention employees {{are an important part of}} many asset protection programs.;A major interest of managers is improving the efficiency of their crime and loss control processes, including loss prevention store detective programs. Retail managers commonly use job performance reviews to gauge the individual efficacy of store detectives. In addition to job training, and job output supervision, research has indicated certain stable characteristics of individuals helps explain actual job performance, making pre-employment selection a critical part of process improvement. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to the selection of in-store detectives in the literature.;Qualitative research was used to identify critical job tasks in order to develop and validate a specialised job performance instrument. The preliminary research with subject matter experts indicated four distinct job roles of store detectives. This job analysis also resulted in a new job performance rating instrument later tested in the quantitative phase of the project.;Subsequently, a quantitative study of 201 US store detectives (using the performance instrument in a concurrent validity design) developed four distinct selection models designed to help explain role-specific job performance variance. Four hypothesis regarding the relationship between biographical data, personality traits, cognitive ability and the four measures of job performance were tested using multiple and logistic regression. The four resulting models explained between 13 % and 23 % of the variance in detective job performance measures.;Implications of the project's findings, and suggestions are also discussed in context t the current sample, as well as prior work in pre-employment selection research...|$|E

The models in this paper help explain this discrepancy using two assumptions: (1) the probabilities of being robbed or pick-pocketed, or having a purse snatched, depend on the amount <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> held; and (2) there are costs of being robbed other than <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> such as injury, medical bills, lost time at work, and trauma. Two models are presented: a dynamic, stochastic model with both instantaneous and decaying noncash costs of robbery, and a revised version of the inventory-theoretic model that includes one-period noncash costs. The former model yields an easily interpreted first-order condition for money demand involving various marginal costs and benefits <b>of</b> holding <b>cash.</b> The latter model gives quantitative solutions for money demand that come much closer to matching the 1995 data$ 75. 98 for one plausible set of parameters.

It has potential to be very helpful for central governments and economies, in the context of global negative inflation and quantative easing, and central control of the money supply. However a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> also transfers complete control of transactions, interest, and individual use of money, and information about these, to the nation state and third party providers, since the individual cannot avoid their money being held in an external system capable of regulation and control.

Therefore it requires another approach to counter phishing attack which is more accurate and efficient than blacklist method. The purpose of this work is to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms such as an Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machines and K-nearest Neighbor to website phishing detection. The datasets of phishing and non-phishing websites were gathered in order to train, test machine learning algorithm models, compare evaluative metrics of algorithms between each other.

40|$|In Sierra Leone, at {{the moment}} 10 out of the total 14 districts {{are faced with the}} problem of {{large-scale}} land investments for industrial agriculture (oil palm, sugarcane…). The production is mainly for the local, regional and world market. There are quite many of these investments in the planning stage, while some are extending their operations by taking more land from communities or are already at the production stage. Studies and media reports have claimed a number of negative impacts felt in communities hosting these companies, ranging from <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> land, food insecurity, increase in poverty to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> livelihoods, environmental degradation as well as social and cultural problems. The goal of this thesis is to examine the impacts of the operations of “Socfin Agriculture Company” on food security of local communities in Malen Chiefdom, Pujehun District of Sierra Leone. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are used for data collection, analyses, and interpretation of results. The research uses household income and expenditure to compare household food security before and after the start of the company’s operations. It examines consequences <b>of</b> community’s <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> land to support household food production versus casual wage earn from employment created by the company to meet household food security. The results show a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> household’s income sources and a significant decrease in households’ income. Households’ food crop production has reduced accompanied by a complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> crop farming. Households affected by the operations of the company have lost access to land and other natural resources that support food production. Furthermore, the company employs very few people in comparison to the total population of affected communities. Calculation of total wage earn from employment by the company cannot meet the staple food (rice) needs of the households. Also, households claimed a host of unfilled promises made by the company and national government {{at the onset of the}} operations of the company. In conclusion, household food production is the most significant determinant for household food security, with regards to food availability, accessibility, utilization and stability of supply. Therefore, national government should carefully study and develop a framework that addresses food security of households impacted by the operations of the rapidly growing large-scale land investment companies and ensure a fair share of the local community in the economic development of the country and suggesting ways of improving access rights in the context of tenure. ...|$|R

For individuals with disabilities currently receiving health care under Medicaid, the fear of losing their health care and related services {{is one of the greatest}} barriers keeping such individuals from maximizing their employment, earnings potential, and independence. For many individual SSDI and SSI recipients, the risk of losing Medicare and Medicaid coverage that is linked to their cash benefits is a risk that is an equal or greater work disincentive than the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> benefits associated with working. To allow workers with income levels higher than SSI requirements to maintain their Medicaid coverage, the federal government has provided states with an optional “Medicaid Buy-In program. ” The Buy-In allows qualifying people with disabilities whose income levels are too high for them to receive SSI, to purchase Medicaid coverage much like one would purchase any health insurance policy. The Medicaid Buy-In was first made a state option through the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (Section 4733). The 1999 passage of TWWIIA expanded the number and type of choices states can make if they decide to implement a Medicaid Buy-In program. States primarily support working persons with disabilities through implementation of Buy-In programs. Twenty-nine states (Bicameral Briefing on Medicaid Buy-in Programs for Working Individuals with Disabilities, 2001) have adopted some form of a Medicaid Buy-In program that enables persons with disabilities to continue eligibility for Medicaid-financed services. States with Buy-In programs implemented them following guidelines outlined in either the Balanced Budget Act (1997) or in TWWIIA (1999). Older programs tend to follow BBA guidelines and newer programs tend to follow TWWIIA guidelines. Nebraska’s Buy-In program currently follows the BBA guidelines. This report provides projections of the number of qualified unmarried Nebraskans expected to enroll in the current Medicaid Buy-In program. (The current policy is summarized in the table presented below.) To gauge the effect of changes in specific policy parameters, we also estimate enrollment in the program under different policy scenarios. These projections are based on a number of underlying assumptions. We assume that all qualified Nebraskans have complete knowledge of the program, there is no perceived social stigma attached to participation in the program, and that enrollment for qualified individuals is costless. The report is organized around the presentation of six tables of population projections.

It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, diminishing the possibilities of pilfering and governance processes Internal audit began in unsophisticated manner during the Second World War, especially In 1939,when the Nazi Party were the first government to recognize the importance of having a well-controlled mechanism for running an evil, world-conquering regime. The IIA were contracted to undertake a series of efficiency reviews in the early weeks of World War II. At this time many organizations found it difficult to maintain operational efficiency and control. So, Companies appointed special staff (i. e. present day internal auditors) to review operations and report to them.

Internal audit activities are performed in diverse legal and cultural environments; within organizations that vary in purpose, size, complexity, and structure; and by persons within or outside the organization. While differences may affect the practice of internal auditing in each environment, compliance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing is essential if the responsibilities of internal auditors are to be met. Through an audit, an organization can identify a system’s ineffectiveness, take corrective action, and ultimately support continuous improvement. Unfortunately, a poorly deployed internal auditing system can lead to increased, non-value-added costs, many hours of wasted resources, and an eventual, inevitable QMS breakdown.
