The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including white lead (lead carbonate) and verdigris, a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa.

25|$|While {{the process}} has long been {{associated}} with French wine, the first recorded mention of adding sugar to must in French literature was the 1765 edition of L'Encyclopedie, which advocated the use of sugar for sweetening wine over the previously accepted practice of using <b>lead</b> <b>acetate.</b> In 1777, the French chemist Pierre Macquer discovered that the actual chemical benefit of adding sugar to must {{was an increase in}} alcohol to balance the high acidity of underripe grapes rather than any perceived increase in sweetness.

40|$|E. coli cells produce acetate as an {{extracellular}} coproduct {{of aerobic}} cultures. Acetate is undesirable because it retards growth and inhibits protein formation. Most process designs or genetic modifications to minimize acetate formation aim at balancing growth rate and oxygen consumption. In this research, three genetic approaches to reduce acetate formation were investigated: (1) direct {{reduction of the}} carbon flow to acetate (ackA-pta, poxB knock-out); (2) anticipation on the underlying metabolic and regulatory mechanisms that <b>lead</b> to <b>acetate</b> (constitutive ppc expression mutant); and (3) both (1) and (2). Initially, these mutants were compared to the wild-type E. coli via batch cultures under aerobic conditions. Subsequently, these mutants were further characterized using metabolic flux analysis on continuous cultures. It is concluded {{that a combination of}} directly reducing the carbon flow to acetate and anticipating on the underlying metabolic and regulatory mechanism that <b>lead</b> to <b>acetate,</b> is the most promising approach to overcome acetate formation and improve recombinant protein production.

2500|$|Resorcinol {{crystallizes}} from benzene as colorless needles {{that are}} readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon disulfide. It reduces Fehling's solution and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with <b>lead</b> <b>acetate</b> solution, {{as does the}} isomeric pyrocatechol. Iron(III) chloride colors its aqueous solution a dark-violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromoresorcin. These properties are what give it its use as a colouring agent for certain chromatography experiments. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150 to 160°C with concentrated barium hydroxide solution gives γ-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorlgnder); when fused with potassium hydroxide, resorcinol yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechol, and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, {{in the presence of}} dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, e.g., with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145°C it yields resacetophenone (HO)2C6H3~CO.CH3. With the anhydrides of dibasic acids, it yields fluoresceins. When heated with calcium chloride—ammonia to 200°C it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine. With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of lacmoid. [...] It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition of catalytic hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin 2•CH2. Reaction with chloral hydrate in the presence of potassium bisulfate yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid.

When aqueous solution of <b>lead</b> (II) <b>acetate</b> reduced with sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, alpha form of lead oxide nanoparticles, with spherical shape were achieved. Decreasing the ratio of sodium hydroxide to <b>lead</b> (II) <b>acetate</b> concentration at moderate temperatures resulted with a gradual change in crystal structure from quasi -spherical α-PbO nanoparticles and two dimensional nanoflakes of beta PbO with a thickness below 100 nm was synthesized for the first time.

40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} yielded two {{strains of}} Pseudomonas putida capable of growth with orcinol (3, 5 -dihydroxytoluene) {{as the sole}} source of carbon. Experiments with cell suspensions and cell extracts indicate that orcinol is metabolized by hydroxylation of the benzene ring followed successively by ring cleavage and hydrolyses to give 2 mol of acetate and 1 mol of pyruvate per mol of orcinol as shown: orcinol leads to 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene leads to 2, 4, 6 -trioxoheptanoate <b>leads</b> to <b>acetate</b> + acetylpyruvate <b>leads</b> to <b>acetate</b> + pyruvate. Evidence for this pathway is based on: (i) high respiratory activities of orcinol-grown cells towards 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene; (ii) transient accumulation of a quinone, probably 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, during grouth with orcinol; (iii) formation of pyruvate and acetate from orcinol, 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene, and acetylpyruvate catalyzed by extracts of orcinol, but not by succinate-grown cells; (iv) characterization of the product of oxidation of 3 -methylcatechol (an analogue of 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene) showing that oxygenative cleavage occurs between carbons bearing methyl and hydroxyl substituents; (v) transient appearance of a compound having spectral properties {{similar to those of}} acetylpyruvate during 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene oxidation by extracts of orcinol-grown cells. Orcinol hydroxylase exhibits catalytic activity when resorcinol or m-cresol is substituted for orcinol; hydroxyquinol and 3 -methylcatechol are substrates for the ring cleavage enzyme 2, 3, 5 -trihydroxytoluene- 1, 2 -oxygenase.
