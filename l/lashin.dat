5|$|Six Egyptian {{table tennis}} players, {{three men and}} three women, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, four for the singles and an additional two for the team events. The four singles competitors, Omar Assar, El-sayed <b>Lashin,</b> Nadeen El-Dawlatly, and Dina Meshref, all qualified based on their achievements at the 2011 All-Africa Games. At this tournament, Assar won the singles event, {{was part of the}} victorious Egyptian team, finished second in the doubles with Emad Moselhy, and placed third in the mixed doubles alongside Meshref. He also won silver in the singles and gold in the team event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he defeated Yaroslav Zhmudenko of Ukraine in the opening round, but lost to Greece's Panagiotis Gionis in round two. <b>Lashin</b> was the runner-up in the singles at the 2011 All-Africa Games, as well as the winner of the doubles (with Ahmed Saleh), a bronze medalist in the mixed doubles (alongside El-Dawlatly), {{and a member of the}} gold medal-earning Egyptian team. His list of international medals stretched back to the 1996 African Championships, where he won a gold medal in the team event, and he had previously appeared in the Olympic Games in 2000 and 2008. In London he defeated Pär Gerell of Sweden and Zoran Primorac of Croatia before losing to Japan's Jun Mizutani in the third round. For the team event, Assar and <b>Lashin</b> were joined by Saleh, a 2008 Olympic veteran whose victories went as far back at the doubles event at the 1996 Arab Championships, but they were eliminated in the opening round.|$|E
5|$|Shaimaa El-Gammal {{became the}} nation's first female {{to appear in}} her fourth Olympic games, while former Olympic medalists Tamer Bayoumi (taekwondo), Karam Gaber (Greco-Roman wrestling), and Hesham Mesbah (judo) {{returned}} to compete again. Middleweight boxer Mohamed Hikal and skeet shooter Mostafa Hamdy also made a fourth appearance at the Games, while Gaber, Mesbah, and six other athletes made their third Olympic appearance: discus thrower Omar Ahmed El Ghazaly, modern pentathlete Aya Medany, table tennis player El-sayed <b>Lashin,</b> Greco-Roman wrestlers Ashraf El-Gharably and Mohamed Abdelfatah, and judoka Islam El Shehaby. Skeet shooter Mona El-Hawary, aged 49, was the oldest athlete on the team, while sprint freestyle swimmer Farida Osman was the youngest at age 17. Bayoumi was selected as Egypt's flagbearer for the closing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|El-Dawlatly {{had been}} {{fourth in the}} singles at the 2011 All-Africa Games, as well as third in the doubles and mixed doubles (with Meshref and <b>Lashin</b> respectively), {{and was a member}} of the gold medal-winning Egyptian team. She had also earned gold in the team event and the doubles and silver in the singles at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London she was {{defeated}} in the opening round by Denmark's Mie Skov. Meshref had the same results as El-Dawlatly at the 2011 All-African Games, except for being fifth in the singles, and took gold in the singles, doubles, and team events at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London she defeated Offiong Edem of Nigeria and Yana Noskova of Russia before being overcome by Romania's Elizabeta Samara. For the team event, El-Dawlatly and Meshref were joined by Raghd Magdy, who had been third in the doubles and mixed doubles, as well as runner-up in the team competition, at the 2003 All-Africa Games. The Egyptian women were defeated by the Dutch in the first round.|$|E

50|$|The Arabic {{short story}} can be {{classified}} in three different periods. The first is “The Embryonic Stage,” (Arabic المرحلة الجنينيّة) dated {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to 1914; the works of writers of this stage such as Salim Al-Bustani, Labibah Hashim, Khalil Gibran, Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti and others were described as melancholic, and they had adapted Western short story techniques. The second stage, known as “The Trial Stage,” (Arabic المرحلة التجريبيّة)dated from 1914 to 1925, may be called the traditional stage, in which we find clear attempts for authentic voices. Writers of this new genre, such Muhammad Taymour, Tahir <b>Lashin</b> and others, felt it necessary of studying its techniques in Western literature and approach it in a more unconventional way. And finally, “The Formative Stage,” (Arabic المرحلة التشكيليّة) which extends from 1925 to the present, was opened by Mahmoud Taymour, where a new narrative style emerged emphasizing the development and psychological analysis of the characters in the stories with a more realistic approach.In the 1960s, the short story achieved a distinguished level of grounding in specific artistic characteristics, including an insistence on being short in length, encompassing a short time frame, having critical and deep details, written in prose language, having a minimal number of characters, and conveying an ambiguous ending which leaves the reader to his own imagination and interpretation.|$|E

30|$|For the mud density result {{shown in}} Fig.  9, both muds were built {{to achieve a}} density of 9.0 ppg before thermal aging test. More amount of barite was added to HWBM in {{comparison}} to BWBM to achieve equal density with BWBM due to the low density of the HLE. Appropriate mud density is important to assess its effects on filtrates loss, filter cake properties, and formation damage. It can also influence drilled cuttings removal and promote wellbore cleaning by providing enough overbalance to ensure sufficient drilling rate is provided (Fattah and <b>Lashin</b> 2016). This is because the generated volume of drilled cuttings relies on drilling rate. Pumping thick fluid at fixed intervals while sustaining sufficient viscosity would promote cuttings lifting out of the hole. After heating the mud samples at 150  °F for 16  h, {{the density of the}} mud systems decreased. BWBM showed about 3.3 % decreased, while HWBM showed 2.2 % decreased, which indicated decomposition of some of the additives of the mud systems. There is no appreciable variation of density after heating between the two mud samples.|$|E
40|$|Crown rot of {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea) {{caused by}} Aspergillus niger is prevalent in {{warm and dry}} climatic zones and its incidence ranges from 2 % to 14 % (Pande and Narayana Rao 2000). The pathogen attacks groundnut plants at all the growth stages and causes pre-emergence rotting in seeds, soft rot in emerging seedlings, and crown rot in mature plants. Thus, management ofcrown rot by fungicides is difficult and expensive. Biological control of plant diseases is cost effective and environmentally safe compared to fungicides. Also, the biocontrol agent once established persists in the soil for longer periods and offers disease protection even in the consecutive crop seasons (Mew and Rosales 1986). Trichoderma spp are antagonistic {{to a wide range}} of phytopathogenic fungi and are able to control economically important diseases in several crop plants (Papavizas 1985). Trichoderma harzianum and Bacillus subtilis AF 1 were tested to control the incidence ofcrown rot in groundnut and varying levels of disease control were obtained with these biocontrol agents (<b>Lashin</b> et al. 1989, Podile 2000). Bacillus subtilis AF 1 induced production of lipoxygenase and altered the phytoalexin metabolism in groundnut seedlings (Podile 2000).

30|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{currently}} not {{represented in the}} national energy mix of Oman and only plays a very minor role in the Arabian Peninsula in general. In the whole region {{a large percentage of}} the energy consumption is used for cooling. In Oman 50 % of the residential power supply is only used for residential cooling (Sweetnam et al. 2014) in Saudi Arabia even 80 % and the average for the whole Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consisting of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, is 40 – 50 % (<b>Lashin</b> et al. 2015). The electricity demand will rise in the GCC by 7 – 8 % per year on average; in the smallest and fastest-growing economies, demand will grow even faster (GCC 2010). The electricity sector in Oman is primarily based on natural gas (97.5 %) and diesel (2.5 %, Authority for Electricity Regulation, Oman). The same applies to the other GCC countries, which all fall in the top 25 countries of carbon dioxide emissions per capita (Reiche 2010). Geothermal energy could significantly contribute to a greener energy mix, especially in countries in possession of high‐temperature and intermediate temperature hydrothermal systems, like Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. The usage of thermally driven cooling could significantly help to lower the energy demand in this sector. Thermally driven cooling requires temperatures of 70 – 100  °C. The energy for sustainable cooling supply can be developed from solar and geothermal sources. Solar heat supply is fluctuating, whereas geothermal heat can provide base load heat supply. The results of this study show that the target temperatures can be reached in around 2000  m depth. Fault structures which exist in the contact zone between the Tertiary sedimentary sequence and the Semail Ophiolite, correlated with hot springs, constitute a potential setting for drilling.|$|E
40|$|Small wind {{turbines}} of 1 – 3, 5 – 10, and 15 – 20 kW rated powers {{are used to}} find out suitable and efficient turbines for power generation in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the effect of hub height on energy output and the plant capacity factor is investigated to recommend an optimal hub height {{to be used in}} the present case. To achieve the set objectives, hourly mean wind speed data measured at 20, 30, and 40 m and wind direction at 30 and 40 m during 13 September 2005 to 9 May 2010 have been utilized. The annual mean wind speed values were 5. 73, 5. 34, and 4. 75 m/s at 40, 30, and 20 m with north-north west (NNW) prevailing wind direction. An increase of about 20. 7 % was estimated in wind speed measured at 40 m compared to that at 20 m. Wind turbines Fortis Passat— 1. 4 kW, Fortis Montana— 5. 8 kW, Fortis Alize— 10 kW, and CF 20 — 20 kW with annual energy and plant capacity factor of 7. 015 MW h and 57. 2 %, 25. 955 MW h and 51. 08 %, 42. 603 MW h and 48. 63 %, and 54. 674 MW h and 31. 21 % were the most efficient turbines for the chosen location, respectively. Highest percentage increase in annual energy yield was obtained for a mere change of 5 m from 15 to 20 m in hub height in the present case study. The next best annual energy yield was obtained while increasing hub height from 20 to 30 m.
