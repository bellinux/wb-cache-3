I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope {{you will not be}} there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1885 Acton {{asserted}} that: [...] "We {{must never}} judge {{the quality of}} a teaching by the quality of the Teacher, or allow the spots to shut out the sun. It would be unjust, and it would deprive us of nearly all that is great and good in this world. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you of Macaulay. He remains to me one of the greatest of all writers and masters, although I think him utterly base, contemptible and odious for certain reasons which you know." [...] In 1888 he wrote that Macaulay [...] "had done more than any writer in the literature of the world for the propagation of the Liberal faith, and he was not only the greatest, but the most representative, Englishman then [...] living".|$|E
2500|$|... – When asked a {{question}} about the coup at a press conference, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Bernard Kouchner replied, [...] "You know how attached we are to Mauritania's stability. It is too soon to describe the situation. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you nevertheless of France's attachment to preserving the rule of law in all circumstances and its hostility to the seizure of power by force." [...] A statement in French from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier in the day also said, [...] "We are in contact with our embassy in Nouakchott and monitoring the situation with the greatest attention in conjunction with all our partners. Steps are being taken locally {{to ensure the safety of}} French nationals. The safety recommendations will be distributed according to the changing situation." [...] France subsequently suspended its development assistance. On August 28, seeking Abdallahi's release and restoration to power, it announced that it was prepared to apply sanctions against individual junta leaders.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{had begun}} to write the little {{that remains to be}} told, when it struck me that I might, unintentionally, be exercising an unfair {{influence}} on your opinion. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> only <b>remind</b> you that I believe absolutely in the supernatural revelation which I have endeavored to describe.

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he said, {{with a kind}} of sad good-humor, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is {{unreasonable}} of me to expect that a young woman like you should share any opinion with an old lawyer like <b>me.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> only <b>remind</b> you that our conversation must remain strictly confidential for the present; and then let us change the subject.

6000|$|... "O! that God," [...] says Carey in his Journal in Hindostan, [...] "would {{make the}} Gospel {{successful}} among them! That would undoubtedly make them honest men, and I fear nothing else ever will." [...] Now {{this is a}} fact,--spite of infidels and psilosophizing Christians, a fact. A perfect explanation of it would require and would show the psychology of faith,--the difference between the whole soul's modifying an action, and an action enforced by modifications of the soul amid prudential motives or favouring impulses. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> here <b>remind</b> myself of the absolute necessity of having my whole faculties awake and imaginative, in order to illustrate this and similar truths;--otherwise my writings will be no other than pages of algebra.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Mackellar," [...] says he, [...] "I {{take this}} near on an unfriendliness. I cannot have you go: {{this is to}} make a {{stranger}} of the prodigal son; and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you where--in his own father's house!

60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first briefly <b>remind</b> you, as {{the truth}} upon which my whole {{explanation}} of this text is built, {{that man is}} not meant either for solitude or independence. He is meant to live WITH his fellow-men, to live BY them, and to live FOR them. He is healthy and godly, only when he knows all men for his brothers; and himself, {{in some way or}} other, as the servant of all, and bound in ties of love and duty to every one around him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I returned, [...] "I fear, mostly, I think, {{to frighten}} any one. I'm not {{particularly}} brave. I haven't, at all events, {{in spite of}} my certitude, interrogated Mrs. Server, and I give you my word of honour that I've not had any denial from her to prop up my doubt. It still stands on its own feet, and it was its own battle that, when I came here at your summons, it was prepared to fight. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> accordingly <b>remind</b> you," [...] I pursued, [...] "in connection with that, of the one sense in which you were, as you a moment ago said, talked over by me. I persuaded you apparently that Long's metamorphosis was not the work of Lady John. I persuaded you of nothing else." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{factors are}} common to all by-elections, under all Governments; but never, I venture to say, has it been more {{important}} to an Opposition to gain by-electoral successes than during the present Parliament. It is their only possible line of activity. In the House of Commons they scarcely show their noses. In divisions they are absent; in debate--well, I do not think we need say much about that; {{and it is only}} by a combination of by-electoral incidents properly advertised by the Party Press on the one hand, and the House of Lords' manipulation upon the other, that the Conservative Party are able to keep their heads above water. And when I speak of the importance to the Opposition of by-elections, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>remind</b> you that never before have by-electoral victories been so important, not only to a great Party, but to a great trade.|$|R

As for me, I have not the time, had I the will, to engage you further. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you that I would be gone." ...|$|E

"Ask {{them into}} the drawing-room when they call, my dear; or, better still, dont pay them, {{so that they will}} have no need to write a receipt. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you that ink shews as much on white {{hearthstone}} as it can possibly do on marble. Yet extensive disfigurements of steps from the visits of tax collectors are not common." ...|$|E

Business is business; and your business, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>remind</b> you, is too muddy for such airs. Trust me, or leave me alone and find someone else; but let us have an end, for God's sake, of your jeremiads." ...|$|E

We {{know a great deal}} more tonightthan we did then about the state of that agenda. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> aboveall <b>remind</b> you that whatever that state may be is for the time beingonly. John Marshall, as I then said, died a disappointed man, surroundedby omens of the impending wreckage of his dreams, andtwenty-five years after his death the country seemed, in the most decidedmanner, to have rejected his vision of a single sovereign nation.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} lecture is {{to clarify}} the concept of {{derivatives}} on quantum spaces [2]. These derivatives are an essential input {{for the construction of}} deformed field equations such as the deformed Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations [3]. These deformed field equations are in turn the starting point for field theories on quantum spaces. For a given coordinate space there are in general many ways to define derivatives [4]. We shall try to develop a general concept of such derivatives into which all the different sets of derivatives fit and that allows us by adding additional requirements-usually based on symmetries- {{to reduce the number of}} possible derivatives. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>remind</b> you of the concept of deformed coordinate spaces (DCS) which we will use as quantum spaces. DCS are defined in terms of coordinates ˆx µ,µ = 1 [...] . n and relations. Examples of such relations are 1. Canonical relations [5] [ˆx µ, ˆx ν] = iθ µν, (1) for constant θ it leads to the socalled θ-deformed coordinate space (θ-DCS). 2. Lie-type relations [6] where the coordinates form a Lie algebr...|$|R

[...] "I remember it very well. You told me then that I REMINDED YOU OF YOUR MOTHER. Well, I am not old enough to be your mother, Mr. Brant, but I am old enough to have been, and might have been, the mother of your wife. That was what you meant then; that is what you mean now. I was wrong to accuse you of trying to make me ridiculous. I ask your pardon. Let us leave it as it was that day in the boudoir, as it is NOW. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> still <b>remind</b> you of your mother,--I know she must have been a good woman to have had so good a son,--and when you have found some sweet young girl to make you happy, come to me for a mother's blessing, and we will laugh at the recollection and misunderstanding of this evening." ...|$|R
