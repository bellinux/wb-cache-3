40|$|During {{the last}} three years the National Poisons Control Centre (NVIC) of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) found an {{increasing}} number of poisonings of children by <b>lamp</b> <b>oil.</b> In order to establish the circumstances of exposure, the frequency and severity of clinical effects and the treatment received, a prospective study was carried out in 1996. In close co-operation with the General Inspectorate for Health Protection (IGB) more specific information on the circumstances of exposure and the products involved was collected during the second half year of the study. <b>Lamp</b> <b>oil</b> ingestions involve a considerable risk of aspiration and chemical pneumonitis. In this study ingestion of <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in clinical effects in the majority of the cases. Effects most frequently seen were coughing, vomiting and dizziness. Chemical pneumonitis was reported in several cases. Physicians need to be notified that not all performed therapies were according to the NVIC guidelines and that these therapies possess risks for serious and unwanted clinical effects. Most of the children drank the <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> directly from the lamp. Drinking from the lamp clearly needs more attention so people may be notified by warnings on the packages.

Due to overfishing, whale oil became rare and expensive. By this time, petroleum oil had already begun to supplant fish, whale, and vegetable oils for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, and transatlantic export had already begun.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} fuel used with juggling fire torches in the US is white gas, or Coleman fuel.

40|$|Poisoningsfrom <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> {{ingestion}} {{continue to}} occur worldwide among the pediatric population despite preventive {{measures such as}} restricted sale of colored and scented <b>lamp</b> <b>oils.</b> This suggests that optimal prevention practices for unintentional pediatric exposures to <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> {{have yet to be}} identified and/or properly implemented. ObjectiveTo characterize demographic, health data, and potential risk factors associated with reported exposures to <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> by callers to poison centers (PCs) in the US and discuss their public health implications. Study design. This was a two part study in which the first part included characterizing all exposures to a <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> product reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) with regard to demographics, exposure, health, and outcome data from 1 / 1 / 2000 to 12 / 31 / 2010. Regional penetrance was calculated using NPDS data by grouping states into four regions and dividing the number of exposure calls by pediatric population per region (from the 2000 US census). Temporal analyses were performed on NPDS data by comparing number of exposures by season and around the July 4 th holiday. Poisson regression was used to model the count of exposures for these analyses. In the second part of this project, in order to identify risk factors we conducted a telephone-based survey to the parents of children from five PCs in five different states. The 10 most recent <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> product exposure calls for each poison center were systematically selected for inclusion. Calls in which a parent or guardian witnessed a pediatric <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> product ingestion were eligible for inclusion. Data on demographics, exposure information, behavioral traits, and health were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and Fisher 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exact test was used to evaluate associations between variables. All analyses were conducted using SAS v 9. 3. ResultsAmong NPDS data, 2 years was the most common patient age reported and states in the Midwestern region had the highest numbers of exposure calls compared to other regions. Exposure calls differed by season (p< 0. 0001) and were higher around the July 4 th holiday compared {{to the rest of the}} days in July (2. 09 vs. 1. 89 calls/day, p< 0. 002).

50|$|The first tractor {{models of}} 1947 were built for petrol fuel. In 1949 {{versions}} of the engine using TVO, and in 1950 <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> were introduced. TVO has a low octane rating of around 60 and so the engine had the usual changes to compression ratio and ignition timing. A heat shield around the manifolds increased the inlet temperature, encouraging vapourisation of the fuel. To avoid problems with fuel condensation in the inlet ports, diameter of the valves (in some engine versions) was also reduced, thus increasing flow velocity. The <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> engine used a zero octane paraffin (kerosene) fuel, but was only suitable for use in warm climates, or else the fuel did not vapourise adequately.|$|R
50|$|Whale oil {{was needed}} as <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> for illumination. It burned with a bright, {{smokeless}} flame that nothing else {{was known to}} match. Chemists had known how to make oil from coal (coal oil) or turpentine (camphene) for many years, but they burned with sooty flames, making them unsuitable for indoor illumination. The only viable competitor to whale oil was “burning oil,” a mixture of camphene and alcohol, which burned bright and smokeless, but which was volatile and prone to explode. Fire insurance policies charged higher premiums for buildings in which camphene-based <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> was used. The city of Lowell, Massachusetts banned the storage of products containing camphene within 200 yards of any building in the city.|$|R
