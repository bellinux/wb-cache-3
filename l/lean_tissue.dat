A forelegs weighing system to estimate the daily individual body weight (BW) of group-housed pigs was developed and validated. In two experiments, BW dependent feeding strategies in the finishing period were examined in relation to performance and carcass traits. In Exp. 1, the daily energy allowance of barrows was restricted to 18 MJ ME per day above maintenance. In Exp. 2, barrows were restricted to a feeding level at which their growth was similar to the mean growth of a group of ad libitum fed gilts. In Exp. 1, feed restriction improved <b>lean</b> meat <b>tissue</b> percentage with 2. 6 units. In Exp. 2, feed restriction resulted in a similar growth as the ad libitum fed gilts, but gave no improvement of the <b>lean</b> meat <b>tissue</b> percentage. In both experiments, feed restriction decreased the between animal variance in energy intake, but not in energy conversion ratio, growth or <b>lean</b> meat <b>tissue</b> percentage.

As beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BB) are often prescribed for obese patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease, this study compares the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers in obese and control subjects. METHODS: Nine obese (157 +/- 24 % of ideal body weight (IBW) mean +/- s. d.) and nine non-obese healthy volunteers (98 +/- 10 % IBW), aged 32 +/- 9 years, {{were included in}} the study. Subjects were randomly given a single i. v. infusion of one of the following racemic beta-adrenoceptor blockers, whose doses (expressed as base per kg of IBW) were: propranolol (0. 108 mg), labetalol (0. 99 mg) and nebivolol (0. 073 mg). The plasma concentrations of unchanged drugs were measured by h. p. l. c. The ionisation constants and lipophilicity parameters of beta-adrenoceptor blockers were assessed. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic data for the three drugs were qualitatively similar. There was a trend towards a greater total distribution volume (Vss) in obese patients than in controls. However, Vss expressed per kg body weight was slightly smaller in obese patients. The relationship between Vss and lipophilicity of five beta-adrenoceptor was studied by combining the current results with those previously obtained with a moderately lipophilic drug (bisoprolol) and a hydrophilic one (sotalol). The Vss of the five drugs was positively and well-correlated (r 2 = 0. 90; P < 0. 01) with their distribution coefficient at pH 7. 4 (log D 7. 4), but not with their partition coefficients. The linear regression coefficients for lean and obese subjects were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers seem to diffuse less into adipose than into <b>lean</b> <b>tissues.</b> All electrical forms of the drugs (i. e. cations, neutral forms, or zwitterions) present at physiological pH contribute to their tissue distribution, in both obese and <b>lean</b> subjects. Their <b>tissue</b> distribution in obese patients could be restricted by the sum of hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds they elicit with macromolecules in <b>lean</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

However, the news is not entirely good since knee extensor and knee flexor strength losses in long-duration crewmembers after flights aboard Mir and ISS were ~23% and ~25%, respectively (Figure 6-12), indicating that strength losses in the quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups were significant and similar for NASA-Mir and early ISS missions, despite apparent slightly increased preservation of muscle mass (<b>lean</b> <b>tissue)</b> in the legs of ISS crewmembers compared to crewmembers on NASA-Mir missions (also Figure 6-11).

Adult captive Knot increased significantly in BM during spring, primarily due to fat deposition. Most juvenile Knot did not display fat deposition in their first spring in captivity. A seasonal peak in BMR, often double the seasonal minimum, occurred during spring but typically took place, on average, 5, 11 and 4 days (respectively) after the seasonal peaks in BM, lean mass and fat mass. Little {{of the variation in}} BMR seen within or amongst captive Knot, irrespective of physiological state, was explained by variation in a single parameter (BM, lean mass or fat mass). As variation in BMR was not simply a consequence of variation in total lean mass, the average metabolic output per gram of the <b>lean</b> <b>tissues</b> must also have altered seasonally. During fat deposition in spring, Knot exhibited a significant increase in liver mass and a significant elevation (approximately 50 % higher) in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, an indicator of metabolic activity) in the small intestine. Such adaptations may have assisted an increase in fat deposition rate. SDH activity decreased by approximately 60 % in the pectoral muscle of Knot during this period. Such a reduction in SDH may also aid fat deposition as it lowered an individual’s overall BMR. As Knot BM decreased after the spring peak, then BMR decreased in parallel with a decrease in SDH activity in their pectoral muscles. The spring peak in overall BMR may indicate an increase in the maximal sustainable {{metabolic rate}} (MMR) of an individual during migratory flight.

The body water constitutes as much as 73% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight.

In the past years, the sorptive capacities of major biological phases—storage lipid, membrane phospholipids, and proteins—for neutral organic chemicals have been systematically investigated, (e.g., [23]). Chemicals considered include a range of nonpolar and polar chemicals covering a large structural diversity. The polyparameter linear free energy relationship (PP-LFER) models were used to evaluate and predict respective lipid–water and protein–water partitioning coefficients. As summarised in the presentation of Satoshi Endo, UFZ, Leipzig, significant differences in accumulation properties between membrane and storage lipids [24, 25] exist.

Branched-chain amino acids are important since they are most responsible for the synthesis of protein. According to Lemon et al.

Endurance athletes in general need more protein in their diet than the sedentary person.Research has shown that endurance athletes are recommended to have 1.2 to 1.4 g of protein per kg of body weight in order to repair damaged tissue. If the athlete consumes too few calories for the body's needs, <b>lean</b> <b>tissue</b> will be broken down for energy and repair. Protein deficiency can cause many problems such as early and extreme fatigue, particularly long recovery, and poor wound healing. Complete proteins such as meat, eggs, and soy provide the athlete with all essential amino acids for synthesizing new tissues.

5000|$|Until December 2014 {{the cause}} for the {{abnormal}} behavior was unclear, as no physiological data linking altered behavior to hypothesized increased energy demands existed. [...] The Fish and Wildlife Service published a case control study in December 2014: Of 60 little brown bats, 39 bats {{were randomly assigned to}} infection by applying conidia to skin of the dorsal surface of both wings and 21 bats remained controls. All were observed for 95 days and euthanized. 32 bats developed WNS (30 mild to moderate and 2 moderate to severe). Interestingly, the remaining 7 infected bats were PCR-positive with normal wing histology.Infected bats with WNS had higher proportions of <b>lean</b> <b>tissue</b> mass to fat tissue mass than uninfected bats in measuring an increase in total body water volume as a percent of body mass. Infected bats used twice as much energy as healthy bats, and starved to death. Direct calculations of energy expenditure failed for most bats, because isotope concentrations were indistinguishable from background. There was also no difference in torpor durations in this experiment; the average torpor duration for infected bats was 9.1 days with an average arousal of 54 min. Average torpor duration for control bats was 8.5 days with an average arousal duration of 55 min. Infected bats suffered respiratory acidosis with an almost 40% higher mean pCO₂ than healthy bats, and potassium concentration was significantly higher.Hence the following model of infection exists:Pseudogymnoascus destructans colonizes and eventually invades the wing epidermis. This causes increased energy expenditure, and an elevated blood pCO₂ and bicarbonate called chronic respiratory acidosis, possibly due to diffusion problems. Hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium) ensues because of an acidosis-induced extracellular shift of potassium. Dying, infected cells could also leak their (intracellular) potassium into the blood. The damaged wing epidermis might stimulate increased frequencies of arousal from torpor, which removes excess CO₂ and normalizes blood pH, at the expense of hydration and fat reserves. With worsening wing damage, the effects are exacerbated by water and electrolyte loss across the wound (hypotonic dehydration), which stimulates more frequent arousals in a positive feedback loop that ultimately leads to death.|$|E
