5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a grand jury in New York. After Spivey's grand jury appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his grand jury testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the grand jury indicted him on charges of perjury for <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious <b>lying</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|E

McCloskey was later accused of suggesting that other officers <b>lie</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> about his presence at the crime scene, and the Saint John Police Force is currently under investigation by the New Brunswick Police Commission for corruption and a potential cover-up.|$|R
