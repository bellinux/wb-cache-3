5|$|Hostilities {{between the}} English and Dutch in 1664 {{led to a}} change in {{government}} policy: colonial governors were now authorised to issue <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> against the Dutch. Many of the privateers, including Morgan, did not take up the letters, although an expedition to conquer the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius led to the death of Morgan's father-in-law, who was leading a 600-man force.|$|E

Lloyd's of London estimated that Yankee privateers captured 2,208 British ships, amounting to almost $66million, a significant sum at the time.|$|E

Although <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marques</b> were similar to privateers, their primary function was trade so they carried smaller crews. During its career as a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> the Friendship carried thirty men and fourteen guns to fend off French privateers.|$|R
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. The pact aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> and similar commissions. The historian Violet Barbour considers it probable {{that one of the}} Spanish conditions was the removal of Modyford from the Governorship. Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{took two}} French sloops in July 1809. Deux Freres, en route for Guadeloupe from Rochelle when {{captured}}, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July. A week later, Emerald captured the French schooner Balance, {{which had been}} sailing to France from Guadeloupe. Both captures carried <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce.|$|E
5|$|Some of Van Rensselaer's {{success as}} a jewel {{merchant}} came about due to trade {{made possible by the}} Dutch East India Company. The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could not fail to recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa.

5|$|Although Scottish seamen {{received}} {{protection against}} arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.|$|E

5|$|The Battles of Lexington and Concord {{initiated}} the American Revolutionary War and were {{fought in the}} eponymous Massachusetts towns. Future President George Washington took over {{what would become the}} Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775–76, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city. The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day. On the coast, Salem became a center for privateering. Although the documentation is incomplete, about 1700 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers and are credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|Exquemelin {{wrote that}} Morgan's men {{undertook}} widespread torture {{in several of}} the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan's raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque,</b> they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.|$|E
5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they ventured out throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that {{followed}} them, British {{dominance in the}} Indian Ocean was repeatedly challenged by the depredations of French vessels sailing from the isolated and well protected French colonies of Réunion (later Île Bonaparte) and Île de France. Although French Navy cruisers were periodically stationed on the islands, the majority of ships that preyed on British commerce from the islands were privateers, independently funded armed ships issued with <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> giving them permission to attack military and civilian ships belonging to the enemies of France. French naval strategy in the Indian Ocean was so reliant on privateers that entire squadrons developed, including a powerful force under the wealthy privateer captain Robert Surcouf. Although most privateers were small, carrying only a few cannon, some could be very large, rivalling professional warships in size. One such ship was the Bellone, which carried 34 guns, a crew of nearly 200 men and was commanded by Captain Jacques François Perroud, a notorious privateer who had caused significant damage to British trade in the Indian Ocean. In 1803, Perroud had gained significant notoriety with the capture of the valuable East Indiaman Lord Nelson on 14 August 1803.|$|E
5|$|At the Restoration the Privy Council {{established}} {{a force of}} several infantry regiments and a few troops of horse and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after {{the introduction of the}} socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97). Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment by English men of war, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second half of}} the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime. In the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) between 80 and 120 captains, took Scottish <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>marque</b> and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict. In the 1690s a small fleet of five ships was established by merchants for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy was established for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years War, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. By the time of the Act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a standing army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed.|$|E
