Flight parameters (e. g. speed and <b>line</b> <b>spacing)</b> directly affect the rate of area coverage, cost, and data quality of any survey. The influences of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> have been investigated for data from inter‐tidal, coastal and upland environments {{with a range of}} 137 Cs activity concentrations and depositional histories. Estimates of the integrated 137 Cs activity (‘inventory’) within specified areas and the shapes of depositional features were calculated for subsets of the data at different line spacings. Features with dimensions greater than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show variations in inventory and area of less than 3 %, and features with dimensions less than the <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> show larger variations and a decreased probability of detection. The choice of <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> for a task is dependent on the dimensions of the features of interest and required edge definition.

40|$|The {{principal}} question {{discussed in}} this dissertation {{is the problem of}} characterizing the linear and convex functions on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> A linear function is shown to be a convex function. The linear and convex functions are characterized, that is, a function f:[right arrow] X? is linear [convex] if and only if f[subscript l] is linear [convex] in the usual sense on each line of a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space</b> X. We prove that if a function has at least one support at each point on its graph, then it is a convex function. In the first chapter the basic concepts of abstract convexity spaces are introduced. The next chapter is concerned with join systems which are shown to be examples of abstract convexity spaces. On the other hand, a domain-finite, join-hull commutative abstract convexity space with regular straight segments satisfies the axioms of a join system. Consequently, such abstract convexity spaces satisfy the separation property. In Chapter III, the linearization of abstract spaces is done using a linearization family. The following chapter is on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> and graphically it is shown that Pasch?s and Peano's axioms do not hold in a certain generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> It is also proved that the separation property may not hold, in general, in a generalized <b>line</b> <b>space.</b> Finally, the convex and linear functions are studied on generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces.</b> The linearization of generalized <b>line</b> <b>spaces</b> is done by means of the properties of a linearization family...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{meet the}} {{performance}} {{test for the}} confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) accurately in some specific application occasions, the spatial resolution imaging principle of confocal laser scanning microscope was analyzed theoretically. And the micron <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> as the measurement standard has tried to investigate the lateral resolution of CLSM in experiment. The value range of the lateral resolution was calculated by the fluctuation state of the output light intensity signal when there is the lateral movement between the objective with sample. At the same time, some reasons for spatial resolution are also been evaluated in theory. Experiments demonstrate that if {{the value of the}} <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard is closer to the spatial resolution of CLSM, the standard can be utilized to test the spatial resolution. So we can use a a series of <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> standards with different <b>lines</b> <b>spacing</b> values to test the serial effective resolution. And in our experiment, we only measured <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> standard with 8 µm line width and 100 µm line pitch with many times by CLSM, and the spatial resolution of the CLSM is obtained about more minimal than 0. 3 µm by the scanning curves...|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{scalability}} of the random keys schemes, two random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes [5, 7] {{have been proposed}} independently at ACM CCS 2003. These two works are similar in nature, except that they apply different <b>key</b> <b>space</b> models, which will be summarized in Subsection 3.1. Each sensor preloads several keying shares, with each belonging to one <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> Two sensors can establish a shared key if they have keying information from the same <b>key</b> <b>space.</b> References [7] also proposes to assign one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> to each row or each column of a virtual grid. A sensor residing at a grid point receives keying information from exactly two <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> This realization involves more number of <b>key</b> <b>spaces.</b> Note that these random <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> schemes also improve resilience and key-sharing probability because more <b>key</b> <b>spaces</b> are available, and because two sensors compute a unique key within one <b>key</b> <b>space</b> for their shared links.|$|R

We demonstrate that VelociTap has a significantly lower error rate than Google's keyboard while retaining the same entry rate.

We also demonstrate that enabling flexible word-delimiter options does not incur an error rate penalty. Finally, we investigate how small {{we can make the}} keyboard when using VelociTap.
