50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> if the <b>lay</b> direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same <b>lay</b> direction, the <b>rope</b> is called a <b>lang</b> <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> (formerly Albert’s <b>lay</b> or <b>Lang’s</b> <b>lay).</b> Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|Various {{techniques}} {{are used for}} constructing the rope. Dozens of wires are wound into a strand. Several strands are wound around a textile core, their twist is oriented in the same or opposite direction as the individual wires; this {{is referred to as}} <b>Lang</b> <b>lay</b> and regular lay respectively.|$|R

30|$|With the {{increase}} of demand in predicting the behavior of ropes, many advanced digital techniques {{had been used in}} the strand and rope analysis. Computer-aided design and the finite element method created powerful sophisticated tools for the modeling and analysis of ropes. Judge et al. (2012) developed full 3 D elastic–plastic finite element models of the multi-layer spiral strand cables subjected to quasi-static axial loading using LS-DYNA. Nawrocki and Labrosse (2000) presented a finite element model of a simple straight wire rope strand and studied all the possible inter-wire motions. The role of contact conditions in pure axial loading and axial loading combined with bending were investigated. Stanova et al. (2011 b) established a geometric model of a multi-layered strand by CATIA V 5 and analyzed force-strain relationship of the strand by ABAQUS/Explicit. Jiang et al. (2000, 2008), Jiang (2012) performed concise finite element models for 1  ×  7 wire strand under axial extension and pure bending load, and studied the contact stress among wires, wire radial displacement, global response of the strand and predicted the detailed progressive nonlinear plastic behaviors of the strand wires. Ma et al. (2008, 2009) reported the 6  ×  19 IWS right <b>lang</b> <b>lay</b> and right ordinary <b>lay</b> <b>rope</b> models with ANSYS software. Wang et al. (2012, 2013) proposed finite element models for 6  ×  19 wire rope from the viewpoint of determination of fretting parameters. Many scholars (Bradon et al. 2007; Ghoreishi et al. 2007 a, b; Usabiaga and Pagalday 2008; Argatov 2011; Beltrán and Williamson 2011; Paczelt and Belezna 2011; Beltra’n and Vargas 2012; Prawoto and Mazlan 2012) dealt with theoretical models, fiber ropes and broken ropes using 3 D finite element analyses.|$|R

5000|$|Indian mountaineer Malli Mastan Babu {{also had}} the {{eminence}} of setting a Guinness world record by surmounting the Seven Summits in 172 days in 2006. The world record for completion of the Messner and Bass list was 136 days, by Danish climber Henrik Kristiansen in 2008. Kristiansen completed the summits in the following order: Vinson on Jan 21, Aconcagua on Feb 6, Kosciuszko on Feb 13, Kilimanjaro on Mar 1, Carstensz Pyramid on Mar 14, Elbrus on May 8, Everest on May 25, spending just 22 days on the mountain (normally, expeditions take up to two months acclimatizing, <b>laying</b> <b>ropes,</b> etc.) and finally Denali on June 5, beating Ian McKeever's previous record by 20 days. Vern Tejas set the new record for the same, in 134 days. Tejas began with summiting Vinson on 18 January 2010 and ended with summiting Denali on May 31. This was Tejas' ninth time to complete the Bass Seven Summits.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from the craft of rope-making for sailing ships that {{dominated}} the area until the 19th century.

50|$|Twisted ropes {{are built}} up in three steps. First, fibres are {{gathered}} and spun into yarns. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to <b>lay</b> the <b>rope.</b> The twist of the yarn is opposite {{to that of the}} strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope. It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} plan {{had been for}} one team to <b>lay</b> fixed <b>rope</b> above Camp 6 {{at the top of}} the Rock Band and for a second team to go for the summit. Bonington now decided it would be unreasonable to expect the first team to turn back so near the summit and so one team would do all the work even though this meant a very long summit climb after a heavy day <b>laying</b> <b>ropes</b> and a second night at Camp 6. However, progress had been so good that two further summit teams might be possible and, with careful planning, these might comprise four climbers each rather than two. Bonington had promised a place for a Sherpa in any subsequent attempt. He selected (1) Haston and Scott, (2) Boardman, Boysen, Burke and Pertemba (who, to Bonington's satisfaction, nominated himself) and (3) Ang Phurba, Bonington, Braithwaite and Estcourt. Estcourt and Braithwaite were to return temporarily to ABC, losing their second place in the [...] "queue" [...] for the summit, and contrary to what they had been promised earlier. Burke had been climbing slowly but Bonington considered that this could have been due to the weight of camera equipment and he realised the value of having filming high up on the mountain. Regarding his own place, Bonington himself had been at 25500 ft and above for nearly a fortnight so as team doctor Clarke privately advised him not to continue higher. Bonington accepted this opinion and gave his place to Richards though he still cherished the hope he himself might be in a fourth summit bid. MacInnes had moved to Camp 1 because of reports that the platform of ice it was on was starting to slip down the Icefall. When he heard he was to be left out of the summit parties he left the expedition because there was nothing further for him to do but he assured Bonington he would tell the press he was leaving because of his injured lungs.|$|R
