Virgin olive oil is characterized by acidity between 0.8% and 2%, while <b>lampante</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (a low quality oil that is not edible) features a free acidity higher than 2%.

In some oils, the epoxy and dihydroxy derivatives of β-sitosterol were also found at very low levels. The highest total concentrations of phytosterol oxides, ranging from 4. 5 to 67. 5 and from 4. 1 to 60. 1 ppm, were found in sunflower and maize oils, respectively.

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an olive oil. According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an olive oil can be classified as extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), virgin olive oil or <b>lampante</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6]. On the contrary, lampante olive oils have a distinctly unpleasant smell, are not edible and are used for the production of refined olive oils. It is well known that selling virgin olive oils or lampante olive oils as EVOOs is a fraud. However, another important aspect to consider is that the downgrading of an EVOO to a lower category implies a big economic loss for the producers. So, it is fundamental that both the chemical analyses and the organoleptic evaluations used to define quality grade are “sufficiently” objective and reproducible.|$|E
40|$|Virgin {{olive oil}} is the juice from the olive drupe, a produce that usually {{features}} high quality. However, {{virgin olive oils}} produced in {{different regions of the}} world suffer from defects, most of them of sensory nature. The largest amount of olive oil in which some organoleptic defect is present matches to the Virgin Olive Oil (VOO) class. The causes leading to sensory defects in virgin olive oil, on the different steps of the elaboration, are not well-known sometimes. Important is to note that current legislation allow the classification with sensory defects as VOO and <b>Lampante</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>Oil</b> (LOO). Volatile compounds are important in the sensory perception of the olive oils, for both the positive attributes and the defects. Knowledge on the biogenesis of the volatile compounds involved in the virgin olive oil defects and in its sensory characterisation is still scarce. There are different causes of defects, depending on the physical, chemical or microbial degradation affecting the product. These join to the positive attributes, leading to an infinite diversity of sensory `fingerprints¿. The microbes cause the most of the defects sensory analysed in olive oils. Despite some interesting studies reported on the biogenesis of the compounds responsible of such defects, microbiological research within the olive oil production, includingpost-harvest life of olives, is scarce. We should highlight there is a long way to avoid the generation of sensory defects in olive oils within the production process itself and storage. This paper tries to identify significant shortfalls on the knowledge of the causes and circumstances for inducting sensory defects in olive oils, and defining the major aspects which are sufficiently known.

The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study was to extract olive oil from the fruit of Olea europaea by means of supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-C 02) as an alternative to traditional methods. Extractions were performed on a laboratory scale supercritical fluid extractor of the latest design, featuring three mutually independent flow systems and extremely high flow rates. A number of extraction runs based on a statistical design was performed to establish the conditions (time, pressure, temperature) for a maximum yield of extracted olive oil. These conditions turned out to be 50 OC and 460 atm (corresponding density of 0. 953 g/mL) for a 60 minute extraction run. The influence of different variables on the yield of extracted oil was investigated by means of computer-assisted surface response analysis. Additional extraction runs were performed at selected conditions to make reliable conclusions regarding the temperature, pressure and density dependencies of the extraction process and the nature of the mechanism of extraction. The density of the extracting fluid was found to be the key variable which limits the extraction by the extent to which olive oil dissolves in sc-CO 2. The composition of the sc-C 02 derived oil was determined by GC-GCTTOF-MS analysis and compared to that of commercial olive oil. A total of 27 peaks were detected in the chromatogram of the sc-C 02 derived oil as opposed to 37 peaks observed for commercial olive oil. These peaks could all be identified, and the two major components in the sc-C 02 derived olive oil are hexadecanoic and oleic acid. The quality and composition of the oil were evaluated against standard specifications of the International Olive Oil Council and classified on the basis of these criteria as <b>lampante</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> This oil is suitable for industrial use but not for human consumption.

Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 Determining {{the quality}} of olive oil {{has always been a}} conflict, as to date, the only way that was {{available}} for classification was through tasting by a panel of experts. This differentiation, performed by a quite subjective method, could be complex, and sometimes leads to large discrepancies in the organoleptic qualities of the same oil depending on the taster to try it. Such discrepancies may result in misclassification of the oil, resulting in economic harm to producers, to determine a quality below the real to a particular product. The progress each day over chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry allows to reach detect differences in concentrations of trace compounds even in the range of parts per trillion. Through these techniques it can be quantified with high accuracy at these levels, something impossible for a tasting panel or other physicochemical techniques. In the same way, in highlighting differences between large groups of samples, technical progress with high resolving power, and the development of new information technologies has facilitated the emergence of complex statistical analyzes that allow, based a previous model, a sample assignment within a given group with a minimum data treatment.

It has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams (0.3%) and its other characteristics correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard. This is obtained by refining virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> with a high acidity level or organoleptic defects that are eliminated after refining. Note that no solvents {{have been used to}} extract the oil, but it has been refined with the use of charcoal and other chemical and physical filters. Oils labeled as Pure <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or <b>Olive</b> <b>oil</b> are primarily refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> with a small addition of virgin-production to give taste.|$|R
