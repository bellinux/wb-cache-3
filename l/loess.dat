5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. <b>Loess</b> is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. <b>Loess</b> often stands in either steep or vertical faces. <b>Loess</b> tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with <b>loess</b> are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. <b>Loess</b> deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of <b>loess.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of Arad {{is made up of}} <b>Loess</b> land, while the eastern part is made up of {{sedimentary}} rock, including chalk, flint and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which {{winds through}} the Black Forest. The Elz creates a series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its <b>loess</b> and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in facies of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on <b>loess</b> and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but a few are preserved within sandy units.|$|E
5|$|Landslides {{encompass}} smaller areas, develop on {{the steep}} cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly {{located in the}} artificial <b>loess</b> hills of Zemun: Gardoš, Ćukovac and Kalvarija. However, {{the majority of the}} land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighborhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighborhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of Randolph is situated {{on top of}} the second Chickasaw Bluff, on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River in Tipton County. The four Chickasaw Bluffs are high grounds above the Mississippi River flood plains, composed of eroded pre-historic <b>loess</b> over glacial gravel. The Chickasaw Bluffs west of the community, {{on the banks of the}} Mississippi River, and flat cotton-fields east of Randolph dominate the rural landscape surrounding the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, {{and the nature of}} the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese <b>loess</b> plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as <b>loess,</b> and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the <b>loess</b> soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the <b>Loess</b> Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, {{but also for the}} security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine <b>loess</b> deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Loess</b> Islands {{ecoregion}} {{consists of}} large pockets of thick <b>loess</b> deposits {{surrounded by the}} Channeled Scablands throughout Eastern Washington, including public land within the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge and the Juniper Dunes Wilderness.|$|E
25|$|The museum {{provides}} {{tours of}} the catacombs, which contain remains of Orthodox saints or their relics. The Caves are of geological interest because they are excavated into <b>loess</b> ground. They form {{one of the most}} extensive occurrences of <b>loess</b> caves in the world.|$|E
25|$|Deposits of {{fine-grained}} wind-blown glacial sediment {{are called}} <b>loess.</b>|$|E
25|$|North east of {{the city}} (north to the Neve Menahem neighborhood) there are <b>Loess</b> plains and dry river bands.|$|E
25|$|Where {{it occurs}} in the wild, it is found {{infrequently}} in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic <b>loess</b> (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5.|$|E
25|$|Clogging or bioclogging of geotextiles, geonets, geopipe and/or geocomposites is a {{challenging}} design for certain soil types or unusual situations. For example, <b>loess</b> soils, fine cohesionless silts, highly turbid liquids, and microorganism laden liquids (farm runoff) are troublesome and generally require specialized testing evaluations.|$|E
25|$|Located in the <b>Loess</b> Plateau, {{it is at}} an {{altitude}} of around 2000 meters. The county has an area of 2193km². Out of its population of 463400, 444500 (95.92%) are registered as working in agriculture. Ethnic Han and Hui make up most of the population.|$|E
25|$|Council Bluffs, {{the major}} city of {{southwest}} Iowa, {{sits at the}} base of the <b>Loess</b> Hills National Scenic Byway. With three casino resorts, the city also includes such cultural attractions as the Western Hills Trails Center, Union Pacific Railroad Museum, the Grenville M. Dodge House, and the Lewis and Clark Monument.|$|E
25|$|Lyell's {{geological}} interests {{ranged from}} volcanoes and geological dynamics through stratigraphy, palaeontology, and glaciology to topics that {{would now be}} classified as prehistoric archaeology and paleoanthropology. He is best known, however, {{for his role in}} popularising the doctrine of uniformitarianism. He {{played a critical role in}} advancing the study of <b>loess.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{arrived in}} the Netherlands somewhere around 5000 BC with the Linear Pottery culture, who were {{probably}} central European farmers. Agriculture was practised only on the <b>loess</b> plateau in the very south (southern Limburg), but even there it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop {{in the rest of}} the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Wheat is {{the second}} most-prevalent grain crop, grown {{in most parts of}} the country but {{especially}} on the North China Plain, the Wei and Fen River valleys on the <b>Loess</b> plateau, and in Jiangsu, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces. Corn and millet are grown in north and northeast China, and oat is important in Inner Mongolia and Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Very fine glacial sediments or {{rock flour}} is often {{picked up by}} wind blowing over the bare surface and may be {{deposited}} great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These eolian <b>loess</b> deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. Katabatic winds can be important in this process.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the current terrain of the city, dating from the late Pliocene in the Tertiary period, {{is linked to the}} clogging of the Pannonian Sea. Layers of soil were created from deposits of sand, <b>loess</b> and gravel, and generally have a thickness of –. Over this base, decaying vegetation gave rise to podsolic soils, which led to favorable conditions for crops (cereals, vegetables, fruit trees).|$|E
25|$|Deposits most {{susceptible}} to liquefaction are young (Holocene-age, deposited {{within the last}} 10,000 years) sands and silts of similar grain size (well-sorted), in beds at least metres thick, and saturated with water. Such deposits are often found along stream beds, beaches, dunes, and areas where windblown silt (<b>loess)</b> and sand have accumulated. Some examples of soil liquefaction include quicksand, quick clay, turbidity currents, and earthquake induced liquefaction.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} devastating {{earthquakes}} in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi province, China. More than 830,000 people died. Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of <b>loess</b> hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Other {{geographic}} {{features are}} the peninsula of Mala Ciganlija {{and the island}} of Ada Međica, both on the Sava and the bay of Zimovnik (winter shelter), engulfed by Mala Ciganlija, with the facilities of the Beograd shipyard. The <b>loess</b> slope of Bežanijska Kosa {{is located in the}} western part of the municipality, while in the southern, the Galovica river canal flows into the Sava.|$|E
25|$|Iowa is {{generally}} not flat; {{most of the state}} consists of rolling hills. Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage. <b>Loess</b> hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick. Northeast Iowa along the Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Zone, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear almost mountainous.|$|E
25|$|During the Quaternary glaciations, Brittany {{was covered}} by <b>loess</b> and rivers started to fill the valleys with {{alluvial}} deposits. The valleys themselves were {{a result of a}} strong tectonic activity between the African and the Eurasian plate. The present Breton landscape did not acquired its final shape before one million years ago. The Breton subsoil is characterised by a huge amount of fractures that form a large aquifer containing several millions square meters of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{raw data}} is normalized; the {{simplest}} normalization {{method is to}} subtract background intensity and scale so that the total intensities {{of the features of}} the two channels are equal, or to use the intensity of a reference gene to calculate the t-value for all of the intensities. More sophisticated methods include z-ratio, <b>loess</b> and lowess regression and RMA (robust multichip analysis) for Affymetrix chips (single-channel, silicon chip, in situ synthesised short oligonucleotides).|$|E
25|$|A Strontium isotope {{analysis}} of 86 people from Bell Beaker graves in Bavaria suggests that 18–25% of all graves were occupied {{by people who}} came from a considerable distance outside the area. This was true of {{children as well as}} adults, indicative of some significant migration wave. Given the similarities with readings from people living on <b>loess</b> soils, {{the general direction of the}} local movement according to Price et al., is from the northeast to the southwest.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ice over {{so much of}} the continents greatly modified patterns of atmospheric circulation. Winds near the glacial margins were strong and persistent because of the abundance of dense, cold air coming off the glacier fields. These winds picked up and transported large quantities of loose, fine-grained sediment brought down by the glaciers. This dust accumulated as <b>loess</b> (wind-blown silt), forming irregular blankets over much of the Missouri River valley, central Europe, and northern China.|$|E
25|$|Most of Mississippi {{is part of}} the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The {{coastal plain}} is {{generally}} composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown <b>loess</b> soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the Alabama Black Belt.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} scenery in Iowa is found in the unique <b>Loess</b> Hills. The Iowa Great Lakes include several resort areas such as Spirit Lake, Arnolds Park, and the Okoboji Lakes. The Sanford Museum and Planetarium in Cherokee, Grotto of the Redemption in West Bend, Arnolds Park Amusement Park (one of the oldest amusement parks in the country) in Arnolds Park, The Danish Immigrant Museum in Elk Horn, and the Fort Museum and Frontier Village in Fort Dodge are regional destinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{area from}} Long Island to Nantucket, Massachusetts was formed from glacial till, and {{the plethora of}} lakes on the Canadian Shield in {{northern}} Canada can be almost entirely attributed to {{the action of the}} ice. As the ice retreated and the rock dust dried, winds carried the material hundreds of miles, forming beds of <b>loess</b> many dozens of feet thick in the Missouri Valley. Post-glacial rebound continues to reshape the Great Lakes and other areas formerly {{under the weight of the}} ice sheets.|$|E
25|$|Kansas is {{underlain}} by {{a sequence}} of horizontal to gently westward dipping sedimentary rocks. A sequence of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks outcrop in the eastern and {{southern part of the}} state. The state's western half has exposures of Cretaceous through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the erosion of the uplifted Rocky Mountains to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to glaciation in the Pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and <b>loess.</b>|$|E
