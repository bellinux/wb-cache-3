BackgroundThere are limited data for the safety and effectiveness of DES in STEMI. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 812 consecutive patients treated with DES implantation for STEMI. Intracoronary <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> was angiographically estimated and categorized as large <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (LTB), defined as <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> ≥ 2 vessel diameters, and small <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (STB) to predict clinical outcomes. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as death, repeat myocardial infarction, and IRA reintervention. ResultsMean duration of follow-up was 18. 2 ± 7. 8 months. Large <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 76, p = 0. 023) and MACE (HR 1. 88, p = 0. 001). The cumulative angiographic IRA-ST was 1. 1 % at 30 days and 3. 2 % at 2 years, and continued to augment beyond 2 years. It was significantly higher in the LTB compared with the STB group (8. 2 % vs. 1. 3 % at 2 years, respectively, p < 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND—: Thrombus {{aspiration}} during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for {{the treatment}} of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been widely used; however, recent trials have questioned its value and safety. In this meta-analysis, we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool the individual patient data from these trials to determine the benefits and risks of thrombus aspiration during PCI in patients with STEMI. METHODS—: Included were large (N≥ 1000) randomized controlled trials comparing manual thrombectomy vs. PCI alone in patients with STEMI. Individual patient data was provided by the leadership of each trial. The pre-specified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular (CV) mortality within 30 days and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 30 days. RESULTS—: The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS, TASTE and TOTAL) enrolled 19, 047 patients, of whom 18, 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. CV death at 30 days occurred in 221 (2. 4 %) of 9155 patients randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 (2. 9 %) of 9151 randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 70 - 1. 01, p= 0. 06). Stroke or TIA occurred in 66 (0. 8 %) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 46 (0. 5 %) randomized to PCI alone (odds ratio [OR] 1. 43 95 % CI 0. 98 - 2. 1, p= 0. 06). There {{were no significant differences in}} recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, heart failure or target vessel revascularization. In the subgroup with high <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (TIMI <b>thrombus</b> <b>grade</b> ≥ 3) thrombus aspiration was associated with less CV death (170 [2. 5 %] vs. 205 [3. 1 %] HR 0. 80; 95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 98, p = 0. 03), and with more stroke or TIA (55 [0. 9 %] vs. 34 [0. 5 %] OR 1. 56; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 42, p= 0. 04). However, the interaction p-values were 0. 32 and 0. 34, respectively. CONCLUSIONS—: Routine thrombus aspiration during STEMI PCI did not improve clinical outcomes.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{evaluation}} of treatment strategies for {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) is assessed {{through the use of}} a reliable method of quantifying the extent of the thrombotic process. Previous indices of <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> have suffered from various limitations, including lack of clinical relevance, poor correlation with actual thrombus mass, and failure to include important venous segments in the methodology. The use of a novel scheme of quantifying venous thrombus was evaluated as an alternative method that would avoid some of the drawbacks of existing indices. Methods: The volumes of 14 venous segments (infrarenal inferior vena cava, common iliac, hypogastric, external iliac, common femoral, profunda, superficial femoral, and popliteal and six tibial veins) were calculated from computed tomography (pelvic vein diameter), duplex ultrasound scan (infrainguinal vein diameter), and contrast venography (length of all segments) measurements. A venous volumetric index (VVI) was assigned with the normalization of the values to the volume of a single calf vein. The VVI was validated with the assessment of the ability to discriminate between asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT and between those DVT that were associated with pulmonary emboli and those that were not. Results: With the imaging data, the VVI ranged from 1 for a single calf vein thrombus to 26 for the infrarenal inferior vena cava. Each VVI unit represented 2. 3 mL of thrombus, with a maximum possible score of 63 representing a <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> of 145 mL for a single extremity, including the infrarenal inferior vena cava. In 885 patients with DVT, the VVI ranged from 1 to 56, averaging 3. 9 ± 0. 2 in patients who were asymptomatic and 8. 7 ± 0. 3 in patients who were symptomatic (P <. 001). The VVI was similar in the patients with pulmonary emboli as compared with those without (9. 6 ± 1. 2 vs 7. 7 ± 0. 2, respectively). In comparison with the three existing methods of quantifying venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results suggested that the VVI and the Venous Registry index were better than the other two indices in the discrimination of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic DVT (P <. 001). Conclusion: A novel index of venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> on the basis of actual venous volume measurements, was more accurate than present indices in the differentiation between clinical categories of patients with DVT. As such, it offers an acceptable alternative to current scoring systems. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 30 : 1060 - 6. ...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} extended-delay stenting (> 7 days between procedures) {{in the setting of}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). MethodsThis ongoing prospective observational study is being conducted in STEMI patients with a high <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> in the infarct-related artery (IRA). Patients are enrolled if the operator decides to try to restore the best TIMI flow with the thinnest tool and defer stent implantation for> 7 days under optimal anticoagulation to reduce <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> The primary endpoint is the composite of reocclusion of the IRA or sudden death between the two procedures, and deterioration of the flow (from the final flow achieved after the first procedure to the initial flow at the second procedure). ResultsBetween January 2014 and January 2015, 127 patients (of 135 we will enroll) were enrolled at 14 centres: 110 were men and the mean age±SD was 57. 1 ± 13. 0 years. 98 patients underwent a primary PCI as the first procedure and 29 patients underwent PCI after fibrinolysis. The final TIMI flow at the first procedure was 3 in 119 patients, 2 in 7 patients, and 1 in 1 patient and the residual culprit lesion was 61 ± 24 %. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in 42 patients. The second procedure was performed between 7 and 26 days after the first. None of the patients died between the two procedures; 1 patient experienced a reocclusion of the IRA In all cases, initial TIMI flow in the IRA (at the start of the second procedure) was the same as or better than the final flow after the first procedure.

Here we investigate the effects of statins [...] lipid-lowering agents with anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties [...] in decreasing <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> and decreasing vein wall injury, mediators of PTS, in established murine stasis and non-stasis chemical-induced venous thrombosis (N = 282 mice). Treatment of mice with daily atorvastatin or rosuvastatin significantly reduced stasis venous <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> by 25 % without affecting lipid levels, blood coagulation parameters, or blood cell counts. Statin-driven reductions in VT <b>burden</b> (<b>thrombus</b> mass for stasis thrombi, intravital microscopy thrombus area for non-stasis thrombi) compared similarly to the therapeutic anticoagulant effects of low molecular weight heparin. Blood from statin-treated mice showed significant reductions in platelet aggregation and clot stability. Statins additionally reduced thrombus plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), tissue factor, neutrophils, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and macrophages, and these effects were most notable in the earlier timepoints after DVT formation. In addition, statins reduced DVT-induced vein wall scarring by 50 % durably up to day 21 in stasis VT, as shown by polarized light microscopy of picrosirius red-stained vein wall collagen. The overall results demonstrate that statins improve VT resolution via profibrinolytic, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and anti-vein wall scarring effects. Statins may therefore offer a new pharmacotherapeutic approach to improve DVT resolution and to reduce the post-thrombotic syndrome, particularly in subjects who are ineligible for anticoagulation therapy...|$|R

Histopathologic analysis was performed on retrieved embolic fragments, assessing the presence and relative amount of fibrin, necrosis, lipid droplets, collagen, mucopolysaccharides, and leukocytes, {{as well as the}} total debris volume. Such variables were related to baseline clinical and angiographic variables. Results Embolic material was recovered in 41 (89 %) of 46 cases, with a mean total debris volume of 1. 2 +/- 2. 2 mm(3) Prevalent histopathologic patterns were organized thrombus (47 %),. fresh thrombus (29 %), and plaque fragments (24 %). At multivariate analysis, none of the baseline clinical variables considered significantly predicted the total debris volume.

Thus, interventional techniques able to reduce <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> at the culprit vessel might improve final myocardial reperfusion. Objective: To evaluate a new rapid-exchange thrombus-aspirating catheter, the Diver C. E., in {{patients with}} thrombotic coronary lesions undergoing PCI. Methods: Fifty patients with acute myocardial infarction (n = 44) or with non-ST-elevation ACS and angiographic evidence of coronary thrombus (n = 6) undergoing urgent PCI were prospectively enrolled. The Diver C. E. was used to aspirate coronary thrombus from the culprit lesion after placement of the guidewire. Adjunctive balloon inflations and stent implantation were used to achieve good angiographic result. Angiographic coronary flow (by means of TIM[score and corrected TIMI frame count, cTFC), thrombus score (TS), and myocardial perfusion (by means of postintervention myocardial blush grade, MBG) were assessed in all patients. Results: The device could be successfully employed in 96 % of the cases (48 / 50) and yielded significant (P = 2) was associated with a better postintervention angiographic myocardial perfusion (MBG 2. 3 +/- 0. 9 vs 1. 7 +/- 0. 8; P = 0. 05).

We finally selected 35 patients who had done both MRI (including SWI) and CTA. Twenty random subjects with completely normal MRI (including SWI) exam were selected as control. Two neuroradiologists (blinded to {{the presence or absence}} of stroke) reviewed the SW images and then compared the findings with CT angiogram (in patients with stroke). The number of MCA segments showing thrombus in each patient was tabulated to estimate the <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> <b>Thrombus</b> was detected on SWI in one or more MCA segments in 30 out of 35 patients, on the first review. Of the 30, SWI showed thrombus in more than one MCA segments in 7 patients. CTA depicted branch occlusion in 31 cases. Thrombus was seen on both SWI and CTA in 28 patients. Thrombus was noted in two patients on SWI only, with no corresponding abnormality seen on CTA. Two patients with acute MCA showed no vascular occlusion or thrombus on either CTA or SWI.

Due {{to the high}} <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> present in ST, the use of thrombus aspiration (TA) may enhance the angiographic results by limiting distal embolization. Methods. Consecutive patients undergoing urgent PCI due to ST were studied, consisting of two groups according {{to the type of}} intervention (standard PCI [SP] or TA). TIMI flow, corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), myocardial blush grade (MBG), thrombus score (TS), Yip's adverse <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> features, occurrence of angiographically evident distal embolization (DE) were evaluated offline. In-hospital outcomes were also recorded. Results. Twenty-eight patients entered the study.

After PCI, a trend in favor of TA as compared to SP was observed for post-PCI TIMI 3 flow rate (67 % VS. 89 %;p = 0. 10), final cTFC (31 +/- 35 vs. 17 +/- 21; p = 0. 10) and MBG 2 - 3 rote (40 % vs. 67 %; p = 0. 12). Accordingly, the rate of adverse angiographic outcome (post-PCI TIMI 0 - 1 flow and/or DE) was significantly lower in the TA as compared to SP: 5 % (1 / 18) vs 33 % (5 / 15) respectively (p = 0. 04). Throughout hospitalization, major adverse events occurred in 6 % of TA patients vs. 33 % of SP patients (p = 0. 08). Conclusions.

Stents and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were liberally used. Epicardial and myocardial reperfusion angiographic parameters, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE, i. e., cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization) were assessed. RESULTS: The AngioJet was successfully used in all patients. Angiographic analysis showed that the AngioJet significantly improved epicardial coronary flow (p < 0. 01), frame count (p < 0. 01) and myocardial blush (p < 0. 01), while stenting yielded significant improvements only in diameter stenosis, minimum lesion diameter and correlated vessel parameters (p < 0. 01). In-hospital MACE were uncommon [9 (8 %) ], despite the patients' characteristics. When compared to an AMI population with similar <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> but not undergoing thrombectomy, our AngioJet population showed significant improvement of reperfusion parameters. Moreover, there was greater AngioJet benefit in the high versus moderate <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> subset; laboratory and operator experience also correlated significantly with final angiographic results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the favorable risk-benefit profile of AngioJet device use in selected patients with AMI when used in experienced laboratories and by trained operators...|$|R
40|$|A 34 -year-old female from Laos {{presented}} to the emergency department with a 3 -week history of worsening abdominal pain; she subsequently developed an acute abdomen requiring emergent exploratory laparotomy. An intraoperative angiography was performed, which revealed complete portal vein thrombosis. A 5 F 20 -cm infusion catheter was placed through an omental vein, and tissue plasminogen activator was administered directly into the catheter with successful decrease in <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> There are few controlled data {{on which to base}} clinical decisions in patients with portal vein thrombosis. Our case expands on these earlier reports that direct thrombolysis can be safely performed using local, intraclot infusions for portal vein thrombosis, and thrombolytic doses can be kept relatively low, limiting the risk of bleeding complications...|$|R

The MGuard stent is a cobalt chromium bare metal stent with a porous net attached to its outer surface that {{has been designed to}} prevent thrombus fragmentation and distal embolization during stent implantation. This review summarizes the available evidence supporting the use of the MGuard stent in different scenarios such as lesions with high <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden,</b> saphenous vein graft interventions, coronary perforations, or carotid lesions.

40|$|Objective: A {{malignant}} {{profile of}} early brain ischemia {{has been demonstrated}} in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution (DEFUSE) trial. Patients with a malignant profile had a low chance for an independent functional outcome despite thrombolysis within 3 – 6 h. We sought to determine whether CT angiography (CTA) could identify a malignant imaging profile within 3 h from symptom onset. Methods: We studied consecutive patients (04 / 02 – 09 / 07) with anterior circulation stroke who received CTA before intravenous thrombolysis within 3 h. We assessed the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on CTA source images (CTASI). Intracranial <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> on CTA was assessed with a novel 10 -point clot burden score (CBS). We analyzed percentages independent (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2) and fatal outcome at 3 months and parenchymal hematoma rates across categorized combined CTASI-ASPECTS + CBS score groups where 20 is best and 0 is worst. Results: We identified 114 patients (median age 73 years [interquartile range 61 – 80], onset-to-tPA time 129 min [95 – 152]). Among 24 patients (21 %) with extensive hypoattenuation on CTASI and extensive <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> (combined score ≤ 10), only 4 % (1 / 24) were functionally independent whereas mortality was 50 % (12 / 24). In contrast, 57 % (51 / 90) of patients with less affected scores (combined score 11 – 20) were functionally independent and mortality was 10 % (9 / 90; p < 0. 001). Parenchymal hematoma rates were 30 % (7 / 23) vs. 8 % (7 / 88), respectively (p = 0. 008). Conclusion: CTA identifies a large hyperacute stroke population with high mortality and low likelihood for independent functional outcome despite early thrombolysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) encompasses ST segment elevation {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI), with generally high <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> and non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), with lower <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> In {{the setting of}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ACS, bivalirudin appears superior to unfractionated heparin (UFH), driven by reduced major bleeding. Recent trials suggest that the benefit of bivalirudin may be reduced with use of transradial access and evolution in antiplatelet therapy. Moreover, a differential role of bivalirudin in ACS cohorts is unknown. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing bivalirudin and UFH in patients with ACS receiving PCI, with separate analyses in STEMI and NSTE-ACS groups. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated with random-effects model. RESULTS: In 5 trials of STEMI (10   358 patients), bivalirudin increased the risk of acute stent thrombosis (ST) (OR 3. 62; CI 1. 95 to 6. 74; p< 0. 0001) compared with UFH. Bivalirudin reduced the risk of major bleeding only when compared with UFH plus planned glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) (OR 0. 49; CI 0. 36 to 0. 67; p< 0. 00001). In 14 NSTE-ACS trials (25   238 patients), {{there was no difference}} between bivalirudin and UFH in death, myocardial infarction or ST. However, bivalirudin reduced the risk of major bleeding compared with UFH plus planned GPI (OR 0. 52; CI 0. 43 to 0. 62; p< 0. 00001), or UFH plus provisional GPI (OR 0. 68; CI 0. 46 to 1. 01; p= 0. 05). The reduction in major bleeding with bivalirudin was not related to vascular access site. CONCLUSIONS: Bivalirudin increases the risk of acute ST in STEMI, but may confer an advantage over UFH in NSTE-ACS while undergoing PCI, reducing major bleeding without an increase in ST...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionA case is {{reported}} of left brachiocephalic vein thrombus removal using the Angiovac device within a stented venous segment via a through-and-through access technique. ReportThis novel technique involves obtaining through-and-through access {{from the left}} basilic vein to the right femoral vein, which then facilitates the advancement of the Angiovac device to successfully remove in a stepwise fashion the thrombus present within a stented region of the left brachiocephalic vein. DiscussionThe Angiovac device {{has been shown to}} be very useful and effective at removing large amounts of thrombus, tumor, and foreign bodies within arterial and venous systems successfully. This novel technique uses the through-and-through venous access approach to allow for this device to remain close to the targeted area of <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden</b> and prevent damage of the already existing stents in this region...|$|R
40|$|Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} (BCS) or hepatic venous outflow obstruction, is a {{rare and}} complex clinical entity, with diverse aetiology and {{a wide range of}} presentations. Its rarity and heterogeneity create significant challenges for evidence-based clinical decision-making, particularly in the even more infrequent setting of acute BCS presentation. Here we present the case of a young woman with acute, severe BCS, where treatment alternatives were limited due to a significant IVC <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> A clearly defined acute onset allowed the prompt use of systemic thrombolysis, conducted in consultation with a multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, with close monitoring for both treatment response and complications. Her treatment resulted in resolution of hepatic vein occlusion and prevention of the potentially significant clinical sequelae. We review the literature and discuss current opinion in the management of BCS...|$|R
40|$|Early recanalization of an {{occluded}} {{cerebral artery}} {{is the most}} effective way to salvage ischemic penumbra in the acute stroke setting. Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen acti-vator (tPA) is standard therapy for patients arriving within 4. 5 hours of onset. 1 – 4 Early recanalization rates with intravenous tPA are, however, low, especially in patients with proximal artery occlusions and large <b>thrombus</b> <b>burden.</b> 5 In this context, if physicians are able to reliably estimate probability of early recanalization of intracranial arterial thrombi with intravenous tPA, they can make a more informed decision on whether resource intensive intra-arterial therapy should be adminis-tered additionally to these patients. Thrombolysis in any vascular bed depends on the ability of blood and thrombolytic agents, such as tPA, to permeate throm-bus. 6, 7 Permeable thrombi have previously been described on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), transcranial Doppler...|$|R
