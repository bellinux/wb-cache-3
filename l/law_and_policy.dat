5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive <b>Law</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the students’ awareness on their attitude to wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> in selected secondary schools in Ibadan metropolis was carried out using structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered to 480 students while 472 were retrieved. The questionnaire elicits information on their personal data, awareness on wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> {{as well as their}} perception towards wildlife protection. T-test was used to test various hypotheses and research questions. Result indicated that there is {{no significant difference in the}} level of awareness of wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> gender as well as school type. However, there is significant relationship between the level of awareness on wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> perception towards conservation. It was observed that there are few or no extracurricular activities in most secondary schools that can promote awareness in wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies.</b> Subjects like nature studies should be re-introduced into school curriculum and conservation clubs should be established and be made functional in our secondary schools to inculcate awareness of wildlife <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> in the younger generation...|$|R

Drawing mainly on insights from criminology and development studies, it investigates how the commercial migration <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies,</b> specifically the aspects that deal with encouraging or attracting 'high-value' foreign entrepreneurs and investors, make the state potentially complicit in corruption and underdevelopment in the global South. There is an important need to address the implicated migration <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> as a critical and integral part of international efforts to combat corruption and promote peace and development in the global South. Reform of such <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b> is in the long-term interest of all stakeholders...|$|R
