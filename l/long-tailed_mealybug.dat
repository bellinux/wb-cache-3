25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>mealybug</b> under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|E
40|$|Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) {{has been}} widely used in {{classical}} and inundative biological control of mealybugs, including the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>mealybug,</b> Pseudococcus longispinus (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). This {{study was conducted to}} investigate colonization and establishment efficiency of C. montrouzieri to manage P. longispinus on three different ornamental plant species (Ficus elastica, Lilium longiflorum, and Dieffenbachia seguine). Within-plant distribution pattern of P. longispinus and the colonization ecology of adult C. montrouzieri were investigated. Significantly more P. longispinus were found on the upper parts of the plants regardless of plant species, and C. montrouzieri adults discovered P. longispinus significantly faster when they were released {{on the top of the}} plants than on the bottom. Choice tests revealed that C. montrouzieri adults preferred smaller P. longispinus nymphs. The implications for utilization of C. montrouzieri for biological control of mealybugs on various ornamental plants are discussed...|$|E

Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), citrus mealybug, citrus rust mite, and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control. It has been estimated that 100 % of the citrus in Israel is managed with IPM [2]. Cottony-cushion scale had a devastating effect on citrus groves in Israel in the early 1900 s and has been kept under effective control by the predatory vedalia beetle introduced in 1912. When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the USA controlled the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>mealybug.</b> The Florida red scale, considered the most important pest of Israel in the 1950 s, was brought under complete control in most areas by a parasite imported from Hong Kong [3]. Four species of very damaging whiteflies have been introduced into Israel in the last few decades. The introductio...|$|E
40|$|Endosymbiosis {{has been}} a major driver of {{evolutionary}} diversification of eukaryotes. However, symbiosis can create conflict between partners and symbiont density is often tightly regulated within hosts to ensure optimal functioning of the holobiont. The horticultural pest insects, citrus mealybugs, make an intriguing and potentially-powerful case study for endosymbiosis, harbouring two obligate, nutritional, vertically transmitted bacteria: Tremblaya princeps and Moranella endobia, in a nested mutualism. In this thesis, I examine the variation in the density of each of these obligate symbionts in citrus mealybugs under controlled environmental conditions, using qPCR, as well as the diversity of facultative symbionts that infect the mealybugs using next-generation sequencing and conventional targeted PCR. Citrus mealybugs were found to harbour Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Cardinium and Rickettsia, which have been found to impact the fitness of their hosts in other insect species, whereas <b>long-tailed</b> <b>mealybugs</b> were not found to harbour any of these bacteria, but the symbiont communities in both species were found to be dominated by their obligate symbionts. The density of the two obligate symbionts varied by up to six-fold between different populations kept under identical environmental conditions and a hybridisation experiment indicated that M. endobia and T. princeps density may be controlled by symbiont and host genotype respectively. However, symbiont density was not found to correlate with life-history traits in the laboratory, the ability of mealybugs to exploit different plant species, or the susceptibility of the mealybugs to insecticide and artificial reduction of symbiont density by heat-stress also had no effect on host fitness. Citrus mealybugs harbour seemingly superfluous symbionts with no clear fitness costs or benefits...|$|R
40|$|Searching {{behaviour}} of the parasitoid, Leptomastix nr. Epona {{were evaluated}} on four different leaf surfaces (Passiflora, Avocado, Guava, Citrus) and the arrestment behaviour of the parasitoid to the honeydew and waxes of Pseudococcus longispinus and P. affinis were compared under {{a video camera}} in laboratory. Scanning electron microscopy were also done on four leaf surfaces. No significant differences were observed in the behaviour of the parasitoid, L. nr. epona towards the honeydew of long-tailed (host) and glasshouse mealybug (non-host). Female Leptomastix nr. Epona immediately after release, starts searching in clean, honeydew and waxes contaminated areas. After contacting with honeydew or wax contaminated areas, the parasitoid searches the area intensively with its antenna and then turn around the honeydew or waxes contaminated area {{and then try to}} probe by its ovipositor. The female parasitoids may consider <b>long-tailed</b> <b>mealybug</b> honeydew and waxes as chemical and visual cues and responds to this stimulant by changes in locomotary behaviour. Overall, the present results showed L. nr. epona searches on honeydew or wax coated areas more than on a clean area. So honeydew and wax might act as an arrestment stimulus or visual cue, showing this associated host product is a long-term kairomone. The net speed of searching of Leptomastix nr. epona on Passiflora was reduced compared with other three species and the number of trichomes observed on Passiflora (leaf lamina and mid rib of the leaf) were higher compared with other three plant species. So it {{may be one of the}} reason of the parasitoid low net speed of searching on dense trichomatous leaf lamina such as Passiflora compared to leaf lamina where no trichome at all (citrus) ...|$|E
