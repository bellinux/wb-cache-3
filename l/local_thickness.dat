40|$|Heat is {{generated}} during anodizing of aluminium, leading to macroscopic anodic film thickness variations and to local burning effects. The precise {{reasons for this}} non-uniform film behaviour {{have yet to be}} elucidated. In the present study, conventional anodizing in sulphuric acid has been investigated in a wall-jet electrode reactor, enabling introduction of controlled heat transfer variations. An increased <b>local</b> film <b>thickness</b> is associated with an increased local electrode temperature. It was found that the higher the local temperature, the greater the <b>local</b> film <b>thickness.</b> This is explained by considering thermal enhancement of the field-assisted oxide dissolution at the pore bases, which necessitates a local current density rise to maintain the local anodizing equilibrium. Local cyclic voltammetry and capacitance measurements reveal an unchanged barrier layer thickness on the anodized aluminium specimen, thus confirming the previous.

5000|$|Apart {{from its}} ability to alter its camber, each low-mounted wing of the AL5 was {{externally}} unremarkable, with a rectangular plan out to broadly rounded tips. There were two spars, rigidly and conventionally joined together. The plywood covered {{leading and trailing edges}} were each rigid structures but they were hinged on duralumin tubes which ran through the lower parts of the forward and rear spars respectively. Their angular positions were controlled together via rod and lever linkages and determined the profile of the surfaces between the spars. As the edges were rotated downwards, the underside surface bent upwards; spacers kept the <b>local</b> <b>thickness</b> constant so the upper surface curvature also increased, as did the overall camber. As a result, the upper side surface path between the spars increased, so extra skin was allowed to slide out from under the upper side of the trailing edge. There were three wing settings, one for take-off, one for speed and a third for landing. [...] Lachassagne estimated that the camber-changing features added about 15% to the weight of the wing. Broad chord ailerons occupied about 40% of the span. Each wing was wire braced with two pairs of long Vs from the spars at about mid-span, one to the upper fuselage and the other to the landing gear.|$|E

The locally-predicted scalp thickness was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the temporal areas (9. 5 +/- 2. 6 mm) than in the parieto-occipital (6. 6 +/- 1. 3 mm) and frontal (4. 8 +/- 1. 1 mm) areas.

40|$|A {{combined}} PLIF/IR thermography {{technique was}} developed and employed towards the measurement of unsteady and conjugate heat transfer in thin, gravity-driven falling liquid film flows (with and without flow pulsation) over an inclined heated metal foil. Simultaneous, <b>local</b> film <b>thickness,</b> film and substrate temperature, heat flux exchanged with a heated foil and heat transfer coefficient results are reported {{for a range of}} electrically applied heat input values, flow Reynolds (Re) numbers and flow pulsation frequencies. Moreover, interfacial wave velocities were calculated from cross-correlations across successive thickness profiles. Results concerning the instantaneous and local heat transfer coefficient variation and how this is correlated with the instantaneous and <b>local</b> film <b>thickness</b> variation (waves) suggest that the heat transfer coefficient experiences an enhancement in thinner films. The particular observation is most probably attributed to a number of unsteady flow phenomena within the wavy fluid films that are not captured by the steady analysis.

40|$|Design-based stereological methods (the Cavalieri {{principle}} and vertical sectioning) {{have been used}} to estimate the volumes, surface areas and thicknesses of the cerebral cortex. Cortices of individual hemispheres were analysed in a selection of 31 adult domestic mammals (horses, oxen, pigs, goats, dogs, cats and rabbits). There were 13 females and 18 males. After correcting for fixation shrinkage effects, results were tested for species, laterality and sex differences using linear regression and analysis of variance. Mean body weights of domestic mammals varied from 4 kg to 460 kg and brain volumes from 11 cm 3 to 603 cm 3. Hemisphere dimensions varied between species but, except for volume (which exhibited a species x sex interaction effect), no other differences were detected. It is concluded that these mammalian brains are, in terms of their gross anatomy, symmetric and not sexually dimorphic. Apparent cortical thickness (measured directly on slices) proved to be a satisfactory estimate of true thickness (estimated by dividing cortical volume by the mean of outer and inner cortical surfaces).
