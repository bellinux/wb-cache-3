5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service <b>life</b> <b>extension</b> program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down. In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{operators}} {{have chosen}} to undertake various <b>life</b> <b>extension</b> and upgrade programmes to keep their Tornado fleets as viable frontline aircraft for the foreseeable future. The RAF and RSAF have upgraded their Tornados to the GR4 standard to increase combat effectiveness, while German Tornados have been undergoing periodic upgrades under the multi-stage ASSTA (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) programme. With these upgrades, as of 2011, it is projected that the Tornado shall be in service until 2025, more than 50 {{years after the first}} prototype took flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the crash, Onassis's father and {{stepmother}} arrived from New York at the hospital where Onassis was being treated. The couple were accompanied by an American neurosurgeon. Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English neurosurgeon Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no chance of surviving his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen with the <b>Life</b> <b>Extension</b> Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Alexander Onassis was buried next to the chapel on his father's private Ionian island of Skorpios.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service <b>life</b> <b>extension</b> program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was chosen and Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E
25|$|Though many {{scientists}} state that <b>life</b> <b>extension</b> and radical <b>life</b> <b>extension</b> are possible, {{there are still}} no international or national programs focused on radical <b>life</b> <b>extension.</b> There are political forces staying for and against <b>life</b> <b>extension.</b> By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started.

40|$|Purpose: The moving {{rectangle}} {{method is}} used to disentangle the contributions of rectangularization and <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> {{to the increase in}} life expectancy. It requires the choice of an endpoint of the survival curve that approaches the maximum age at death. We examined the effect of choosing different end points on the outcomes of this method. Methods: For five developed countries, survival curves from age 50 years were constructed per calendar year from 1922 onward. Survival values of 0. 1, 0. 01, and 0. 001 were chosen as end points of the survival curve, and the contributions of rectangularization and <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> to the increase in life expectancy were calculated using the moving rectangle method. Results: The choice of different survival values as end points profoundly influenced the estimated contributions of rectangularization and <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> to the increase in life expectancy. When choosing 0. 001, rectangularization contributed most years, whereas when choosing 0. 1, <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> contributed most years. Conclusions: When the moving rectangle method {{is used to}} estimate the contributions of rectangularization and <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> to the increase in life expectancy, its outcomes depend on the choice of the endpoint of the survival curve...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} several upgrade {{programmes}} conducted for the MiG-29.

40|$|A {{model for}} replicative <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by calorie {{restriction}} (CR) in yeast {{has been proposed}} whereby reduced glucose in the growth medium leads to activation of the NAD þ –dependent histone deacetylase Sir 2. One mechanism proposed for this putative activation of Sir 2 is that CR enhances the rate of respiration, in turn leading to altered levels of NAD þ or NADH, and ultimately resulting in enhanced Sir 2 activity. An alternative mechanism has been proposed in which CR decreases levels of the Sir 2 inhibitor nicotinamide through increased expression of the gene coding for nicotinamidase, PNC 1. We have previously reported that <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by CR is not dependent on Sir 2 in the longlived BY 4742 strain background. Here we have determined the requirement for respiration {{and the effect of}} nicotinamide levels on <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by CR. We find that CR confers robust <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> in respiratorydeficient cells independent of strain background, and moreover, suppresses the premature mortality associated with loss of mitochondrial DNA in the short-lived PSY 316 strain. Addition of nicotinamide to the medium dramatically shortens the life span of wild type cells, due to inhibition of Sir 2. However, even in cells lacking both Sir 2 and the replication fork block protein Fob 1, nicotinamide partially prevents <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by CR. These findings (1) demonstrate that respiration is not required for the longevity benefits of CR in yeast, (2) show that nicotinamide inhibits <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by CR through a Sir 2 -independent mechanism, and (3) suggest that CR acts through a conserved, Sir 2 -independent mechanism in both PSY 316 and BY 4742...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} calorie {{restriction}} (CR) on <b>life</b> span <b>extension,</b> demonstrated in organisms ranging from yeast to mice, may involve the down-regulation of pathways, including Tor, Akt, and Ras. Here, we present data suggesting that yeast Tor 1 and Sch 9 (a homolog of the mammalian kinases Akt and S 6 K) {{is a central}} component of a network that controls {{a common set of}} genes implicated in a metabolic switch from the TCA cycle and respiration to glycolysis and glycerol biosynthesis. During chronological survival, mutants lacking SCH 9 depleted extracellular ethanol and reduced stored lipids, but synthesized and released glycerol. Deletion of the glycerol biosynthesis genes GPD 1, GPD 2, or RHR 2, among the most up-regulated in long-lived sch 9 Δ, tor 1 Δ, and ras 2 Δ mutants, was sufficient to reverse chronological <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> in sch 9 Δ mutants, suggesting that glycerol production, in addition to the regulation of stress resistance systems, optimizes <b>life</b> span <b>extension.</b> Glycerol, unlike glucose or ethanol, did not adversely affect the <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> induced by calorie restriction or starvation, suggesting that carbon source substitution may represent an alternative to calorie restriction as a strategy to delay aging...|$|R
40|$|Background An {{increasing}} body {{of literature}} is exploring whether {{the age of the}} recipient of health care should be a criterion in how health care resources are allocated. The existing literature is constrained both by the relatively small number of age comparison groups within preference-elicitation studies, and by a paucity of methodological robustness tests for order and framing effects and the reliability and transitivity of preferences that would strengthen confidence in the results. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at estimating granulated age-related weights for health gains across the age spectrum that can potentially inform health care decision-making. Methods A sample of 2, 500 participants recruited from the health care consumer panels of a social research company completed a person trade-off (or ‘matching’) study designed to estimate age-related weights for 5 - and 10 -year <b>life</b> <b>extensions.</b> The results are presented in terms of matrices for alternative age comparisons across the age spectrum.

40|$|As in our prior work {{showing that}} <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> by calorie {{restriction}} (CR) occurs independently of Sir 2 [1], we {{have attempted to}} examine the putative role for respiration in <b>life</b> span <b>extension</b> in as comprehensive a manner as possible [2].

In contrast, Lin and colleagues have exclusively used 0. 5 % glucose for their CR experiments [3 – 5].
