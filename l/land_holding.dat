5|$|In 1634 King Charles I reorganized {{the colony}} {{into a system}} of shires. The former Elizabeth Cittie became Elizabeth City Shire. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, Adam Thoroughgood (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from King's Lynn, Norfolk, England) was granted a large <b>land</b> <b>holding,</b> through the head rights system, along the Lynnhaven River in 1636.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework {{was taken by the}} keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - a reversal of the old <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 and had gone entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was not up to par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E

25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no better than in most other states.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital was}} {{provisioned}} by the indigenous towns and its labor {{was available for}} enterprises that ultimately created a colonial economy. The gradual drying up of the central lake system created more dry land for farming, but the sixteenth-century population declines allowed Spaniards to expand their acquisition of land. One region that retained strong Indian <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> was the southern fresh water area, which important suppliers of fresh produce to the capital. The area was characterized by intensely cultivated chinampas, man-made extensions of cultivable land into the lake system. These chinampa towns retained a strong indigenous character and Indians continued to hold the majority of that land, despite its closeness to the Spanish capital. A key example is Xochimilco.|$|E
25|$|In the 1350s, the Yuan dynasty {{declined}} rapidly due {{to internal}} struggles, enabling King Gongmin {{to reform the}} Goryeo government. Gongmin had various problems {{that needed to be}} dealt with, including the removal of pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officials, the question of <b>land</b> <b>holding,</b> and quelling the growing animosity between the Buddhists and Confucian scholars. During this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered Liaoyang in 1356, repulsed two large invasions by the Red Turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General Choe Yeong defeated an invading Mongol tumen in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the Wokou menace and used naval artillery created by Choe Museon to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.|$|E

Montserrat also issues <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure in seeking to comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery.

25|$|In 1865 {{more than}} 80 acres of Ripley's <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> were still undeveloped. The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company's former mine workings. Several old mine shafts had been {{converted}} to wells to provide the dye works with its soft water supply. Ripley Ville occupied most of the Broom Hall Estate: Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s. The {{northern part of the}} estate had been acquired by the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) to build the Bowling Curves that opened in 1867. The site chosen for Ripley Ville had the disadvantage being irregularly shaped with steep gradients. Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old mine workings and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre.|$|E
25|$|An {{interpretation}} of Roman law regarding treasure troves makes an {{appearance in the}} 13th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The Parable of the Hidden Treasure is told by Jesus of Nazareth to the crowds surrounding him and his disciples. In the parable, the treasure trove is hidden in a field, which is open country and anyone could conceivably discover something hidden in that location. It's also assumed that the present owner has no knowledge or memory of the treasure. The finder of the treasure kept the trove secret until he could raise capital to purchase the <b>land</b> <b>holding</b> the trove. Selling all he had, the finder purchased the land and then unearthed the trove and, as the finder and owner, he was legally entitled to the entire trove. Jesus compared the kingdom of Heaven to the trove, being of greater value than all a person's earthly wealth and a wise investment that not everyone understands at first.|$|E

25|$|However, {{shortly before}} signing onto the CSM, the second batch of member states (all in the OECS) {{negotiated}} an opt-out agreement {{with regards to}} land ownership by non-nationals. As the OECS members of the CSM are all small countries and have limited available land, {{they are allowed to}} keep their Alien <b>Land</b> <b>Holding</b> Laws or Alien Landholders Acts (which apply to the ownership of land by non-nationals), but will put in place mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Revised Treaty that will monitor the granting of access to land and the conditions of such access. As it now stands foreign companies or nationals have to seek legal permission to buy land. All other laws relating to discrimination in favour of member state nationals only have been amended though. Among the non-OECS members of the CSM, there are no restrictions on private land ownership by CARICOM nationals (although in Suriname, and possibly in the other members as well, restrictions still apply with regards to state-owned land).|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} New York, {{which also has}} a civil law history from its Dutch colonial days, began a {{codification}} of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete {{is known as the}} Field Code applying to civil procedure. The original colony of New Netherland was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was recaptured by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique {{in the history of the}} British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the patroon system of <b>land</b> <b>holding,</b> based on the feudal system and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of Roman-Dutch law continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of food power, it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and <b>land</b> <b>holding.</b> [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. [...] The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.|$|E
