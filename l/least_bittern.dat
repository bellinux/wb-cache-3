50|$|The <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> is {{an elusive}} bird. They {{spend much time}} {{straddling}} reeds. When alarmed, the <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> freezes in place with its bill pointing up, turns its front and both eyes toward the source of alarm, and sometimes sways to resemble wind-blown marsh vegetation. This is perhaps a predator-avoidance behaviour, since its small size makes the bittern vulnerable to many potential predators. Thanks to its habit of perching among the reeds, the <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> can feed {{from the surface of}} water that would be too deep for the wading strategy of other herons. The <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> and much larger and different-looking American bittern often occupy the same wetlands, but may have relatively little interaction because of differences in foraging habits, preferred prey, and timing of breeding cycles. The <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> arrives on its breeding grounds about a month after the American bittern, and leaves one or two months earlier. John James Audubon noted that a young captive <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> was able to walk with ease between two books standing 4 cm apart. When dead, the bird's body measured 5.7 cm across, indicating that it could compress its breadth to an extraordinary degree.|$|E

40|$|I {{estimated}} {{the risk of}} selenium toxicity to endangered Yuma clapper rail and other marsh birds of the lower Colorado River (LCR). I collected sediment, invertebrates, Virginia rails, and <b>least</b> <b>bitterns</b> from 4 locations within the LCR valley, in May-August 1990, and collected additional bird species from 1 of the sites in April 1991. I analyzed the samples for selenium and other trace elements. Selenium accumulated in the backwater marshes of the LCR and was uniformly distributed among the backwaters sampled. Selenium increased 1 - 16 X between successive trophic levels, however, selenium levels {{did not differ significantly}} among species with different diets. Based on the selenium levels in bird tissues and prey species, marsh birds in the LCR valley are at low risk of adult mortality, but moderate to high risk of teratogenicity. The rate of selenium accumulation in the backwaters must be reduced to decrease the risk of toxicity...|$|R
50|$|Initially, Cory's <b>least</b> <b>bittern</b> was {{accepted}} as a valid species, with Elliott Coues and Richard Bowdler Sharpe both including it in published species lists.

Nonetheless, in 1896 Frank Chapman wrote a detailed paper supporting its retention as a valid species. Outram Bangs later argued, in 1915, that this view was wrong, and proposed that Cory's should become a junior synonym of <b>least</b> <b>bittern.</b> This view eventually prevailed, with the American Ornithologists' Union removing the species from their list of North American birds in 1923, although others held dissenting views until at least 1928.|$|E

40|$|This {{summer was}} marked by {{continuing}} high water tables along the Missouri River and good water levels in the eastern Rainwater Basin. As a result, American and <b>Least</b> <b>Bitterns,</b> King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee. Mountain Plovers are present in southwest Kimball Co in surprising numbers, with excellent conservation work being done there. The group responsible for the effort has an excellent Facebook site (see species account). Significant breeding records were made for Burrowing Owl, Long-eared Owl, and Brewer 2 Ì† 7 s Blackbird. Strangely, three species of migrant warblers were found in midsummer: Orange-crowned, Nashville, and Blackburnian, {{as well as a}} late June White-crowned Sparrow. Dickcissels again made a good showing in the west. Other eastern birds far west included Eastern Wood-Pewee and Summer Tanager.

Information on habitat use of the American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and a statistically valid survey design for monitoring changes in populations of inconspicuous marsh birds, which include American and <b>Least</b> <b>Bitterns</b> (Ixobrychus exilis), Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), Soras (Porzana carolina), and Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola)) is needed to inform conservation and management actions. My research, from 1999 - 2002, examined breeding habitat use and home range of American Bitterns. Also, I used pilot survey data to guide design options to meet objectives for monitoring marsh bird occupancy rates in association with habitat changes. Nest sites of American Bitterns in wetlands (n = 47) and grasslands (n = 33) were positively associated with percent dead vegetation cover and density and negatively associated with vegetation height. Foraging sites of American Bitterns were negatively associated with distance to small water openings and vegetation height. Daily survival rate was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 930 - 0. 979) and nest survival rate of American Bitterns was 0. 35 (95 % CI = 0. 15 - 0. 58). The average core home range size (50 %) was 18. 08 ha ([plus or minus] 6. 38) and the 95 % home range was 109. 28 ha ([plus or minus] 38. 47) using the fixed-kernel estimator.

40|$|The {{response}} of wetland vegetation to management {{can only be}} interpreted by considering an intricate mix of physiological, ecological, and temporal factors. Because cattail management is important for many freshwater marshes, {{the purpose of this}} leaflet is to present autecological principles for such management. A 50 : 50 ratio of open water and vegetation is a frequent objective when managing cattail marshes in North America. When a particular marsh has been extensively flooded for some time and few cattails remain, managers may wish to foster more cattails to develop such hemi-marsh conditions. The reverse is followed when a marsh is dominated by cattails. Hemi-marsh conditions are optimal for breeding migratory birds, including most waterfowl, black and Forsterâ€™s terns, American coots, and yellow-headed blackbirds. During the nonbreeding season, the life history requirements of migratory birds are not as closely tied to the hemi-marsh conditions. However, such wetlands still provide excellent habitat. Cattails are prolific and can quickly dominate a wetland plant community. Monotypic stands of cattails have reduced overall habitat value but do benefit some species of wildlife. They provide excellent habitat for wintering white-tailed deer and ring-necked pheasants and habitat for breeding marsh wrens, <b>least</b> <b>bitterns,</b> and various species of blackbirds. However, hemi-marshes also are habitat for these species, too. Cattails also provide excellent roosting habitat for blackbirds that can severely damage adjacent crops, especially sunflowers in the prairie states. Elimination of the cattail stand removes roosting habitat and can reduce local damage, but the damage is often simply shifted to other areas where the displaced birds create new roosts. Although the vegetation cycle in prairie marshes is based on the cycle of wet and dry years on the prairies, its basic principles apply to cattail management elsewhere. The cycle of a semipermanent marsh has four stages: dry, regenerating, degenerating, or lake marsh. Identifying the existing stage of a wetland {{is the first step toward}} determining the appropriate direction of subsequent management. Generally, all wetlands with cattails in their flora mimic aspects of this prairie marsh cycle. However, certain hydrologic conditions can lengthen the duration of any stage to such an extreme that no cycle is apparent...|$|R

40|$|Analyses were {{conducted}} to determine various habitat preferences for secretive marshbird species including the Virginia rail, sora, <b>least</b> and American <b>bittern</b> within the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge and the Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge. These birds are of special concern in the Refuge. The tape callback survey method was used to observe marshbird presence and numbers at 39 sites within the Refuge. The vegetative cover within study sites where relatively high numbers of wading birds were observed was then compared to the land coverage at sites that experienced below average waterbird observations. It was expected that sites that experienced high numbers of bird observations would exhibit land cover that was dominated by certain types of emergent vegetation, including Sparganium, Scirpus, and Saggitaria. The results of this analysis showed that marshbirds do indeed utilize various types of emergent vegetation for habitat. Presence of some other types of plant species {{do not seem to}} discourage marshbird habitat selection, and in some cases seems to enhance it. Some results indicate that there are specific emergent plant species, and other types of plants, whose presence are favorable for secretive marshbird habitat selection. Analyses were also conducted which shed some light on the variability and distribution of the vegetation types within the study areas, {{as well as on the}} effects of some human disturbances on waterbird habitat selection. Waterbirds do not seem to be terribly sensitive to nearby railroads, but might be somewhat sensitive to nearby urban and developed areas...|$|R
