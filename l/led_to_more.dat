5|$|As {{a result}} of timely {{warnings}} issued by the IMD, the Indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> than 150,000 people being evacuated to relief camps which {{had been set up}} on higher ground. Due to the thorough preparations, there was fewer deaths than in the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone.|$|E
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> {{accurate}} predictions about the motions of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
30|$|Increase in coral {{particle}} size {{in addition to}} enhancing the porosity (which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the <b>more</b> pore absorption) of the scaffolds, formed bigger pores in the structure that increased the PBS uptake rate from early time pints, which in turn <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the <b>more</b> and accelerated polymer absorption.|$|R

5|$|One-third of Sri Lankan Tamils {{now live}} outside Sri Lanka. While there was {{significant}} migration during the British colonial period, {{the civil war}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> than 800,000Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have left the country for destinations such as Canada, India and Europe as refugees.|$|E
5|$|The federal Ministry of External Relations and {{its local}} all-union {{affiliates}} would regularly convene {{at the federal}} Council of Ministers and its Union Republics branches to discuss the policy, duties and responsibilities of the MER. This joint gathering <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> participation from the union republics on foreign policy implementation, elaboration and coordination. This organ also discussed international problems and solved such problems in the international arena.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> stringent {{gun control}} laws in Canada. It also introduced {{changes in the}} tactical response of police to shootings, changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the Dawson College shootings.|$|E

50|$|The {{opening of}} Ring road has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> some <b>more</b> developments. There are hotels like Movenpick Hotel, ATMs, schools, and other basic amenities.|$|R
5|$|The new CSG International grew quickly. The {{convergence}} of phone, internet, on-demand movies, {{and other services}} created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> extensive use of billing services providers like CSG. Professional services and international clients, which were previously not {{a significant portion of}} revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then can expand our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.|$|E
5|$|The war-time economy {{provided}} a boom to Indiana's industry and agriculture, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> urbanization throughout the 1920s. By 1925, more workers {{were employed in}} industry than in agriculture in Indiana. Indiana's greatest industries were steel production, iron, automobiles, and railroad cars.|$|E
50|$|The {{successful}} trials with No.3441 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> five <b>more</b> being built. Apart {{from the}} prototype Loch Long all were named after Highland chieftains and grandees.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the German {{television}} network ZDF aired the first Flippers special. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> several <b>more</b> {{throughout the rest}} of the 1990s and the 21st century.|$|R

5|$|Wilkinson's Dazzle {{camouflage}} {{was accepted}} by the Admiralty, even without practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours. The dazzle camouflage strategy was adopted by other navies. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> scientific studies of colour options which might enhance camouflage effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{negative}} associations with oil among many ranchers and farmers, demand for kerosene and other petroleum derivatives drove oil prospecting in Texas after the American Civil War at known oil-producing springs and accidental finds while drilling for water. One {{of the first}} significant wells in Texas was developed {{near the town of}} Oil Springs, near Nacogdoches. The site began production in 1866. The first oilfield in Texas with a substantial economic impact was developed in 1894 near Corsicana. In 1898, the field built the state's first modern refinery. The success of the Corsicana field and increasing demand for oil worldwide <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> exploration around the state.|$|E
5|$|Francium's {{ability to}} be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its {{relatively}} simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1961, {{conferences}} {{were held}} at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful reconciliation between the secessionist factions and the central government {{in the face of}} a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, it might be possible to create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula, the chief organiser of the South Kasai state, in July hastened internal collapse.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and altimeter failed, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by foggy weather conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety. Debris from the crash covered a quarter-mile of densely wooded swampland.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may have given rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
50|$|A protest {{was held}} outside the embassy in 2013 {{following}} {{the murder of}} Cameroonian gay-rights activist Eric Lembembe. This <b>led</b> <b>to</b> several <b>more</b> protests in Cameroon, especially in the southern regions.|$|R
50|$|By 1986 {{the private}} sector was running the {{catering}} at 85 stations. Standards were improving under private ownership, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> 96 <b>more</b> stations being put under private operation in 1987.|$|R
50|$|The {{eruption}} of the Santa Ana volcano, {{located near the}} capital San Salvador, on October 1, 2005 compounded the problems, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> even <b>more</b> destructive floods and mudslides from Stan.|$|R
5|$|Several Arabians, {{mostly of}} Polish breeding, were {{captured}} from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> {{sales to the}} United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead {{with the passing of}} Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The album's initial {{recording}} {{began in}} New York, where Beyoncé invited producers and songwriters {{to live with}} her for a month. During extensive touring the following year, the album changed as she conceived of creating a visual accompaniment to its songs and resumed recording sessions with electronic producer and rock musician Boots. Their collaboration <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> sonically experimental material, which combined contemporary R with electronic and soul music. Throughout this period, the album's songs and videos were composed in strict secrecy as Beyoncé devised an unexpected release.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} scrutiny being {{imposed by}} the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> drastic measures by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.|$|E
