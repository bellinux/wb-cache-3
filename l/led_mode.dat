40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{ionizing}} radiation on static and dynamic behavior of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) was investigated numerically. First, the model of dynamic behavior before irradiation has been analyzed based on Convolution Theorem. Second, all interesting ionizing radiation sensitive factors are compared with their corresponding post irradiation factors. The convolution theorem is applied to get features of dynamic behavior. All interesting parameters have been outlined. The effect of resonance frequency and damping parameters have been studied. The results show that static and dynamic response of these devices are dramatically deteriorated due to irradiation flux. The device gradually changes its mode of operation from lasing mode to <b>LED</b> <b>mode</b> by exhibiting weak oscillation of the output and fast damping {{with the increase of}} ionizing radiation. This type of model can be used for high data bit rate in multimode optical fiber network...|$|E
40|$|Four {{quantities}} deducible {{from nuclear}} structure experiments have been claimed to correlate to the slope parameter L of the symmetry energy; the neutron skin thickness, the {{cross section of}} low-energy dipole (<b>LED)</b> <b>mode,</b> dipole polarizability α_D, and α_D S_ 0 (i. e. product of α_D and the symmetry energy S_ 0). By the calculations in the Hartree-Fock plus random-phase approximation with various effective interactions, we compare the correlations between L and these four quantities. The correlation derived from different interactions and the correlation from a class of interactions that are identical in the symmetric matter {{as well as in}} S_ 0 are simultaneously examined. These two types of correlations may behave differently, as exemplified in the correlation of α_D to L. It is found that the neutron skin thickness and α_DS_ 0 correlate well to L, and therefore are suitable for narrowing down the value of L via experiments. The LED emergence and upgrowth makes the α_DS_ 0 -L correlation strong, although these correlations are disarranged when neutron halo appears in the ground state. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} coherence of a stripe-geometry double-heterojunction GaAs/GaAlAs laser operating CW {{at room temperature}} was determined. A heterodyne detection scheme was used involving the mixing of the laser field with a frequency-shifted and time-delayed image of itself in an interferometer. Because the laser device oscillated in several longitudinal modes, the autocorrelation function of its output exhibited resonances for specific time delays. The {{rate at which the}} amplitude of these resonances decreased with increasing time delays provided a measure of an apparent coherence length associated with individual longitudinal modes. The coherence length, so defined, was found to increase linearly with drive current in excess of threshold. This observation is interpreted as evidence that the intrinsic linewidth of a longitudinal mode is inversely proportional to the coherent optical power in that mode. Apparent coherence lengths were a few centimeters for a few milliwatts of total optical power emitted per facet. For a perfectly balanced interferometer, a sharp heterodyne beat signal was also observed when the laser device was operated considerably below threshold, i. e., in the <b>LED</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} damage {{detection}} {{based on the}} propagation of guided wave in bimetal composite pipes, which can identify damage locations in both axial and circumferential directions. The feasibility of the method is showed by numerical simulations using FEM code ANSYS. Mode analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} guided wave mode and its structure, which can provide the basis of the mode selection in measurements scheme. The guided wave propagation in a damaged pipe is computed by transient analysis. 16 nodes around the pipe wall, as probes, are used to record the guided wave signal. When Pseudo Margenau—Hill distribution (PMHD) for each signal is carried out, three types of modes could be found, which are <b>led</b> <b>mode,</b> excited mode and lag mode in sequences. Based on the results, the arrival time of the excited mode could be used to locate damage in axial direction, and the energy distribution around the pipe of lag mode is consistent with the damage in circumferential direction.

40|$|A {{variety of}} ethical tourism {{initiatives}} have arisen which {{look at the}} distribution of benefits and costs arising from the movement of western tourists who are consuming places in the Global South. This paper troubles those positions. Taking {{the case of the}} rise of domestic tourism in China, the paper examines the linked patterns of ethnic and nature based tourism. Theories of how natural and cultural heritage are valued by tourists are typically derived from Western historical precedents. Notions of individualised, romantic modes of consumption of pristine nature may well be inadequate in other contexts. The paper examines the double edged role of Chinese notions of harmony of people and nature in offering new opportunities for development for poor minority groups whilst also enrolling them in 4 modes of governance that turn them into bio-cultural resources. Looking across examples drawn from Yunnan in South Western China, the paper identifies how environmental ethics are mobilised and script minority identities in 4 ways: the valorisation of geopiety, blurring nature and culture in geotourism, in quests for rural simplicity, and celebrations of place based folk culture that simultaneously render it mobile. The rise of domestic environmentally concerned tourism is shown to fit the emergence of an ecological but market <b>led</b> <b>mode</b> of governance over minority groups...|$|E

The investigation was performed on with RelyX ARC (dual-cured), Filtek Z- 350 (Nanocomposite), Filtek Z- 250 (Hybrid), and Filtek Z- 350 flow (Flowable) resin composites. The analysis used was attenuated total reflection with a Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR). The RelyX ARC resin demonstrated the highest degree of conversion with both <b>LED</b> photoactivation <b>modes.</b> For this resin a 28 % decrease in maximum rate was observed and the time to reach its highest rate was almost 2. 3 times higher than when the soft-start photoactivation light curing was used. Z- 350 flow resin recorder a higher maximum rate using the soft-start mode rather than the standard mode. In contrast, the Z- 250 showed a higher value using the standard mode. Although Z- 250 and Z- 350 showed a higher total degree of conversion effectiveness using the soft-start mode, RelyX and Z- 350 flow achieved a higher value using the standard mode.

40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} associated with using composites is polymerization shrinkage, stresses are generated at the margins, and if these stresses exceed the bond strength, microleakage occurs at the tooth restoration interface which causes ingress of cariogenic bacteria, post-operative sensitivity, and secondary caries. LED offers several curing modes: constant cure, ramped cure, and soft start cure. It is claimed that soft start polymerization mode produces less polymerization shrinkage and consequently less postoperative sensitivity.

Results And Discussion: Out of 124 restorations that were placed, only three restorations presented with postoperative sensitivity, each one being in mild, moderate, and severe categories, respectively. No relationship was seen between the sensitivity and tooth type.
