This was not rectified until an Act of Congress was passed in 1974. Even then it only affected the less than 100 officers still in service.|$|E

40|$|Major {{advances}} in preventing, delaying, or curing individual pathologies {{are responsible for}} an increasingly long life span in the developed parts of our planet, and indeed reaching eight to nine decades of life is nowadays extremely frequent. However, medical and sanitary advances have not prevented or delayed the underlying cause of the disparate pathologies occurring in the elderly: aging itself. The identification of {{the basis of the}} aging processes that drives the multiple pathologies and loss of function typical of older individuals is a major challenge in current aging research. Among the possible causes, an impairment of the immune system plays a major role, and indeed numerous studies have described immunological changes which occur with age. Far from the intention of being exhaustive, this review will focus on recent advances and views on the role that modifications of cell signalling and remodelling of the immune response play during human aging and <b>longevity,</b> <b>paying</b> particular attention to phenomena which are linked to the so called inflammaging process, such as dysregulation of innate immunity, altered T-cell or B-cell maturation and differentiation, {{as well as to the}} implications of immune aging for vaccination strategies in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|A <b>longevity</b> bond <b>pays</b> coupons {{which are}} {{proportional}} to the survival rate of a given population. In such a way the longevity risk becomes hedgeable on the financial market. In our model there are: (i) a longevity bond as a derivative on the population survival rate, (ii) a bond as a derivative on the stochastic instantaneously riskless interest rate, and (iii) a stock. The investor maximizes the expected (CRRA) utility of his intertemporal consumption. In such a framework we demonstrate {{that the amount of}} wealth invested in the longevity bond reduces the portfolio weight of the bond without affecting neither the weight of the stock nor the weight of the riskless asset. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a {{recently}} developed two-factor stochastic mortality model to estimate financial risk measures for four illustrative types of mortality-dependent financial position: investments in zero-coupon longevity bonds; investments in <b>longevity</b> bonds that <b>pay</b> annual survivor-dependent coupons; and {{two examples of}} an insurer’s annuity book that are each hedged by a longevity bond, one based on the annuity book and hedge having the same reference cohort, and the other not. The risk measures estimated are the value-at-risk, the expected shortfall and a spectral risk measure based on an exponential risk-aversion function. Results are reported on a model calibrated on data provided by the UK Government Actuary’s Department, both with and without underlying parameter uncertainty. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|On the {{authority}} of the executive order, Runkle was given retirement pay - both from the date of the Hayes order going forward and back pay to the date he was dismissed. In 1882, he made a claim for additional <b>longevity</b> <b>pay,</b> which was referred to the Court of Claims. In the Court of Claims, however, the government challenged his right to any pay at all, asserting that Hayes did {{not have the right to}} revoke the 1873 order confirming Runkle's dismissal, and demanded Runkle reimburse the government for the pay he had received following Hayes' disapproval of the court-martial decision. Runkle appealed to the Supreme Court, which found in his favor, ruling that Runkle was never legally dismissed from the army, and was entitled to his <b>longevity</b> <b>pay,</b> as well as that which he already received for his regular pay, both before and after the order of Secretary Belknap was revoked.|$|E

He prevailed in the lower court in a decision that could have affected the pay of thousands of Army officers, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision.|$|E

50|$|The statute {{allowing}} <b>longevity</b> <b>pay</b> to {{officers of}} the army, § 1262, Rev.Stat., declared {{that there should be}} allowed and paid to all officers below the rank of brigadier general ten percent of their current yearly pay for every term of five years' service, but it did not restrict the increased pay to officers in active service. The point on which the case turned was the decision of the court, that an officer of the army, though retired, was still in the service, and he was included in the very terms of the statute allowing the increased pay. The statute on which the appellant relies excludes him, by its terms, from its benefits.|$|E
50|$|The {{court also}} found that the Acts of August 3, 1861, 12 Stat. 290, and of December 21, 1861, 12 Stat. 329, were soon after their {{enactment}} construed by the President and Navy Department to include warrant officers, and under that construction it had been the uniform practice of the President to place warrant officers on the retired list, and large numbers of these officers had been so retired. No protest or objection was made by Brown during his lifetime, either to his retirement or rate of pay. The accounting officers of the Treasury had uniformly held that <b>longevity</b> <b>pay</b> to retired officers was not authorized by § 1593 of the Revised Statutes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{opinion of}} the Court, {{delivered}} by Chief Justice Waite, concludes: [...] Under these circumstances, we cannot say it positively and distinctly appears that {{the proceedings of the}} court-martial have ever in fact been approved or confirmed, in whole or in part, by the President of the United States, as the articles of war required, before the sentence could be carried into execution. Consequently, Major Runkle was never legally cashiered or dismissed from the army, and he is entitled to his <b>longevity</b> <b>pay,</b> as well as that which he has already received for his regular pay, both before the order of Secretary Belknap was revoked and afterwards.Such being our view of the case, it is unnecessary to consider any of the other questions which were referred to the Court of Claims. Neither do we decide what the precise form of an order of the President approving the proceedings and sentence of a court-martial should be, nor that his own signature must be affixed thereto. But we are clearly of opinion that it will not be sufficient unless it is authenticated in a way to show otherwise than argumentatively that it {{is the result of the}} judgment of the President himself, and that it is not a mere departmental order which might or might not have attracted his personal attention. The fact that the order was his own should not be left to inference only.The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.|$|E
40|$|Large {{national}} micro-data bases (such as Current Population Survey and Survey of Income and Programme Participation) lack {{information on}} employer outlays for the fringe benefits paid workers. Therefore, this paper motivates research on intra-firm black-white differences in non-wage fringe benefits using data on female office workers {{of a large}} public university. Empirical results indicate that racial differences exist among the fringes (pension, health and life insurance, sick leave, <b>longevity</b> <b>pay,</b> vacation) and also vary across department sizes. The differentials tend to disappear, however, when combined benefits or total compensation {{is used as a}} modelling framework. These results suggest potential sensitivity of regression model estimates, of black-white benefit gaps to the degree of aggregation in the data being modelled. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} analyzed prior enlisted Marine Officer Retention {{and their}} relationship to military paycaps. An analysis of the data showed that retention behavior of prior-enlisted Marine Officers differs from non-prior Marine Officers. Prior-enlisted Marine Officers are more likely to remain on active duty after their initial service obligation and serve a full career in the Marine Corps than Marine Officers with no previous military experience. Prior-enlisted service has a positive effect on retention to 20 YOS. A Marine Officer with sufficient time in service stops receiving <b>longevity</b> <b>pay,</b> and experiences the phenomenon known as pay compression. The lack of pay raises for six years or longer may be a disincentive to continued service, although prior-enlisted Marine Officers have higher retention rates than non-priors at every stage of their careers. The results of this study suggests that Mustang or prior-enlisted Marine Officers with at least 8 years of prior service retire at a higher rate than regular officers after 20 YOS.
