50|$|Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was {{bailed out}} by a {{consortium}} of 14 banks in 1998 after being caught in a cash-flow crisis when economic shocks resulted in excessive mark-to-market losses and margin calls. The fund suffered {{from a combination of}} funding and asset liquidity. Asset liquidity arose from LTCM failure to account for liquidity becoming more valuable (as it did following the crisis). Since much of its balance sheet was exposed to <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> <b>premium</b> its short positions would increase in price relative to its long positions. This was essentially a massive, unhedged exposure to a single risk factor. LTCM had been aware of funding liquidity risk. Indeed, they estimated that in times of severe stress, cuts on AAA-rated commercial mortgages would increase from 2% to 10%, and similarly for other securitiles. In response to this, LTCM had negotiated long-term financing with margins fixed for several weeks on many of their collateralized loans. Due to an escalating liquidity spiral, LTCM could ultimately not fund its positions in spite of its numerous measures to control funding risk.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, a {{liquidity}} premium is {{the explanation for}} a difference between two types of financial securities (e.g. stocks), that have all the same qualities except liquidity. It is a segment of a three-part theory that works to explain the behavior of yield curves for interest rates. The upwards-curving component of the interest yield {{can be explained by}} the {{liquidity premium}}. The reason behind this is that short term securities are less risky compared to long term rates due to the difference in maturity dates.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of liquidity, default and {{personal}} taxes on the relative yields of Treasuries and municipals using a generalized model with <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> The municipal yield model includes liquidity as a state factor. Using a unique transaction dataset, we estimate the <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> of municipals and its effect on bond yields. Empirical evidence shows that municipal bond yields are strongly affected by all three factors. The effects of default and <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> on municipal yields increase with maturity and credit <b>risk.</b> <b>Liquidity</b> <b>premium</b> accounts for about 9 - 13 % of municipal yields for AAA bonds, 9 - 15 % for AA/A bonds and 8 - 19 % for BBB bonds.
