Much of this was reportedly done by those who had already worked stripping and burning buildings for pay: the ashes of burned down properties could be sifted for salable scrap metal. Other fires were caused by unsafe electrical wiring, fires set indoors for heating, and random vandalism associated with the general crime situation. Flawed HUD and city policies also encouraged local South Bronx residents to burn down their own buildings. Under the regulations, Section 8 tenants who were burned out of their current housing were granted immediate priority status for another apartment, potentially in a {{better part of the}} city. After the establishment of the (then) state-of-the-art Co-op City, there was a spike in fires as tenants began burning down their Section 8 housing in an attempt to jump {{to the front of the}} 2- to 3-year-long waiting list for the new units. HUD regulations also authorized <b>lump-sum</b> <b>aid</b> payments of up to $1000 to those who could prove they had lost property due to a fire in their Section 8 housing; although these payments were supposed to be investigated for fraud by a HUD employee before being signed off on, very little investigation was done and some HUD employees and social services workers were accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious fires or even advising tenants on the best way to take advantage of the HUD policies. On multiple occasions, firefighters were reported to have shown up to tenement fires only to find all the residents at an address waiting calmly with their possessions already on the curb.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{empirical}} studies of bureaucratic power have employed testing procedures that are sensitive only to complete bureaucratic power {{in which the}} bureaucrat is able to force an all or nothing choice on his legislative sponsor. This paper suggests a test for incomplete bureaucratic power in which micro-based, survey estimates of the cost elasticity of demand and marginal propensity to spend out of <b>lump-sum</b> <b>aid</b> are compared with estimates of these same parameters taken from governmental expenditure studies. Empirical tests with 205 non-SMSA school districts in Michigan yield results {{that are consistent with}} incomplete bureaucratic power. Copyright 1991 by MIT Press. ...|$|E
40|$|The flypaper effect {{results when}} a dollar of {{exogenous}} grants-in-aid leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: Money sticks where it hits. Viewing governments as agents for a representative citizen voter, this empirical {{result is an}} anomaly. Four alternative explanations have been offered. First, it's a data problem; matching grants have been mis-classified as exogenous aid. Second, it's an econometric problem; exogenous aid is correlated with omitted variables leading to a downward bias in estimates of income's effects and an upward bias in estimates of aid's effects. Third, it's a specification problem: the representative citizen either fails to observe <b>lump-sum</b> <b>aid,</b> or sees aid but mis-perceives its impact as an average price effect, or finally, sees and understands aid's budgetary effects but allocates "public" and "private" monies through separate "mental accounts. " The empirical evidence suggests none of these explanations is sufficient. A fourth explanation seems most promising: It's politics. Rather than an anomaly, the flypaper effect is best seen as an outcome of political institutions and the associated incentives of elected officials. ...|$|E
