40|$|Today {{there exist}} lots of options {{on how to}} control an {{electric}} circuit without touching it. An example could be a motion controlled lightswitch. Simple solutions often consist of a motion, light or sound sensor which are used to activate an object, usually by controlling an electronic switch of some sort. However, {{if there is a}} higher demand for security or proof that the correct person is activating the controlled object then something more is needed. A solution to separate individuals from each other is needed for this. Bluetooth is a wireless communications standard that can solve this. Bluetooth units include an unique identification number {{that can be used to}} identify a specific bluetooth unit. This thesis defines a Bluetooth identifier framework (BTIF), which is a framework for creating an energy efficient controller to handle the interface between an individual and an controlled object. BTIF will then be used to create an prototype where the bluetooth identification number from an mobile phone will be used to activate a <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diod.</b> Validerat; 20120804 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Interviews with {{board members}} and surveys of {{residents}} in a Swedish housing cooperative revealed that their choice to partly reject new energy-efficient outdoor lighting for their outdoor environment (retrofit with <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diods)</b> was motivated by multiple goal frames. The board weighed the normative goal of perceived safety and the subordinate hedonic goal of the perceived quality of the light against gain goals.

40|$|In {{our homes}} we enjoy {{daylight}} reaching the rooms through the windows, and artificial lighting {{when there is}} not enough daylight available. Electrical lighting has been used in Western homes since the late 1910 s. We have experienced the technical development from warm incandescent light bulbs to energy-efficient <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diods</b> (LED). In Sweden we lack daylight in winter and have a lot of daylight in summer. Thanks to candle light and artificial light we endure the dark months of the year. Research has shown that light is not only about seeing. Light affects circadian rhythm. Humans have an internal body clock. The average internal clock time is slightly longer than the solar day, about 24 hours and 15 minutes. The body-clock has to be reset to 24 hours each day and that is why light is so important. Light sets the body-clock by blocking the sleeping-hormone melatonin. Timing the body-clock with the 24 -hour solar day is essential for our wellbeing. The Swedish Healthy Home-program (SHH) is an on-going research project, and the aim is to improve health and promote sleep-quality through lighting as well as save energy. The projects within the over-all program are mainly funded by the Swedish Energy Agency (SEA). The research is conducted by Lighting Research Institute (LRC), at the Rensselaer Polytechnic School of Architecture, Troy, NY, Environmental Psychology at Lund University, and Stress Research Institute at Stockholm University. The SHH-program is part of my doctoral work in Environmental Psychology. My topic is wellbeing connected to light-dark cycles and sleep-wake patterns.

40|$|Recently, organic {{semiconductors}} {{have found}} wide application {{in the preparation}} of such devices like organic <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> <b>diods</b> (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). For the achievement of high device performance, such factors as chemical and thermal stability and durability, charge transport, light absorption, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, appropriate energy levels and suitable morphological properties, should be taken into account in the development of organic semiconductors. Consequently, deep understanding of the electronic structure along with the resulting properties of the materials is necessary for the manufacturing of efficient devices and the design of new compounds. Bipolar compounds employing fluorene, carbazole, triphenylamine donors and triazine, triphenylbenzene, fluorenone, benzonitrile and naphthalenetetracarboxilic acid dianhydride derivatives as acceptors, were thoroughly investigated in recent years. Easy functionalization and variation of conjugation strength leads thus to the great diversity of structures. Miscellanious conjunctions of the above mentioned fragments give rise to the bipolar molecules {{with a wide range of}} necessary characteristics. The aim of this work was design, synthesis and thorough investigation of properties of the new bipolar compounds for the application in optoelectronics. Comparison of practically obtained characteristics with the theoretically predicted ones and estimation of the applicability of new compounds in optoelectronic device was the other goal of the study. The following objectives were raised for the achievement of the aim of the thesis: •	Synthesis and investigation of the impact of linking topology on the properties of bipolar star-shaped derivatives of 2, 4, 6 -triphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine and 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene. •	Synthesis and investigation of properties of the boomerang-shaped compounds containing bicarbazolyl moieties. •	Design, synthesis, investigation of properties and estimation of the emission behaviour peculiarities of the multichromophore fluorenone-based compounds. •	Design, synthesis and comparison of theoretical and practical characteristics of the differently carbazolyl and cyano-substituted 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene derivatives. •	Synthesis and characterization of electron-transporting 1, 4, 5, 8 -naphthalenetetracarboxilic dianhydride derivatives; estimation of the performance in bulk-heterojunction solar cells. In current work the design, synthesis and investigation of properties by the joint theoretical and experimental approach of bipolar branched and electron-accepting brick-type compounds is presented. Star-shaped derivatives of 2, 4, 6 -triphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine and 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene, linked to fluorenyl arms by various linkages, were found to <b>emit</b> <b>light</b> in blue region with high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (up to 0. 7) and demonstrate high thermal stability (decomposition temperature reaching 434 oC) and high hole mobility. The highest hole mobility was displayed by the compounds utilizing ethenyl linking bridge. Intense blue emission with photoluminescence quantum yields reaching 0. 93 and triplet energies ranging from 2. 44 to 2. 68 eV, as well as moderately low ionization potential values (5. 45 - 5. 50 eV) were detected for the boomerang-shaped compounds with various central units and bicarbazolyl side arms. Bicarbazolyl group proved to be a stronger donor than single carbazole fragment, providing lower ionization potential and superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Donor-acceptor multichromophore fluorenone-based compounds demonstrated superior values of decomposition (up to 500 oC) and glass transition temperature (up to 293 oC), ambipolar charge transport behavior. High photoluminescence quantum yields (up to 0. 90) in non-polar media and aggregation induced emission enhancement were observed for these compounds as well. On the basis of experimental and theoretical results a mechanism of emission in the investigated materials was suggested. The orientation of substituents was found to affect greatly the properties of the bipolar 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene-based compounds, utilizing carbazolyl donor and nitrile acceptor. Para-conjugation resulted in higher decomposition and glass transition temperatures, lower ionization potential, exclusively hole transport and appearance of delayed fluorescence; the compounds with meta-linkage displayed ambipolar charge transport and higher triplet energies. A derivative with exclusively para-conjugation displayed high performance in OLED as a blue fluorescent emitter, while a compound with meta-linkages proved to be a successful host matrix in combination with a para-substituted guest. Two series of symmetrical and asymmetrical electron transport materials based on 1, 4, 5, 8 -naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride demonstrated high thermal stability (decomposition temperature in the range 413 – 507 oC), proving that the materials are suitable for vacuum processed organic solar cells, as well as high conductivity (up to 4 · 10 5 S cm- 1) and electron mobility (up to 10 - 3 cm² Vs- 1) and high electron affinity values (3. 84 - 4. 15 eV). The most promising asymmetric compound, tested in solar cell, showed a power conversion efficiency of 7. 9 %...|$|R

Flat enamel surfaces of 50 segments of teeth were prepared. 50 cylindrical composite resin specimens were bonded to the prepared teeth segments. Specimens were divided into 5 groups, three groups were cured for 10, 20 and 40 seconds using blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode and 2 groups were cured for 20 and 40 seconds using halogen light. Specimens were submitted to micro-shear bond test at 1 mm / min cross-head speed. Mean micro-shear bond strengths were analyzed by analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) and Tukey's test at P< 0. 05. At 40 seconds curing, the halogen light produced significantly higher bond strength than that of blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode. No significant difference was found between both lights at 20 seconds. There were no significant differences in bond strength ratios between 10 and 20 seconds blue <b>light</b> <b>emitting</b> diode, and 20 seconds halogen light.
