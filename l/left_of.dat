5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or to the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> {{it is said to}} be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|As a {{publicity}} stunt {{for the opening of}} The Simpsons Movie on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was outlined in water-based biodegradable paint to the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the Cerne Abbas giant.

50|$|Let R be a (possibly not unital) ring. Any {{intersection}} of any nonempty family <b>of</b> <b>left</b> ideals <b>of</b> R is again a <b>left</b> ideal <b>of</b> R.

40|$|For any left orderable group G, we recall {{from work}} of McCleary that {{isolated}} {{points in the}} space <b>of</b> <b>left</b> orderings correspond to basic elements in the free lattice ordered group over G. We then establish a new connection between the kernels of certain maps in the free lattice ordered group over G, and the topology on the space <b>of</b> <b>left</b> orderings <b>of</b> G. This connection yields a simple proof that no left orderable group has countably infinitely many left orderings. When we take G to be the free group of rank n, this connection sheds {{new light on the}} space <b>of</b> <b>left</b> orderings <b>of</b> the free group: by applying a result of Kopytov, we show that there exists a <b>left</b> ordering <b>of</b> the free group whose orbit is dense in the space <b>of</b> <b>left</b> orderings. From this, we obtain a new proof that the space <b>of</b> <b>left</b> orderings <b>of</b> a free group contains no isolated points. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
