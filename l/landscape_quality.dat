We employed a Free Choice Profiling (FCP) methodology, in which observers generated their own descriptive terminologies and then used these to quantify perceived <b>landscape</b> <b>qualities</b> on visual analogue scales. Data were analysed using Generalised Procrustes Analysis, a multivariate statistical technique that does not rely on fixed variables to identify underlying dimensions of assessment. The three observer groups each showed significant agreement, and generated two main consensus dimensions that suggested landscape 'health' and 'development in time' as common perceived themes of landscape expressivity. We critically discuss these outcomes in context of the landscape assessment literature, and suggest ways forward for further development and research...|$|R

50|$|<b>Landscape</b> <b>quality</b> can be {{assessed}} {{in connection with a}} specific development which will affect the landscape. Such assessment requires that a professional submit a development proposal. This approach to complete an assessment serves to identify the potential effects on landscape values brought forth by a certain proposal. The specific proposal is analyzed to evaluate the effects it may have on the landscape or character of the landscape, as well as the proposal's effect on the composition of available views. In a proposal-driven assessment, the area involved should include the site of the project as well as its immediate surroundings. This assessment should produce a detailed description of any physical changes to the landscape as well as a description and analysis of the effect these changes will have. This process should evaluate the importance of character, landscape, and visual amenity. Ultimately, this approach is effective if, and only when measures that can mitigate the effect of a given development proposal are identified.|$|E
50|$|Landscape {{assessment}} is a sub-category of {{environmental impact assessment}} (EIA) concerned with quality assessment of the landscape. <b>Landscape</b> <b>quality</b> is assessed either {{as part of a}} strategic planning process or in connection with a specific development which will affect the landscape. These methods are sub-divided into area-based assessments or proposal-driven assessments, respectively. The term 'landscape assessment' can be used to mean either visual assessment or character assessment. Since landscape assessments are intended to help with the conservation and enhancement of environmental goods, it is usually necessary to have a fully geographical landscape assessment as a stage in the process of EIA and landscape planning. During the initial phases of a project, such as site selection and design concept, the landscape architect begins to identify areas of opportunity or setbacks that may provide constraints. The architect prepares alternative options in order to compare their assessments and identifies the proposal's which allow for the least adverse effects on the landscape or views. A landscape professional works with a design team to review potential effects as the team develops a sustainable proposal. Upon developing a design proposal, the landscape professional will identify and describe the landscape and visual effects that may occur and suggest mitigation measures to be taken in order to reduce negative effects and maximize benefits, if any.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} quantitative indices for the automatic evaluation and classification of <b>landscape</b> scenic <b>quality</b> using digital ground photographs. Research efforts to date are scarce on automated extraction of qualitative information based on photographs and therefore this study contributes in this respect, i. e. the automated quantification of <b>landscape</b> scenic <b>quality.</b> Based on the texture indices that {{are commonly used}} in landscape ecology, nine quantitative indices are selected to describe the fragmentation {{and complexity of the}} landscape, and the results from the application of these indices to a sample of ground photographs are described in this paper. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of the indices selected with respect to the classification of the <b>landscape's</b> scenic <b>quality,</b> while the results are compared to the results derived from a research programme of the National Technical University of Athens. Also, as research experience has shown that texture indices are affected by data resolution, this paper investigates the influence of this factor in the calculation of the quantitative indices that are applied in digital ground photographs. Comments and suggestions for further investigation are presented. The main conclusion of the investigation is that the texture measurement indices are sensitised in the <b>landscape's</b> scenic <b>quality,</b> a fact that is positive and encouraging enough in order to pursue further research. © 2006 WIT Press...|$|R

This involves, firstly, the acquisition of data covering the delineation of landscape character regions for the State, photography of these landscapes, derivation {{of a set of}} representative slides, and rating of these by groups of participants. 	 Secondly, these preference ratings are comprehensively analysed {{on the basis of the}} attributes of the scenes covering land form, land cover, land use, water bodies, naturalism, diversity and colour. 	 Thirdly, the results are applied as follows: 1. a map of <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> of South Australia is derived 2. the results are used to predict the effect that changes in land use (e. g. clearance of trees) will have on <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> 3. the theoretical constructs of <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> are evaluated on the basis of the preference ratings 4. a protocol is detailed to guide the undertaking of large - scale <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> assessment.

40|$|The public’s {{demand for}} more and better forest landscapes is {{increasing}} as scenic forest tours flourish in China, especially in the capital, Beijing. How {{to improve the quality}} of scenic forests has become one of the greatest concerns of urban foresters. Although numerous studies have focused on scenic forest management, to date, no reports have been found on developing a quality assessment index system for scenic forest assessment. In this study, a simple and scientific index system was established using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to quantitatively assess scenic forest quality. The index system is composed of four scales: individual tree <b>landscape</b> <b>quality,</b> in-forest <b>landscape</b> <b>quality,</b> near-view forest <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> and far-view <b>landscape</b> <b>quality.</b> The in-forest <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> was determined by horizontal and vertical stand structures, species composition and under-canopy landscape traits. Near-view forest <b>landscape</b> <b>quality</b> was mainly determined by patch characteristics, seasonal change, visibility, color change of patches and stand age class. To test the validity of our quality assessment index system, scenic forests in Xishan were used as a case study. The results show that near-view forest landscape was the most important scale for the overall quality of the scenic forest, according to the priorities of the criterion layer, and the second most important scale was far-view forest landscape. Seasonal change, patch color contrast, patch distribution and patch shape accounted for 52. 2 % of the total of 13 indices in the near-view forest landscape. The integrated quality of scenic forests in Xishan was at an average level, and the in-forest landscape, near-view landscape and far-view landscape had below average quality...|$|E

30|$|The herders’ {{concept of}} {{rangeland}} quality was {{closely related to}} livestock productivity response. Livestock which graze on <b>landscapes</b> with high <b>quality</b> of forage resources are expected to increase milk production, exhibit good health, high mating frequency and more successful calving or kidding rates. The texture of animal dung and hair condition are also used by the herders to determine the quality of forages on different landscapes. Livestock grazed on good <b>quality</b> <b>landscapes</b> have smooth body hair but when grazed on poor <b>quality</b> <b>landscapes</b> they display rough body hair. Herders believe that livestock instinctively assessed {{the condition of the}} rangeland and adjust their behaviour accordingly. The livestock would refuse to graze on landscapes that have poor forage quality. The rangeland quality indicators are gauged from livestock productivity performance observed at <b>landscape</b> level.
