40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} consumer {{acceptance of a}} <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop versus the existing polystyrene (PS) scoop as a dosing device for synthetic powder laundry detergents. Specifically: (1) Were the consumers aware of and {{in agreement with the}} environmental benefits of a <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop versus the current plastic scoop? (2) Did consumers consider a <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring scoop? The implementation of a <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop would reduce packaging waste by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of virgin fibres and internal waste sources. The 10 % virgin fibres and internal sources was used to help increase the board strength and improve printability. The TAPPI (1989) test methods were used in the selection of the paperboard grades in meeting the performance requirements of the paper scoop application. The results of the home performance test indicated that a <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> measuring scoop was not an acceptable replacement for the plastic measuring scoop. Although there were positive ratings on the <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> scoop, they related to generalities and environmental preference. The <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> measuring scoop cannot substitute several aspects of the plastic scoop, specifically, the technical functionality, durability, rigidity and utility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{analysed}} application status and reasons of <b>recycled</b> <b>paper,</b> researched physical properties, mechanical properties, optical properties, chemical properties and printing adaptability of <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> and tested the important indexes. The test data was compared with ordinary offset paper {{and there is}} little difference. The result shows <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> can be wildly used for offices, book, <b>paper</b> toys etc. <b>Recycled</b> <b>paper</b> is made from waste paper through a variety of processes, such as smashing, decolorizing and pulping. 80 % of its raw material originate from the recycling of waste paper, thus known as environmentally friendly paper of low energy consumption and light pollution. Papermaking with waste paper has been proved to saving energy, saving water and low cost. one ton of waste paper can be turned into 850 kilograms of good paper, which are compared with chemical pulping for papermaking, it can economizer 1. 2 tons of coal, 600 degrees of electricity, 100 m 3 of water and 300 kg of chemical raw materials. Moreover, it can reduct 35 % of water pollution and 75 % of air pollution, and save wood and 3 m 3 of landfill spac...|$|R
40|$|Rice straw {{cellulosic}} ethanol fermentation waste (CEFW) {{and municipal}} solid waste derived fiber (MSWF) were used as alternative fibers for <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> making. The fibers were mixed with old newspaper (ONP) fiber at different mass ratios to produce standard <b>recycled</b> <b>papers</b> and paperboards. A “green” adhesive binder derived from kraft black liquor (BLDB) was used to improve the physical properties of the waste-derived paper products. The values of these properties increased linearly with increasing average fiber lengths, regardless {{of the type of}} fiber used in the products. BLDB improved the physical properties of the products by 50 % for papers and 85 % for paperboards, and the performance of this binder was comparable to a commercial urea formaldehyde resin binder. Thermal pressing, however, did not improve the physical properties of the binder-enhanced paper products. With the addition of the adhesive binder, CEFW and MSWF showed reasonable substitution potential for ONP fiber by providing suitable tensile and bursting strength in the <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> products. The critical fiber length, which produced the minimum strength properties for the <b>recycled</b> <b>paper</b> products, was approximately 1020 µm.
