5|$|Phallus hadriani is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and thus}} obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter. In North America, {{it is commonly}} associated with tree stumps, or roots of stumps that are decomposing in the ground. In Great Britain, its distribution {{is more or less}} restricted to coastal dunes, while in Poland, it has been noted to avoid humid and humic forest soils, and live in symbiosis with xerophilous grasses and the black <b>locust</b> <b>tree,</b> Robinia pseudoacacia. The mushroom is one of three species protected by the Red Data Book of Latvia.|$|E
2500|$|For {{at least}} the last decade, it had become {{tradition}} for students and visitors to stick pieces of chewed gum to a honey <b>locust</b> <b>tree</b> located between Emens Parking Garage and Pruis Hall.

2500|$|She {{was built}} as a {{single-screw}} steam-powered topsail schooner by Oregon Iron Works at Albina (Portland) Oregon in 1876 [...] and commissioned at San Francisco in 1877. She was constructed of fir and [...] "fastened with copper, galvanized iron, and <b>locust</b> <b>tree</b> nails". [...] Her appearance was typical of revenue cutters of the period, flush-decked (or nearly so) with clipper bow, fantail stern, two sail-bearing masts, pilot house and funnel amidships and a deckhouse (probably including the upper parts of the engine and boiler rooms) beneath and extending behind the pilot house. The boiler powering the propulsion machinery was of the Scotch marine boiler type {{and was the first}} instance of that type of boiler on a Revenue Cutter Service vessel. The addition of steam jackets on the cylinders to reduce condensation losses was another innovation new to the service. [...] Her cost and displacement were somewhat greater than the Dexter-class (1874) cutters of similar length and overall design.|$|E

2500|$|When he was 22 years old, Muir {{enrolled}} at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, paying his own way for several years. There, under a towering black <b>locust</b> <b>tree</b> beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson. A fellow student plucked a flower from the tree {{and used it to}} explain how the grand locust {{is a member of the}} pea family, related to the straggling pea plant. Fifty years later, the naturalist Muir described the day in his autobiography. [...] "This fine lesson charmed me and sent me flying to the woods and meadows in wild enthusiasm." [...] As a freshman, Muir studied chemistry with Professor Ezra Carr and his wife Jeanne; they became lifelong friends and Muir developed a lasting interest in chemistry and the sciences. Muir took an eclectic approach to his studies, attending classes for two years but never being listed higher than a first-year student due to his unusual selection of courses. Records showed his class status as [...] "irregular gent" [...] and, even though he never graduated, he learned enough geology and botany to inform his later wanderings.|$|E

As she sat there, shaded by a great <b>locust</b> <b>tree,</b> which had dropped so many yellow leaves upon the grass, that, now and then, it could not help letting a little fleck of sunshine come down upon her, sometimes gilding for a moment her light-brown hair, sometimes touching {{the end of a}} crimson ribbon she wore, and again resting for a brief space on the toe of a very small boot just visible at the edge of her dress, Lawrence looked at her, and said to himself: [...] "Is it possible that this is the rather pale young girl in black, who gave me change from behind the desk of Mr Candy's Information Shop? I don't believe it. That young person sprang up, temporarily, and is defunct. This is some one else." ...|$|E
