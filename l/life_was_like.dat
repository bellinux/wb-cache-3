25|$|Princess Nagako {{was born}} in Tokyo, Japan, {{into one of the}} Ōke {{branches}} of the Imperial House of Japan, which are eligible to provide an heir to the throne of Japan (by adoption). She was therefore a Princess by birth, as the daughter of Kuniyoshi, Prince Kuni (1873–1929) by his consort, Chikako (1879–1956). While her father was a scion of the Imperial family itself, her mother descended from daimyōs, the feudal or military aristocracy. Nagako would become one of the last Japanese who could remember what <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> inside the Japanese aristocracy in the years before the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the resort}} homes and {{buildings}} from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The Croll Building, {{on the corner of}} Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautifully preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.|$|E

The book contained Du Bois's feminist essay, [...] "The Damnation of Women", which was a tribute to the dignity and worth of women, particularly black women.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more {{critical}} review, describing the opening as [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and early {{events in the}} novel as [...] "soap-opera-ish". Despite these objections, she concluded, [...] "Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will.

500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E

I argue {{that many of these}} claims—by both sides—are not well-founded. We have no sufficiently clear sense of what a minimally good <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> It <b>is</b> a result of this that the repugnant conclusion doesn’t license us in drawing any interesting conclusions...|$|R
