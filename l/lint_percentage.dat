50|$|The {{main focus}} of the {{scientists}} of Breeding and Genetics Section, CCRI, Multan is to develop and commercialize Bt. and non-Bt. new cotton varieties with inbuilt resistance/tolerance against the biotic and abiotic stresses along with desirable fibre traits. Development of germplasm has {{a key role in}} the process of variety development. This section holds its own recognition in this aspect. Two Bt. varieties Bt. CIM-600, Bt. CIM-616 and one non Bt. Variety CIM-612 were submitted for approval to Expert Sub-Committee. Six advanced Bt. strains were evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain Bt.CIM-616 gave best performance at both the locations. The strain had the <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> of 41.7 with the staple length of 28.8 mm and micronaire of 4.7 µg inch-1. The fibre strength of the strain is very good up to 100.3 tppsi. Seven advanced non-Bt. strains were also evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain CIM-716 produced the highest seed cotton yield on overall basis. All these strains have the desirable fibre characteristics. The crosses with exotic material (AS-0349) from France and Mac-7 for induction of CLCuD resistant/tolerance are in different filial generations.|$|E

To investigate the genetic architecture of <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> a diversity panel consisting of 355 upland cotton accessions was grown, and the <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> was measured in four different environments. Genotyping was performed with specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> were detected via a genome-wide association study (GWAS), in which five SNP loci distributed on chromosomes At 3 (A 02) and At 4 (A 08) and contained two major-effect QTLs, which were detected in the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) and {{in more than three}} environments simultaneously. Furthermore, favorable haplotypes (FHs) of two major-effect QTLs and 47 putative candidate genes in the two linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks of these associated loci were identified. The expression levels of these putative candidate genes were estimated using RNA-seq data from ten upland cotton tissues. We found that Gh_A 02 G 1268 was very highly expressed during the early fiber development stage, whereas the gene was poorly expressed in the seed. These results implied that Gh_A 02 G 1268 may determine the <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> by regulating seed and fiber development. The favorable QTL alleles and candidate genes for <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> identified in this study will have high potential for improving lint yield in future Chinese cotton breeding programs...|$|E

40|$|Six {{quantitative}} traits {{were studied}} by analyzing F 1 data {{derived from a}} 6 x 6 diallel cross. Two traits i. e., yield of seed cotton and number of bolls per plant showed complete adequacy of additive dominance model. Two characters <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and seed index partially passed the assumption for diallel analysis. Both additive and dominance (non-additive) variations were observed in the diallel cross population for yield of seed cotton per plant, boll numbers per plant, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and seed index. The magnitude of non-additive genetic components were greater than additive for yield of seed cotton per plant and seed index, whereas the value of additive genetic components were higher than dominance for boll numbers per plant. The substantial contribution to dominance was due to heterogeneity of loci for the four traits analysed in this experiment. The recessive alleles were in excess in the parents for yield of seed cotton per plant, number of bolls per plant, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and seed index. The operation of over-dominance was estimated for yield of seed cotton per plant and seed index whereas partial dominance was observed for boll number per plant. The <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> possessed complete dominance in this set of diallel cross. The ratio {{of positive and negative}} alleles at the loci exhibiting dominance were in equal proportion in these parents for yield of seed cotton per plant and number of bolls per plant whereas asymmetrical distribution of negative and positive alleles among the parents was suggested for <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and seed index.

In 2008 - 2009 in thе Field Crops Institute in Chirpan (Bulgaria) and Agricultural Faculty in Strumica to the Univercity “Goce Delchev” in Stip (Macedonia) field trials were carried out according to the adopted cotton growing technology in each country. The varieties were evaluated {{on the grounds of}} the obtained data for the most important economic traits. It was found that during the years of study in Bulgaria and in Macedonia, there was sufficient temperature sum and insufficient rainfall supply for cotton development. The region of Strumica was comparatively arid than that of Chir-pan, but the longer growing season allowed the use of rainfall during the months of August and September, and seed cotton yield was almost twice higher. Of the studied factors (varieties, regions and years) the regions had the biggest share in the total variation of the seed cotton yield (73. 2 %) and boll weight, while the varieties had the biggest share in the total variation of fiber length and <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> (44. 5 % and 44. 4 %, respectively). The effect of years was significant only for boll weight and fiber length. In Strumica the varieties differed more strongly in seed cotton yield and fiber <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and more slightly in fiber length. Based on the average two-year data, for the conditions of Bulgaria, the varieties Darmi, Helius and Natalia proved to be the best and in seed cotton yield (2233 kg. ha- 1) exceeded the standard variety Chirpan- 539 by 16 to 62 g. kg- 1. Darmi and Natalia varieties surpassed the standard in fiber length by 1. 1 - 1. 9 mm, but were inferior to it in <b>lint</b> <b>percentage.</b> Under the conditions of Chirpan the Macedonian variety 5140 was inferior to the standard in seed cotton yield (by 48 g. kg- 1) and in <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> (by 2. 6 %). For the conditions of Strumica - Macedonia the Bulgarian varieties Helius, Natalia and Vega were found to be the best. The variety Helius in seed cotton yield significantly exceeded the standard (by 277 g. kg- 1) and the Macedonian variety 5140.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Current {{study was}} carried out to study plant {{material}} for good quality and high yielding cotton vari-eties. For this purpose combining ability effects were calculated for different plant traits related to yield and quality in upland cotton. The present study revealed the potential of different varieties for breeding programme. All six parents i. e. FH- 945, MNH- 93, MNH- 129, CIM- 496, CIM- 446 and NIAB- 78 displayed their prospective general and specific combining abilities for various characters except boll weight and fiber strength. CIM- 496 proved the best general combiner for number of boll per plant, seed cotton yield, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> fiber length and fiber fineness while MNH- 129 followed closely. The hybrid CIM- 496 × NIAB- 78 displayed diligent specific combining ability for number of bolls per plant, CIM- 496 × NIAB- 78 for seed cotton yield, MNH- 129 × CIM- 446 for <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and CIM- 496 × CIM- 446 for fiber length. Some of the hybrids involved one parent with good and one with poor general combining ability e. g., CIM- 446 × NIAB- 78 for number of bolls per plant, CIM- 446 × NIAB- 78 for seed cotton yield, MNH- 93 × NIAB- 78 for <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and MNH- 93 × CIM- 446 for fiber length.

Some studies report that insect pests attack on genotypes/cultivars with the traits, frego bracts, okra leaf, and red leaf color is comparatively lower. The genotypes/cultivars with these traits were planted and separated by fine netting to assess insect {{pest infestation}} in comparison to commercial cultivars. The Gossypium arboreum cultivar, FH- 170 had minimum number of population buildup of sucking and chewing insect pests. Among hirsutum genotypes/cultivars, minimum population buildup of thrips, mites, spotted bollworm and American bollworm was found on Gumbo Okra. Minimum aphid was recorded on Russian Red. PBG-Fb- 5 showed the most resistant response against pink bollworm. Population buildup of thrips, mites and aphid was relatively higher under water deficit conditions compared to well watered conditions whereas, population buildup of jassid, and white fly was higher under well watered conditions but was non-significant. Populations of parents, F 1 and segregation pattern of F 2 and backcross populations of crosses involving okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf traits showed that the traits were monogenic, okra leaf type and red leaf color being incompletely dominant and frego bract as recessive trait. Gene action of agronomic traits (plant height, number of bolls, number of monopodial branches, number of sympodial branches, boll weight, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> seed index, fiber fineness, fiber strength, and fiber length) in the crosses involving okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color were different. Heritability estimates for different agronomic traits in the crosses of okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color varied from 0. 26 to 0. 95. These results showed {{the interaction of the}} insect resistant traits with agronomic traits. Correlation of the traits, okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color with agronomic traits showed that okra leaf positively correlated with sympodial branches, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> fiber fineness (measurement scale has inverse relationship with fiber fineness) and fiber length whereas, negative correlation of okra leaf was observed with plant height and seed index. Frego bract had negative correlation with boll weight and <b>lint</b> <b>percentage.</b> Red leaf color had positive association with <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and negative correlation with number of bolls and sympodial branches and fiber strength. Negative correlation of these insect resistant traits with some desirable agronomic traits reveal that very large F 2 population would be required to find insect resistant recombinants with desirable agronomic attributes. The correlations among agronomic traits in the crosses involving different insect resistant traits were different which suggest that while incorporating each insect resistant trait into a strain, a different breeding strategy will have to be followed.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} {{of this study was}} to estimate gene action and the type of inheritance of investigated traits in cotton. Another objective was to evaluate general combining ability of parents and special combining ability of F 1 diallel crosses and to select the superior F 1 s that can be used in future breeding programs of cotton. Additive and dominant components were found significant for investigated traits. Number of bolls and lint percentages were effective in the control of additive type of gene action with partial dominance, but seed-cotton yield was also effective in the control of additive type of gene action with over-dominance. Greater parents were ‘Paum- 15 ’ and ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ for the number of bolls and the seed-cotton yield; ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ and ‘Nazilli- 84 S’ for the <b>lint</b> <b>percentage.</b> Greater cross combinations were ‘Paum- 15 ’ x ‘Stoneville- 453 ’; ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Nazilli- 84 S’; ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Fantom’; ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Delcerro’ and ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Giza- 45 ’ diallel crosses for the number of bolls; ‘Paum- 15 ’ x ‘Nazilli- 84 S’, ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Fantom’, ‘Nazilli- 84 S’ x ‘Delcerro’ and ‘Nazilli- 84 S’ x ‘Giza- 45 ’ diallel cross for the <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> ‘Paum- 15 ’ x ‘Stoneville- 453 ’, ‘Paum- 15 ’ x ‘Nazilli- 84 S’, ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Nazilli- 84 S’, ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Fantom’, ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Delcerro’, ‘Stoneville- 453 ’ x ‘Giza- 45 ’, ‘Nazilli- 84 S’ x ‘Fantom’ and ‘Nazilli- 84 S’ x ‘Delcerro’ diallel crosses for the seed-cotton yield...|$|E
40|$|Improving yield {{is a major}} {{objective}} for cotton breeding schemes, and lint {{yield and}} its three component traits (boll number, boll weight and <b>lint</b> <b>percentage)</b> are complex traits controlled by multiple genes and various environments. Association mapping was performed to detect markers associated with these four traits using 651 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A mixed linear model including epistasis and environmental interaction was used to screen the loci associated with these four yield traits by 323 accessions of Gossypium hirsutum L. evaluated in nine different environments. 251 significant loci were detected {{to be associated with}} lint yield and its three components, including 69 loci with individual effects and all involved in epistasis interactions. These significant loci explain ∼ 62. 05 % of the phenotypic variance (ranging from 49. 06 % ∼ 72. 29 % for these four traits). It was indicated by high contribution of environmental interaction to the phenotypic variance for lint yield and boll numbers, that genetic effects of SSR loci were susceptible to environment factors. Shared loci were also observed among these four traits, which may be used for simultaneous improvement in cotton breeding for yield traits. Furthermore, consistent and elite loci were screened with -Log 10 (P-value) > 8. 0 based on predicted effects of loci detected in different environments. There was one locus and 6 pairs of epistasis for lint yield, 4 loci and 10 epistasis for boll number, 15 loci and 2 epistasis for boll weight, and 2 loci and 5 epistasis for <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> respectively. These results provided insights into the genetic basis of lint yield and its components and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding to improve cotton production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A genetic {{model was}} {{proposed}} for simultaneously analyzing genetic effects of nuclear, cytoplasm, and nu-clear-cytoplasmic interaction (NCI) {{as well as}} their genotype by environment (GE) interaction for quantitative traits of diploid plants. In the model, the NCI effects were further partitioned into additive and dominance nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction compo-nents. Mixed linear model approaches were used for statistical analysis. On the basis of diallel cross designs, Monte Carlo simula-tions showed that the genetic model was robust for estimating variance components under several situations without specific effects. Random genetic effects were predicted by an adjusted unbiased prediction (AUP) method. Data on four quantitative traits (boll number, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> fiber length, and micronaire) in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were analyzed as a worked exam-ple to show the effectiveness of the model...|$|E
40|$|In {{last years}} {{considerable}} progress was {{achieved in the}} Bulgarian cotton breeding regarding the earliness and fiber quality. The varieties Colorit, Darmi and Natalia are new achievement in succession. These three varieties have been obtained from the crosses of G. hirsutum L. and bred lines of G. hirsutum L. G. barbadense L. origin. In earliness and productivity they were equal to the variety Chirpan- 539 (standard for earliness and productivity) and in fiber length they were equal to the variety Avangard- 264 (standard for fiber quality). Natalia and Darmi distinguished by higher <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> than Avangard- 264. Hierarchical cluster analysis, based on six agronomic traits, showed that the variety Natalia was {{very similar to the}} standard variety Avangard- 264, whilst the variety Darmi was genetically more distant.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of honeycomb pedigree selection (HPS) {{as compared to}} conventional pedigree selection (CPS) was studied in one intraspecific (G. hirsutum L. x G. hirsutum L.) cross population (population I) and one interspecific (G. hirsutum L. x G. barbadense L.) cross population (population II). Combined selection for yield and lint quality traits was applied for four cycles at two locations for population I and at one location for population II. Finally, the best F- 6 lines derived by each method, together with the unselected population derived by single seed descent (SSD) and three check cultivars, were tested in comparative experiments, separately for each cross, at the same locations. In both populations the analysis of variance indicated significant differences among the groups of the material tested for seedcotton yield, mean boll weight, micronaire reading, staple length, and uniformity ratio. No {{significant differences were found}} with respect to plant height, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> and fiber strength in population I and with respect to <b>lint</b> <b>percentage</b> and fiber strength in population II. In population I, on the basis of mean seedcotton yield and number of superior lines derived by each method as compared to the check varieties and the unselected SSD population, HPS-lines were superior to CPS-lines for seedcotton yield, fiber length and boll weight. HPS-lines, however, did not differ significantly in seedcotton yield from the best check cultivar Eva. Finally, the material derived by CPS was earlier in maturity than the material derived by HPS and SSD. Also in population II, on the basis of mean seedcotton yield and number of superior lines derived by each method as compared to the unselected SSD population, HPS-lines were superior to CPS-lines. No significant differences, however, were identified between the material of the two methods for lint quality traits. It was concluded that in both populations HPS was more effective than CPS in identifying lines with high yielding ability and good lint quality. This superiority of HPS is attributed, at least partially, to its effectiveness in early generation selection...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the genetic {{distance}} between eleven Bulgarian and four Macedonian cotton varieties by applying the method of cluster analysis. The trial was carried out in 2008 and 2009. The cluster analysis based on the varieties agronomic and fiber technological properties confirmed the genetic differences between them. The varieties grouped into two basic groups depending on the breeding directions and breeding methods. Some varieties were genetically very similar and they could be included in one breeding program for rapid breeding effect. The Macedonian varieties and lines were genetically distant from some Bulgarian varieties and their including in one breeding program can has a good effect. The year conditions had influence on genetic similarity and genetic remoteness as a result of predetermination of genetic formulas controlling the traits.

40|$|Pakistan ranks at 4 th {{position}} {{with respect to}} global area and production of cotton, however the yield level is still low as compared to other major cotton producing countries. There are so many pathways which contribute to the final yield of cotton plant, one {{of which may be}} the exploitation and selection for some basic traits related to boll. Keeping in view the importance of within-boll yield components in determining the final yield, present study was carried out in research area of the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad to estimate the genetic basis of various yield and quality attributes, combining ability and heterotic manifestation and correlation of agronomic, boll related and fibre quality traits in Gossypium hirsutum L. For this study two crosses were made involving four contrasting parents with respect to seed cotton yield and fibre quality characters. Crosses were made following triple test cross model and data on various agronomic, boll related and fibre quality traits were recorded and analyzed. Significant amount of epistatic interaction was found to be involved in expression of almost all the traits. The additive variance was greater in magnitude that dominance variance for traits like number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield per plant, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> lint index, fibre fineness, lint mass per boll and lint mass per seed resulting in partial degree of dominance for these traits. While dominance variance was found to be greater in magnitude than additive variance for average boll weight, fibre length, fibre strength, number of seeds per boll, seed mass per boll, seed index, seed volume and seed surface area resulting in over-dominance type of gene action. Seed density showed complete dominance of the genes. BH- 89 showed highest positive GCA effects for most of the traits. Among testers, CIM- 1100, CIM- 496 and FH- 634 showed significant GCA effects for most of the traits. NIAB- 999 × CIM- 70 proved to be the best regarding seed cotton yield per plant and seed surface area. Combination of S- 12 with (NIAB- 228 × BH- 160) showed maximum value regarding <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> fibre length, seed volume and seed surface area, it also proved to be the best for seed density when combined with NIAB- 228. The highest value of mid and better parent heterosis regarding number of bolls per plant (43. 60 % and 25. 52 %), seed cotton yield per plant (61. 41 % and 30. 67 %) and seed number per boll (17. 28 % and 16. 14 %) was observed for the hybrid BH- 89 × CIM- 496. Correlation studies revealed that bolls per plant were positively associated with seed cotton yield. Average boll weight showed significant positive correlation fibre strength and seed cotton yield. In the second cross, number of bolls per plant showed positive correlation with boll weight, fibre strength and seed cotton yield. Number of seeds per boll was positively associated with <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> fibre length and seed cotton yield. Fibre length and fibre fineness were negatively correlated.

To verify the experimental results, historical data (1986 to 2003) of seed cotton yield, GOT and Staple length of top three high yielding lines was collected from National Coordinated Varietal Trials (NCVT) conducted in Multan region. Significant differences among varieties for node of first fruiting branch, monopodial branches per plant, days taken to first flower and ginning out turn percentage were exhibited. NCVT data showed that among varieties recommended for general cultivation since 1986, variety S- 12 showed highest seed cotton yield and ginning outturn (40. 5 %).

40|$|This paper {{studied the}} effects of 60 Co-gamma ray on the pollen grains of upland cotton. The {{irradiation}} effects on pollen grains were tested {{in terms of the}} ultrastructural changes in the exine and interior of pollen grains, their germination rate, the single primer amplification reaction polymorphism of ovule developed after the pistils were pollinated by the pollen grains which had been irradiated with 60 Co-gamma ray, and the law of genetic variation of their M 1, M 2 progeny. The results showed that 60 Co-gamma ray had no effects on the exine wall of the pollen grains. The interior structure of pollen grain were destroyed significiantly. The interior wall became thin and irregular, and part of it concavitied to the inner. The endoplasmic reticulum depolymerized. The amount and the density of pollen grain inclusions increased. The number of pollen tubes in style decreased by 38 %, compared with the control group (natural pollen grain). The single primer amplification reaction polymorphism of ovule increased. The germination percentage of M 1 progeny was decreased by 41. 03 %. And with the cotton plants of M 1 progeny, the length of taproot, longest lateral root, average lateral root, the number of lateral root, and the height of seedling decreased by 22. 24 %, 18. 93 %, 11. 80 %, 28. 02 %, 23. 05 %, respectively, compared with the control group. The percentage of sterility plants was 56. 7 %.

40|$|Interspecific {{chromosome}} substitution {{is among}} the most powerful means of introgression and steps toward quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification. By reducing the genetic “noise” from other chromosomes, it greatly empowers the detection of genetic effects by specific chromosomes on quantitative traits. Here, we report on such results for 14 cotton lines (CS-B) with specific chromosomes or chromosome arms from G. barbadense L. substituted into G. hirsutum and chromosome-specific F 2 families. Boll size, <b>lint</b> <b>percentage,</b> micronaire, 2. 5 % span length, elongation, strength, and yield were measured by replicated field experiments in five diverse environments and analyzed under an additive–dominance (AD) genetic model with genotype and environment interaction. Additive effects were significant for all traits and dominance effects were significant for all traits except 2. 5 % span length. CS-B 25 had additive effects increasing fiber strength and fiber length and decreasing micronaire. CS-B 16 and CS-B 18 had additive effects related to reduced yields. The results point toward specific chromosomes of G. barbadense 3 - 79 as the probable locations of the genes that significantly affect quantitative traits of importance.
