500|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air {{in an air}} separation unit using the methods of <b>liquefaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds (since those compounds give off alpha particles). Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over [...] to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, nitrogen narcosis, the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold, and carbon dioxide poisoning (hypercapnia), the panic-inducing effect of excessive {{carbon dioxide in the}} bloodstream. After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Energy storage is becoming an issue in a world were renewable energy {{will probably be the}} major way <b>of</b> energy production. <b>Liquefaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasses</b> in order to store the liquid is being looked at. This liquid can then be expanded in a Rankine cycle in order to recover the energy. If waste heat is used as input for the boiler, this can be an interesting technology to raise energy efficiency in industry. In this paper an analysis is made of the efficiency of storing liquefied air. Starting from the thermodynamics of the basic cycle, more complex combined cycles are studied. It is clear the ideal cycles have a good efficiency. Taking real expander efficiencies into account reduces the output a lot. Using combined cycles for liquefaction and energy production do not raise efficiency in a significant way. Conversion efficiencies are in the order of 20 to 50 %, making these cycles comparable to hydrogen storage and compressed air storage. mp 201...|$|R
