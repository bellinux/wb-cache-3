5|$|Historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs {{argued that}} the VOC victory in Surabaya {{probably}} accelerated the fall of Mataram.

Amangkurat I's successor, Amangkurat II, <b>later</b> <b>told</b> the VOC that the alliance with the VOC pushed his cousin Pangeran Purbaya towards the rebel side, and Purbaya's forces were among those who later overran the capital.|$|E
