5000|$|In Thailand, sky {{lanterns}} {{are often}} traditionally made from oiled rice paper on a bamboo frame. They {{may also be}} constructed from other <b>lightweight</b> <b>papers.</b> The source of hot air is usually a small candle or fuel cell composed of a waxy flammable material lit and which usually stays lit despite the surrounding air currents. The Thai name is khom loi. Many areas of Asia, however, do not permit sky lanterns because of widespread fire hazards as well as danger to livestock.|$|R

50|$|The posters {{used are}} {{typically}} {{made of a}} <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> and printed using flexography, digital printing and screen printing. Modern printing techniques enable the posters to feature full-colour designs, halftones, and photographs, making them popular for advertising concerts, political messages, commercial advertisements and special events. An increasing number of posters do not advertise anything at all and instead feature artwork, inspirational or positive messages, and religious messages.|$|E
50|$|This process worked {{best with}} cheap, <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> stocks, {{but when the}} sheets of paper were {{impregnated}} with the solvent they could easily crease or crumple, jamming the machine. One well-made master could print about 50 copies before the pigment was exhausted and the print became illegible.

It was also possible to use photograms, using a natural material such as a leaf as an artwork of found-materials.|$|E

50|$|Topus {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on March 15, 1924. He grew up in Flatbush where {{he fell in love}} with pigeons at an early age and befriended several local pigeon {{handlers}} who taught him to handle the birds. In 1942 he enlisted in the United States Army Signal Corps as a pigeoneer. He was stationed at Camp Ritchie in Maryland - one of several camps where birds were raised and trained for use as messengers. He taught other soldiers how to train and care for carrier pigeons, how to fasten on the tiny capsules containing messages written on <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper,</b> to drop pigeons from airplanes; and to jump out of airplanes themselves, with pigeons tucked against their chests.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1970s, SCM Allied Paper was the market leader in the <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> field, used {{exclusively}} in bibles. Investments made in the 1960s were paying off handsomely. Also paying off was that Allied owned the entire manufacturing process, since it had pulp mills, paper mills and converting operations which produced forms and other final paper products. A new 18000 sq ft headquarters building for the papermaking division of SCM was constructed on Portage Road in Kalamazoo during 1974 and 1975. However, new and larger mills located in the Southern U.S. and Canadian forests were making the Allied mills in Kalamazoo uncompetitive. The King Mill had closed in 1970 and the Monarch Mill closed in 1981, leaving just the Bryant Mill operating in Kalamazoo plus the pulp and paper mills in Jackson, Alabama. Also in 1981 the paper coating operation in Bryant Mill E was shut down.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of fuse is {{the burning}} fuse, believed to {{date back to}} the 10th century and originating in China. This simple fuse consisted of <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> filled with loose gunpowder, and served as a means of delaying ignition in fireworks. This simple form of burning fuse can still be found today in many modern fireworks. A version of this simple fuse is called visco fuse, and consists of the burning core coated with wax or lacquer for durability and water resistance. Early fuses for grenades also consist of an wooden plug with a longitudinal hole filled with a slow burning gunpowder mixture inserted into the grenade. Such fuses were in use until the 18th century. The commercial and military version of a burning fuse referred to as safety fuse (invented by William Bickford) is a textile tube filled with combustible material and wrapped to prevent external exposure of the burning core. Safety fuses are used to initiate the detonation of explosives {{through the use of a}} blasting cap.|$|E

5000|$|In 1979, magician and debunker James Randi {{engineered}} a hoax, now {{referred to}} as Project Alpha to encourage a tightening of standards within the parapsychology community. Randi recruited two young magicians and sent them undercover to Washington University's McDonnell Laboratory where they [...] " [...] fooled researchers ... into believing they had paranormal powers." [...] The aim was to expose poor experimental methods and the credulity thought to be common in parapsychology. Randi has stated that both of his recruits deceived experimenters {{over a period of}} three years with demonstrations of supposedly psychic abilities: blowing electric fuses sealed in a box, causing a <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> rotor perched atop a needle to turn inside a bell jar, bending metal spoons sealed in a glass bottle, etc. The hoax by Randi raised ethical concerns in the scientific and parapsychology communities, eliciting criticism even among skeptical communities such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), which he helped found, but also positive responses from the President of the Parapsychological Association Stanley Krippner. Psychologist Ray Hyman, a CSICOP member, called the results [...] "counterproductive".|$|E
40|$|When You Hear This Sound is a 'singing book' {{inspired}} by the book and record sets of the artist's childhood, complete with a 7 " vinyl record soundtrack. When You Hear This Sound explores unique forms of personal storytelling of the artist's Sydney neighborhood and it's characters, through wordplay and quirky observations. Developed from hand drawn illustrations and individually stamped rubber text, the final silk screened product holds true to this aesthetic.

40|$|The {{adaptability}} and practicality of microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are highly desirable traits {{in the search}} for alternative sources of energy. An innovative application for the technology could be to power portable emergency locator transmitters (ELTs). Such devices would ideally need to be lightweight, robust and fast-in terms of response. Urine is an abundant resource, and with MFCs, could be the ideal fuel for powering ELTs, with the compelling advantage of also indicating proof of life. We developed novel origami tetrahedron MFCs (TP-MPFCs) using photocopier paper to test different urine-based inoculants. When inoculated with urine extracted from the anode chambers of working MFCs a stack of 6 abiotic MFCs produced a usable working voltage after just 3 h 15 min; enough to energise a power management system. The anodes of established TP-MFCs were then removed and air-dried for 7 days before being inserted into new paper reactors and refrigerated. After 4 weeks, these MFCs displayed an immediate response to fresh urine and achieved a functional working voltage in just 35 minutes. Two paper MFCs connected in parallel were able to transmit 85 radio signals and in a series configuration 238 broadcasts over 24 hours. These findings demonstrate that simple, inexpensive, <b>lightweight</b> <b>paper</b> MFCs can be employed as urine-activated, “proof of life” reporting systems...|$|E
