500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{used his}} press conference before the match to look ahead to the new season. He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson then {{flew over}} an {{irrigation}} ditch filled {{with dozens of}} bodies. [...] Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> there's {{an awful lot of}} unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. [...] There's bodies everywhere. [...] There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. [...] There's something wrong here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} execution, Thompson {{discovered}} the irrigation ditch full of Calley's victims. Thompson then radioed {{a message to}} accompanying gunships and Task Force Barker headquarters, [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> there's {{an awful lot of}} unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here." [...] Thompson spotted movement in the irrigation ditch, indicating that there were civilians alive in it. He immediately landed to assist the victims. Lieutenant Calley approached Thompson and the two exchanged an uneasy conversation.|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen's murders {{were first}} {{discovered}} by a Dyno-Rod employee named Michael Cattran, {{who responded to}} the complaints made by both Dennis Nilsen and other tenants of 23 Cranley Gardens regarding the drains of the property being blocked on 8 February 1983. Opening a drain cover {{at the side of the}} house, Cattran discovered the drain was packed with a flesh-like substance and numerous small bones of unknown origin. Cattran reported his suspicions to his supervisor, Gary Wheeler. However, as he had arrived at the property at dusk, Cattran and his supervisor agreed to postpone further investigation into the blockage until the following morning. Prior to leaving the property, Nilsen and a fellow tenant named Jim Allcock convened with Cattran to discuss the source of the substance. Upon hearing Cattran exclaim how similar the substance was in appearance to human flesh, Nilsen replied: [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> someone has been flushing down their Kentucky Fried Chicken." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baseball America named Hirsh Houston's top {{prospect}} {{heading into}} the 2006 season; it also listed Hirsh as having the [...] "Best Control" [...] in the organization. Before the season, Houston added him to its 40-man roster. [...] "He's a very mature kid," [...] Astros assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. [...] "He keeps everything in perspective." [...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he maintains good concentration. [...] Whatever he's doing, {{he looks like he}} focuses at it. [...] He looks like he throws the ball down in the zone well, which is really good for as big as he is. And his stuff's good. [...] He looks like he has some of the other ingredients that you've got to have to go along with having good stuff. [...] He's a good athlete. [...] He swings the bat pretty good, and he moves on the mound well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} just like old Kit to take the law into his own hands," [...] the ranger {{admitted}} to himself. [...] "And the writing in that letter <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> Mrs. Abe Kitsong's." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was struck}} dumb. Mr. Murthwaite {{went on with}} his cheroot. Mr. Franklin, after what <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a little private veering about between the {{different}} sides of his character, broke the silence as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{slightly}} staggered at this, more especially as I saw {{the hands of}} some of the men steal down to their sides, where hung on each what <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a large and heavy knife.|$|R
2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E

And there isn't the ring of real gold about the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{am not so}} sure as to one of {{the young}} fellows with them. I was about to {{question}} him, when you broke in. He did not <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a young peasant, and I should not be at all surprised if he is some Huguenot gentleman, making his way to Nerac with three of his followers." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} try {{to climb out of}} my hole, but as it was nine feet deep and bottle-shaped, which the light flowing in from the neck showed, I found this impossible.

60|$|I do {{not believe}} that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, it lacks force of character, it lacks bitterness.
