25|$|Pool {{designs for}} canine {{hydrotherapy}} vary, but most have generic elements. The pool {{tends to be}} smaller than a human swimming pool and is heated. (This is unlike equine hydrotherapy pools. Horses generate a lot of body heat when swimming, so equine pools use cold water to prevent the animal overheating.) A dog's muscles benefit from the warming effects of the heated water. Most pools have a ramp for entry and exit and some have harnesses to maintain the dog in position in the water. There may be a manual or electric hoist for <b>lifting</b> <b>dogs</b> {{in and out of}} the water. Water is chlorinated or treated with an alternative chemical. Some have jets to add resistance and make the dog swim more strongly.|$|E

50|$|The chain {{travels through}} a steel trough, and is {{normally}} powered {{by one or}} more motors which are positioned under the <b>lift</b> hill. Chain <b>dogs</b> underneath each train are engaged by the chain and the train is pulled up the <b>lift.</b> Anti-rollback <b>dogs</b> engage a rack (ratcheted track) alongside the chain to prevent the train from descending the lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the chain wraps around a gear wheel where it begins its return {{to the bottom of the}} lift; the train is continually pulled along until gravity takes over and it accelerates downhill. The spring-loaded chain and anti-rollback dogs will disengage themselves as this occurs.|$|R

She was greatly alarmed, though the dog was not seriously hurt. She <b>lifted</b> the <b>dog</b> into the carriage, and the man drove on. Not receiving any call or direction from his mistress, as was usual, he stopped the carriage and discovered her, as he thought, in a fit, or ill, and drove to St. George's Hospital, which was near at hand. When there it was discovered that she must have been dead some little time. Mrs. Carlyle's health had been for several months feeble, but not in a state to excite anxiety or alarm.|$|R

It involved a lady passenger on the stagecoach that grabbed the tail of her dog as it jumped out the window in pursuit of a cat. She hung on screaming for help until the owner of the local restaurant, Mother Cummings, came to her rescue. While she was <b>lifting</b> the <b>dog</b> through the window of the coach she said, [...] "Well Ma'am, a tail-holt is better than a no holt at all".

Foghorn dives to catch her, and Prissy sees Foghorn as not only a savior but a potential husband, a notion which Foghorn rejects. Foghorn then goes about his regular routine by picking up the board and going to the doghouse, where he <b>lifts</b> the <b>dog</b> up by the tail and repeatedly slaps his rear end with a board which causes the dog to chase him. Foghorn then closes the gate to the fence just in time for the dog to crash into it head first. Foghorn is then seen trying to slip a lit dynamite stick into the dog house, but the dog is wise to it and the trick backfires. Foghorn is then seen having a picnic with a large amount of food prepared by Prissy, but Foghorn rejects her again.|$|R

50|$|Knopa was {{selected}} as the Terrier Group winner by judge Michael Phillips, having been declared the best Scottish Terrier competing by the breed judge Geoff Corish. On the final day, 8 March 2015, Knopa challenged against the other six group winners. These were a male Flat-Coated Retriever from Sweden, a Maltese who had been brought over from Italy and was also male, a Bearded Collie, an Alaskan Malamute, a Saluki and a female Miniature Poodle from Norway. The judge for Best in show was Ronnie Irving and after choosing Knopa as his overall winner, Irving selected the Flatcoat as Reserve Best in Show. The three judges are all considered terrier experts.The last time a Scottish Terrier won the Best in Show award at Crufts was in 1929. Knopa's American handler, Rebecca Cross, stated the dog was likely to be retired from competition after this win. Prior to the show Cross had been informed in writing by The Kennel Club that the American style of terrier handling, which includes <b>lifting</b> the <b>dog</b> from the assessment table by grasping the animal by the neck and tail, is not permitted; nevertheless this was the manner used to lift Knopa and Cross later apologised for it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{delivery}} truck shows {{up and the}} delivery man wheels in a large crate containing a loudly-barking dog. As Jerry signs for the crate, Tom is almost too scared to look on as he takes a crowbar to the crate. Jerry whistles for the loud dog to come out....and it is a tiny bulldog even smaller than Jerry is in stature (possibly due to Jerry's surname, [...] "Mouse", making the dog very small, {{about the same size}} as him). Tom is amazed to see the dog's small stature, but Jerry orders the dog to take care of Tom. After it sits around panting and barking, Jerry <b>lifts</b> up the <b>dog</b> and compares the dog to himself (Jerry being bigger than the dog), which causes the dog to snuggle up to him and fall on its head due to the dog's short legs. He <b>lifts</b> up the <b>dog,</b> who then licks him, as Tom comes out to investigate. Jerry takes the dog back into the crate with him, and ends up hanging on the tail when the dog wants to go out and meet Tom. Tom tosses the dog up a few times, pointing and laughing, which causes the dog to buzz saw his right arm hair off. He is still smiling until the dog repeats on the left arm, leading him to frantically try and shake the dog off. With a mouthful of fur, the dog hits the ground, only to buzzsaw on Tom's tail, turning part of it into sausages. Horrified at the state of his tail, he runs into the house screaming in terror. The rest of this short sees Tom without fur covering either of his arms, although he regains that of his tail.|$|R

We cannot say whether he understood it, but beyond all doubt he heard it. Crusoe never presumed to think of going to sleep until his master was as sound as a top; then he ventured to indulge in that light species of slumber which is familiarly known as [...] "sleeping with one eye open." [...] But, comparatively, as well as figuratively speaking, Crusoe slept usually with one eye and a-half open, and the other half was never very tightly shut.|$|R

The creature moaned feebly when I looked at it and called to it, but never stirred. I moved away the seat and looked closer. The poor little dog's eyes were glazing fast, and there were spots of blood on its glossy white side. The misery of a weak, helpless, dumb creature is surely one of the saddest of all the mournful sights which this world can show. I <b>lifted</b> the poor <b>dog</b> in my arms as gently as I could, and contrived a sort of make-shift hammock for him to lie in, by gathering up the front of my dress all round him.

5000|$|By most accounts, {{the history}} of the {{industry}} begins with a man named James Spratt. An electrician from Cincinnati, Spratt had patented a new type of lightning conductor in 1850. Later in the decade, he traveled to England to sell it. According to industry lore, he had a quayside epiphany in London when he saw a group of dogs eating discarded hardtack, the cheap, tough biscuits carried on ships and known to sailors as [...] "molar breakers." [...] The first major chunk of today's pet industry was born.In 1860, still in England, Spratt unveiled Spratt's Patent Meat Fibrine Dog Cakes, a combination of wheat, beetroot, vegetables, and beef blood. Before long, he had competitors with names like Dr. A. C. Daniels' Medicated Dog Bread and F. H. Bennett's Malatoid Dog Biscuits. The products embraced the dubious science and the lightly regulated hucksterism of their era. (2009) [...] More than 70 years ago, in a little shop in London an electrician named James Spratt conducted experiments which led to the production of Spratt's Patent—a scientifically blended dog food. It was the first attempt to <b>lift</b> the <b>dog</b> out of the class of scavenger which he had occupied from caveman times.

6000|$|Forth it came, {{headed by}} the bride and bridegroom, both looking their very handsomest, and we bridesmaids in six couples behind, when, {{just as we were}} clear of the porch, and school-children were strewing flowers before the pair, there was a strange shuddering cry, and the great bloodhound, Kirby, with broken chain and foaming jaws--all the dreadful tokens of madness about him--came rushing up the avenue with the speed of the wind, making full for his mistress, the bride. There was not a moment for her to do more than give a sort of shrieking, despairing command, [...] "Down, Kirby!" [...] when, just as the beast was {{springing}} on her, his throat was seized by the powerful hands that alone could have grappled with him, and the terrible head, foaming, and making horrid choking growls, was swung round from her, and the <b>dog</b> <b>lifted</b> by {{the back of the neck}} in the air, struggling and kicking violently.|$|R
60|$|Now Jantje had all a Hottentot's natural {{love for}} animals, which is, {{generally}} speaking, as marked {{as is the}} Kafir's callousness towards them, and he was particularly fond of the dog Stomp, which always went out with him those rare occasions when he thought it safe or desirable to walk like an ordinary man instead of wriggling from bush to bush like a panther, or wriggling through the grass like a snake. The sight of the animal's death, therefore, raised in his yellow breast a very keen desire for vengeance on the murderer, if vengeance could be safely accomplished; and he paused to reflect how this might be done. As he thought Hendrik rose, gave the dead dog a kick, withdrew his assegai from the carcase, and then, as though struck by a sudden desire to conceal the murder, he undid the collar and, <b>lifting</b> the <b>dog</b> in his arms, carried him with difficulty {{into the house and}} laid him under the kitchen-table. This done, he came out again to the wall, which was built of unmortared stones, pulled one out without trouble, deposited the watch and the silver he had stolen in the cavity, and replaced the stone. Next, before Jantje could guess what he meant to do, he proceeded to make it practically impossible for his robbery to be discovered, or at any rate very improbable, by lighting a match, and, having first glanced round to see that nobody was looking, reaching up and applying it to the thick thatch wherewith the house itself was roofed, the fringe of which just at this spot was not more than nine feet from the ground. No rain had fallen at Mooifontein for several days, and there had been a hot sun with wind. As a result the thatch was dry as tinder. The light caught in a second, and in two more a thin line of fire was running up the roof.|$|R
6000|$|Bob Pillin, {{attentive}} to Mrs. Larne, was gazing {{with all his}} might over her shoulder at the girl. The young man was moonstruck, that was clear! There was something almost touching in the stare of those puppy dog's eyes. And he thought 'Young beggar--wish I were his age!' The utter injustice of having an old and helpless body, when your desire for enjoyment was as great as ever! They said a man was as old as he felt! Fools! A man was as old as his legs and arms, and not a day younger. He heard the girl beside him utter a discomfortable sound, and saw her face cloud as if tears were not far off; she jumped up, and going to the window, <b>lifted</b> the little <b>dog</b> and buried her face in its brown and white fur. Old Heythorp thought: 'She sees that her humbugging mother is using her as a decoy.' But she had come back, and the little dog, rolling its eyes horribly at the strange figure on the sofa, in a desperate effort to escape succeeded in reaching her shoulder, where it stayed perched like a cat, held by one paw and trying to back away into space. Old Heythorp said abruptly: ...|$|R
6000|$|The past of {{the place}} is not so rich in legend as that of much humbler localities, but {{there is at least}} one Indian story which will bear telling over again. It {{concerns}} Jacob Wetzel, the brother of the famous Lewis Wetzel, who was one day returning from a hunt well within the bounds of the present city, and had sat down on a log to rest, when a growl from his dog warned him of danger. He instantly treed, or jumped behind a tree, and then saw an Indian treed behind a neighboring oak. They both fired; the Indian missed, but Wetzel's bullet had broken the savage's arm. They rushed at each other with their drawn hunting knives, and fell in a fearful struggle. Wetzel unhurt was no match for the wounded Indian, who sat astride of him with his knife <b>lifted</b> when Wetzel's <b>dog</b> sprung at his throat. Wetzel now flung him off, and while the dog held him helpless, easily dispatched him. Another story is of the usual ghastliness relieved by a touch of the comic. Colonel Robert Elliott was shot by the Indians near the northern line of Hamilton County. One of them sprang upon him to scalp him, but at a touch the poor man's wig came off in his hand. He lifted it and was heard to say with an oath, [...] "Lie!" [...] while he stared at his trophy in bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|Jack Harrington had {{anticipated}} this crush and waited by his sled until it untangled. Louis Savoy, {{aware of his}} rival's greater wisdom {{in the matter of}} dog-driving, had followed his lead and also waited. The rout had passed beyond earshot when they took the trail, and it was not till they had travelled the ten miles or so down to Bonanza that they came upon it, speeding along in single file, but well bunched. There was little noise, and less chance of one passing another at that stage. The sleds, from runner to runner, measured sixteen inches, the trail eighteen; but the trail, packed down fully a foot by the traffic, was like a gutter. On either side spread the blanket of soft snow crystals. If a man turned into this in an endeavor to pass, his dogs would wallow perforce to their bellies and slow down to a snail's pace. So the men lay close to their leaping sleds and waited. No alteration in position occurred down the fifteen miles of Bonanza and Klondike to Dawson, where the Yukon was encountered. Here the first relays waited. But here, intent to kill their first teams, if necessary, Harrington and Savoy had had their fresh teams placed a couple of miles beyond those of the others. In the confusion of changing sleds they passed full half the bunch. Perhaps thirty men were still leading them when they shot on to the broad breast of the Yukon. Here was the tug. When the river froze in the fall, a mile of open water had been left between two mighty jams. This had but recently crusted, the current being swift, and now it was as level, hard, and slippery as a dance floor. The instant they struck this glare ice Harrington came to his knees, holding precariously on with one hand, his whip singing fiercely among his dogs and fearsome abjurations hurtling about their ears. The teams spread out on the smooth surface, each straining to the uttermost. But few men in the North could <b>lift</b> their <b>dogs</b> as did Jack Harrington. At once he began to pull ahead, and Louis Savoy, taking the pace, hung on desperately, his leaders running even with the tail of his rival's sled.|$|R
5000|$|Many ducks are {{swimming}} and flying around a pond. They are also doing a conga line around two dogs who are hunting, waiting in their boat. Nearby at a tree, a sign reads [...] "No Hunting Before 6:AM. As the clock finally strikes six, all the ducks fly away {{before the two}} dogs {{have the chance to}} shoot one. Then the dogs spot a mother duck having her nest with an egg in it strapped to herself. The dogs miss the shot but the strap breaks, dropping the egg onto the boat and hatching. Just then, it starts dancing and taking off the egg shell, and jumps into the water. The two dogs point their guns into the water, but no shooting is heard. The <b>dogs</b> <b>lift</b> their guns, revealing that the duckling had tied the point of their guns together in a knot. The duckling laughs and jumps back into the water. The duckling goes under the boat and pulls out a drill, and puts a hole in the boat. The dogs notice the leaking, and the small dog covers the hole with his hands. Water starts coming out of his ears and the big dog covers the small dog's ears with his hands. Suddenly, water starts coming out of the big dog's ears, and the small dog stops the water by using the big dog's nose like a faucet. The small dog uncovers the hole, and the duckling honks his nose, laughs, and dives back in. The small dog points his gun into the hole, but the duckling snaps it shut with a clip. The small dog pulls up his gun, and the big dog lets go of the clip, and the gun explodes in the small dog's face. The duckling then lifts the boat and hits it against the water. The duckling laughs and swims away.|$|R
5000|$|The small dog then {{heads to}} the motor, but the engine won't start. The big <b>dog</b> <b>lifts</b> the anchor and uses the small dog's head to start the boat. As the dogs chase the {{duckling}} at super-sonic speed, the boat's rudder blades cut the water in half, then the land in half, sinking a tree. Continuing the chase in the boat on dry land, the blades proceed to turn a log, two trees and a rock mountain into a bridge, staircase and ladder, and Mount Rushmore, respectively. The duckling and the boat go into a hole in a tree, and goes through another tree that has a hole. The duckling passes between two trees with the big tree suddenly lifting the small tree before the boat can do something to it. After crossing a mudpit and squeezing between two other trees, the chase temporarily ends with the boat and everybody crashing into a rock and getting flattened. Now chasing the duckling on foot, they stop upon a [...] "Stop School Crossing" [...] sign with an actual schoolhouse crossing the road. Chasing the duckling into a forest, everything suddenly turns black and white, the trio having passed a sign indicating [...] "Technicolor Ends Here". Going back into the color portion of the forest, the duckling stops {{at the edge of}} a cliff and spots the big dog coming towards him, prompting the duckling to pull out a bottle of [...] "Quick Grow" [...] and instantly turning a small plant into a tree which the big dog crashes into. The big dog then grabs an ax, and then puts it down to spit on his hands. The little dog comes back, and the big dog blindly uses him instead of the ax. The big dog notices this, and puts the little dog down. Then the little dog spits out a little pile of logs.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of propofol TCI for visual examination of arytenoid motion in dogs. Materials and methods: Seven ASA I-II dogs scheduled for examination of laryngeal function were enrolled in a prospective study. Acepromazine (0. 02 mgkg 1) and morphine (0. 15 mgkg 1) were administered intramuscularly 60 minutes prior to induction. Cardiorespiratory monitoring and flowby oxygen (0. 2 Lkg 1 min 1) were started before induction. Anesthesia was induced with propofol using a TCI system. A 3. 1 mcgmL 1 plasma target was achieved, Loss-Of-Righting-Reflex (LORR) was assessed, and individual predicted ES concentration at LORR was recorded. After induction the individual ES concentration at LORR was targeted, and the target increased or decreased by 0. 2 mcgmL 1 steps until laryngoscopy was impossible or arytenoid motion disappeared. The median (range) ES concentration at LORR and at ‘best arytenoid motion’ were calculated. Results: Five males and 2 females, 48 (12 – 72) months old, weighing 17. 7 (5. 4 – 28) kg entered the study. The median (range) propofol ES concentration was 1. 65 (1. 60 – 2. 59) mcgmL 1 at LORR, and 2. 1 (1. 4 – 2. 8) mcgmL 1 at ‘best arytenoid motion’. Two dogs were diagnosed with bilateral laryngeal paralysis and elongated soft palate, respectively. Although all dogs had some spontaneous movements of the tongue and jaw, and held their breath intermittently in response to laryngoscopy, on no occasion there was any risk of trauma to the examiner, the dog or the equipment. At the propofol concentration providing the best assessment no <b>dogs</b> <b>lifted</b> the head or showed a transient Return-Of- Righting-Reflex (RORR) after end of assessment. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation exceeded 94 %in all dogs. Heart rate lower than 60 beats-per-minute and Mean Arterial Pressure lower than 60 mmHg were not detected. Conclusions: Propofol ES-TCI represents a useful tool for visual examination of arytenoid motion in dogs. It provides a stable anesthetic depth, and can be titrated according to individual response. Required propofol ES concentration seems to be higher for laryngeal assessment than for LOR...|$|R
