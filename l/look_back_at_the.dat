5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his {{point is that the}} human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E

[...] "I could {{be having a}} guitar lesson and something will just come to me," [...] the former observed.

[...] In April 2003, Madonna discussed her motivations behind [...] "American Life" [...] with VH1 while talking about her experience in the music industry. She stated [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 20 years behind me and I realized {{that a lot of}} things that I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record.

500|$|Historically {{the rocky}} outcrop was known locally by the Malays {{in earlier times}} as [...] "Batu Berlayar" [...] ("Sailing Rock") near the present site of Labrador Park, off Pasir Panjang Road. Another rock outcrop used {{to stand on the}} {{opposite}} shore of Tanjong Rimau on Sentosa Island. These two rock outcrops once formed a gateway at the western entrance to Keppel Harbour. British sailors named the more prominent Batu Berlayar, [...] "Lot's Wife" [...] in reference to the biblical story of the wife of Abraham's nephew. She was transformed into a pillar of salt when she disobeyed divine orders not to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> destruction of Sodom while fleeing from the city. It is argued that the two rocky outcrops are the two hills of Temasek named in Yuan sources as Long Ya Men (Dragon's Teeth Gate) since they resembled two dragon's teeth between which a passage of water runs. [...] Another name Ling Ya Men (...) is recorded in the Song dynasty work Zhu Fan Zhi, however it is usually considered to be a different place.|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|American Life became Madonna's final studio {{album with}} Maverick Records, and {{marked the end}} of an eleven-year {{recording}} history with the label. In an interview with VH1, Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that [...] "material things" [...] were unimportant, stating [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record. The album has been deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States. [...] " [...] are examining things I valued and things I found myself worrying about, caring too much about, and realizing that those things aren't important and wanting to get out from underneath that cloud, the world of illusion", Madonna stated. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , the main concept of American Life was about [...] "nothing". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. O'Brien described the concept of the album and the song: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle {{for me to get}} over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy" [...] lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, [...] "broodier and more revealing". The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is [...] "a reflective <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E
