2500|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been a call for the end of legal {{impunity}} for domestic violence, an impunity often {{based on the idea that}} such acts are private. The Istanbul Convention is the first <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instrument</b> in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women. The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, de jure or de facto, these forms of violence. At para 219, it states: [...] "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator." ...|$|E

50|$|International {{human rights}} {{instruments}} are treaties {{and other international}} documents relevant to international human rights law {{and the protection of}} human rights in general. They can be classified into two categories: declarations, adopted by bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, which are not <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> although they may be politically so as soft law; and conventions, which are <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instruments</b> concluded under international law. International treaties and even declarations can, over time, obtain the status of customary international law.|$|R

This paper will thus examine all the relevant international and regional legal instruments in the field of religious freedom...|$|R
2500|$|All species (and sub-species) of gorilla {{are listed}} as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Now, over 100,000 western lowland gorillas are thought {{to exist in the}} wild, with 4,000 in zoos; eastern lowland gorillas have a {{population}} of under 5,000 in the wild and 24 in zoos. Mountain gorillas are the most severely endangered, with an estimated population of about 880 left in the wild and none in zoos. Threats to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade. In 2004, a population of several hundred gorillas in the Odzala National Park, Republic of Congo was essentially wiped out by the Ebola virus. A 2006 study published in Science concluded more than 5,000 gorillas may have died in recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in central Africa. The researchers indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these apes, the virus creates [...] "a recipe for rapid ecological extinction". Conservation efforts include the Great Apes Survival Project, a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme and the UNESCO, and also an international treaty, the Agreement on the Conservation of Gorillas and Their Habitats, concluded under UNEP-administered Convention on Migratory Species. The Gorilla Agreement is the first <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instrument</b> exclusively targeting gorilla conservation; it came into effect on 1 June 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Marital rape is non-consensual {{sexual contact}} perpetrated against a spouse. It is under-reported, under-prosecuted, and legal in many countries, {{due in part}} to the belief that through marriage, a woman gives {{irrevocable}} consent for her husband to have sex with her when he wishes. In Lebanon, for instance, while discussing a proposed law that would criminalize marital rape, Sheik Ahmad Al-Kurdi, a judge in the Sunni religious court, said that the law [...] "could lead to the imprisonment of the man where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights." [...] Feminists have worked systematically since the 1960s to criminalize marital rape internationally. In 2006, a study by the United Nations found that marital rape was a prosecutable offense in at least 104 countries Once widely condoned or ignored by law and society, marital rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. The countries which ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instrument</b> in Europe in the field of violence against women, are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner are illegal. The convention came into force in August 2014.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{it began}} to dawn upon us that the tables were turned. By degrees it came out that we had made a mistake. Dr. Polperro was really the person he {{represented}} himself to be, and had been always. His picture, we found out, was the real Maria Vanrenen, and a genuine Rembrandt, which he had merely deposited for cleaning and restoring at the suspicious dealer's. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had been imposed upon and cheated by a cunning Dutchman; his picture, though also an undoubted Rembrandt, was not the Maria, and was an inferior specimen in bad preservation. The authority we had consulted {{turned out to be}} an ignorant, self-sufficient quack. The Maria, moreover, was valued by other experts at no more than five or six thousand guineas. Charles wanted to cry off his bargain, but Dr. Polperro naturally wouldn't hear of it. The agreement was a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instrument,</b> and what passed in Charles's mind at the moment had nothing to do with the written contract. Our adversary only consented to forego the action for false imprisonment on condition that Charles inserted a printed apology in the Times, and paid him five hundred pounds compensation for damage to character. So that was the end of our well-planned attempt to arrest the swindler.|$|E

[...] States, though, have been slow in incorporating these rights in internationally <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instruments.</b> Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in hard law, that is, in <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> international human rights instruments, others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of soft law in international law, while a further group {{is yet to be}} accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of advocacy.|$|R

40|$|Tobacco is {{responsible}} for the death of 6 million people every year globally, of whom 700   000 are in Europe. Effective policies for tobacco control exist; however, the status of their implementation varies across the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. In order to tackle the tobacco epidemic, action has been taken though the implementation of both <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> and non-legally binding measures. This article aims to present the achievements and challenges of tobacco control in Europe, focussing on the available <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instruments</b> such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive at the European Union level. Tobacco still faces heavy lobbying of the tobacco industry, which has systematically contrasted policies to achieve public health objectives. The legal instruments for tobacco control in Europe presented here are not always adequately enforced in all the countries and there is certainly room for improving their implementation. Finally, the need for a strong political commitment towards the end-game of the tobacco epidemic is emphasised...|$|R

30|$|In addition, it is {{important}} to note at this juncture the legal status of peace agreements. Prior to 2005, peace agreements were understood as being <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> documents, serving as a kind of contract between the signatory parties (Kastner 2015, 13). Since the Armed Activities Case before the ICJ (International Court of Justice 2005), however, the status of peace agreements has been in doubt. In this case, the Court effectively ‘downgraded’ the status of peace agreements from <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>instruments</b> to modus operandi (para 99). The reasoning for this seems to have been to prevent states from relying on peace agreements to escape international responsibility for wrongful acts (an argument on which Uganda was relying in the case) (Lang 2008, 109). Andrea Lang has argued that the Court’s judgement was also based on a reluctance to engage with the issue of the status of NSAGs under international law (Lang 2008, 125), which is an issue that would be unavoidable, should agreements signed by NSAGs constitute a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> document. However, the legal status of the kinds of ceasefire agreements between states and NSAGs focused on in the current paper remains somewhat anomalous (see Kastner 2015, 13 – 14). Even though many of these agreements do not fall within the realm of public international law, it is still possible for a NSAG to conclude a <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> agreement with states (for example by “including a third state party as a guarantor or using a Security Council Resolution”: Public International Law and Policy Group 2013, 7). The legal status of the agreements proposed will therefore depend upon the situations of their adoption.|$|R

Rapid urbanization however is causing an adverse impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Protecting and restoring urban biodiversity and ecosystem services can increase human well-being of the rapidly increasing urban population. Today, however, the international biodiversity conservation practice mainly focuses on rural areas, and not on urban conservation and restoration.
