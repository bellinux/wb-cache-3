5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably more complex {{than that of the}} planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called Saros cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
25|$|Precession, nutation, and {{intrinsic}} rotation (spin) {{are defined}} as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not {{expressed in terms of}} the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> around the external axis z, the second rotates around the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E

40|$|A calculational {{model is}} derived {{for use in}} {{estimating}} Solar cosmic ray exposure to critical body organs in low-Earth orbit {{at the center of}} a large spherical shield of fixed thickness. The effects of the Earth's geomagnetic field and the astronauts' self-shielding are evaluated explicitly. The geomagnetic field model is an approximate tilted eccentric dipole with geomagnetic storms represented as a uniform-impressed field. The storm field is related to the planetary geomagnetic index K(sub p). The code is applied to the Shuttle geometry using the Shuttle mass distribution surrounding two locations on the flight deck. The Shuttle is treated as pure aluminum and the astronaut as soft tissue.

An estimate of the energy dissipation shows that substantial cooling can be performed during a reasonable time even in the microkelvin regime. Comment: 5 pages, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
25|$|Euler {{rotations}} {{provide an}} alternative {{description of a}} rotation. It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. Euler rotations are never {{expressed in terms of}} the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> around the external axis z, the second rotates around the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.|$|E

25|$|This {{implies a}} {{different}} definition for the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> in the geometrical construction. In the proper Euler angles {{case it was}} defined as the intersection between two homologous Cartesian planes (parallel when Euler angles are zero; e.g. xy and XY).

25|$|The nodes are {{points at}} which the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic. The Moon crosses the same node every 27.2122 days, an {{interval}} called the draconic or draconitic month. The <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes,</b> the intersection between the two respective planes, has a retrograde motion: for an observer on Earth it rotates westward along the ecliptic with a period of 18.60 years, or 19.3549Â° per year. When viewed from celestial north, the nodes move clockwise around Earth, opposite to Earth's own spin and its revolution around the Sun. Lunar and solar eclipses can occur when the nodes align with the Sun, roughly every 173.3 days. Lunar orbit inclination also determines eclipses; shadows cross when nodes coincide with full and new moon, when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in three dimensions.|$|E

30|$|The {{rationality}} {{can also}} be verified by comparative analysis between two nodes. For example, node 5 and 9 have {{the same number of}} incoming and outgoing lines. Flow value rankings <b>of</b> two incoming <b>lines</b> and two outgoing <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>node</b> 5 are 2 nd, 7 th and 4 th, 6 th. Flow value rankings <b>of</b> two incoming <b>lines</b> and two outgoing <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>node</b> 9 are 9 th, 13 th and 14 th, 17 th. Therefore, node 5 is more important than node 9 for larger power flow values of its incoming and outgoing lines. In method 1, the importance rankings <b>of</b> two <b>nodes</b> are 3 rd and 6 th, which accord with actual situation. However, in method 2, the importance rankings <b>of</b> two <b>nodes</b> are much closer {{due to the fact that}} they have the same number of outgoing and incoming lines. It is unreasonable. Similarly, the analysis can be applied to nodes 2 and 6. It shows that <b>node</b> importance ranking <b>of</b> power grid without consideration of power flow is determined by the topology of power grid to a greater extent. It is inconsistent with practical situation of power grid.|$|R
40|$|The {{superconductivity}} of quasi-one-dimensional {{electrons in}} {{the magnetic field}} is studied. The system is described as the one-dimensional electrons with no frustration due to the magnetic field. The interaction {{is assumed to be}} attractive between electrons in the nearest chains, which corresponds to the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>nodes</b> <b>of</b> the energy gap {{in the absence of the}} magnetic field. The effective interaction depends on the magnetic field and the transverse momentum. As the magnetic field becomes strong, the transition temperature of the spin-triplet superconductivity oscillates, while that of the spin-singlet increases monotonically.

40|$|From {{the group}} {{theoretical}} ground, the Blount's theorem prohibits the existence <b>of</b> <b>line</b> <b>nodes</b> for odd-parity superconductors (SCs) {{in the presence}} of spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
