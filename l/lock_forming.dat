60|$|But she cannot {{keep in the}} ear-rings long, {{else she}} may make her uncle and aunt wait. She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them up. Some day she {{will be able to}} wear any ear-rings she likes, and already she lives in an {{invisible}} world of brilliant costumes, shimmering gauze, soft satin, and velvet, such as the lady's maid at the Chase has shown her in Miss Lydia's wardrobe. She feels the bracelets on her arms, and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall mirror. But she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to wear to-day, because she can hang it on the chain of dark-brown berries which she has been used to wear on grand days, with a tiny flat scent-bottle {{at the end of it}} tucked inside her frock; and she must put on her brown berries--her neck would look so unfinished without it. Hetty was not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear-rings, though it was a handsome large locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and a beautiful gold border round the glass, which showed a light-brown slightly waving <b>lock,</b> <b>forming</b> a background for two little dark rings. She must keep it under her clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty had another passion, only a little less strong than her love of finery, and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in her bosom. She would always have worn it, if she had dared to encounter her aunt's questions about a ribbon round her neck. So now she slipped it on along her chain of dark-brown berries, and snapped the chain round her neck. It was not a very long chain, only allowing the locket to hang a little way below the edge of her frock. And now she had nothing to do but to put on her long sleeves, her new white gauze neckerchief, and her straw hat trimmed with white to-day instead of the pink, which had become rather faded under the July sun. That hat made the drop of bitterness in Hetty's cup to-day, for it was not quite new--everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white ribbon--and Mary Burge, she felt sure, would have a new hat or bonnet on. She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings: they really were very nice indeed, and she had given almost all her spare money for them. Hetty's dream of the future could not make her insensible to triumph in the present. To be sure, Captain Donnithorne loved her so that he would never care about looking at other people, but then those other people didn't know how he loved her, and she was not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for a short space.|$|E

40|$|Fully {{understanding}} {{the mechanisms of}} signaling proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) will require the characterization of their conformational states and the pathways connecting those states. The recent crystal structures of the β 2 - and β 1 -adrenergic receptors in a nominally inactive state constituted a major advance toward this goal, but also raised new questions. Although earlier biochemical observations had suggested that these receptors possessed a set of contacts between helices 3 and 6, known as the ionic lock, which was believed to form a molecular switch for receptor activation, the crystal structures lacked these contacts. The unexpectedly broken ionic lock has {{raised questions about the}} true conformation(s) of the inactive state {{and the role of the}} ionic lock in receptor activation and signaling. To address these questions, we performed microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) in multiple wild-type and mutant forms. In wild-type simulations, the ionic <b>lock</b> <b>formed</b> reproducibly, bringing the intracellular ends of helices 3 and 6 together to adopt a conformation similar to that found in inactive rhodopsin. Our results suggest that inactive β 2 AR exists in equilibrium between conformations with the <b>lock</b> <b>formed</b> and the <b>lock</b> broken, whether or not the cocrystallized ligand is present. These findings, along with the formation of several secondary structural elements in the β 2 AR loops during our simulations, may provide a more comprehensive picture of the inactive state of the β-adrenergic receptors, reconciling the crystal structures with biochemical studies...|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} a concert varies by musical genre, {{individual}} performers, and the venue. Concerts by a small jazz combo or small bluegrass band may have the same order of program, mood, and volume—but vary in music and dress. In a similar way, a particular musician, band, or genre of music might attract concert attendees with similar dress, hairstyle, and behavior. For example, concert goers in the 1960s often had long hair (sometimes in dread <b>lock</b> <b>form),</b> sandals and inexpensive clothing made of natural fibers.

At the line-out, the locks are supported by teammates, allowing them to compete for the ball, either passing or tapping it to the scrumhalf or setting up a drive. In scrums, the two locks bind tightly together and put their heads between a prop and the hooker. They compete for the kick-offs and are involved in securing the ball in rucks and mauls. They commonly make short runs (otherwise known as [...] "crash balls").|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Read-write locks {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} <b>lock</b> <b>forms</b> in concur-rent applications because they allow read accesses to locked code to proceed in parallel. However, they do not offer any parallelism between reads and writes. This paper introduces pessimistic lock-elision (PLE), a new approach for non-speculatively replacing read-write locks with pessimistic (i. e. non-aborting) soft-ware transactional code that allows read-write concurrency even for contended code and even if the code includes system calls. On systems with hardware trans-actional support, PLE will allow failed transactions, or ones that contain system calls, to preserve read-write concurrency. Our PLE algorithm is based on a novel encounter-order design of a fully pes-simistic STM system that in a variety of benchmarks spanning from counters to trees, even when up to 40 % of calls are mutating the locked structure, provides up to 5 times the performance of a state-of-the-art read-write lock...|$|R
