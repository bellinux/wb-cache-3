5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E
5|$|The {{veracity}} of Hahn's claim was questioned {{as early as}} 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Hahn {{did not mention the}} date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Over 700 {{species of}} Eucalyptus are known; {{refer to the}} List of Eucalyptus species for a {{comprehensive}} <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Some have diverged from the mainstream of the genus {{to the extent that}} they are quite isolated genetically and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics. Most, however, may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species, which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which gene exchange still occurs. In these situations, many species appear to grade into one another, and intermediate forms are common. In other words, some species are relatively fixed genetically, as expressed in their morphology, while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives.|$|E
25|$|Pittas are {{generally}} forest birds {{and as such}} are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation. They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked. Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Additionally eight species are listed as near-threatened and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient. The Gurney's pitta was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand. This small population continued to decline since its rediscovery, and by 2000 it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. In 2003 the species was found in Burma {{for the first time}} since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. Although the species was considerably less threatened than thought, it is still of considerable conservation concern as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues. The rapid rate of deforestation in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, previously considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> considered vulnerable. Pittas have also been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild bird trade. They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. According to some trappers they also may end up being eaten for food. On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsbile for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta, but the snake, which is responsible for a number of extinctions across the Pacific, is native to the island.|$|E
