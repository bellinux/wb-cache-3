40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{a theory of}} <b>legislative</b> <b>cooperation</b> in bicameral legislatures. At its core is a distinction between two decision-making scenarios leading to a concurrent majority in the two chambers. In an inter-institutional scenario, the chambers oppose each other as unitary actors. In a trans-institutional scenario, the constituent actors enter into cooperation across the boundaries of their chambers. The central argument is that formateurs face a strategic decision on which of these two routes to take. They can stick to their intra-institutional coalition, or they can abandon it and propose a logroll across issues within a bill that is carried by a majority across the chambers. The thesis comprises three papers, united by the general topic of trans-institutional <b>legislative</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and each demonstrating the crucial role of the formateurs. The empirical analysis focuses on co-decision legislation proposed in the bicameral system of the European Union between 1999 and 2009. In particular, it draws on a new dataset on early-stage and final-stage coalitions in the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. This {{is based on an}} extensive analysis of more than 18, 000 Council documents and 19, 000 amendments in the EP presenting {{for the first time a}} systematic insight into early-stage coalitions. Three central findings emanate from the application of the theoretical framework to the new data. First, formateurs can obtain an outcome closer to their preferences by choosing between inter- and trans-institutional scenarios. Second, the transaction costs of exchanges across institutional boundaries are lower if formateurs’ preferences are similar. Third, the decisions of the formateurs potentially produce winners and losers as some actors are included and others are excluded from the coalitions. These findings build on and further develop theories of bicameral coalition formation and legislative organisation. They highlight that the strategic environment in which actors operate surpasses their individual chamber, and explain how this affects the process and outcome of decision-making. This leads to important empirical and theoretical contributions which raise normative implications...|$|E

40|$|In 1915 Governor James Ferguson {{began his}} term in Texas bolstered {{by a wave}} of voter enthusiasm and <b>legislative</b> <b>cooperation</b> so great that few Texans {{anticipated}} anything short of a successful administration. His campaign was based on two key elements: his appeal to the rural constituency and a temporary hiatus {{from the effects of}} the continuous Prohibition debate. In reality, Jim Ferguson had shrewdly sold a well-crafted image of himself to Texas voters, carrying into office a bevy of closely guarded secrets about his personal finances, his business acumen, and his relationship with Texas brewers. Those secrets, once unraveled, ultimately led to charges brought against Governor Ferguson via impeachment. Refusing to acknowledge the judgment against him, Ferguson launched a crusade for regained power and vindication. In 1925 he reclaimed a level of political influence and doubled the Ferguson presence in Austin when he assisted his wife, Miriam, in a successful bid for the governorship. That bid had been based largely on a plea for exoneration but soon degenerated into a scandal-plagued administration. In the Governor’s Shadow unravels this complex tale, exposing the shocking depth of the Fergusons’ misconduct. Often using the Fergusons’ own words, Carol O’Keefe Wilson weaves together the incontestable evidence that most of the claims that Jim Ferguson made during his life regarding his conduct, intentions, achievements, and abilities, were patently false...|$|E
40|$|Never has {{sovereignty}} been as fashionable as {{since its}} explanatory and normative force {{first came into}} doubt and its knell was tolled in the European Union. With the shift in authority away from the state to new sub-state, supra-state, post-state and non-state entities, an important {{question is whether the}} concept of ultimate authority or sovereignty is to be abandoned or, on the contrary, retained and, if so, in which form. This paper aims at exploring a third way that would allow us to escape from the two types of dualism that contrast state and sovereignty, first, and rejecting and saving sovereignty, second. This paper's argument is that sovereignty is neither the simple reflection of the new European and international reality nor the application of a pre-established concept whose criteria are immutable and risk corseting the post-national order. As an essentially contestable concept, sovereignty is at once a state of affairs, a question pertaining to the nature and justification of that state of affairs and a justification of the latter. The correct use of the concept of sovereignty consists therefore in constantly contesting one's conceptions of the concept and hence one's exercize of sovereignty. As such, the reflexive concept of sovereignty can be described as cooperative in the post-national constellation where sovereign entities overlap in their claims to sovereignty over the same territory and population. Read together with the principle of subsidiarity, cooperative sovereignty implies allocating competences to those authorities that are best placed to ensure the protection of shared sovereign values and principles, such as the values of democracy and fundamental rights. In the European context, cooperative sovereignty provides the normative framework {{for the development of a}} dynamic and reflexive form of constitutionalism. Through its duties of cooperation and coherence, cooperative sovereignty countervails the risks of erosion implied by constitutional pluralism, while also enhancing the legitimacy of the European polity. This can be observed in the context of difficult issues such as constitutional conflicts, <b>legislative</b> <b>cooperation</b> and, finally, multi-level constitutionalism. sovereignty; supremacy; subsidiarity; polity building; multilevel governance; legitimacy; democracy; fundamental/human rights; constitution building; national parliaments; European Convention; political science; law...|$|E

40|$|Following the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, the executive branch of the U. S. Government turned to data mining practices for the avowed purpose of protecting public security. Relying on a combination of <b>legislative</b> authorization and <b>cooperation</b> by the private sector, federal institutions have obtained access to information in commercial databases collected largely from routine business transactions by ordinary people posing no particular threat to public order. Much of the data mining has occurred without safeguards like prior court authorization and limitations in the Privacy Act of 1974. In the absence of these safeguards designed to protect individual liberty, data mining appears to have contributed to an erosion of public trust in government.

40|$|The present paper {{tries to}} put {{together}} a modest study on the actions taken at EU level in order to fight economic crime. A series of measures have been implemented at national and European level to create a framework for fighting criminality. The European institutions and the national authorities are improving their cooperation in order to fight the increasing number of economic crimes committed both in the private and public sector, while Member States are approximating their legislation to the provisions of the Community acquis. We have divided these efforts into five categories corresponding to the five main areas of economic crime identified at EU level: fight against fraud, which affects the financial interests of the European Union and mainly comprises fraudulent practices in the use of EU funds and in taxation, fight against piracy and counterfeiting, public and private corruption, money laundering and organised crime. In order to combat the negative influence criminality exerts {{on the development of the}} economy and of the overall society, for each of the above mentioned areas legislative, institutional, technical and administrative measures have been adopted.

40|$|The {{independent}} agency {{has been around}} for 100 years now, but we are still trying to understand how it best relates to the administration of government. Its popularity as an organizational mechanism is more a function of competing political forces within the legislative and executive branches than of any systematic analysis of its effectiveness. Yet one can discern reasons why independent agencies might be superior mechanisms for administering government programs if their structure and purpose are analyzed functionally. This essay proposes to do that and, in the process, reach some conclusions about both the potential and the limits of the {{independent agency}} as a vehicle for making government decisions. I.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with an issue in European law that is historically derived from the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. The aim is to illuminate the functions and objectives of the European Union that correspond to the provisions of Part Four of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - Association of the Overseas Countries and Territories. The basic provisions are laid down in the primary law of the European Union {{but there are also}} other documents and legislative acts that lay down more detailed provisions on the given issue and reveal a more complex perspective. The article focuses on the existing legislation regulating the association of overseas countries and territories with the Union. The author first draws attention to the key provisions of the Treaty establishing the EEC that define the purpose, objectives and fundamental principles applied between the Union and the overseas countries and territories. The main purpose of the article, however, is to analyse the current legal basis of association and to highlight the need for a new <b>legislative</b> framework of <b>cooperation.</b> New legislation should take into account not only the interests of the Union, but also the desire of the overseas countries and territories for a new quality of mutual cooperation.

In this regard the author analyses issues related to Council decision 2001 / 822 /EC on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community and the proposal for a Council decision (COM/ 2012 / 362) of 16 July, 2012...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the democratic {{problems in the}} EU concerning the legislative process. The goal is to point out and analyze complications regarding {{the involvement of the}} national parliaments in the legislative process. Starting with a comparative analysis of the 15 first EU countries will give insight into the parliamentary abilities of the member states. This will show, that there is various ways of institutionalizing EU scrutiny. Furthermore we will classify the member states parliamentary EU scrutiny institutions, ranking them from weak to strong. Our further studies will focus on two countries with strong traditions for parliamentary scrutiny and debate; Denmark and Sweden. Selecting two countries identified as being 'strong', will help us narrow down the reasons for the problems with the <b>legislative</b> process and <b>cooperation</b> with the EU to only the most essential. Furthermore Denmark and Sweden's political traditions are very much alike. A short presentation of the scrutiny committees and the background for the EU membership will be given. Further analysis will focus on the relationship between the parliaments and the governments in coordinating and debating EU policies. The relationship will be theorized, using the principal-agent theory, suggesting that there is an asymmetry of information favoring the government, leading to a decoupling of national parliaments. A tendency backed by multiple scholars. The ordinary legislative procedure includes both the Council and the European Parliament in the policy legislation. This was implemented after a critique of the EU being undemocratic due to the exclusion of the Parliament. Now, the same legislation is being accused of excluding the national parliaments. Particularly due to the informal and opaque nature of the 'trialogue meetings' before the publication of new proposals. In academia this tendency has been referred to as 'early decision making'. This, in a democratic legitimacy perspective is highly discreditable and is also what the paper has found to be the most problematic feature of the legislative process in EU. The discussion will deliberate how, in an attempt to be more productive and effective, the EU has prioritized this over a legitimate legislative process. What are the considerations in determining whether such a priority is to be made? Lastly the subject will be put into perspective by examining some of the solutions proposed by scholars and politicians...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityInevitably, {{government}} is reaching {{more and more}} into fields of industry, human relations, and social welfare. The trend toward centralization is all too obvious to many of our citizens. It seems that the states were adequately {{equipped to deal with}} the nation's economic and social problems of the nineteenth century, but they have not proved themselves adequate to deal with many of those same problems of the twentieth century. Many people seem to forget that to a large degree this growth of the Federal government has been due to the inability of the states to handle their problems to and to cooperate among themselves. So it is evident that we must pursue the remedy of interstate cooperation in order to revive our "drooping" federalism and to preserve the sovereign rights of the States. The writer's basic assumption is that "federalism" is still alive and that the sovereignty of the States is no mere fiction. Furthermore, he assumes that interstate cooperation and uniform state action can revive and save "federalism. " The present work represents an attempt to survey the scope and to analyze the significance and possibilities of interstate relations as pertaining to New England with particular emphasis on Massachusetts. It is an attempt to show briefly the nature and accomplishments of such cooperative relations and reciprocal agreements as have come to exist at the present time. The thesis and problem then, is to discover how interstate cooperation and uniform policies can be achieved in New England, to find out what has and is being done in this field, and then, to evaluate the good and bad points. The methods used to gather this material were the historical research and the interview methods for the most part, although some statistical studies were included. The greater part of the material was obtained from the Massachusetts State House Law Library, the Kirsten Better Business Library, and the Massachusetts Commission on Interstate Cooperation. The need for <b>legislative</b> uniformity and <b>cooperation</b> in New England was found to be very great. First, the lack of uniform laws pertaining to insurance, marriage and divorce, the issuance of corporate charters, traffic control, public health, aviation, as well as many other subjects, as found to be all too obvious. Second, there are matters that are of common concern to all the New England states, such as river pollution control, flood control, forest fire prevention, etc If the states can solve these problems by themselves, {{it seems as if the}} Federal government would be less likely to step in, consequently, the move toward centralization might be checked. It was found that use of the interstate compact as an instrument to facilitate joint action between two or more states in New England has been used very sparingly. One of the most important agencies of interstate cooperation now at work in New England is the interstate cooperation commission. Each of the six states has a commission, Massachusetts being the first to establish one in 1937. Their functions are to advance cooperation between the states by formulating proposals for and by facilitating the adoption of interstate compacts, the enactment of uniform or reciprocal legislation, and the adoption of uniform or reciprocal administrative rules and regulations. The achievements of the commissions are impressive. New England states now have general uniform motor laws, flood control compacts are in the process of being enacted, a forest fire compact has just recently been passed, and many other subjects have been solved through the efforts of the commissions. Several administrative organizations were found to be contributing to better cooperation between the states. The New England Governors' Conference is one of the foremost in this group. At these conferences many recommendations have been made which have later led to more uniform administrative policies. The now defunct New England Regional Planning Commission and the Joint Railroad Committee were organizations that could have been very helpful at the present time. A very important unofficial organization working to provide the region's agencies of business and government with the stimulus and the means for working together in a cooperative manner on common problems is the New England Council. A brief summary of its main activities reveals that the council maintains contact with the governors and frequently takes up matters with them. At least once a year it brings the governors together in an annual conference to discuss methods of perfecting and coordinating the economic growth of the entire area. The council maintains executive offices with a staff who carry on work in such fields as agriculture, industry, recreational development, publicity, research, etc. The Council's efforts are largely stimulative. The Council has promoted uniformity in agricultural administration, in motor vehicle regulation, and in many other fields. Through its publicity activities it has tried to acquaint New England with the Council's work in order to promote cooperation. The Council's Committees on aviation, atomic energy, community development, industry, etc., have made important contributions to the coordinated growth of New England. Despite the Council's good work, it does have a rather glaring weakness since it seems to voice the opinion of big business in general, and does not adequately represent the small businessman or the consumer. Of all the organizations working for interstate cooperation and uniform laws in New England, the interstate cooperation commissions appear to be doing the most effective work. The New England Council and the Governors' Conferences are also doing fine work, but too often it is with very little action. Thus, it seems most imperative that the New England states continue to develop, aid, and strengthen these commissions by giving them more funds, technical assistance, etc. Finally, the writer would like to propose his own program for achieving uniform laws and cooperation between the New England states. First, it wou 1 d seem both possible and desirable for the six states to form a regional assembly of state administrative officers. These would include executive officers from various leading industries in New England, from the state government offices, and also some of the heads of the colleges. From these men with their wide experience, it should be possible to form a representative assembly which can study the existing situation in the region, evaluate methods, and devise ways and means of furthering interstate cooperation in New England. It would have a permanent secretariat such as the United Nations has, to handle various specialized tasks. Second, the effort must be made to stimulate interest and enthusiasm in the idea of cooperation and uniformity among those who have the power to act, namely, public officials, both legislators and administrators. Third, an educational program in the interests of uniformity and cooperative state action in New England must be unaugurated. The states all have funds which are used for propaganda activities and these could be used in a campaign to enlighten the young people, the white collar worker, and the ordinary laborer, of the seriousness of the move toward centralization. Fourth, and to the writer the most important method that the states should rely on to achieve cooperation, is the use of the interstate compact. The compact offers a way of constructive cooperation. It is binding, it provides for joint action, it need not be merely a legislative declaration; it may extend to any form of activity, executive, administrative, judicial, as well as legislative; and an interstate compact may be permanent, it cannot be brushed lightly aside. The compact could be utilized in many fields in New England, such as labor, penal problems, flood control, irrigation projects, conservation, etc. In whatever fields compacts are used, the complexities arising between subjects and between regions require a systematic approach. There must be a plan to prevent the hurried negotiation of emergency compacts made without reference to a coordinated program, since this would result in very unfortunate perceived legislative action. The regional assembly suggested by the writer offers one instrument for the coordination of compact programs as do the interstate commissions on cooperation. The accomplishments to date have been limited because we have not sensed fully the significance of the problem, and because we have not organized ourselves effectively to solve it. The policy of drift has failed. It is time to take stock of our needs, gather our resources, and proceed toward a more satisfactory solution. If we do not do this, we have only ourselves to blame if as many people fear, the states are ultimately reduced to mere administrative units in a vast centralized machine...|$|R
