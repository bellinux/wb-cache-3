40|$|The {{secondary}} air system {{of a modern}} gas or steam turbine is configured to satisfy a number of requirements, such as to purge cavities and maintain a sufficient flow of cooling air to key engine components, for a minimum penalty on engine cycle efficiency and specific fuel consumption. Advanced sealing technologies, such as brush seals and leaf seals, are designed to maintain pressures in cavities adjacent to rotating shafts. They offer significant reductions in {{secondary air}} parasitic leakage flows over the legacy sealing technology, the labyrinth seal. The <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> comprises a series of stacked sheet elements which are inclined relative to the radial direction, offering increased axial rigidity reduced radial stiffness, and good leakage performance. Investigations into <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> mechanical and flow performance have been conducted by previous researchers. However, limited understanding of the thermal behavior of contacting leaf seals under sustained shaft contact {{has led to the}} development of an analytical model in this study, which can be used to predict the power split between the leaf and rotor from predicted temperature rises during operation. This enables the effects of seal and rotor thermal growth and, therefore, implications on seal endurance and rotor mechanical integrity to be quantified. Consideration is given to the heat transfer coefficient in the leaf pack. A dimensional analysis of the <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> problem using the method of extended dimensions is presented, yielding the expected form of the relationship between seal frictional power generation, leakage mass flow rate and rotor temperature rise. An analytical model is derived which is in agreement. Using the derived leaf temperature distribution formula, the theoretical leaf tip temperature rise and temperature distributions are computed over a range of mass flow rates and frictional heat values. Experimental data were collected in high speed tests of a <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> prototype using the Engine Seal Test Facility at Oxford University.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the evaluation of}} Pressure Actuated <b>Leaf</b> <b>Seals</b> (PALS) technology readiness for shaft and shroud sealing in power generation and aerospace applications. Seal designs tested are prototypical and constructed using processes appropriate for volume production. Results include both static and dynamic seal leakage measurements running against a 5. 1 in (129. 54 mm) diameter smooth surface test rotor and another that simulates sealing against turbine blade shrouds. A further test was undertaken using a 2 D static rig that determined acoustic noise experienced during testing was attributed to leaves vibrating at their natural frequency {{as a result of}} inter-leaf gaps. The dynamic simulated shroud test includes steps, duplicating small discontinuities of adjacent shroud sealing surfaces and slots to inject air radially under the seal leaves as may occur between shrouds on blades {{with a high degree of}} reaction. Consistent seal performance over 15 hours confirms suitability for turbine blade tip applications. Controlled deflection of PALS leaves with operating differential pressure is effective for startup rub avoidance in service as well as conformal wear-in sizing of leaf tips with the rotor. Tested leaf tip wear-in of approximately 0. 010 in (0. 25 mm) against rotor discs without hard-face coating, shows potential to eliminate seal misalignment and run-out contributions to operating seal clearance. PALS design features prevent further rubbing contact with the operating rotor after initial wear-in sizing thereby sustaining a small effective seal clearance and prospects for long seal life. Measurements of rotor surface wear tracks from the wear-in process and endurance runs are included as well as rotor and leaf tip photos.

40|$|Turbine {{shaft seals}} are {{vulnerable}} to rubs caused by thermal distortion, mis-alignment and rotor dynamic vibration that are often not well understood. When seals rub as a machine is brought up to operating conditions performance is compromised due to increased seal leakage. Much effort has been extended {{in recent years to}} develop seals that mitigate those losses. This paper presents a seal design with segmented film riding runners capable of non-contacting seal operation during rotor transients. Operating differential seal pressure displaces seal leaves and attached runners toward the rotor surface until balanced by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift. Sufficient radial range of operation is provided to follow the rotor seal surface during transients while maintaining a small seal clearance. Seal design features and function will be described and illustrated along with analysis of forces and motions for a sample application. Planned modeling and testing will also be presented. This concept promises enhanced shaft sealing by combining a <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> structure that provides a large range of motion to avoid rubs during startup and shutdown with runner elements capable of generating hydrostatic and hydrodynamic lift forces to maintain shaft- seal separation during all rotor displacement transients.

40|$|Filament seals, such as {{brush seals}} and leaf seals, are {{investigated}} {{as a potential}} improved seal for gas turbine applications. As these seals operate {{in contact with the}} rotor, a good understanding of their stiffness is required in order to minimize seal wear and degradation. This paper demonstrates that the filament and complete seal stiffness is affected in comparable magnitudes by mechanical and aerodynamic forces. In certain cases, the aerodynamic forces can also lead to an overall negative seal stiffness which may affect stable seal operation. In negative stiffness, the displacement of the seal or rotor into an eccentric position causes a resultant force, which, rather than restoring the rotor to a central position, acts to amplify its displacement. Insight into the forces acting on the seal filaments is gained by investigating a <b>leaf</b> <b>seal,</b> which consists of a pack of thin planar leaves arranged around the rotor, with coverplates {{on either side of the}} leaf pack, offset from the pack surfaces. The <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> is chosen due to its geometry being more suitable for analysis compared to alternative filament seals such as the brush seal. Data from two experimental campaigns are presented which show a seal exhibiting negative stiffness and a seal exhibiting a stiffness reduction due to aerodynamic effects. An empirical model for the forces acting on leaf filaments is developed based on the experimental data, which allows separation of mechanical and aerodynamic forces. In addition a numerical model is developed to analyze the flow approaching the leaf pack and the interleaf flow, which gives an insight into the causes of the aerodynamic forces. Using the empirical and numerical models together, a full picture of the forces affecting leaf stiffness is created. Validation of the models is achieved by successfully predicting seal stiffness for a further data set across the full range of operating conditions. The understanding of aerodynamic forces and their impact on filament and seal stiffness allows for their consideration in <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> design. A qualitative assessment of how they may be used to improve seal operation in filament seals is given...|$|E

Leaf seals offer better performance than traditional labyrinth seals, giving lower leakage flows at design duties. However, for aero-engine applications, seal designs must be able to cope with relatively large off-design seal closures and closure uncertainties. The two-way coupling between temperatures of seal components and seal closures, through the frictional heat generated at the leaf–rotor interface when in contact, represents an important challenge for <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> analysis and design. This coupling can lead to leaf wear and loss, rotor overheating, and possibly to unstable sealing system behavior (thermal runaway). In this paper, we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element (FE) thermal analysis, and experimental data to characterize the thermal behavior of leaf seals. This sets the basis for a study of the coupled thermomechanical behavior. CFD is used to understand the fluid-mechanics of a leaf pack. The <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> tested at the Oxford Osney Laboratory is used for the study. Simulations for four seal axial Reynolds number are conducted; for each value of the Reynolds number, leaf tip-rotor contact, and clearance are considered. Distribution of mass flow within the leaf pack, distribution of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) at the leaf surface, and swirl velocity pick-up across the pack predicted using CFD are discussed. The experimental data obtained from the Oxford rig is used to develop a set of thermal boundary conditions for the leaf pack. An FE thermal model of the rig is devised, informed by the aforementioned CFD study. Four experiments are simulated; thermal boundary conditions are calibrated to match the predicted metal temperatures to those measured on the rig. A sensitivity analysis of the rotor temperature predictions to the heat transfer assumptions is carried out.

They are almost constantly making repetitive, deep dives, raising the question of when do they rest? One type of dive, the drift dive, characterized by a time-depth profile with a phase of lower than average descent speed is believed to be a resting dive. To examine the behaviour of seals during drift dives, we measured body position and three-dimensional diving paths of six juvenile seals. We found that seals rolled over and sank on their backs during the drift phase, wobbling periodically so that they resembled a falling <b>leaf.</b> This enabled <b>seals</b> to drastically slow their descent rate, possibly so that negatively buoyant seals can rest without ending up in the abyss.

40|$|Leaf seals are {{filament}} seals for use at static to rotating interfaces in {{the engine}} secondary air system. They offer reduced leakage rates and better off-design performance over conventional labyrinth seals. If compared with advanced brush seals, leaf seals are more compliant due to their lower stiffness and can withstand higher axial pressure differences. Although leaf seals can exhibit hydrodynamic air-riding, {{this is not always}} the case and seal–rotor contact can occur. As a result, friction between the leaf tips and the rotor causes heat generation and wear. To predict the diameter of the rotating shaft and the seal life, the shaft and seal interface temperature needs to be estimated. In the steady state, this is determined by the ratio of convective heat transfer through the seal to that through the shaft. To that end, the convective heat transfer characteristics of the flow over the shaft around the seal are required to build accurate thermal models. In this paper, the convective heat transfer coefficient (HTC) distribution in the close vicinity of a typical <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> is investigated in a new test facility.

40|$|Design {{approach}} for maximising contacting filament seal performance retention Ingo HJ Jahn Good sealing {{is a key}} requirement for modern efficient turbomachinery such as steam and gas turbines. A class of seals that promise better performance, compared to conventional labyrinth seals, are contacting filament seals such as brush, <b>leaf,</b> or finger <b>seal.</b> When new, these filament seals offer better performance; however, if poorly designed they wear excessively, resulting in leakages higher than a comparable labyrinth seal. This paper outlines a design methodology for selecting ideal contacting filament seal properties for a given operating cycle or set of operating cycles. Following this approach ensures the seal performs well, the seal retains its performance, and performance is retained if the operating cycle is altered. In the approach, the seals are described by four generic properties (stiffness, blow-down, cross-coupling, and build clearance), which are then used for a performance evaluation based {{on a number of}} test cycles. Once the ideal seal properties for a given operating cycle have been identified, a seal to match these can be designed. The approach is evaluated with a generic gas turbine cycle and recommendations for ideal contacting filament seal properties for this cycle are made...|$|R

Therefore, we measured the cuticular conductances for CO 2 and water vapor in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) leaves having various water potentials. The lower <b>leaf</b> surface was <b>sealed</b> to force all gas exchange through the upper surface, which was stoma-free. In this condition both gases passed through the cuticle, and the CO 2 conductance could be directly determined from the internal mole fraction of CO 2 near the compensation point, the external mole fraction of CO 2, and the CO 2 flux. The cuticle allowed small amounts of CO 2 and water vapor to pass through, indicating that gas exchange occurs in grape leaves no matter how tightly the stomata are closed. However, the CO 2 conductance was only 5. 7 % of that for water vapor. This discrimination against CO 2 markedly affected calculations of the mole fraction of CO 2 in leaves as stomatal apertures decreased. When the leaf dehydrated, the cuticular conductance to water vapor decreased, and transpiration and assimilation diminished. This dehydration effect was largest when turgor decreased, which suggests that cuticular gas exchange may have been influenced by epidermal stretching...|$|R
40|$|Leaf seals have {{previously}} been proposed as an improved filament seal for gas turbine engines. Recently, a {{phenomenon known as}} negative stiffness has been reported from experimental testing. Good understanding of this phenomenon is required to ensure stable interaction between the seal and the rotor. In negative stiffness the displacement of the seal or rotor into an eccentric position causes a resultant force, which, rather than restoring the rotor to a central position, acts to amplify its displacement. The seal consists of a pack of thin planar leaves arranged around the rotor, with coverplates {{on either side of}} the leaf pack, offset from its surface. It is notable that negative stiffness only occurs when certain geometric configurations of the coverplates are employed. This paper gives insight into the fluid phenomena that contribute to the negative stiffness effect through the creation of a general 2 -D model of the flow upstream of the leaf pack and between the leaves. These show that there is the capacity for the inertia force to be a significant contributor to the overall force acting on individual leaves depending on the coverplate configuration surrounding the leaf pack. The influence of a key parameter, coverplate height, is explored. Results from a test campaign with varying seal geometry are compared to the forces predicted by modeling to justify the proposed mechanisms for negative stiffness. The close agreement between the experimental and predicted data extends the previously published insight on negative stiffness to allow more general considerations for <b>leaf</b> <b>seal</b> design to be inferred...|$|E

There was no effect of P enrichment on the decomposition of either oak or maple leaf litter.

The 2005 edition was the second of two games played on December 29, 2005, with the Big 12's Oklahoma Sooners defeating the Pac-10's Oregon Ducks, 17-14, in a matchup of teams each with something to prove. The Ducks were playing to show that they deserved a BCS bowl bid, having gone 10-1 during the regular season (the only loss coming to the nation's top-ranked team, Southern California), while the Sooners, who had lost in the BCS championship game each of the past two years, were trying to show that they really were the team that came into the season ranked fifth in the USA Today coaches' poll and seventh in the AP writers' poll than the team that lost to Texas by 33. Although Oregon got off to an early 7-3 lead and held that lead for nearly half the game, 22:38, the offense was unable to muster much against an Oklahoma defense that recorded four sacks (two by junior defensive end C.J. Ah You), held the Ducks to 2.6 yards per carry, and allowed only six third-down conversions in 18 attempts. Rotating between Dennis Dixon and Brady Leaf (whose brother, Ryan, was once the quarterback for the San Diego Chargers and played in said stadium) at quarterback, as they had done since losing starter Kellen Clemens earlier in the year, the Ducks gained 244 passing yards on 44 attempts, but much of that came in the fourth quarter as the Sooners defense tired during two extended drives. Oregon managed little success on the ground, with their top rusher, senior Terrence Whitehead, going for only 42 yards. Oklahoma's offense played largely efficiently, gaining 365 yards, with redshirt freshman quarterback Rhett Bomar completing 59 percent of his passes for 229 yards and one touchdown (freshman Malcolm Kelly was the team's top receiver, hauling in seven Bomar throws for 78 yards). Sophomore Adrian Peterson led the way on the ground, accumulating 79 yards on 23 carries. In spite of their general success, Bomar and Peterson each provided Oregon hope, with Bomar's throwing an interception and Peterson's fumbling within a yard of the goal line. The Ducks, trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter, were unable to convert a first-down in the shadow of their own goal posts against the aggressive Sooners defense and thus failed to capitalize on the Peterson turnover. Their defense, though, stymied every Oklahoma drive in the fourth quarter, getting two more possessions for the offense, and Oregon drove 81 yards in 14 plays, with Brady Leaf's hitting Tim Day for a three-yard touchdown. Once more the Sooners offense failed to convert a third-down on their ensuing possession as the Ducks defense tightened, and, behind a resurgent Leaf, Oregon drove to the Oklahoma 19-yard-line before Sooners senior linebacker Clint Ingram intercepted a <b>Leaf</b> pass to <b>seal</b> the victory for the Sooners.|$|R
