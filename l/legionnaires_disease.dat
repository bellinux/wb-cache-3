50|$|L. cherrii {{and other}} Legionella species are {{considered}} to be intracellular bacteria that can cause major respiratory problems in humans. Infection occurs when a human host inhales the organism, which may be carried in humidified air. Distinguishing patients with <b>Legionnaire’s</b> <b>disease</b> is difficult because most are asymptomatic due to <b>Legionnaire’s</b> <b>disease</b> being similar to other types of pneumonia. Although L. pneumophila {{is the leading cause of}} <b>Legionnaire’s</b> <b>disease,</b> other Legionella species (such as L. cherrii) likely are capable of causing this disease. The cultural growth period for Legionellae is typically 3-4 days. Lung biopsy or bronchoscopy is not necessary to obtain a clinical isolate from a human patient. Plated acidification or using BCYE agar increases the level of selectivity and allows easier access to collecting a Legionella sample from an infected human’s sputum. Not much is known on how to treat <b>Legionnaire’s</b> <b>disease,</b> but one way could be to reduce the amount of biofilm production the bacteria create.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTFollowing {{the first}} {{outbreaks}} of <b>legionnaire's</b> <b>disease,</b> erythromycin {{emerged as the}} treatment of choice without the foundation of rigorous clinical trials. The number of therapeutic failures with erythromycin, {{as well as the}} side-effects and drug interactions, led to the consideration of other drugs such as the new macrolides and quinolones for the treatment of <b>legionnaire's</b> <b>disease</b> in the 1990 s. In this article, 19 studies in in-vitro intracellular models and seven animal studies that compared macrolides to quinolones were reviewed. Quinolones were found to have greater activity in intracellular models and improved efficacy in animal models compared with macrolides. No randomised trials comparing the clinical efficacy of the new macrolides and new quinolones have ever been performed. Three observational studies totalling 458 patients with <b>legionnaire's</b> <b>disease</b> have compared the clinical efficacy of macrolides (not including azithromycin) and quinolones (mainly levofloxacin). The results suggested that quinolones may produce a superior clinical response compared with the macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin) with regard to defervescence, complications, and length of hospital stay. Little data exist for direct comparison of quinolones and azithromycin...|$|R

50|$|For initial {{treatment}} in the nursing home, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic suitable for respiratory infections (moxifloxacin, for example), or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid plus a macrolide has been suggested. In a hospital setting, injected (parenteral) fluoroquinolones or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide could be used. Other factors {{that need to be}} taken into account are recent antibiotic therapy (because of possible resistance caused by recent exposure), known carrier state or risk factors for resistant organisms (for example, known carrier of MRSA or presence of bronchiectasis predisposing to Pseudomonas aeruginosa), or suspicion of possible Legionella pneumophila infection (<b>legionnaires</b> <b>disease).</b>|$|E

5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of <b>Legionnaire's</b> <b>Disease</b> in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; <b>Legionnaire's</b> <b>Disease</b> was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of <b>Legionnaire's</b> <b>Disease.</b> In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|R

Not expected to live, he was given experimental steroids and recovered. Because he could not bear the fact that three weeks had been erased from his memory, he reimagined, during a long convalescence, what his illness had been like. It became Raising the Dead. Its three parts are a retrospective on the 19th-century unanaesthetized mastectomy of the novelist Fanny Burney, who also had no advance notice of her operation; an account of his nursing care and his resurrection after being pronounced dead; and the period during which speaking was difficult from the prolonged endotracheal intubation and during which he experienced delusions about floating down the Nile and that his inflating bed was [...] "carnivorous." ...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{obtained}} by others who used direct immunofluorescence staining to demonstrate serological differences among strains of <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease</b> bacterium prompted {{this study of}} parameters influencing {{the ability of the}} indirect immunofluorescence test to detect human antibodies to <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease</b> bacterium. A total of 25 <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease</b> bacterium strains, representing four serogroups, were used as immunofluorescence antigens to test selected human sera. The use of diethyl ether in preparing the antigens was discontinued when it was found that titers against ether-killed group 2 (Togus 1 -like) antigens were impossible to determine. Instead, heat-killed suspensions of <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease</b> bacterium in 0. 5 % buffered normal chicken yolk sac were used to show the serogroup diversity of the strains and the serogroup specificity of the antibody response of some, but not all, patients with serological evidence of <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies suggest that multiple antigens should be used in serological tests for <b>Legionnaires</b> <b>disease.</b> Furthermore, the fact that some sera contain antibodies that bind equally well to strains of all four serogroups implies that demonstration of a fourfold increase in titer of paired sera when tested with a single antigen should not be interpreted as evidence of infection with a strain of the same serogroup...|$|E
