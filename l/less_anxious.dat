25|$|The League of Augsburg {{had little}} {{military}} power – the Empire and its Allies {{in the form}} of the Holy League were still busy fighting the Ottoman Turks in Hungary. Many of the petty princes were reluctant to act due to the fear of French retaliation. Nevertheless, Louis XIV watched with apprehension Leopold I's advances against the Ottomans. Habsburg victories along the Danube at Buda in September 1686, and Mohács a year later had convinced the French that the Emperor, in alliance with Spain and William of Orange, would soon turn his attention towards France and retake what had recently been won by Louis's military intimidation. In response, Louis XIV sought to guarantee his territorial gains of the Reunions by forcing his German neighbours into converting the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent settlement. However, a French ultimatum issued in 1687 failed to gain the desired assurances from the Emperor whose victories in the east made the Germans <b>less</b> <b>anxious</b> to compromise in the west.|$|E

In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was <b>less</b> <b>anxious</b> about how he was perceived by others. In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as executive producer (seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001), he became more of [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf". Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset [...] now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck." [...] Fans have dubbed this incarnation of the character [...] "Jerkass Homer". At voice recording sessions, Dan Castellaneta has rejected material written in the script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is [...] "boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose."

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the studies}} {{was to examine the}} role of {{implicit}} processes in aeronautical risk perception and risk taking. Background: Aeronautical decision making consists of both explicit processes (e. g., comparing options, seeking information) and implicit, or intuitive, processes (e. g., immediate affective reactions). The present studies utilized a novel methodology, adapted from studies in social cognition, {{to examine the relationship between}} general aviation pilots' implicit reactions toward risk and their involvement in hazardous events. Method: The Implicit Association Test was used to measure pilots' (Study 1 : N = 23; Study 2 : N = 32) implicit associations between good and bad weather conditions and perceptions of risk and anxiety. Results: There was a relationship between the pilots' implicit perceptions and previous involvement in hazardous aeronautical events as measured by D. R. Hunter's (1995, 2002) Hazardous Events Scale. The more weather-related hazardous events the pilots had been involved in, the less they associated implicit risk with adverse weather (Study 1) and the <b>less</b> implicitly <b>anxious</b> they were toward adverse weather (Study 2). Conclusion: The results show a relationship between implicit associations and risk-taking behavior. Application: Pilots may be involved in risk-taking behavior because they perceive less risk in, and are implicitly less afraid of, hazardous conditions. 11 page(s...|$|R

However, there has been little research done in the area of prospection, defined as the generation of mental representations of possible futures, and social {{anxiety disorder}}.
