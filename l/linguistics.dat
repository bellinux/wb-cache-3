5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to <b>linguistics.</b> For example, descriptive <b>linguistics</b> examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical <b>linguistics</b> develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, neurolinguistics studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational <b>linguistics</b> builds on theoretical and descriptive <b>linguistics</b> to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical <b>linguistics</b> relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E

5|$|Noam Chomsky (1928) {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish {{immigrants}} from Eastern Europe. Becoming academically involved {{in the field of}} <b>linguistics,</b> Chomsky eventually secured a job as Professor of Department of <b>Linguistics</b> & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the field of <b>linguistics,</b> he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy, the universal grammar theory, and the Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. He was particularly known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy and contemporary capitalism, and he {{has been described as a}} prominent cultural figure.|$|E

5|$|René Wellek (1903–1995) was an Austrian-born scholar {{from the}} structuralist Prague school of <b>linguistics,</b> {{studying}} under Vilém Mathesius. Wellek had training in classical literature and was fluent in several European languages, both Romance and Slavic. His theoretical training included the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, {{as used in}} Roman Ingarden's work, and the psychologically influenced <b>linguistics</b> of Karl Bühler. After Nazi Germany occupied Prague in 1939, Wellek fled London– {{where he had been}} teaching– for the United States, teaching at the University of Iowa under Norman Foerster.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called <b>linguistics.</b> Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in <b>linguistics</b> include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} language, <b>linguistics,</b> has been {{developing}} into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in India more than 2000 years ago, after {{the development of the}} Brahmi script. Modern <b>linguistics</b> is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his life}} Whorf was a {{chemical}} engineer by profession, {{but as a}} young man he took up an interest in <b>linguistics.</b> At first this interest drew him to the study of Biblical Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at <b>linguistics</b> conferences.|$|E

5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive <b>linguistics</b> interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive <b>linguistics</b> is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s Bánáthy began {{teaching}} courses in applied <b>linguistics</b> and systems science at San José State University. In 1962 {{he was named}} Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master's degree in psychology at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a doctorate in education for a transdisciplinary program in education, systems theory, and <b>linguistics</b> from the University of California in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the Society for General Systems Research. He published his first book, Instructional Systems, in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of <b>linguistics.</b> Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to <b>linguistics</b> insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{was founded}} on 28 December 1924, when about 75 {{linguists}} met to select officers, ratify a constitution, and present papers {{in order to facilitate}} communication within the field of <b>linguistics.</b> The foundational members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions. By 1935, half of the female foundational members had left the society—a rate similar to that of male members—largely due to the professionalization of the field of <b>linguistics</b> that disproportionately affected women as most worked outside of academia.|$|E
