5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E

You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of his school education, Rajinikanth continued to perform various {{jobs in the}} cities of Bangalore and Madras, including that of a coolie and carpenter, and finally ended up being recruited in the Bangalore Transport Service (BTS) as a bus conductor. He began {{to take part in}} stage plays after Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. During the time, he came across an advertisement issued by the newly formed Madras Film Institute which offered acting courses. Though his family was not fully supportive of his decision to join the institute, his friend and co-worker Raj Bahadur motivated him to join the institute and financially supported him during this phase. During his stay at the institute, he was performing in a stage play and got noticed by Tamil film director K. Balachander. The director advised him to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Tamil, a recommendation that Rajinikanth quickly followed.|$|E

5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} more common among {{speakers}} of tonal languages such as most dialects of Chinese or Vietnamese, which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same; e.g. Mandarin with four possible tonal variations, Cantonese with six, Southern Min with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six. Speakers of Sino-Tibetan languages {{have been reported to}} speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> a tonal language (and possibly also by infants when they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> a pitch-accent language). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.|$|E
25|$|Interlingua {{combines}} this pre-existing vocabulary with {{a minimal}} grammar {{based on the}} control languages. People with a good knowledge of a Romance language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the international scientific vocabulary can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of other languages can also <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using {{a small number of}} roots and affixes.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been a lot of {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E

25|$|Charles did not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{until the}} age of four nor to walk until eight, and was treated as {{virtually}} an infant until he was ten years old. His jaw was so badly deformed (an extreme example of the so-called Habsburg jaw) that he could barely speak or chew. Fearing the frail child would be overtaxed, his caretakers did not force Charles to attend school. The indolence of the young Charles was indulged {{to such an extent that}} at times he was not expected to be clean. When his illegitimate half-brother John of Austria the Younger obtained power by exiling the queen mother from court, he covered his nose and insisted that the king at least brush his hair.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards it was {{discovered}} that the flood predicted before the levee was breached had been a false alarm and the Mississippi River did not reach a high enough level to flood New Orleans, but the damage was done and many Isleños and black sharecroppers suffered the consequences, while the bankers' investments remained intact. The Isleños also fought in the World Wars; after World War II, the returning Isleño soldiers looked for work in the suburban areas of New Orleans that had developed along the Mississippi River, and many of them left Saint Bernard Parish in the 1940s and 1950s. Their children were raised in areas where English was the majority language and consequently they did not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> Spanish.|$|E
25|$|MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome, {{is marked}} by severe {{neurological}} symptoms. These include progressive dementia, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep {{for more than a}} few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and motor skill development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may never <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> In the syndrome's second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome's last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.|$|E

25|$|The officer {{commanding}} the Army of India was the Commander-in-Chief, India who {{reported to the}} civilian Governor-General of India. The title was used before {{the creation of a}} unified British Indian Army; the first holder was Major General Stringer Lawrence in 1748. By the early 1900s the Commander-in-Chief and his staff were based at GHQ India. Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to have a private income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily Hindi speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood, Claude Auchinleck and William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this {{agreement}} after he received the same message from two different sources: “You must <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating {{what seems to be the}} ordinary into another level of consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E

500|$|English, besides forming {{new words}} from {{existing}} words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years. The {{most commonly used}} words in English are West Germanic. The words in English learned first by children as they <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods {{of the development of}} Old English.|$|E
