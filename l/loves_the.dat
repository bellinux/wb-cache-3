5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she <b>loves.</b> <b>The</b> play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E
5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very {{gifted and}} {{she has her own}} {{individuality}} as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E

5|$|After {{sharing a}} romantic {{dance with the}} Beast ("Beauty and the Beast"), Belle discovers her father's predicament using the magic mirror. The Beast {{releases}} her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. Back at the village, Belle proves Maurice's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk.

With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.|$|E
5|$|Nier defeats the pair, with Emil sacrificing {{himself to}} ensure his friends' progress. The {{remaining}} group then defeats the Shadowlord. It is {{revealed that the}} Shadowlord's true identity is the Gestalt form of the Nier from the prologue; the Nier the player has been controlling {{for the majority of}} the game is his Replicant. Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she can hear the new Yonah inside her, and that she <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, VH1 {{broadcast}} a ten-part series entitled I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s. The series {{was adapted from}} a BBC series, first broadcast in 2000, in which current entertainers and pop-culture figures offered their take on the trends, events, and personalities of another decade. The success of VH1's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s, coupled with the growing nostalgia for ever-more-recent times, led the network to create a parade of similarly themed programs. These ranged from 2003's I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s, to further variants like I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s Strikes Back, I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s, and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '90s: Part Deux. More recently, VH1 premiered I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '80s 3-D and I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> '70s: Volume 2. So eager was the network {{to capitalize on the}} trend while it was hot, that it devoted a series to the 2000s, {{despite the fact that the}} decade had not yet ended (I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> New Millennium, broadcast in 2008, covered only the years 2000-2007). This was thought to be final installment of the series until 2014, when I <b>Love</b> <b>the</b> 2000s continued the format.|$|R

5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) is {{organizing}} {{the making of}} a time capsule, meant to be opened 50 years in the future and filled with items that encapsulate the spirit of Pawnee. A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he ever gets past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E
5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend the throne, but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

25|$|Stoppard has {{commented that}} he <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> medium of theatre for how 'adjustable' {{it is at}} every point, how unfrozen it is, {{continuously}} growing and developing through each rehearsal, free from the text.
