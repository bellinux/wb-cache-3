Gel electrophoretic analyses indicated a purity of about 90 %. The purified enzyme is {{remarkably similar to}} mammalian <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases</b> (EC 3. 4. 1. 1) both in chemical and in enzymatic properties.

The enzyme also liberates N-terminal amino acids from the insulin B chain. The pH optima for the hydrolysis of different substrates depend on the buffers used; highest reaction rates are generally obtained at pH 8. 5 to 10. 5.

Two <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases,</b> ruLap 1 and ruLap 2, and two dipeptidyl-peptidases, ruDppIV and ruDppV, were characterized and compared to orthologues secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus using a recombinant protein from Pichia pastoris. RuLap 1 is a 33 kDa nonglycosylated protein, while ruLap 2 is a 58 - 65 kDa glycoprotein. The hydrolytic activity of ruLap 1, ruLap 2 and A. fumigatus orthologues showed various preferences for different aminoacyl- 7 -amido- 4 -methylcoumarin substrates, and various sensitivities to inhibitors and cations. ruDppIV and ruDppV showed similar activities to A. fumigatus orthologues.

40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus grows well at {{neutral and}} acidic pH {{in a medium}} {{containing}} protein as the sole nitrogen source by secreting two different sets of proteases. Neutral pH favors the secretion of neutral and alkaline endoproteases, <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases</b> (Laps) which are nonspecific monoaminopeptidases, and an X-prolyl dipeptidase (DppIV). Acidic pH environment promotes the secretion of an aspartic endoprotease of pepsin family (Pep 1) and tripeptidyl-peptidases of the sedolisin family (SedB and SedD). A novel prolyl peptidase, AfuS 28, {{was found to be}} secreted in both alkaline and acidic conditions. In previous studies, Laps were shown to degrade peptides from their N-terminus until an X-Pro sequence acts as a stop signal. X-Pro sequences can be then removed by DppIV, which allows Laps access to the following residues. We have shown that at acidic pH Seds degrade large peptides from their N-terminus into tripeptides until Pro in P 1 or P' 1 position acts as a stop for these exopeptidases. However, X-X-Pro and X-X-X-Pro sequences can be removed by AfuS 28 thus allowing Seds further sequential proteolysis. In conclusion, both alkaline and acidic sets of proteases contain exoprotease activity capable of cleaving after proline residues that cannot be removed during sequential digestion by nonspecific exopeptidases...|$|R
40|$|Historically, peptidases {{have been}} {{considered}} as housekeeping proteins involved in protein degradation and amino acid turnover. However, recent work has highlighted the fact that peptidases, including aminopeptidases, have critical regulatory roles in the cell including modulation of growth, development and stress responses. Recently, plant <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases</b> (LAPs) have been recognized for their roles in modulation of late wound-responses and insect defense. While no known mechanism of action has been identified, LAPs were presumed to act through their aminopeptidase function to affect the stability, activity, or localization of a peptide and protein involved in defense. In my dissertation studies, I have identified two new molecular functions for plant LAPs as molecular chaperones and Cys-Gly dipeptidases. In addition, microarray analyses has demonstrated the tomato LAP-A regulates early and late wound responses both positively and negatively. In particular, microarray analyses identified two new sets of genes modulated by LAP-A: late wound dehydrins and Pathogenesis-Related 1. This study also provides evidence LAP-A may act though the negative regulator salicylic acid or the positive regulator hydrogen peroxide to modulate wound signaling. The role of LAP-A in glutathione metabolism is also discussed. Together this study has provided evidence that LAP-A's role in wound signaling and insect defense {{is more complex than}} initially anticipated and {{may be the result of}} LAP-A utilizing multiple functions (aminopeptidase, chaperone and/or Cys-Gly dipeptidase activities) in different environments and in response to different stresses...|$|R

The four genes were symbolized lap 1, lap 2, lap 3, and lap 4, and the corresponding enzymes LAPI, LAPII, LAPIII, and LAPIV. Both lap 1 and lap 4 were mapped to the left arm of chromosome XI, and lap 3 was mapped to the left arm of chromosome XIV. Strains which possessed {{only one of the}} four <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases</b> (LAPs) were constructed.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glutathione by the periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola produces hydrogen sulfide, {{which may}} play a role in the host tissue destruction seen in periodontitis. H 2 S production in this organism has been proposed to occur via a three enzyme pathway, γ-glutamyltransferase, cysteinylglycinase (CGase), and cystalysin. In this study, we describe the purification and characterization of T. denticola CGase. Standard approaches were used to purify a 52 -kDa CGase activity from T. denticola, and high pressure liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this molecule showed that it matches the amino acid sequence of a predicted 52 -kDa protein in the T. denticola genome data base. A recombinant version of this protein was overexpressed in and purified from Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly) with the same kinetics as the native protein. Surprisingly, because sequence homology indicates that this protein is a member of a family of metalloproteases called M 17 <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases,</b> the preferred substrate for the T. denticola protein is Cys-Gly (kcat/Km of 8. 2 μm– 1 min– 1) not l-Leu-p-NA (kcat/Km of 1. 1 μm– 1 min– 1). The activity of CGase for Cys-Gly is optimum at pH 7. 3 and is enhanced by Mn 2 +, Co 2 +, or Mg 2 + but not by Zn 2 + or Ca 2 +. Importantly, in combination with the two other previously purified T. denticola enzymes, γ-glutamyltransferase and cystalysin, CGase mediates the in vitro degradation of glutathione into the expected end products, including H 2 S.

The endopeptidases described to date will only produce peptides from host haemoglobin. In order to obtain free aminoacids for incorporation in malarial proteins the malarial parasite requires exopeptidases (i. e. aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases). Aminopeptidase activity was described in human malarial parasites Plasmodium falciparum rodent malarial parasites Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei. These enzymes were shown to be inhibited by the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin. In light of these findings, the antimalarial effects of bestatin were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Bestatin inhibited the in vitro growth of P. c. chabaudi, of chloroquine sensitive P. falciparum clone FCH 5. C 2 and chloroquine resistant P. falciparum clone K 1 /Thailand. P. chabaudi infection is naturally lethal to male mice whereas female mice develop protective immunity against a similar infection. In vivo investigation {{of the effects of}} bestatin showed that this aminopeptidase inhibitor could induce self-healing of P. c. chabaudi infection in male CD 1 mice. The aminopeptidase was purified by a combination of sizeexclusion HPLC and affinity chromatography and, alternatively, by a combination of size-exclusion HPLC and anion exchange chromatography. The aminopeptidase activity appears to be composed of four different aminopeptidases with an apparent monomeric molecular weight range of 60 to 70 kDa. Comparative studies of the inhibition of the P. c. chabaudi and porcine kidney aminopeptidase by bestatin indicate that the active site of the malarial aminopeptidase could differ to the mammalian aminopeptidase. Nucleotide probes/primers to clone this aminopeptidase(s) have been designed from the sequences of bestatin and metal ions binding site of several <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases.</b> This thesis shows that the malarial aminopeptidase is a potential chemotherapeutic target with bestatin and/or bestatin analogues as potential antimalarial drugs.

40|$|Background: Aphid {{infestation}} of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) has {{the potential}} to reduce yields and biomass quality. Although switchgrass-greenbug (Schizaphis graminum; GB) interactions have been studied at the whole plant level, little information is available on plant defense responses at the molecular level. Results: The global transcriptomic response of switchgrass cv Summer to GB was monitored by RNA-Seq in infested and control (uninfested) plants harvested at 5, 10, and 15 days after infestation (DAI). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infested plants were analyzed relative to control uninfested plants at each time point. DEGs in GB-infested plants induced by 5 -DAI included an upregulation of reactive burst oxidases and several cell wall receptors. Expression changes in genes linked to redox metabolism, cell wall structure, and hormone biosynthesis were also observed by 5 - DAI. At 10 -DAI, network analysis indicated a massive upregulation of defense-associated genes, including NAC, WRKY, and MYB classes of transcription factors and potential ancillary signaling molecules such as <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidases.</b> Molecular evidence for loss of chloroplastic functions was also detected at this time point. Supporting these molecular changes, chlorophyll content was significantly decreased, and ROS levels were elevated in infested plants 10 -DAI. Total peroxidase and laccase activities were elevated in infested plants at 10 -DAI relative to control uninfested plants. The net result appeared to be a broad scale defensive response that led to an apparent reduction in C and N assimilation and a potential redirection of nutrients away from GB and towards the production of defensive compounds, such as pipecolic acid, chlorogenic acid, and trehalose by 10 -DAI. By 15 -DAI, evidence of recovery in primary metabolism was noted based on transcript abundances for genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient assimilation. Conclusions: Extensive remodeling of the plant transcriptome and the production of ROS and several defensive metabolites in an upland switchgrass cultivar were observed in response to GB feeding. The early loss and apparent recovery in primary metabolism by 15 -DAI would suggest that these transcriptional changes in later stages of GB infestation could underlie the recovery response categorized for this switchgrass cultivar. These results can be exploited to develop switchgrass lines with more durable resistance to GB and potentially other aphids...|$|R

The superior enzyme localization {{is due to}} the more rapid rate of coupling of the hydrolysis product, 4 -methoxy- 2 -naphthylamine as compared to 2 -naphthylamine itself, and to the low lipid solubility and high substantivity for protein of the copper chelate of the dye formed on coupling with tetrazotized diorthoanisidine.

40|$|Original {{research}} {{direction is}} cloning the thermostable N- Carbamoyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase(nca) gene. Therefor, designing the degenerate primer {{is based on}} highly consensus amino acid sequence region from N- Carbamoyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase. To use of nested PCR with genomic DNA from thermophilic bacterium Bacillus kaustophilus CCRC 11223 and Bacilius sp. TS 23 as template DNA would find two fragments with 250 bp in length but different in DNA sequences. Using those DNA fragments was found in good alignment with conserved amino acid sequence region from the Agrobacterium radiobacter N- Carbamoyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase gene. The similarities of two DNA sequences from B. kaustophilus were 58 % and 60 %, and two other DNA sequences from Bacillus sp. TS 23 were 50 % and 56 % with A. rediobacter nca, respectivily. Using those DNA fragments as probe to screen two genomic libraries of B. kaustophilus and Bacillus sp. TS 23 would not find nca gene. So we use the B. kaustophilus DNA fragment obtained previously to design a pair of specific primers and screen B. kaustophilus genomic library with PCR amplification. But all were found only the leucine aminopeptidase(lap) (EC 3. 4. 11. 1) DNA fragments. To discus the reason, we find the last 7 nucleic acid bases on 3 '' end of designed primer was identical to the DNA sequence of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene. Because it is not found in any commercial application, and the thermostable <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> has its industrial potential. So we switch the reseach direction to clone the thermostable <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene. Using this DNA fragment of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> as probe to screen the thermostable <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene from B. kaustophilus genomic library. We got 2 pure clones that both contain the <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene. After DNA sequencing, we found {{they are the same}} sequence of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene. Then we transformed this gene into E. coli and found to expression the enzymatic activity of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase.</b> The ORF of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene is 1, 494 bp and translated into a peptide of 497 residues with molecule weight 53. 7 kDa and its enzyme was found to be intracellular. The similarity was found to be 62 % in amino acid sequence comparison between B. subtilus and B. kaustophilus. Amino acid alignment with the know lap genes were found this B. kaustophilus <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> has two zinc cneters. The B. kaustophilus <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> gene was cloned into pQE 30 vector and then expressed in E. coli Nova Blue. With the recovery of this pure enzyme, we find the optimal temperature is 65 ℃ and optimal pH is 10. In the situation with no metal, this enzyme was not found any catalytic activity. But the addition of Co 2 +、Mn 2 +及Ni 2 + will promote the enzymatic acyivity know as a metalloezyme.

TS 23 的染色體作為模版，利用Nested PCR，各可分別從染色體中找到兩種長度均為 250 bp之不同DNA序列片段，將其與Agrobacterium radiobacter N-Carbamoyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase胺基酸序列的高保留區域比對之相似度，源自B. kaustophilus DNA序列之片段為 58 %及 60 %，而源自Bacillus sp. TS 23 DNA序列之片段為 50 %及 56 %。然而以這些片段作為探針(probe) ，於B. kaustophilus 及Bacillus sp. TS 23 的染色體基因庫，進行篩選，均無法選殖到此基因。因此利用所得之B. kaustophilus DNA序列之片段設計primer，利用PCR方法由B. kaustophilus的染色體基因庫進行篩選，卻選殖到leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3. 4. 11. 1) 基因之片段，探討其成因，發現所設計之引子的 3 ''端末 7 個核酸序列與leucine aminopeptidase 基因上的核酸序列完全相同，而導致此結果。由於目前並無商業化耐熱性leucine aminopeptidase產品，而此耐熱性之leucine aminopeptidase卻有工業應用的潛力，因此將研究方向調整為選殖耐熱性之leucine aminopeptidase基因;隨後以此leucine aminopeptidase基因之片段，由B. kaustophilus library篩選耐熱性leucine aminopeptidase基因，共篩選出 2 個含有leucine aminopeptidase基因的純株(clone) 。經DNA定序後，發現是同一個leucine aminopeptidase基因。將此段基因選殖入 Escherichia coli 菌體內，可表現leucine aminopeptidase的活性。此 ORF 全長為 1, 494 bp，可轉譯出含 497 個胺基酸殘基的蛋白質、其分子量為 53. 7 kDa，為一胞內酵素。經過胺基酸殘基序列的比對，與B. subtilis <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> 的胺基酸相似度為 62 %，由文獻中已知之胺基酸序列進行比對得知此B. kaustophilus leucine aminopeptidase具有兩個zinc center。 將B. kaustophilus之leucine aminopeptidase ORF 選殖入pQE 30 載體，轉形入E. coli Nova Blue，回收此酵素，經酵素活性分析後，發現此酵素之最適反應溫度為 65 ℃，最適pH值為pH 10 ，在無金屬離子下則此酵素不具催化能力，而Co 2 +、Mn 2 +及Ni 2 +等離子能提昇酵素活性，顯示其可能是metalloezyme。L-leucine-p-nitroanilide為基質時，此酵素之Km為 0. 028 mM， Kcat為 7. 90 min- 1 。中英文摘要………………………………………………………… 2 前言………………………………………………………………… 5 材料與方法………………………………………………………… 8 一、菌株及質體………………………………………………… 8 二、藥品………………………………………………………… 8 三、E. coli質體DNA的抽取……………………………………… 9 四、DNA洋菜膠體電泳分析…………………………………… 10 五、DNA片段的回收與純化…………………………………… 11 六、DNA純度鑑定及定量分析………………………………… 11 七、退化型引子的設計………………………………………… 12 八、PCR反應…………………………………………………… 13 (1) PCR………………………………………………………… 14 (2) Nested PCR………………………………………………… 15 九、DNA黏接反應……………………………………………… 15 十、質體的轉形作用…………………………………………… 16 (1) 勝任細胞之製備…………………………………………… 16 (2) 轉形作用…………………………………………………… 16 十一、基因的選殖……………………………………………… 17 (1) 染色體DNA的抽取………………………………………… 17 (2) 染色體基因庫的建立……………………………………… 18 (3) 染色體基因庫的放大……………………………………… 20 (4) 含phagemid之噬菌體的大量釋出………………………… 21 (5) DNA探針的製備…………………………………………… 22 (6) 溶菌斑雜交法……………………………………………… 22 (7) 單一選殖株質體釋出法…………………………………… 24 (8) 限制西每圖譜之製作……………………………………… 25 (9) 南方轉漬雜交法…………………………………………… 25 十二、DNA序列分析…………………………………………… 27 (1) 單股DNA模板的製作……………………………………… 27 (2) DNA定序…………………………………………………… 28 (3) 定序膠體電泳分離………………………………………… 28 (4) primer extention……………………………………………… 30 十三、蛋白質之定量…………………………………………… 31 十四、蛋白質的電泳分析……………………………………… 32 十五、lap基因的表現…………………………………………… 34 (1) lap基因於B. kaustophilus內的表現…………………………… 34 (2) lap基因選殖入E. coli表現載體……………………………… 35 (3) lap基因的大量表現………………………………………… 35 (4) LAP的純化…. ……………………………………………… 36 (5) 呈色法測定酵素活性……………………………………… 37 十六、LAP性質之分析………………………………………… 38 (1) LAP最適反應溫度………………………………………… 38 (2) 金屬離子對LAP活性的影響……………………………… 38 (3) pH值對LAP活性的影響…………………………………… 38 (4) LAP對基質的選擇性……………………………………… 39 (5) LAP的酵素動力學分析…………………………………… 39 結果……………………………………………………………… 45 一、N-Carbamoyl-D-amino acid aminohydrolase基因的選殖…… 40 (一) N-Carbamoyl-D-amino acid aminohydrolase基因探針的 設計…………………………………………………………… 40 (二) B. kaustophilus染色體基因庫之構築……………………… 41 (三) nca基因的篩選…………………. ………………………… 42 (A) 溶菌斑雜交選殖………………………………………… 42 二、利用PCR由基因庫中選殖nca基因的片段………………… 43 三、lap基因的選殖……………………………………………… 43 (一) 溶菌斑雜交選殖…………………………………………… 43 (二) 含lap基因之DNA片段的限制西每圖譜…………………… 44 (三) DNA定序…………………………………………………… 45 四、lap基因在E. coli之表現……………………………………… 45 五、純化回收LAP酵素………………………………………… 46 六、蛋白質的電泳分析………………………………………… 47 七、LAP的生化特性…………………………………………… 47 (1) LAP酵素的最適反應溫度………………………………… 47 (2) 金屬離子對LAP酵素活性的影響………………………… 48 (3) pH值對LAP酵素活性的影響……………………………… 49 (4) LAP對基質的選擇性與酵素動力學分析… ……………… 49 討論……………………………………………………………… 50 一、B. kaustophilus LAP的胺基酸序列………………………… 50 二、金屬離子對LAP活性的影響……………………………… 50 三、LAP的大量表現…………………………………………… 51 四、LAP的最適反應溫度……………………………………… 52 五、pH值對LAP酵素活性的影響……………………………… 53 六、LAP對基質的選擇性與酵素動力學分析…………………. 53 圖表………………………………………………………………. 54 參考文獻………………………………………………………… 9...|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} {{chromatography}} on DEAE-Sephadex, two arylamidases (hydrolysing L-arginine 2 -naphthylamide) and three dipeptidyl peptidases (hydrolysing dipeptide 2 -naphthylamides) were distinguished in extracts of rat muscle. However, the arylamidase {{from the larger}} peak also hydrolysed the dipeptide 2 -naphthylamides. Glycyl-L-arginine amide, an alternative substrate for dipeptidyl peptidase I, was not hydrolysed by arylamidase. L-Leucine amide was hydrolysed by an enzyme, presumed to be <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase,</b> from a separate peak, but was also hydrolysed by arylamidase. Arylamidase, dipeptidyl peptidase III {{and most of the}} <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> could be extracted from the muscle with a neutral salt solution, but dipeptidyl peptidase I was extracted only in the presence of Triton X- 100; dipeptidyl peptidase II showed an intermediate extraction behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} gene for the Vibrio cholerae <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> (lap) was cloned and sequenced. The cloned DNA fragment contained a 1, 503 -bp {{open reading frame}} potentially encoding a 501 -amino-acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 54, 442 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the entire protein showed high homology with the sequence of Vibrio proteolyticus <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase.</b> The residues potentially involved in binding the zinc ions were completely conserved in the V. cholerae aminopeptidase {{as well as in}} the V. proteolyticus aminopeptidase. The recombinant protein was partially purified and characterized. The molecular mass was estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 34 kDa, suggesting a processing of the protein to acquire the mature form. The protease showed maximum activity at pH 9. 0 and was thermostable at 70 degrees C. The substrate leucyl-p-nitroanilide was cleaved by the protease, and its activity was inhibited by EDTA and bestatin. These results suggested that the protein was a <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase.</b> The PCR analysis of lap gene distribution showed that it was widely distributed among the V. cholerae strains.

40|$|The zinc {{hydrolase}} superfamily is a {{group of}} divergently related proteins that are predominantly enzymes with a zinc-based catalytic mechanism. The common structural scaffold of the superfamily consists of an eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by six α-helices. Previous analyses, while acknowledging the likely divergent origins of <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase,</b> carboxypeptidase A and the co-catalytic enzymes of the metallopeptidase H clan based on their structural scaffolds, have failed to find any homology between the active sites in <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase</b> and the metallopeptidase H clan enzymes. Here we show that these two groups of co-catalytic enzymes have overlapping dizinc centers where one of the two zinc atoms is conserved in each group. Carboxypeptidase A and <b>leucine</b> <b>aminopeptidase,</b> on the other hand, no longer share any homologous zinc-binding sites. At least three catalytic zinc-binding sites have existed in the structural scaffold over the period of history defined by available structures. Comparison of enzyme-inhibitor complexes show that major remodeling of the substrate-binding site has occurred in association with each change in zinc ligation in the binding site. These changes involve re-registration and re-orientation of the substrate. Some residues important to the catalytic mechanism are not conserved amongst members. We discuss how molecules acting in trans may have facilitated the mutation of catalytically important residues in the active site in this group...|$|E
