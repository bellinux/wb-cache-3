40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} diet and medication, either isolated or associated, on serum levels of uric acid in patients with hyperuricemia. METHODS: We studied patients from the Hypertension Unit of the University of Goias who had hyperuricemia (men > or = 8. 5 mg/dL and women > or = 7. 5 mg/dL). We divided the patients into three groups: G 1 (<b>low</b> <b>purine</b> diet), G 2 (<b>low</b> <b>purine</b> diet + medication), and G 3 (medication only). Patients received allopurinol, 150 mg/day titrated up to 300 mg/dL when necessary. Patients were evaluated with regards to their lifestyles (diet, smoking, physical, activity, alcohol consumption), uric acid, blood pressure, use of medication, body mass index, cholesterol, and triglyceride. Follow-up took place in weeks 0 (M 1), 6 (M 2), 12 (M 3) during the intervention and in week 36 (M 4) after the study was completed. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients participated in the study, 31 women, mean age 54. 4 ± 10. 6 years, body mass index 28. 6 ± 3. 9 kg/m². A similar reduction (p< 0. 001) in uric acid levels occurred in the three intervention groups. In week 36 (M 4), after 24 weeks without intervention, a tendency toward elevation of uricemia was noted in G 2 and G 3, and a continuous drop in uricemia was noted in G 1. No significant modifications were observed in the other variables analyzed. CONCLUSION: Considering the cost x benefit relationship, a diet <b>low</b> in <b>purine</b> should be the 1 st therapeutic option for controlling hyperuricemia in patients with similar characteristic to the ones presented in this study...|$|R

40|$|Isotopically labeled {{uric acid}} has been {{injected}} intravenously into normal subjects and subjects with various diseases {{in order to}} determine the pool size and turnover rate of body uric acid.

It was found that three times as much of the administered N 15 could be recovered in urinary uric acid in the gouty subject as in the two normal subjects studied. The gouty subject used in this initial study had been deliberately {{selected on the basis of}} his ex-cessive basal urinary uric acid excretion in order to determine whether increased basal urinary ex-cretion of uric acid, which has been found to oc-cur in about 25 per cent of all gouty subjects stud-ied (2), can properly be ascribed to overproduc-tion of uric acid.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop {{evidence}} based {{recommendations for}} the management of gout. METHODS: The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales. RESULTS: 12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; <b>low</b> animal <b>purine</b> diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0. 87 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 25 to 1. 50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1. 39 (0. 78 to 2. 01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1. 50 (0. 76 to 2. 24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is {{associated with the use of}} diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0. 5 - 1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

40|$|The enzyme xanthine: {{acceptor}} oxidoreductase {{found in}} rat heart equilibrates between three forms differing in electron acceptor specificity. Form D transfers electrons exclusively to NAD+ and ac-counts for 85 % of total oxidoreductase activity. Form O transfers electrons to molecular oxygen and accounts for 8 %. The D/O form prefers NAD+, but without NAD+ transfers electrons to oxygen. Interconversion from D to O and O to D forms is catalyzed by sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents: Cd 2 +, Cu 2 +, disulfiram, and heating with dithiothreitol. This suggests that sulfhydryl groups partici-pate {{in the first}} stage of enzyme conversion. The NADH/NAD+ concentration ratio may regulate the dehydrogenase activity of xanthine:acceptor oxidoreductase (NAD+-dependent activity of D and D/O forms).

Linkage analysis in a Dutch family and an Australian family {{suggested that the}} candidate gene maps to Xq 22. 1 -q 24. Oligonucleotide microarray expression profiling of fibroblasts from two probands of the Dutch family revealed reduced expression levels of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 gene (PRPS 1). Subsequent sequencing of PRPS 1 led to the identification of two different missense mutations, c. 455 T -> C (p. L 152 P) in the Dutch family and c. 398 A -> C (p. Q 133 P) in the Australian family.

40|$|Chromosomal aberrations {{in human}} gliomas are principally numerical. In tumours of low malignancy, karyotypes are {{frequently}} normal, but occasionally {{an excess of}} chromosome 7 {{and a loss of}} sex chromosome are observed. In highly malignant tumours, the most frequent aberrations are gain of chromosome 7, loss of chromosome 10 and less frequently losses or deletions of chromosomes 9, 22, 6, 13 and 14 or gains of chromosomes 19 and 20. To understand the meaning of these chromosome imbalances, the relationships between chromosome abnormalities and metabolic disturbances were studied. The losses or deletions observed affected principally chromosomes carrying genes encoding enzymes involved in purine metabolism. The activities of ten enzymes were measured: adenosine kinase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenylate kinase, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenylosuccinate lyase, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, adenosine deaminase, nucleoside phosphorylase and adenosine monophosphate deaminase. In parallel, two enzymes involved in pyrimidine metabolism, thymidine kinase and thymidylate synthase (TS), were studied. The activities of all these enzymes were measured on samples from 30 human primary glial tumours with low or high malignancy, six xenografted tumours at different passages, four portions of normal brain tissue and four non-glial brain neoplasms. As suggested by cytogenetic data, the enzymatic results showed a relatively <b>low</b> activity of <b>purine</b> metabolism in glial tumours when compared with normal brain and non-glial brain neoplasms. Considering the two enzymes involved in pyrimidine metabolism, only TS had higher activity in glial tumours of high malignancy than in normal brain. In comparison with normal brain, the balance between salvage and de novo pathways changes in gliomas, and even more in grafted tumours, in favour of de novo synthesis. The relation between chromosomes and metabolic imbalances does not correspond to a simple gene dosage effect in these tumours. These data suggest that the decrease of adenosine metabolism occurs before chromosomal aberrations appear, since it is observed in tumours of low malignancy when most karyotypes are still normal, and that the de novo pathway increases with tumour progression...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{factor p}} 53 {{is the most}} {{commonly}} altered gene in human cancer. As a redox-active protein {{in direct contact with}} DNA, p 53 can directly sense oxidative stress through DNA-mediated charge transport. Electron hole transport occurs with a shallow distance dependence over long distances through the π-stacked DNA bases, leading to the oxidation and dissociation of DNA-bound p 53. The extent of p 53 dissociation depends upon the redox potential of the response element DNA in direct contact with each p 53 monomer. The DNA sequence dependence of p 53 oxidative dissociation was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing both synthetic and human p 53 response elements with an appended anthraquinone photooxidant. Greater p 53 dissociation is observed from DNA sequences containing <b>low</b> redox potential <b>purine</b> regions, particularly guanine triplets, within the p 53 response element. Using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of irradiated anthraquinone-modified DNA, the DNA damage sites, which correspond to locations of preferred electron hole localization, were determined. The resulting DNA damage preferentially localizes to guanine doublets and triplets within the response element. Oxidative DNA damage is inhibited in the presence of p 53, however, only at DNA sites within the response element, and therefore in direct contact with p 53. From these data, predictions about the sensitivity of human p 53 -binding sites to oxidative stress, as well as possible biological implications, have been made. On the basis of our data, the guanine pattern within the purine region of each p 53 -binding site determines the response of p 53 to DNA-mediated oxidation, yielding for some sequences the oxidative dissociation of p 53 from a distance and thereby providing another potential role for DNA charge transport chemistry within the cell. To determine whether the change in p 53 response element occupancy observed in vitro also correlates in cellulo, chromatin immunoprecipition (ChIP) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to directly quantify p 53 binding to certain response elements in HCT 116 N cells. The HCT 116 N cells containing a wild type p 53 were treated with the photooxidant [Rh(phi) 2 bpy] 3 +, Nutlin- 3 to upregulate p 53, and subsequently irradiated to induce oxidative genomic stress. To covalently tether p 53 interacting with DNA, the cells were fixed with disuccinimidyl glutarate and formaldehyde. The nuclei of the harvested cells were isolated, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using magnetic beads conjugated with a monoclonal p 53 antibody. The purified immounoprecipiated DNA was then quantified via qPCR and genomic sequencing. Overall, the ChIP results were significantly varied over ten experimental trials, but one trend is observed overall: greater variation of p 53 occupancy is observed in response elements from which oxidative dissociation would be expected, while significantly less change in p 53 occupancy occurs for response elements from which oxidative dissociation would not be anticipated. The chemical oxidation of transcription factor p 53 via DNA CT was also investigated with respect to the protein at the amino acid level. Transcription factor p 53 plays a critical role in the cellular response to stress stimuli, which may be modulated through the redox modulation of conserved cysteine residues within the DNA-binding domain. Residues within p 53 that enable oxidative dissociation are herein investigated. Of the 8 mutants studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), only the C 275 S mutation significantly decreased the protein affinity (KD) for the Gadd 45 response element. EMSA assays of p 53 oxidative dissociation promoted by photoexcitation of anthraquinone-tethered Gadd 45 oligonucleotides were used to determine the influence of p 53 mutations on oxidative dissociation; mutation to C 275 S severely attenuates oxidative dissociation while C 277 S substantially attenuates dissociation. Differential thiol labeling was used to determine the oxidation states of cysteine residues within p 53 after DNA-mediated oxidation. Reduced cysteines were iodoacetamide labeled, while oxidized cysteines participating in disulfide bonds were 13 C 2 D 2 -iodoacetamide labeled. Intensities of respective iodoacetamide-modified peptide fragments were analyzed using a QTRAP 6500 LC-MS/MS system, quantified with Skyline, and directly compared. A distinct shift in peptide labeling toward 13 C 2 D 2 -iodoacetamide labeled cysteines is observed in oxidized samples as compared to the respective controls. All of the observable cysteine residues trend toward the heavy label under conditions of DNA CT, indicating the formation of multiple disulfide bonds potentially among the C 124, C 135, C 141, C 182, C 275, and C 277. Based on these data it is proposed that disulfide formation involving C 275 is critical for inducing oxidative dissociation of p 53 from DNA. ...|$|R
