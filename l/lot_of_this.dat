5|$|The Basingstoke Canal {{started at}} a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran {{alongside}} the River Loddon following {{the line of}} Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around {{the eastern edge of}} Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.|$|E

A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> had been attributed to lack of team chemistry and injuries to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, Livingston, and Kaman. Players such as Luke Jackson, Alvin Williams, and Doug Christie were signed to 10-day contracts to help solidify the team's bench.|$|E

25|$|Substances {{containing}} {{natural radioactivity}} {{are known as}} NORM (Naturally occurring radioactive material). After human processing that exposes or concentrates this natural radioactivity (such as mining bringing coal to the surface or burning it to produce concentrated ash), it becomes technologically enhanced {{naturally occurring radioactive material}} (TENORM). A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> waste is alpha particle-emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The main source of radiation in the human body is potassium-40 (40K), typically 17 milligrams in the body at a time and 0.4 milligrams/day intake. Most rocks, due to their components, have a low level of radioactivity. Usually ranging from 1 millisievert (mSv) to 13mSv annually depending on location, average radiation exposure from natural radioisotopes is 2.0mSv per person a year worldwide. This makes up the majority of typical total dosage (with mean annual exposure from other sources amounting to 0.6mSv from medical tests averaged over the whole populace, 0.4mSv from cosmic rays, 0.005mSv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing, 0.005mSv occupational exposure, 0.002mSv from the Chernobyl disaster, and 0.0002mSv from the nuclear fuel cycle).|$|E
25|$|The {{forest reserve}} was set aside as a {{national}} park in 1929, officially declared Riding Mountain National Park on May 30, 1933. The park opened to visitors on July 26 of that year, with Manitoba Lieutenant-Governor James D. McGregor unveiling a cairn and giving a speech at a dedication ceremony. In attendance were Manitoba Premier John Bracken, Minister of Natural Resources J. S. McDiarmid, and Thomas G. Murphy, Minister of the Interior. According to the Winnipeg Evening Tribune, over one thousand vehicles were registered at various park entrances and over four thousand people had been admitted inside the park forty-five minutes after McGregor arrived. Ten thousand people in total attended the ceremony, where the Clear Lake site was designated Wasagaming. Much of the public infrastructure in Riding Mountain National Park was created during the 1930s by labourers participating in Canada's great depression relief programs. In total there were ten relief camps supervised by James Wardle. Funding for these relief programs {{was provided by the}} 1930 Unemployment Relief Act and the 1934 Public Works Construction Act. In 1932 most relief workers were British and over half were from Winnipeg. At this time the -storey interpretive centre and several other buildings were built of log, many featuring a rustic architectural style. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> early construction survives to this day.|$|E

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

[...] On 26 December, at the Teatro Regio Ducal (Milan's great opera {{house at the}} time), Wolfgang directed the first public performance [...] from the keyboard, dressed for the occasion in a scarlet coat lined with blue satin and edged with gold. The occasion was a triumph: the audience demanded encores and at the conclusion cried [...] "Evviva il maestro!" [...] (Long live the master!). The opera ran for 22 performances, and the Gazetta di Milano praised the work handsomely: [...] "The young maestro di capella, who is not yet fifteen years of age, studies the beauties of nature, and represents them adorned with the rarest musical graces." [...] The arias sung by Bernasconi [...] "vividly expressed the passions and touched the heart". Subsequent reactions to the opera proved less effusive; there are no records of further performances of Mitridate before its revival in Salzburg in 1971.|$|E

Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriageâ€“ because {{at the end of the}} day, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ends up being taxes and who can visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with itâ€“ so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E

Commenting on the album's gospel content, Hill stated [...] "Gospel music is music {{inspired}} by the gospels. In a huge respect, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> music {{turned out to be}} just that. During this album, I turned to the Bible and wrote songs that I drew comfort from." [...] Several of the album's songs, such as [...] "Lost Ones," [...] "Superstar," [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] and [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] were widely speculated as direct attacks at Fugee members Wyclef and Pras. [...] "Ex-Factor" [...] was originally intended for a different artist, however, Hill decided to keep it after it was completed, due to its personal content.

He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?â€”These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
