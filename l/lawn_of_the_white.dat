25|$|The South Lawn at the White House in Washington, DC, {{is located}} {{directly}} {{south of the}} house, and is bordered on the east by East Executive Drive and the Treasury Building, and on the west by West Executive Drive and the Old Executive Office Building, and along its curved southern perimeter by South Executive Drive and a large circular public lawn called The Ellipse.

25|$|Shortly thereafter, the Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed the}} bill without amendment on July 20, 2006 by a 98–0 vote. However, {{in an unprecedented}} event for a bill that passed unanimously out of committee, Senators of only one political party, Republicans, signed onto the bill's Senate committee report, and the report was not filed until six days after the bill's passage. The Senate report differed in significant ways from the House report, and in their own statement, Senate Democrats objected to parts of the Senate report that they believed highlighted evidence that could jeopardize the bill's constitutionality. The day after the committee report was filed, President George W. Bush signed the bill in a morning ceremony on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House on July 27, 2006, one year {{in advance of the}} 2007 expiration date.

25|$|On 25 July 1993, Israel {{carried out}} a week-long {{military}} operation in Lebanon to attack Hezbollah positions. On 13 September 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords (a Declaration of Principles) on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. The principles established objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim Palestinian Authority, {{as a prelude to}} a final treaty establishing a Palestinian state, in exchange for mutual recognition. The DOP established May 1999 as the date by which a permanent status agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect. In February 1994, Baruch Goldstein, a follower of the Kach party, killed 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, which became known as the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Kach had been barred from participation in the 1992 elections (on the grounds that the movement was racist). It was subsequently made illegal. Israel and the PLO signed the Gaza–Jericho Agreement in May 1994, and the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities in August, which began the process of transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians. On 25 July 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the Washington Declaration, which formally ended the state of war that had existed between them since 1948 and on 26 October the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace, witnessed by U.S. President Bill Clinton.|$|E

Students, teachers, and professionals from the fields of astronomy and the private sector of space exploration were invited to attend. One notable participant was Ahmed Mohamed, a Texas high school student who assembled a makeshift clock at home, brought it to school, and was detained and questioned by police after a teacher thought it resembled a bomb. In the wake of subsequent publicity, President Obama tweeted an invitation to Mohamed to visit the White House with his [...] "cool clock". Obama Administration staff urged him to attend Astronomy Night, with Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling the incident a [...] "teachable moment" [...] and Science Advisor John Holdren extending a formal invitation.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, two {{collaboration}}s with Waylon Jennings were released;WWII in 1982, and Take {{it to the}} Limit, another {{collaboration with}} Waylon Jennings was released in 1983. In the mid-1980s, Nelson, Jennings, Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash formed The Highwaymen, who achieved platinum record sales and toured the world. Meanwhile, he became more involved with charity work, such as singing on We are the World in 1984. In 1985, Nelson had another success with Half Nelson, a compilation album of duets {{with a range of}} artists such as Ray Charles and Neil Young. In 1980, Nelson performed on the south <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. The concert of September 13 featured First Lady Rosalynn Carter and Nelson in a duet of Ray Wylie Hubbard's [...] "Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother". Nelson frequently visited the White House, where according to the biography by Joe Nick Patoski, Willie Nelson: An Epic Life, he smoked marijuana on the White House roof.|$|E
2500|$|The White House {{and grounds}} cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the {{construction}} of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, which was graded and planted by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built {{on the west side of}} the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. The general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by [...] President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband's assassination. On the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building, came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson. Michelle Obama planted the White House's first organic garden and installed beehives on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.|$|E
