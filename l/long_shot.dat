5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was released on July 29, 2015 through the official Japanese Warner Bros. channel on YouTube. It opens with a blurred <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> of the band sitting on a couch, and as the music starts, it has them performing in a warehouse surrounded with music gear and ornaments. Intercut shots of vocalist Ichigo surrounded with construction tape appears during the songs verses, whilst Kyoudan is seen performing the guitar during instrumental breaks on a tank. The video ends with a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> of the group standing in the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Now, you can win. You {{will not}} be a favorite; you'll be rather a <b>long</b> <b>shot.</b> But given luck and money and {{a hell of a lot}} of work, you can win... but for Christ's sake don't commit suicide with no dough... Maybe you can't crucify mankind on a cross of gold, but you can sure as hell crucify a statewide {{candidate}} upon a cross of no-gold.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina had {{chances to}} equalise {{in the second}} half, with a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> from {{substitute}} Matías Fernández tipped over the crossbar by Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Iličić missing a one-on-one. The team also brought on Rossi in place of Joaquín after 72 minutes, his first action since his injury in January. Despite being reduced to ten men {{for the last ten}} minutes after a second booking for Gökhan Inler after he fouled Iličić, Napoli extended their lead in injury time when substitute Mertens scored a third after being set up by Callejón.|$|E

5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams {{moved to}} his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He made up for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E
5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a <b>long</b> <b>shot,</b> but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5–3.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{went into}} {{the final day of}} the {{competition}} knowing a draw was enough to win the Emirates Cup. Alexandre Lacazette started for Arsenal, as did Mesut Özil, while Ben Yedder continued to lead the line for Sevilla in a front three – either side of Nolito and Joaquín Correa. After an uneventful first half which saw both sides create few chances, Sevilla took the lead when Ben Yedder's reverse ball found an incoming Correa who slotted the ball past Petr Čech. Lacazette equalised for Arsenal, but the hosts went behind again after Steven N'Zonzi's <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> looped into the far top corner. Sevilla held on to win, but despite a 100% record they finished second because Arsenal's points and goal difference was identical to theirs, and the Spanish club had scored fewer goals over the two days.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 hockey season, Schenn {{attended}} training camp with the Kings, but was considered a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> to make the team. Schenn was returned to Brandon after being one of the last cuts at camp. He served as Brandon's captain for the 2009–10 WHL season. During the season, Schenn again represented the WHL in the Canada-Russia Challenge series. He finished the regular season with 99 points (34 goals, 65 assists) in 59 games, which tied him for fourth overall in WHL scoring with teammate Matt Calvert. Schenn was named to the WHL Eastern Conference First All-Star Team.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E

5|$|When Harding {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1920 he was considered a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General Leonard Wood, could not gain the needed majority, and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a front porch campaign, remaining {{for the most part}} in Marion and allowing the people to come to him. He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs, running on a theme of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one <b>long</b> <b>shot.</b> The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

Because of a positive track take, the expected returns of any strategy stay negative and so any agent must vanish in the long run.

This relative advantage results in overvaluation of <b>long</b> <b>shots...</b>|$|R

5|$|Though {{the loss}} to Miami knocked the Hokies out of {{contention}} for the Big East championship and its accompanying automatic BCS bid, there was the possibility that Tech could receive an at-large BCS game bid if it scored high enough in the final BCS poll and the administrators of a BCS game wanted to invite the Hokies. Tech was considered a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> due to the availability of Oregon State and Notre Dame, two teams with large followings that would attract greater television revenue and ticket sales. Gator Bowl officials made plans based on different possibilities. If Virginia Tech was selected for a BCS bowl but Notre Dame was not, the Fighting Irish would play in the Gator Bowl. If both were selected, Big East No. 3 Pittsburgh would be given the nod for the Gator Bowl. On December 3, the BCS selections were announced: The Fiesta Bowl selected No. 5 Oregon State and No. 10 Notre Dame instead of No. 6 Virginia Tech. This left the Hokies available for the Gator Bowl, which picked them on the next day.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Vanbiesbrouck {{was named}} to the All-Star Game. In the game, he played the second period and gave up three goals on seven shots. The Panthers were in playoff {{position}} {{for more than half of}} the season, but faltered late in the season and were close to falling out of the playoff race. Late in the season Vanbiesbrouck shutout the New Jersey Devils putting Florida into the playoffs. At the end of the regular season he played in 57 games posting a 21–25–11 with 2 shutouts. His games played ranked him tenth in the league while his GAA of 2.68 was ninth. In the first round Florida defeated the Boston Bruins in five games. Their second round match-up was against the heavily favored Philadelphia Flyers. Vanbiesbrouck posted a shutout in the first game of the series, the third post season shutout of his career and the first in Panthers playoff history. During the series Vanbiesbrouck held the Flyers scoreless for 116:46 straight minutes, as Florida upset Philadelphia winning four games to two. In the Conference Finals the Panthers were again huge underdogs to the Pittsburgh Penguins, a team that featured the leagues two top scorers in Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr. The Penguins took a 3–2 series lead, but the Panthers won game six 4–3 to force game seven. In game 7 Vanbiesbrouck made 39 saves in a 3–1 Panthers victory, winning the Eastern Conference and putting them in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Panthers fell behind the Colorado Avalanche 3–0 in the series. Game four was considered one of the classic games in finals' history. The game was a 0–0 tie entering the third overtime period. Early in the period, a <b>long</b> <b>shot</b> from Colorado's Uwe Krupp eluded Vanbiesbrouck giving the Avalanche a 1–0 win and the Stanley Cup.
