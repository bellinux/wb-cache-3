I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the <b>latest</b> <b>vegetable</b> alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge." ...|$|R
60|$|I don’t think I saw Judkin {{more than}} three times all told, and always the lane was our point of contact; but as the roan mare was taking me to the station one heavy, cloud-smeared day, I passed a dull-looking villa that the groom, or instinct, told me was Judkin’s home. From beyond a hedge of ragged elder-bushes could be heard the thud, thud of a spade, with an {{occasional}} clink and pause, as if some one had picked out a stone and thrown it to a distance, and I knew that he was doing nameless things to the roots of a pear tree. Near by him, I felt sure, would be lying a large and <b>late</b> <b>vegetable</b> marrow, and its largeness and lateness would be a theme of conversation at luncheon. It would be suggested that it should grace the harvest thanksgiving service; the harvest having been so generally unsatisfactory, it would be unfair to let the farmers supply all the material for rejoicing.|$|R

40|$|Aiming at {{developing}} ways {{to produce}} organic GMO-free seeds, trials on different vegetable species {{were conducted in}} lightweight tunnels. Organic vegetable seed production is possible in Denmark {{for some of the}} <b>late</b> maturing <b>vegetable</b> species - when performed in tunnels. At the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS) different growing systems in tunnel have been studied in both open pollinated and hybrid carrot (Daucus carota L.) for seed production. Tunnel production of carrot increases yield and germination percentages compared to normal field conditions and yields in the range of 100 – 250 g seeds/m 2 can be obtained. The lightweight tunnel production system can be widely used and modified for small-scale producers also in developing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{vegetable}} seed production {{is possible in}} Denmark {{for some of the}} <b>late</b> maturing <b>vegetable</b> species – when performed in tunnels. At the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS) different growing systems in tunnels have been studied in carrot (Daucus carota L.), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. oleracea) and leek (Allium porrum L.). Tunnel production of carrot and leek seeds increases yield and germination percentages compared to normal field conditions. Yields in the range of 100 - 250 g seeds/m 2 can be obtained in both species. A hybrid cauliflower seed production is possible in tunnels with a yield range of 9. 7 - 67. 6 g seeds/plant. In cauliflower problems with fungi on the seed and a resulting low germination percentage often occur and improved ways to reduce these problems are needed. The lightweight tunnel production system can be widely used and modified for small-scale producers in e. g. developing countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the <b>latest</b> progress for <b>vegetable</b> oil-based polyurethanes {{mainly from the}} view of thermoset and thermoplastic. Firstly, the modification methods for traditional thermoset polyurethane are introduced, including physical modification methods (filling and alloying) and chemical modification methods (copolymerization grafting, crosslinking and interpenetrating polymer network). Materials used for physical modification mainly contain inorganic materials such as SiO 2 and organic substances such as cellulose. Grafting copolymerization of styrene, acrylate and other monomers with polyurethane is the main method of chemical modification. The characteristics, preparations and application fields of thermoplastic polyurethane are reviewed, and the preparations, performances and applications of oleic acid-based thermoplastic polyurethane are chiefly presented. The development prospects of vegetable oil-based polyurethane are put forward. Surface-initiated living polymerization and other methods are used to controllable chemical modification of the traditional thermoset polyurethane and click chemistry method is uesd to promote multi-functionalization of the thermoplastic polyurethane...|$|R
40|$|Since the <b>late</b> 1990 ’s <b>vegetable</b> oils {{have been}} conquering an {{increasing}} {{importance in the}} world. In virtue of reducing the CO 2 emissions and promoting regional development, the biodieselemerges as a viable alternative. Hence this articleappraises the productivity of vegetable oil forthe production of biodiesel in the Zona da Mata Mineira over the period 2005 / 2006, using theexploratory spatial data analysis. In order to measure the productive potential of vegetable oil atthe regional level, one calculates the content of oil for each vegetable and these contents aresummed up to obtain the total of vegetable oil. Clusters were identified {{for the production of}}vegetables both the high efficiency and low efficiency. The finding reveal the possibility ofgenerating jobs in most regions within Zona da MataMineira. Hence one observes the plantation ofvegetables for the production of biodiesel is highly viable in the Zona da Mata Mineir...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s {{and provided a}} safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants. Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at {{the time for the}} unit was a deep freeze. These devices, or appliances, did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II. The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic defrosting and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though environmental issues led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the <b>late</b> 1920s fresh <b>vegetables</b> were successfully processed through freezing by the Postum Company (the forerunner of General Foods), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to Clarence Birdseye's successful fresh freezing methods.|$|R
40|$|Some {{vegetable}} seeds need {{a very long}} time to germinate. In these kinds of seeds the second phase of germination is very long. As acetylene’s chemical structure is almost similar to the gaseous hormone ethylene, its’ physiological effect on seed germination should be very similar as well. Therefore, an experiment was established in order to enhance seed germination, by treating seeds with acetylene released from interaction of calcium carbide (CaC 2) with water (H 2 O). A simple system was designed for efficient and proper use of gaseous acetylene resulted from the two substrates interaction, which conducted the produced gas obtained inside the interaction chamber into a sealed container wherein seeds were floating in water. This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of one concentration of acetylene with different exposure periods (between 1 to 8 hours) on parsley, celery and Swees chard seeds’ germination (chosen as <b>late</b> germinating <b>vegetables).</b> The effect of acetylene on seed germination speed and percent was investigated. There were significant differences in both percent and speed of germination within the various treatments. By floating for 3, 5 and 3 hours for parsley, celery and Swiss chard respectively, the highest germination rates were observed. The highest germination speed was achieved by 5, 5 and 3 hours floating respectively for parsley, celery and Swiss chard. Based on the results obtained, the current experiment suggests that acetylene has positive effect on enhancing seed germination of named vegetables, and played the role of ethylene, its effects resembling in regard to seed germination process. </p...|$|R
50|$|It {{was in the}} mid-1940s that Rev. Brown and a {{few others}} started to hold worship {{services}} from house to house. They most often met in a 2-story house on Henry Avenue across from Moseley’s Store. Rev. Brown and Rev. Moseley managed to secure a plat of land on the corner of 12th Street, NW and Rosser Avenue. In 1947, it was there that Rev. Brown constructed Holy Temple Church of God in Christ, his first major non-residential building. Soon after building the church, Brown met E. R. Martin. After doing a number of jobs for Martin who owned a lot of property, a deal was struck that made Brown the owner of several acres of land on 12th Street, NW. It was there that he built what would become the “family home.” The land had been a dumping area on a dead end street. However, the location was ideally suited for Brown and his family that had swelled to 5 daughters and 5 sons. Brown seemingly could not get away from farming. He maintained huge gardens and several pigs until the <b>late</b> 1950s. The <b>vegetables</b> from the gardens were shared with church members and neighbors alike. Brown eventually built and sold 4 more houses on the same block. Most of the houses were constructed of cinder block with 2 front dormers for less than $10,000. In 2006, some 45-50 years later, the average market price was $190,000.|$|R
