The use of smartphones and tablets have made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> interactions of children at this age with technology much more intuitive and made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>of</b> previous research of less impor-tance. That said, these devices also pose new usability considerations which have to be addressed. In addition, not all proposed evaluation methods are suitable for evaluat-ing games. As even with careful heuristic evaluations some product-specific problems remain undiscovered until children start using the product, {{it is better to}} involve chil-dren in evaluations as early as possible. Therefore, we present guidelines compiled from literature and describe our experience during the evaluation phase of our mobile game ”Hamza ” for teaching preschoolers the Arabic Alphabet. ...|$|R

5000|$|Phytic acid is {{also known}} to bond with many {{different}} minerals, and by doing so prevents those minerals from being absorbed; making phytic acid an anti-nutrient. There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> with phytic acids in nuts and seeds because of its anti-nutrient characteristics. In preparing foods with high phytic acid concentrations, it is recommended they be soaked in after being ground to increase the surface area. [...] Soaking allows the seed to undergo germination which increases the availability of vitamins and nutrient, while reducing phytic acid and protease inhibitors, ultimately increasing the nutritional value. Cooking can also {{reduce the amount of}} phytic acid in food but soaking is much more effective.|$|E

Since it was a Clear Channel satellite station, the lineup was dominated mainly by Clear Channel programming.

In his interviews to Leonid Filatov he characterized modern times as «corrupted», «a collapse of culture and morals», and modern cinema — as «a cigarette butt's art».

50|$|In 1988, the Ugandan {{government}} {{launched a}} comprehensive program {{in response to the}} country's high fertility and growth rates, which adversely affected per capita incomes and threatened the sustainability of social services. The major goal was to increase the contraceptive rate from 5 percent to 20 percent by 2000. The services for birth control in Uganda are now accessible at clinics and are operated by the Family Planning Association of Uganda. Contraceptives like condoms helped to reduce the rate of HIV/AIDS in Uganda, but there are still a significant number of unwanted pregnancies leading to abortion. There was direct support provided in the government's policy on contraceptive use, and since 1995, 8 percent of married women aged 15 to 49 use contraception. The total fertility rate from 1995 to 2000 was 7.1, and the age specific fertility rate per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 from 1995 to 2000 was 180. The government has shown a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> for the morbidity and mortality resulting from induced abortion, but there has been a number of complications in childbearing and child birth. In Uganda, the female life expectancy at birth from 1995 to 2000 was 40.4 percent.|$|E

He said [...] "When I was involved and worked for Gearheart Australia and we were shooting wells in 1983 and 1984, we worked alongside Halliburton to complete those jobs." [...] He went on to describe the process of fracking as he had witnessed it at the time, before discussing water issues: [...] "There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> obviously, about possible contamination—whether it is groundwater contamination or freshwater contamination—and the last thing oil companies want (the last thing anyone wants) is shooting off site because when you are shooting oil and gas, {{you do not want to}} shoot water... There has been a lot of emotion, and I concur with the member for Waite's comments that, yes, we do need to get on with the job, we do need to be careful, and we do need to make sure we have the appropriate environmental management and the appropriate water management. But I can assure you—and I know very much from experience—the last thing people want to do is make a mistake in these jobs."He concluded his presentation by supporting the expansion of the practise in South Australia by saying:"We do have to make sure that the process is operated effectively and we certainly cannot have a process where hydraulic fracturing is taken out of the equation, because it is certainly a big part of making sure that the economy of this state gets going."In June 2015, Pederick went on a fracking fact-finding trip to the USA with fellow South Australian politicians Troy Bell, Mark Parnell and John Darley, and farmer David Smith.|$|E
