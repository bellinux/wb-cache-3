2500|$|Mary Edwards Walker {{was born}} in the Town of Oswego, New York, on November 26, 1832, the {{daughter}} of Alvah (father) and Vesta (mother) Walker. She was the youngest of seven children: she had five sisters and one brother. Alvah and Vesta raised both their son and their daughters in a progressive manner that was revolutionary for the time. Their nontraditional parenting nurtured Mary's spirit of independence and sense of justice that she actively demonstrated throughout her life. While they were devoted Christians, the Walkers were [...] "free thinkers" [...] who raised their children to question the regulations and restrictions of various denominations. The Walker parents also demonstrated non-traditional gender roles to their children regarding sharing work around the farm: Vesta often participated in heavy labor while Alvah took part in general household chores. Walker worked on her family farm as a child. She did not wear women's clothing during farm labor, because she considered it too restricting. Her mother reinforced her views that corsets and tight <b>lacings</b> were unhealthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{never was}} such a cross family!" [...] cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot <b>lacings,</b> and sat down upon her hat.|$|E
60|$|She had clothes enough, but all needed care; {{even her}} best dress had two buttons off, and her Sunday hat but one string. Shoes, skirts, books, and toys lay about, and her drawers were a perfect chaos of soiled ruffles, odd gloves, old ribbons, boot <b>lacings,</b> {{and bits of}} paper.|$|E
60|$|With {{his knife}} Smoke cut away the <b>lacings</b> and leather of the moccasins. So stiff were they with ice that they snapped and {{crackled}} under the hacking and sawing. The Siwash socks and heavy woollen stockings were sheaths of ice. It {{was as if}} her feet and calves were encased in corrugated iron.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has a deep}} gash {{near the}} neck," [...] the leech said. [...] "The <b>lacings</b> and straps of the helmet and gorget must have been cut by a sharp sword, and another blow has fallen on the same spot. Methinks he has dropped as much from loss of blood as from the blow on the head." ...|$|E
60|$|Hans, {{who was in}} {{the stern}} of the canoe, began to faint from exhaustion, and in his efforts to obtain air, for the heat and stench of the skin were overpowering him, thrust his head out through the <b>lacings</b> of the hide beneath the reed-stuffed mask of the gorilla, which fell over languidly upon his shoulder. Komba saw his ugly little face and knew it again.|$|E
60|$|This, however, was {{not their}} intention, for they {{intended}} to put him to death by slow torture. He was lifted and carried into the cottage. There the <b>lacings</b> of his armour were cut, the cords loosened one by one, sufficient {{to enable them to}} remove the various pieces of which it was composed, then he was left to himself, as the hags intended to postpone the final tragedy until the men returned from the hills.|$|E
60|$|The red Dragon of Merlin which a giant bore {{led them}} on. It sank, it fell, it rose again. The giant was down, but another had it. They {{scrambled}} over {{the mass of}} dead and dying. They got among the living beyond. With eerie screams they houghed the horses and, when the riders fell, hacked open the <b>lacings</b> of their helms, and, unheeding of any cries for mercy, drove the great knives home. At length all were dead, and they returned again waving those red knives and singing some fierce chant in their unknown tongue.|$|E
60|$|Again the clarions blew, {{and again}} they started forward, and {{presently}} again {{they met in}} mid career. As before, the lances struck upon the shields; but so fearful was the impact, that Peter's shivered, while that of Morella, sliding from the topmost rim of his foe's buckler, got hold in his visor bars. Back went Peter beneath the blow, back and still back, till almost he lay upon his horse's crupper. Then, when it seemed that he must fall, the <b>lacings</b> of his helm burst. It was torn from his head, and Morella passed on bearing it transfixed upon his spear point.|$|E
60|$|Now Theseus was {{not wearing}} light shoes or sandals, like the golden sandals of Ã†geus, which he carried in his wallet. He was wearing thick boots, with bronze nails in the soles, {{and the upper}} leathers were laced high up his legs, for the Greeks wore such boots when they took long walks on {{mountain}} roads. As soon as Theseus had trained Sciron {{to stand in the}} proper position, he bade him stoop to undo the <b>lacings</b> of his boots. As Sciron stooped, Theseus gave him one tremendous kick, that lifted him {{over the edge of the}} cliff, and there was an end of Sciron.|$|E
60|$|A {{gold belt}} encircles his waist, below it hangs a garment {{resembling}} the modern kilt, but reaching {{halfway between the}} knee and the ankle. It is dyed a rich purple, and three bands of gold embroidery run round the lower edge. On his feet he wears sandals with broad leather <b>lacings</b> covered with gold. His toga, also of purple heavily embroidered with gold, lies on the couch beside him; {{from one of the}} poles of the tent hang his arms, a short heavy sword, with a handle of solid gold in a scabbard incrusted with the same metal, and a baldrick, covered with plates of gold beautifully worked and lined with the softest leather, by which it is suspended over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a lovely}} {{moonlight}} evening when they started. During their stay at Delhi they had, profiting by their previous expedition, got rid of every article of accouterment that could make a noise. Wooden scabbards had taken the place of steel, and these were covered in flannel, to prevent rattle should they strike against a stirrup. The water bottles were similarly cased in flannel, and the rings and chains of the bits in leather. Nothing, save {{the sound of the}} horses' hoofs, was to be heard as they marched, and even these were muffled by the deep dust that lay on the road. Each man, moreover, carried four leathern shoes for his horse, with <b>lacings</b> for fastening them. Under the guidance of two natives, the troop made their first six stages without the slightest adventure. The country was flat, and the villages sparsely scattered. The barking of the dogs brought a few villagers to their doors, but in those troubled times the advantages of non-interference were obvious and the peasant population in general asked nothing better than to be let alone.|$|E
60|$|When {{this was}} done, {{and he had}} looked to the saddles and trappings of the horses, Wulf told of all that had passed between him and Lozelle on the bridge. How at the first onset his spear had caught in the links of and torn away the {{head-piece}} of his foe, who, if the <b>lacings</b> had not burst, would have been hurled to death, while that of Lozelle struck his buckler fair and shattered on it, rending it from his arm. How they pushed past each other, {{and for a moment}} the fore hoofs of Smoke hung over the abyss, so that he thought he was surely sped: How at the next course Lozelle's spear passed beneath his arm, while his, striking full upon Sir Hugh's breast, brought down the black horse and his rider as though a thunderbolt had smitten them, and how Smoke, that could not check its furious pace, leapt over them, as a horse leaps a-hunting: How he would not ride down Lozelle, but dismounted to finish the fray in knightly fashion, and, being shieldless, received the full weight of the great sword upon his mail, so that he staggered back and would have fallen had he not struck against the horse.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a wondrous}} sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious earth beneath {{was as a}} weaver's loom, with a {{gorgeous}} carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the <b>lacings</b> of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!-- whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!-- but one single word with thee! Nay--the shuttle flies-- the figures float from forth the loom; the fresher-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.|$|E
50|$|From about 1740, most {{gowns and}} bodices were worn {{to reveal the}} stomacher, which covered {{the front of the}} torso from {{neckline}} to waist or even below the waist. The bodice's <b>lacings</b> would then criss-cross over the stomacher, and eventually the <b>lacings</b> became a series of decorative bows.|$|E

50|$|Traditional snowshoes have a {{hardwood}} {{frame with}} rawhide <b>lacings.</b> Some modern snowshoes are similar, {{but most are}} made of materials such as lightweight metal, plastic, and synthetic fabric. In addition to distributing the weight, snowshoes are generally raised at the toe for maneuverability. They must not accumulate snow, hence the latticework, and require bindings to attach them to the feet.|$|E
50|$|A stomacher is a {{decorated}} triangular panel that fills {{in the front}} opening of a woman's gown or bodice. The stomacher may be boned, {{as part of a}} corset, or may cover the triangular front of a corset. If simply decorative, the stomacher lies over the triangular front panel of the stays, being either stitched or pinned into place, or held in place by the <b>lacings</b> of the gown's bodice.|$|E
50|$|From 1884 to 1893 he was {{agent for}} the firm of Woodward & Stillman, of New York. In 1893 he founded and was elected {{treasurer}} of the Elmwood Mills, manufacturers of shoe laces, and held that position until 1912, {{when he was elected}} president of the International Braid Company, which made boot, shoe and corset <b>lacings.</b> He maintained the International Braid Company in a profitable state, and occupied a leading position among business leaders in Rhode Island.|$|E
5000|$|If {{metal or}} another hard {{material}} has a hole made in it, the hole {{will probably have}} sharp edges. [...] Electrical wires, cord, rope, <b>lacings,</b> or other soft vulnerable material passing through the hole can become abraded or cut, or electrical insulation may break due to repeated flexing at the exit point. [...] Rubber, plastic or plastic coated metal grommets are used to avoid this. The grommet could also protect the wiring/cabling from contamination from dirt, air, water, etc. The smooth and sometimes soft inner surface of the grommet shields the wire from damage.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Van Dalen {{created by}} {{commission}} the Data Hall, a permanent site-specific installation for the University of Miami's Center for Computational Sciences. The mural {{consists of a}} set of motherboards, which originally formed a part of UMâ€™s first supercomputer, named Pegasus. The boards were altered with plastic <b>lacings</b> that criss-cross and converge into nodes in a scale-free network. These drawings not only communicate Van Dalen's interest on new ways of making art by combining aesthetically compatible materials and thereby producing paradoxical images; they also aid her in the attempts to comprehend the concept of data processing in a tactile and visual manner.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of macramÃ© knots. MacramÃ© art also {{includes}} <b>lacings</b> and crossings created when two or more knot segments are joined together. The square knot is considered the simplest knot and the half hitch, {{also known as the}} half knot, is the second most basic knot. These knots are typically used when hemp making hemp jewelry. The half knot produces a spiral cord and the full square knot produces a flat cord. Beads and other decorations are also weaved into the jewelry. Hemp is ideal for this jewelry because it is durable and keeps its shape well.|$|E
5000|$|Shaganappi Trail is an {{arterial}} {{road in the}} northwest quadrant of Calgary, Alberta. It {{is considered one of}} the city's expressways. It extends to the south as Montgomery View, a small service road in the neighborhood of Montgomery and that provides access to Edworthy Park, passes north past Market Mall and the western boundary of Nose Hill Park, and terminates in the neighborhood of Nolan Hill in the north, with city planning maps indicating future northern extension beyond 144 Avenue NW. [...] The name [...] "Shaganappi" [...] is of Cree origin, referring to the bison hide <b>lacings</b> that held Red River ox carts together.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the period}} before the Bolshevik victory, trade goods {{included}} [...] "foodstuffs, canned milk, canned fruit, clothing {{of every kind}} (including frilly things for women), hardware of all kinds, toys for children, a great many luxuries which {{many of them had}} never known before."

50|$|From the 1820s onwards, elite gentlemenâ€”at {{least those}} {{among the more}} fashionable circles, {{especially}} the younger set and the militaryâ€”wore corsets. The waistcoat served to emphasize the new popularity of the cinched-in waist for males, and became skin-tight, with the overcoat cut to emphasize the figure: broader shoulders, a pouting chest, and a nipped-in waist. Without a corset, a man's waistcoat often had whalebone stiffeners and were laced in the back, with reinforced buttons up the front, so that one could pull the <b>lacings</b> in tight to mould the waist into the fashionable silhouette. Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, {{had a reputation for}} his tight corsets and tiny waist; and although he lacked popularity during his early reign, men followed his style, and waistcoats became even more restrictive.|$|E
50|$|The modern roper style boot {{with a low}} {{heel and}} shorter shaft emerged from the {{traditional}} design {{in response to the}} needs of modern rodeo, particularly calf roping, where the cowboy had to run to tie the calf as well as to ride. The lower shaft resulted in a less expensive boot, but also allowed the boot to be more easily removed. A laceup design for roper boots became popular as it prevented the boot from falling off too easily and provided more ankle support when on foot, though the lacer also has safety issues because it will not fall off if a rider is hung up in a stirrup, and, lacking a smooth upper, the <b>lacings</b> themselves may {{make it easier for the}} boot to become caught in the stirrup in the first place.|$|E

40|$|Build-up {{column is}} a steel {{structure}} composed of two I-beam steel joined with steel plate or angles as the <b>lacings</b> of the column. The build-up column {{is one of the}} main load carrying members among all the other structural components of a building. Since the build-up column is assembled manually at the construction site, there might have some error in the section and orientation of the <b>lacings</b> assembled which will affect the performance of the build-up column. The main objectives of this study the effect of the different section and orientation of steel elements on build-up column in terms of buckling and stress distribution. Finite Element Analysis of Ansys 12. 0 software is used to design the ten model of the build-up column. In order to study the effect of section of <b>lacings,</b> steel plate and L-angles are used.
