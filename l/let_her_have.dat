5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} {{but as soon}} as Abi leaves the house for Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and nobody knows she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames the residents for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E
25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the titleâ€”of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E

[...] "I realized that you give {{her as much as}} they'll <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have.</b> She'll take it", he explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, her blaming <b>her</b> {{husband for}} <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> own way about the hotel; and her telling {{him not to}} mention his {{proposal}} to Kitty, and then doing it herself, just--after she'd pronounced it absurd and impossible." [...] He spoke with heat at being forced to make what he thought a needless explanation.|$|R

2500|$|Dodd {{found that}} Mrs. Long had [...] "influence on Earl Long that he didn't recognize. She {{knew how to}} get him to do what she wanted. Sometimes Earl would just <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> her way to shut her up. But she was a power in his administration, and every {{appointee}} and favor-seeking person soon learned that and acted accordingly. I tried to stay in her good graces, but she chose her political friends, and I never got on her favored list.|$|E

[...] "He <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> her way," [...] notes a story in Life magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and [...] "instructed them to lay off". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's [...] "synthetic razzle-dazzle".

2500|$|The student {{newspaper}} reporter commented on Botkin's [...] "unorthodox" [...] beliefs regarding sexual relations {{between men and}} women. Botkin {{believed that it was}} inappropriate for a man to react to his wife's affair with the rage that was expected by society: [...] "A woman falls in love with another man. All that is necessary is to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> her fling. After that she is often a better wife and mother. It is like a person who loves to play Bach and suddenly wants to play Beethoven." [...] One historian commented that Botkin's church [...] "was a curious faith, to be sure," [...] but [...] "the Church of Aphrodite was not nearly so wanton as it sounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|As yet John {{does not}} {{understand}} all this. The idea is new and strange to him. He feels as the child in a fairy story on suddenly discovering that the trees and flowers has he passed by carelessly a thousand times can think and talk.

60|$|By {{clinging}} like grim {{death to}} the gunwale, we just managed to keep inside the boat, but it was exhausting work. Hector said that pirates and other seafaring people generally lashed the rudder to something or other, and hauled in the main top-jib, during severe squalls, and thought we ought {{to try to do}} something of the kind; but I was for <b>letting</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> head to the wind.|$|R

None of them had thought of luncheon, so the ship's steward now brought tea and sandwiches to those congregated on deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "No one. She used to {{practice}} mounting, holding the reins, and sitting straight {{on an old}} saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>have</b> horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well.
