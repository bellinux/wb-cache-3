5|$|The <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> {{split flaps}} at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of <b>light</b> <b>alloy.</b> The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed riveting. From February 1943 flush riveting was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
50|$|The sIG 33 {{was rather}} heavy for its mission, {{and it was}} {{redesigned}} in the late 1930s to incorporate <b>light</b> <b>alloys.</b> This saved about 150 kg, but the outbreak of war forced the return to the original design before {{more than a few}} hundred were made, as the Luftwaffe had a higher priority for <b>light</b> <b>alloys.</b> A new carriage, made entirely of <b>light</b> <b>alloys,</b> was tested around 1939, but was not accepted for service.|$|R

25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> skin panels, and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.|$|E

Its {{two rows of}} seats were enclosed under a three part canopy which merged at the rear into the raised fuselage. There was a wide door on either side for cabin access and a separate baggage space behind the seats. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, behind the engines. The nosewheel was steerable. The undercarriage, like the flaps and airbrakes, were hydraulically powered.|$|E

The parametrical criteria, which estimate the complexity of mould space and allow to choose the optimum rates of filling, have been developed. The mathematical dependence of temperature of flow front on the configuration of mould space has been determined. The mathematical simulator to fill the mould space {{with regard to the}} influence of configuration and coats has been developed. The program module of computer-aided design of GFS for the castings in the <b>light</b> <b>alloys,</b> which provide for the defectless filling of sand mould by the melt, have been developed.

50|$|The LG 42 was {{basically}} an enlarged and improved {{version of the}} 7.5 cm LG 40. It incorporated torque vanes in the jet nozzle to counteract the torque forces imparted by the round engaging the rifling and any clogged or eroded nozzles. It also used the improved priming mechanism developed after {{the problems with the}} smaller weapon became apparent. Like all the German 10.5 cm recoilless rifles it shared shells with the 10.5 cm leFH 18 (light Field Howitzer). The LG 42-1 version was built using <b>light</b> <b>alloys</b> in parts of the carriage, but the LG 42-2 replaced these with ordinary steel as <b>light</b> <b>alloys</b> became too valuable later in the war. Both versions could be broken down into 4 loads for parachute operations.|$|R
25|$|The Vickers-Wibault {{construction}} {{method was}} based on the patents of Michel Wibault, who began working with Vickers in 1922. It was a way of producing an all-metal aircraft with an airframe built up from simple, non-machined metal shapes, covered with very thin e.g. 0.016 in (0.4mm) corrugated <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> sheets. Skin panels were riveted {{to each other and to}} the underlying structure; the skin on the wings was not stressed. Vickers' first experience of the method was with the licence built Wibault Scout. The first Vickers design using this construction was the Vireo and the third, the Viastra, used a blend of Wibault and Vickers construction techniques.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external fishplate joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|E
25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} single piston engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties. Saunders-Roe also developed a replacement metal <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> rotor blade that possessed superior aerodynamic properties and provided increased performance. A fixed tricycle undercarriage arrangement, complete with interchangeable wheels and brake units, was also present.|$|E
