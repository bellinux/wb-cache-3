25|$|Germ-cell {{tumors are}} {{typically}} discovered {{when they become}} large, palpable masses. However, <b>like</b> <b>sex</b> cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is subacute abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding, necrotizing, or stretching the ovarian capsule. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause acute abdominal pain, which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Psychologically {{traumatic}} experiences often involve physical {{trauma that}} threatens one's survival {{and sense of}} security. Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include harassment, embarrassment, abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, sexual abuse, partner battery, employment discrimination, police brutality, judicial corruption and misconduct, bullying, paternalism, domestic violence, indoctrination, being the victim of an alcoholic parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in childhood), life-threatening medical conditions, and medication-induced trauma. Catastrophic natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, large scale transportation accidents, house or domestic fire, motor vehicle accident, mass interpersonal violence like war, terrorist attacks or other mass tortures <b>like</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking, being taken as a hostage or kidnapped can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme poverty or milder forms of abuse, such as verbal abuse, exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.|$|E

Do you like it? You're not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love". David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine noted undeniable similarities between this spoken section and a similar quote by actress Julianne Moore in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. In May 2014, during an interview with Vanity Fair, Lewinsky addressed the lyrics of the song mentioning her, saying, [...] "Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clinton'd all on my gown'".|$|E

Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls dress <b>like</b> <b>sex</b> workers, but she {{said that the}} look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said around the same time that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E

A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".|$|E

40|$|Sex {{and eating}} may have {{behavioral}} and psychological relationships and have cortical regions in common. This research investigated the general relationship between sex and eating from a reward perspective {{among the general}} population. Two-hundred and sixty-one Chinese participants were recruited via the internet (136 males, 125 females, mean age 30. 46 years) to fill in questionnaires about wanting and <b>liking</b> for <b>sex</b> and eating. The results revealed that first, there was {{a positive correlation between}} wanting for sex and wanting to eat only for males. Second, the relationship between <b>liking</b> for <b>sex</b> and eating was also positive for males and not significant in females. Third, the correlation between sociosexual orientation and wanting to eat was significant only in females, and there was no significant correlation between sociosexual orientation and liking for eating. Fourth, emotional sex cravings (or emotional sexual activity) was positively correlated with emotional food cravings (or emotional eating behavior), with a higher magnitude correlation in males than females. Finally, analysis of wanting (<b>liking)</b> models of <b>sex</b> and eating for males and females revealed three models for wanting among females: high wanting, low wanting for eating, and low wanting for sex; and two models for wanting among males: high wanting and low wanting. <b>Liking</b> for <b>sex</b> and eating among females consisted of two types of model: high liking and low liking; whereas three type models existed for males: high <b>liking</b> for <b>sex,</b> high <b>liking</b> for eating, and low liking.

2500|$|Today {{there are}} {{multiple}} sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, {{the mood of the}} meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert Mark Oldman has noted [...] "Food and Wine pairing can be <b>like</b> <b>sex</b> and pizza: even when it's bad, it can still be pretty good" [...] and gives the example of wedding cake with a dry sparkling wine. A very dry wine with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, [...] "the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard" [...] and is not a [...] "good pairing" [...] according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline. Today, many wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing try to focus on the more objective physical aspects of food that {{have an effect on the}} palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine.|$|E

60|$|The laws {{governing}} inheritance {{are for the}} most part unknown; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the <b>like</b> <b>sex.</b> It is a fact of some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much greater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be otherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.|$|E
