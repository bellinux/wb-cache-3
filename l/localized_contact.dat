Fractographic study confirmed that the chipping off of material was by static overload. Metallurgical examination showed carburization of the entire collar of the circlip groove. Evidences suggest that there were <b>localized</b> <b>contacts</b> between the circlip face and the groove surface resulting in high loads at these contact points. Study shows that these <b>localized</b> <b>contacts</b> were due to inability of the hard carburized material to deform and make necessary adjustment for establishing contacts with the entire circlip face. It appears most probable that high notch sensitivity of the carburized material at the circlip groove in conjunction with the high localized load on the collar of the circlip groove was responsible for the failure. In view of this, it is recommended that suitable process modification be incorporated to avoid carburization in the circlip groove region...|$|R

The wide availability, small size, low cost, and high robustness of MEMS-based accelerome-ters make this approach a promising near-term avenue for enabling robots to understand their physical interactions with the environment.

We exploit a granular description of snow to develop a discrete element model based on the full 3 -D microstructurecaptured by microtomography. The model assumes that snowis composed of rigid grains interacting through <b>localized</b> <b>contacts</b> accounting for cohesion and friction. The geometry ofthe grains and of the intergranular bonding system are explicitly defined from microtomographic data using geometrical criteria based on curvature and contiguity. Single grains are represented as rigid clumps of spheres. The model is applied to different snow samples subjected to confined compression tests. A detailed sensitivity analysis shows that artifacts introduced by the modeling approach and the influence of numerical parameters are limited compared to variations due to the geometry of the microstructure. The model shows that the compression behavior of snow is mainly controlled by the density of the samples, but that deviations from a pure density parameterization are not insignificant during the first phase of deformation. In particular, the model correctly predicts that, for a given density, faceted crystals are less resistant to compression than rounded grains or decomposed snow.

In the present work it is shown that the maximum energy dissipation and corresponding optimum friction force of friction dampers with stiff <b>localized</b> <b>contacts</b> and large relative displacements within the contact, can be determined with sufficient accuracy using a dry (Coulomb) friction model. Both the numerical calculations with more complex friction models and the experimental results in a laboratory test set-up show that these two quantities are relatively robust properties of a system with friction. The numerical calculations are performed with several friction models currently used in the literature. For the stick phase smooth approximations like viscous damping or the arctan function are considered but also the non-smooth switch friction model is used. For the slip phase several models of the Stribeck effect are used. The test set-up for the laboratory experiments consists of a mass sliding on parallel ball-bearings, where additional friction is created by a sledge attached to the mass, which is pre-stressed against a friction plate. The measured energy dissipation is in good agreement with the theoretical results for Coulomb friction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

According to wear theory, contact pressure and sliding distance {{are the two}} dominant factors in determining sliding wear. We applied the finite element analysis to accurately quantify the contact pressure and sliding distance at the die radius in sheet metal stamping. The results were then applied to analyze sliding wear at the die radius. We found that a typical two-peak steady-state contact pressure response exists during a channel forming process. The steady-state contact pressure response was preceded by an initial transient response, which produced extremely large and <b>localized</b> <b>contact</b> pressures.

40|$|International audienceNonlinear {{normal mode}} (NNM) {{analysis}} is one emerging technique to analyse the nonlinear vibration of bladed-disk. It links the resonance frequency {{to the energy}} present in the system, and allows a simple identification of internal resonances in the structure. Non-linear vibration analysis is traditionally carried out {{under the assumption that}} the mechanical properties and forcing function are deterministic. Since every mechanical system is by nature uncertain a truly accurate nonlinear dynamic analysis requires the inclusion of random variables in the response predictions. The propagation of random input uncertainties in a NNM analysis is the main aim of the presented work. The Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) will be used to calculate the NNMs for a contact problem in a computationally efficient way. The stochastic NNM permits to quantify the effect of uncertainties on the resonance frequency and the change in mode shape due to non-linearities, leading to the calculation of uncertain internal resonances. The proposed method is initially applied to a simple spring-mass system to demonstrate the effects of uncertainty on the NNM predictions.

These tests were interrupted at certain numbers of cycles in order to weigh the specimens, characterize the topography, and investigate the wear appearances. In addition, after cleaning in ethanol and anionic detergent, before-and-after comparison rendered the weight of the tribomaterial.

Afterwards the loss of material surpassed the generation of new tribomaterial and a steady weight-loss was measured. Topography measurements were used as input data for contact mechanics calculations. Apparently the incipient, locally high contact stresses accelerated tribochemical reactions.
