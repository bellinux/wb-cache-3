5|$|Blackman's {{guilty verdict}} {{led to a}} showing of {{public support for the}} Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions alternately asking that he be given a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for leniency.|$|E
25|$|The sixth man, John Heath, who {{was accused}} of {{organizing}} the robbery, was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison. Unsatisfied with what they perceived as a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence,</b> a Tombstone lynch mob forcibly removed him from jail and hanged him on February 22, 1884. Today, the graves of the five murderers are part of the popular tourist attraction at Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1978, CBS News {{reported}} on the surprising developments in Laredo in a half-hour prime time CBS Reports narrated by Bill Moyers. The documentary details many of the scandals in the Martin administration, including the looting of taxpayers through fraudulent purchase orders, particularly for vehicle batteries. A month after the election, Martin was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} on one count of mail fraud and was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $201,118 to the city in restitution. He was sentenced to serve thirty weekends in the Webb County Jail. Critics said the <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> had made Laredo the laughingstock of Texas.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{domestic}} violence are often prosecuted under common assault, resulting in <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> for the offenders such as six months or less.|$|R
5000|$|John Augustus was a Boston boot maker who {{is called}} the [...] "Father of Probation" [...] in the United States because of his {{pioneering}} efforts to campaign for more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> for convicted criminals based on their backgrounds.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an opinion}} {{letter to the}} Houston Chronicle, member of Houston City Council Jolanda [...] "Jo" [...] Jones argued that the {{relatively}} <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> {{is an example of}} favorable treatment of White Americans in the Harris County legal system.|$|R
500|$|Sanger's {{trial began}} in January 1917. She was {{supported}} by a large number of wealthy and influential women who came together to form the Committee of One Hundred, which was devoted to raising funds for Sanger and the NBCL. The committee also started publishing the monthly journal Birth Control Review, and established a network of connections to powerful politicians, activists, and press figures. Despite the strong support, Sanger was convicted; the judge offered a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> if she promised not to break the law again, but Sanger replied [...] "I cannot respect the law as it exists today."Engelman, p. 91. She served a sentence of 30 days in jail.|$|E
500|$|On 28 January 1942, FBI agents {{arrived at}} Townsend's home and arrested him for having {{acted as a}} Japanese agent without {{registering}} under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information, a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940. Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and {{claimed to be a}} victim of political persecution, he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee, stating that it was merely a payment in exchange for the bulk sale of his pamphlets. Even so, Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal. Townsend also solicited the support of anti-interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator Rush D. Holt and his longtime friend Senator Gerald Nye, the latter of whom described Townsend as [...] "a loyal and patriotic American citizen". The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was, however, unmoved, and deeming his crimes [...] "repulsive, obscene and macabre", Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC.|$|E
2500|$|The London-based Arab-language daily {{newspaper}} Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported in early May 2005 that {{during a meeting}} with Donald Rumsfeld, [...] "known only to a few Iraqi officials in Jordan", Saddam refused an offer of release if he made a televised request to armed groups for a ceasefire with allied forces. The British Daily Telegraph newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior UK government source, had reported two weeks before that Iraqi insurgents were being offered a [...] "deal" [...] whereby the former President of Iraq would receive a more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> if they gave up their attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The lyrics {{describe}} the <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> of a hooligan, with the narrator sarcastically taking {{the side of}} the criminal, saying [...] "and he'll never ever do it again / of course he won't / not until the next time".|$|R
50|$|In 1999, three Americans - John Dixon, Gary Blanchard and Joseph Pettijohn - {{claimed to}} have been {{tortured}} after their arrest. The trial judge accepted their evidence of torture and gave them <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> after their conviction for weapons offences.|$|R
2500|$|The act {{was also}} criticised by the Conservative Party for its <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> rules and {{handling}} of parole. [...] Further fueling the controversy was {{the revelation that}} 53 prisoners who had been sentenced to life imprisonment under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 had been freed on parole since 2000.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1882 the {{government}} introduced new legislation, the West Coast Peace Preservation Bill, which decreed that Te Whiti and Tohu {{were not to}} be tried, but would be jailed indefinitely. If released, they could be rearrested without charge at any time. [...] Bryce explained that the law was necessary to protect the people of Taranaki and because he feared the two chiefs might be acquitted by a jury or, if they were convicted, receive a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence.</b> The legislation, signed into law on 1 July, was followed by the Indemnity Act, which indemnified those who, in preserving the peace on the west coast, may have adopted measures [...] "in excess of legal powers".|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March 1789, James gave {{evidence}} on the theft by 2 fellow convicts of 6 cabbages. The thieves received 50 lashes each. James was then hauled before the magistrate, charged with stealing 'medicines' from the hospital stores where he worked at Port Jackson. These medicines were, in fact, 1 pound of pepper (or paper) and horehound (a herb that imitates the tangy flavour of hops), belonging to Surgeon John White. Though James claimed the stolen horehound was for his pregnant girlfriend, he later revealed at the Bigge inquiry that he began brewing beer on his arrival to Australia, which he sold for 4d per quart. Indeed, James was brewing beer for the personal consumption of Lieutenant Francis Grose and William Paterson over that time. Perhaps that explains Squire's possibly <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> when petty theft was often severely punished. His sentence of 14 November 1789 read: [...] "one hundred and fifty (lashes of the whip) now, and the remainder when able to bear it".|$|E
2500|$|Turning to the {{particular}} facts of this case, the Court commented that the district judge had committed no significant procedural error. [...] He correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the statutory factors, and [...] "thoroughly documented his reasoning." [...] In particular, the judge did not ignore {{the seriousness of the}} offense. [...] To be sure, he did not specifically recite the adverse health effects that ecstasy presents. [...] Yet the prosecutor did not urge those adverse health consequences as a basis for imposing the sentence it felt was reasonable. [...] "It was not incumbent upon the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative." [...] Moreover, the probation-only sentence in this case promotes respect for the law. [...] Seven of the eight defendants in the case received prison terms. [...] Gall did not because, as the district judge explained, [...] "a sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed merely as a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances in sentencing." [...] Finally, Gall understandably received a more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> because he withdrew from the conspiracy while the other defendants did not.|$|E
50|$|She was {{the victim}} of a violent robbery and rape in 1986 at a vicarage in Ealing, London, a crime for which the perpetrators' {{relatively}} <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> led indirectly to changes in the law. Saward was the first rape victim in Britain to waive her right to anonymity.|$|R
30|$|It {{was only}} after the war that {{official}} channels, namely courts, were used against the perpetrators. After 1947, the German Federal Republic judiciary mostly made decisions that allowed T 4 participants to rejoin German professions, for example by terminating trials, acquitting defendants or giving <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> (Bryant 2005, p. 218).|$|R
50|$|The {{trial was}} moved to L'Aquila, in Abruzzo, by the judges who heard the {{preliminary}} trial, thus preventing public participation, and resulted in <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> {{for a handful of}} the SADE and ENEL engineers. One SADE engineer (Mario Pancini) committed suicide in 1968. The government never sued SADE for damage compensation.|$|R
60|$|Found guilty, the {{prisoner}} had been recommended to mercy by the jury--partly {{in consideration of}} her youth; partly {{as an expression of}} sympathy and respect for her unhappy father. The judge (a father himself) passed a <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence.</b> She was condemned to imprisonment for two years. The careful matron of the jail had provided herself with a bottle of smelling-salts, in the fear that there might be need for it when Helena heard her sentence pronounced. Not the slightest sign of agitation appeared in her face or her manner. She lied to the last; asserting her innocence in a firm voice, and returning from the dock to the prison without requiring assistance from anybody.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{continuing}} investigation in 1974–75, Watergate scandal prosecutors offered companies that had given illegal campaign contributions to Nixon's re-election campaign <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> if they came forward. Many companies complied, including Northrop Grumman, 3M, American Airlines and Braniff Airlines. By 1976, prosecutors had convicted 18 American corporations of contributing illegally to Nixon's campaign.|$|R
50|$|Maistrišin {{ended up}} {{convicted and sentenced}} to five years of imprisonment, Sobolev was sentenced to 2.5 years of imprisonment. Six other accomplices were given brief {{custodial}} sentences; about a dozen were sentenced to time served. The unexpectedly <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> aroused considerable discussion in Estonian public arena, and led to decline in underground alcohol sales.|$|R
50|$|Corruption and {{intimidation}} by traffickers complicate the drug-control {{efforts of the}} institutions of government. Colombia passed revised criminal procedures code in 1993 that permits traffickers to surrender and negotiate <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> in return for cooperating with prosecutors. In December 1996 and February 1997, however, the Colombian Congress passed legislation to toughen sentencing, asset forfeiture, and money-laundering penalties.|$|R

50|$|She {{supports}} judges {{being given}} {{the ability to}} effectively convict perpetrators of 'the most heinous, cruel and vile' crimes with a life sentence, with the intent that they are never released. Davidson also calls {{for an end to}} the automatic release of prisoners, and believes that alcohol and drug consumption should not grant more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentencing</b> to people who have committed crimes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{majority}} of cases featuring well-known clients, Hoelter has managed to develop court-approved sentencing proposals which produced more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> featuring substantial amounts of community service and home confinement. When clients receive more stringent prison terms, as was the case for Vick, Hoelter works to help the client resume life outside of prison, focusing on re-entry back into society.|$|R
50|$|A {{special court}} hears cases {{involving}} persons {{under the age}} of 18. Children who appeared before the court received more <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences</b> than adults, and extenuating circumstances received greater consideration in juvenile cases. The minimum age for children to be tried is 12 years old. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 who are convicted of a crime are sentenced to detention centers for minors.|$|R
50|$|Hijar died in prison, {{which seems}} harsh {{compared}} to the <b>lenient</b> <b>sentence</b> given to Gaspar Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia in 1641 {{for his part in}} the Andalusian independentist conspiracy (1641).|$|E

50|$|In January, the Spartacus League {{and others}} in the streets of Berlin made more armed {{attempts}} to establish communism, known as the Spartacist uprising. Those attempts were put down by paramilitary Freikorps units consisting of volunteer soldiers. Bloody street fights culminated in the beating and shooting deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht after their arrests on 15 January. With the affirmation of Ebert, those responsible were not tried before a court martial, leading to <b>lenient</b> <b>sentences,</b> which made Ebert unpopular among radical leftists.|$|R
