40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: (1) {{to determine the effects}} of load and posture on an individual’s ability to estimate the weight of an external load, and (2) to identify estimation trends among the experimental conditions. 18 experienced, healthy female checkout operators <b>lifted</b> standardized <b>containers</b> <b>of</b> 3 weights (28. 9, 33. 4, 37. 8 N) in 3 postures (normal, maximum, extreme) for 2 trials. For each condition, the weight <b>of</b> the test <b>container</b> was estimated in absolute terms. A balanced ANOVA with repeated measures was used to test the main effects and interactions at α = 0. 05. There was a statistically significant interaction for posture and load, indicating that different combinations of load and posture effected load estimation differently. Overestimation of the load occurred in the maximum and extreme postures while handling the heavier loads, whereas underestimation occurred in the normal posture lifting the lightest load. The ability to accurately report the weight of an external load was affected by the position of the load and the weight of the load, therefore, direct measurement of these variables must be taken to accurately reflect the physical demands placed on the worker...|$|R

40|$|The seismic design {{procedure}} for large container cranes adapting the pseudo-static method as a seismic coefficient of 0. 2. The same manner, the pseudo-static method is used against a wind load as a equivalent coefficient of 55 m/s wind velocity. Of the two design factors, the wind resistance {{turns out to}} be the determining one in most cases. During the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanmbu Earthquake (The Great Hanshin Earthquake Disaster) the port structures and cargo handling machinery of the Port of Kobe were seriously damaged. Since the serious damages research work, two levels of earthquake motions are used as design reference motions, defined as L 1 : the level of earthquake motions that are likely to occurred during the life-span of the structure, L 2 : the level of earthquake motions associated with infrequent rare events, that typically involve very strong ground shaking, the new seismic design concept was announced by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers. To evaluate seismic performance of port structures, dynamic analysis has been introduced to the design code. Reflecting such a revision in earthquake resistance design code for port structures, it has become necessary to include dynamic analysis for L 2 seismic motion in the design of cranes so that container cranes may have earthquake resistance level equal to that of port structures. It is necessary to evaluate the performance of port facilities, both port structures and cargo handling facilities. This is because the locking phenomenon was known to have occurred to the cranes in the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanmbu Earthquake as a result of strong earthquake motions and this phenomenon <b>lifted</b> some legs <b>of</b> cranes. This study has been initiated against such a background to analyze stability <b>of</b> <b>container</b> cranes for strong earthquakes, with a view to establishing earthquake resistant design methods <b>of</b> <b>container</b> cranes. In this study, focused on the container crane installed in <b>container</b> terminal <b>of</b> major Japanese ports. To investigate the dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>container</b> crane, model tests and numerical simulations were conducted. In the model tests, the similitude law (i. e. model and prototype crane scaling law) was constructed based on the vibration modes of model and prototype crane as a scale of 1 / 15, Both static loading tests and dynamic vibration tests were done. The results of experiment indicate that the <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> legs caused by bending deformation of the legs and by horizontal acceleration. It has also been found out that <b>lifting</b> behavior <b>of</b> legs can be predicted with the maximum horizontal response acceleration at the center of gravity of crane during vibration test, which is coincide with the equivalent static horizontal load at the center of gravity of crane when the legs liftoff state, during the monotonic horizontal loading test (static test). To consider the effect of input motion wave forms, a series of shake table tests were conducted with four different seismic input motions. The results of this test indicate that the prediction <b>of</b> legs <b>lifting</b> requires studies on the effects of high-frequency wave component in the response acceleration. A series of dynamic vibration tests also clarified behaviors <b>of</b> <b>container</b> cranes during strong earthquakes. To reduce the big response acceleration during big earthquake such as L 2, proposed the philosophy of base isolation technique for the container crane. The study also proposed a simplified numerical analyses regarding a container crane as a single mass-spring model. The simplified model is capable of exhibiting vibration characteristics just before legs lifting takes place, with sufficiently good reproducibility to justify its use in practical design to predict legs lifting to some extent. The study confirmed that the FEM analysis using a Gap element at the legs base of cranes is sufficiently effective for analysis <b>of</b> <b>container</b> crane behaviors. On the basis of the above results, I have proposed an earthquake resistant design method for container cranes to prevent legs <b>lifting</b> by combination <b>of</b> a simplified numerical analyses and the FEM analysis. This design method will alleviate the burden of design as well as being practical as a means of earthquake resistant design. There still remain unclear elements for the lifting behaviors and the behaviors after <b>lifting</b> <b>of</b> legs in response to L 2 seismic motion, although they have large possible effects on the crane and its foundation. For this reason I proposed earthquake resistant container cranes equipped with base seismic isolators as a means <b>of</b> preventing legs <b>lifting.</b> The model tests have confirmed that the base seismic isolators are sufficiently effective in preventing legs lifting. This study analyzed behaviors of cranes during strong earthquakes. On the basis of the result of analyses, I proposed a {{procedure for}} earthquake resistant design <b>of</b> <b>container</b> cranes. The study also verified the effect of base isolators and reflected it in proposed safe and economic structure <b>of</b> <b>container</b> cranes. I hope that the results of this study will be incorporated in design standards and will thus contribute to improvement of earthquake resistance <b>of</b> <b>container</b> terminals. Then this study will mean very much in improvement of social infrastructure. 筑波大学博士 (工学) 学位論文・平成 13 年 2 月 28 日授与 (乙第 1704 号) 標題紙、目次 [...] A Study on Stability <b>of</b> <b>Container</b> Cranes during Strong Earthquakes [...] 第１章　コンテナクレーンの耐震性に関する研究 [...] 第２章　コンテナクレーン設計上の課題 [...] 第３章　模型実験 [...] 第４章　数値解析による検討 [...] 第５章　コンテナクレーンの新耐震設計法について [...] 第６章　免震コンテナクレーンの効果 [...] 第７章　結論 [...] 既発表の研究論文リスト [...] 謝...|$|R
