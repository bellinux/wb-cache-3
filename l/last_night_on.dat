500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} critical acclaim from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode calling it [...] "A super-sweet {{end to a}} super-sweet series!" [...] Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said [...] "Overall, [...] "Hello Goodbye" [...] did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives in a nice pretty bow", they added [...] "We wanted MORE!" [...] The day after the episode's U.S. airing, {{a reporter for the}} British newspaper Daily Mail praised Betty's transformation saying [...] "Gone were the thick-rimmed glasses and braces that once defined America Ferrera's character, and in its place a professional career woman signalling the completion of a four-year metamorphosis." [...] However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was [...] "like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave," [...] but added the conclusion was [...] "unsatisfying". New York magazine said [...] "The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending — and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> the series finale". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying [...] "The one-hour finale easily could have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said [...] "Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans". Wieselman also added [...] "On a show that always favored high drama and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone get such an expected ending". Wieselman, however, did enjoy the final scene calling it [...] "pitch-perfect".|$|E

2500|$|We {{have had}} {{frequent}} {{experience of the}} excitement appertaining to [...] "first nights", but we may safely say, and our opinion will be backed by several hundreds of Her Majesty's subjects, that we never witnessed such a scene of enthusiasm as that displayed <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>on</b> the occasion of Mademoiselle Jenny Lind's début as Alice in an Italian version of Robert le Diable.|$|E
