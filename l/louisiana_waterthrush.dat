25|$|Birds are an {{especially}} {{important component of}} the local ecosystem for historical reasons. Bicknell's thrush was first observed on the summit of Slide in 1881; today, after recently being declared a separate species from the gray-cheeked thrush, it is considered a threatened species and its summer breeding areas in the boreal forests important enough that in 1999, New York governor George Pataki augmented the wilderness status of the area with Bird Conservation Area status that applied to almost all the Catskill High Peaks. This protects not only the Bicknell's but other species such as the black-and-white warbler, black-throated blue warbler, Canada warbler, red-eyed vireo, <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush,</b> scarlet tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak, some of which require large unbroken forests to nest.|$|E
25|$|Crevice-gleaning is a niche {{particular}} to dry and rocky habitats. Adaptations for crevice-gleaning {{are similar to}} that of bark-gleaning. Just as the Bewick's wren, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, has a long bill suited for poking around in the small places of woods and gardens, another North American wren, the canyon wren, has an even longer bill, which allows it to probe crevices in rocky cliffs. It also has skeletal adaptations to aid it in reaching deep into small spaces. These same traits are useful for gleaning the sides of buildings, as well. Another kind of rocky habitat is found along mountain streams, where birds such as the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> of North America and the forktails of Asia pick over stream-side rocks and exposed roots for aquatic insects and other moisture-loving prey.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} birds inhabit the {{floodplains}} and slopes near Mahoning Creek. These include scarlet tanagers, black-throated green warblers, belted kingfishers, gray catbirds, black-capped chickadees, eastern wood-peewees, <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrushes,</b> and wood thrushes.|$|R
2500|$|Acadian flycatchers and <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrushes,</b> birds rare in Minnesota, nest {{within this}} park. Mammals that roam here are raccoons, deer, badgers, minks, beavers, gray and red foxes, muskrats, and wild turkeys.

Mammals in the hollow include rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, squirrels, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> {{does not}} sing on its {{wintering}} grounds before it leaves. It sings immediately when it arrives on its breeding territory. Whether it begins singing during migration is not known. When establishing his territory, a male sings vigorously nearly all day. After he acquires a mate, singing decreases quickly and he concentrates his singing {{into the morning}} hours. The breeding habitat is wet woodlands near running water and does not occur outside such areas as a breeder. However, during winter, the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> mainly forages along flooded roads or trails, and in parks, lawns and gardens, rarely entering true forest, even forested wetlands, in the subtropics. The northern waterthrush prefers stagnant, swampy waters and is generally a more terrestrial forager. Louisiana waterthrushes prefer dense vegetation along the water's edge for nesting, since this provides the main protection of nest from predation. Louisiana waterthrushes nest in a rock crevice, mud bank or amongst tree roots, laying 4-6 eggs in a cup nest from late May to mid-June. Both parents construct the nest, which is built from wet, muddy leaves, pine needles, grass, and small twigs. The female <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> incubates the eggs for 12 or 13 days. The fledging period lasts for 9 or 10 days, with both adults feeding the young for a further 4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> (Parkesia motacilla) is a New World warbler, that breeds {{in eastern}} North America and winters in the West Indies and Central America. Plain brown above, it is white below, with black streaks and with buff flanks and undertail, {{distinguishing}} {{it from the}} closely related northern waterthrush. The habitats it prefers are streams and their surroundings, and other wet areas.|$|E
50|$|Within the reserve, 417 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants, {{many of which}} are rare, have been identified. This includes the regionally rare cuckoo flower and the sand violet, as well as the nationally endangered butternut, population of which has dwindled due to the butternut canker disease. Fauna includes the locally rare northern long-eared bat, the nationally vulnerable <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> and the northern brook lamprey, as well as the nationally threatened Jefferson salamander.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> has a plain brown {{back and}} white underparts {{streaked}} with black. The flanks and undertail are buff.

50|$|It breeds {{in eastern}} North America from southernmost Canada and south through the eastern United States, {{excluding}} Florida and the coast. The <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> is migratory, wintering in Central America and the West Indies. This {{is a rare}} vagrant to the western United States. They {{are one of the}} earlier neotropical migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration in late March or early April, which is almost two months before most other warblers reach their breeding grounds. They are also one of the earliest warblers to vacate their breeding grounds, with some departing as early as July; almost all will have left by late August.|$|E

50|$|This bird breeds {{in dense}} {{deciduous}} {{forests in the}} eastern United States, usually on wooded slopes. The nest is an open cup placed on the ground, hidden among dead leaves. It {{is one of several}} species of new-world warblers that nests on the ground including the black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), the northern waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis), <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> (Parkesia motacilla), palm warbler (Setophaga palmarum), and the Kentucky warbler (Geothlypis formosa). The female lays four or five eggs. Both parents feed the young; they may try to distract predators near the nest by pretending to be injured. Worm-eating warblers are often parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) where forest fragmentation occurs. Reducing forest fragmentation may prove vital if populations of worm-eating warblers suffer large declines.|$|E

50|$|Less {{common and}} {{widespread}} {{today than it}} was two centuries ago, the Louisiana waterthrush's decline is mainly due to the reduction of suitable habitat, through clearing and channelization of streams, as well as pollution, and the impounding of rivers and streams to create reservoirs. Additionally, because the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> is dependent on large areas of continuous forest, this species is likely to be threatened by increasing forest fragmentation. Timber harvesting, agriculture, urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species. The population seems be quite extremely sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity. Threats to the Canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage, excessive irrigation and climate change, as well as logging and habitat fragmentation.|$|E
50|$|The colour, {{shape or}} other {{features}} of the supercilium {{can be useful in}} bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush.</b> The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, a {{breeding}} bird {{survey was conducted}} on the reservation in order to inform management of Quinebaug Woods. During the survey, a total of 37 species of birds were identified on the property including seven species listed as Massachusetts Priority Neotropical Migrant Bird Species. A male northern parula was observed along the river in June 2002. It is unlikely that this state-listed, threatened warbler is breeding on the property as it was only observed on one occasion. It is more likely that this individual was an unpaired male or a late migrant. Brown-headed cowbirds were one of the few problematic or non-native species observed. These birds pose a risk to neotropical migrants in that their habit of laying their eggs in the nests of other species impacts the productivity of native, neotropical migrants. In June 2002, a <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush</b> was observed feeding an immature cowbird.|$|E

50|$|The Great Swamp is home {{to about}} 180 species of bird, {{including}} 100 that breed there. The red-winged blackbird {{is one of the}} most commonly observed, while the bittern, sora, and marsh wren are often not seen. The large size, wide range of habitat, and river dynamics are what make these wetlands so suitable for wildlife. Several areas, ponds, and preserves have concentrated wildlife. Camp Sharparoon, now the Dover Furnace Shooting Preserve, an 1800 acre area west of New York State Route 22, was home to one of the first breeding grounds for ravens within the county. Other commonly seen species include turkey vultures, red-tail hawks, swallows, swifts, black vulture, redstart, veery, indigo bunting, <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush,</b> northern waterthrush, winter wren, black-throated green warbler, willow flycatcher, and alder flycatcher. Throughout other areas, the wood duck, mallard, Canada goose, great blue heron, and belted kingfisher are seen nesting in various bridges. The Great Swamp is Audubon-designated Important Bird Area #89.|$|E
50|$|Over 200 {{species of}} both migratory and {{non-migratory}} birds {{have been identified}} in the marsh. It serves as a wintering ground and stop-over point for migrating waterfowl, which gather in numbers as high as 4,000 in the fall. These waterfowl include American black ducks, wood ducks, and mallards. Constitution Marsh is also used by migrating pied-billed grebes, ospreys, northern harriers, and peregrine falcons; at least 2 and as many as 30 bald eagles can be found there in the winter. Autumn concentrations of swallows once peaked at 100,000, but have dwindled since the mid-1990s. Over 50 different bird species are known to breed within the wildlife sanctuary, including the least bittern, worm-eating warbler, Virginia rail, <b>Louisiana</b> <b>waterthrush,</b> northern cardinal, spotted sandpiper, gray catbird, common yellowthroat, marsh wren, eastern phoebe, swamp sparrow, and willow flycatcher, as well as the wood thrush, which breeds in the forest near the swamp. The marsh was included in bird habitat studies in 1986-1987 and again in 2005. The results revealed that the diversity of breeding bird species is steadily decreasing as the red-winged blackbird becomes dominant.|$|E

40|$|Riparian {{habitats}} perform {{many important}} ecological functions, but are frequently affected by anthropogenic development. Recently, using bioindicator species, {{such as the}} <b>Louisiana</b> <b>Waterthrush,</b> to evaluate riparian health has become increasingly important. Louisiana Waterthrushes nest along stream banks and feed primarily on benthic macroinvertebrates, making them vulnerable to both changes in riparian production and diversity. It is important to determine aspects of the riparian environment that affect productivity. We measured various habitat characteristics of nesting Louisiana Waterthrushes to determine what territorial factors influence breeding success. Based on independent t-tests, we found that increased canopy cover and oak density were positively correlated with nest success. In contrast, increased poplar density and length of streams that are intermittent rather than perennial within territories were negatively correlated nest success. These four factors were placed in a binary logistic regression model. Canopy cover and poplar density were statistically significant, while oak density and intermittent streams were marginally significant. This model correctly predicted 86. 1 percent of nest outcomes. Increased canopy cover may offer greater protection from visual predators. Poplar, a tree species characteristic of relatively open forests, is often replaced by oaks as the forest matures—which typically also increases canopy cover. Increased intermittent flow limits the productivity of streams, and therefore, decreases the reproductive success of the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>Waterthrush.</b> More research {{must be done to}} increase sample sizes, and consequently, the understanding of how these habitat factors affect the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>Waterthrush...</b>|$|E
