During World War II she studied engineering in Delft, but then returned home to work and experiment at her father's company. Ruys's father, Bonne Ruys, founded the Moerheim Nursery in 1888 specializing in perennials in the bogs near Dedemsvaart, near Zwolle, in the east of the Netherlands. Ruys's business quickly grew and {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century had become the most notable nursery in Europe for perennials. She was the younger sister of Anna Charlotte Ruys. [...] Beginning in 1924, Mien began experimenting, making small gardens of perennials on her father's land, and soon became as interested in the materials for building gardens as the plants in them. These experiments were the foundation for the Tuinen Mien Ruys and helped her become one of the most notable landscape and garden architects of the Netherlands. Ruys also studied architecture with Marinus Jan Granpré Molière, a noted Dutch architect and <b>landscape</b> <b>planner,</b> and worked with architects such as Gerrit Rietveld, a collaboration which is still celebrated in Bergeijk, where Rietveld designed a factory, Weverij de Ploeg, surrounded by a Ruys-designed park.|$|E

40|$|The European {{landscape}} reflects its agricultural legacy, but {{agriculture is}} losing its dominant position in the rural economy. The rural landscapes of Europe are {{in a process of}} polarization between intensive land use and naturalistic areas. In addition to this process, fragmentation of the landscape is also taking place. Regional distinctiveness is disappearing due to the impact of globalization on food production. If regional differences are not maintained and protected then the cultural landscapesof Europe and their biological diversity will decline and only remnants will remain. It is argued that regional differences can only be maintained through conscious environmental and ecological planning.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Horticulture, Forestry & Recreation ResourcesGreg DavisUrban {{environmental}} pollution {{continues to be}} exacerbated {{by a number of}} factors relating to human population growth including sewage discharged directly into the urban rivers designed with concrete-sealed riverfronts. This has left a number of rivers with deteriorated water quality. Where a riverfront could be the highlight and magnet of the city, it may instead become a stain and waste place. In 1969 American <b>landscape</b> <b>planner</b> McHarg proposed the landscape planning theory, “Design with Nature. " His primary argument was that natural processes provide self-regulatory functions that need to be reflected in our plans and designs. Ecological design aims include restoring or promoting natural processes and automatic (bio-physical, regenerative, and adaptive) stabilizers. A wide range of scientific knowledge is available to help guide the designer, but designers usually have limited time to complete their designs. Unfortunately, much of this information is diffusely dispersed in research literature and not easily collected and synthesized by the design community. The purpose of this review is to help provide a synthesis of current thought and to help establish the basis for principles that can aid the designer, offering easy-to-understand design guidelines related to the use of aquatic plants in ecological redevelopment along urban riverfronts. This report focuses on using aquatic plants as the main material to help solve two key problems along riverfront developments: water pollution and flooding. As such this report can serve as a guide for the designer helping them to select aquatic plants using an ecological design approach for the redevelopment of urban riverfronts. It also addresses the essential need to adapt designs based on local site problems and requirements. Since this report provides a review and a basis for where to start in designing with aquatic plants in ecological redevelopment of urban waterfronts, it should not be considered as an exclusive source for the designer but rather a complement to local guidelines and information to derive design solutions...|$|E

40|$|Landscape {{planning}} is {{an approach to}} planning land use based on analysis of physical, biological, cultural, and aesthetic resources. Its aim is creative resolution of land use conflicts {{through the development of}} physical plans. These plans result from synthesis of scientific analyses produced by specialists from multiple disciplines and from reconciliation of the interests of different user groups. Landscape planning developed primarily as a specialty area within landscape architecture in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Its most recognized practitioner was Ian McHarg, author of the influential book Design With Nature (1969). ^ Thirty years ago, <b>landscape</b> <b>planners</b> were {{on the cutting edge of}} environmental research. Their work led to methods for implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the development of geographic information systems (GIS). Bridging the cultures of scientific research and professional planning practice was the aim of the first scholarly journal in the field, Landscape Planning, and it is a sentiment that characterized <b>landscape</b> <b>planners</b> quite well. ^ In recent years, the profile of landscape planning has diminished considerably. Those who might have called themselves <b>landscape</b> <b>planners</b> in the past now identify themselves as ecological modelers, landscape ecologists, or environmental planners. Is it possible that the mission of classic landscape planning has been subsumed by these newer specialty areas? Or does landscape planning still have a role to play in the resolution of today 2 ̆ 7 s environmental and land use problems? These are the questions that this research addresses. ^ To understand the evolution of landscape planning, its history is placed in context with the histories of city planning, ecology, and landscape architecture. To document the current status of the field, scholarly literature is analyzed through journal network analysis and content analysis of the last five years of landscape planning articles. ^ This research sheds light on the complex relationships between disciplines engaged in environmental problem solving. Results suggest that there is still a need for landscape planning today, but that weaknesses must be overcome to make the field more effective. A new model of landscape {{planning is}} proposed to address the problems and yet still retain the strengths of the classic model. ...|$|R
