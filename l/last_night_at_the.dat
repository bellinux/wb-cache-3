5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

25|$|As an artist, Shovelton {{began with}} scraperboard and ink drawing and later turned to {{watercolour}} painting. He {{also became a}} skilled calligrapher. He designed posters, flyers and other artwork for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including the programme cover for the company's <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Adelphi Theatre, {{as well as for}} all the Gawsworth Hall productions. He created the book covers and illustrated poem collections by his former tutor and friend, the geographer Jay Appleton. Shovelton's cartoons graced the monthly newsletter of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, The Palace Peeper, for over three decades. Shovelton also created numerous Gilbert and Sullivan themed Christmas, greeting and note cards, and was a keen photographer. He provided the cover illustration for a novel by Tony Joseph, The Diary of April March, and illustrated two books of poetry by his former tutor at Hull, Jay Appleton (Grains Among the Chaff and Enter the Fat Lady) and all three editions of Harry Benford's The Gilbert and Sullivan Lexicon (1978, 1991 and 1999).|$|E
500|$|Wayne Pommen, the first-choice Cambridge bow, {{was injured}} {{two days before}} the race, {{fracturing}} his wrist following a full-speed collision with the harbourmaster's launch during a practice start. [...] Matthias Kleinz was hit on the head but did not require medical attention. Cambridge number seven James Livingston said: [...] "For a couple of seconds I thought I was going to die. [...] We were going flat out {{and all of a sudden}} I heard Jim's voice. [...] I've never heard so much fear in anybody's voice before." [...] Pommen was circumspect: [...] "A few of us were feeling quite lucky <b>last</b> <b>night...</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, it was very frustrating and disappointing... but there was no point sulking in the corner." [...] Three oars were destroyed and two riggers bent; the boat was sent to Weybridge to be repaired. [...] Pommen was replaced by Ben Smith, brother of the Oxford stroke Matthew. [...] Not since the 1979 race had such a late change in the line-up of a crew been made. Along with James and David Livingston, this was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that two pairs of brothers would be racing against one another.|$|E

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{first found}} wide acclaim {{when he stood}} in for an ill Otto Klemperer in a {{performance}} of Don Giovanni, at the Royal Festival Hall in 1959. A year later, Beecham invited him to collaborate with him in preparing The Magic Flute at Glyndebourne. Beecham was taken ill, and Davis conducted the opera. After the Don Giovanni, The Times wrote, [...] "A superb conductor of Mozart declared himself <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Festival Hall…. Mr Davis emerged as a conductor ripe for greatness." [...] Neville Cardus in The Guardian was less enthusiastic but nevertheless considered that he [...] "had his triumphs" [...] in the performance. After The Magic Flute, The Times called Davis [...] "master of Mozart's idiom, style and significance", although Heyworth in The Observer was disappointed by his tempi, judging them to be too slow.|$|E
