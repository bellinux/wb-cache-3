Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E

25|$|The mythological {{name was}} revived in 1979 by James Lovelock, in Gaia: A New <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>Life</b> on Earth; his Gaia {{hypothesis}} {{was supported by}} Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and inorganic material {{are part of a}} dynamical system that shapes the Earth's biosphere, and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions. Further books by Lovelock and others popularized the Gaia Hypothesis, which was embraced to some extent by New Age environmentalists as part of the heightened awareness of environmental concerns of the 1990s.|$|E

The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>life</b> through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'."

2500|$|Zevon {{was a much}} {{darker and}} more ironic {{songwriter}} than Browne and other leading figures of the era's L.A.-based singer-songwriter movement. But he and his 1970s L.A. peers shared a grounding in earlier folk and country influences {{and a commitment to}} songcraft with roots in the work of artists like Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. The album Warren Zevon (1976), produced by Browne, was a modest commercial success, but it was later termed a masterpiece in the first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide and is cited in the book's most recent revised edition (November 2004) as Zevon's most realized work. Representative tracks include the junkie's lament [...] "Carmelita"; the Copland-esque outlaw ballad [...] "Frank and Jesse James"; [...] "The French Inhaler", a scathing insider's <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>life</b> and lust in the L.A. music business (which was, in fact, about his long-time girlfriend and the mother of his son, Jordan); and [...] "Desperados Under the Eaves", a chronicle of Zevon's increasing alcoholism.|$|E
