Despite this, the demographic contributions of <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> to a population network {{and to the}} growth rate of such a network are still largely unexplored. Using data on individually marked young and adult female reed buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) from 21 <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> studied over six years in northeastern Switzerland, we examined the source—sink status of small and large <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> with recently developed metrics.

5|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Australians {{continued}} to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program {{in an attempt to}} consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing basic health care to the <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> Despite such efforts though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for the <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D.|$|E
40|$|The {{song of the}} Reed Bunt­ing is {{characterized}} by a large variability between individuals. Within Switzerland, the subspecies schoeniclus is breeding north and south of the Alps in wetlands, which are often small and unconnected. The local isolation might favour the development of local song characteristics, i. e. dialects. We therefore analysed 260 songs of 30 different Reed Buntings from five separate locations (Greifensee, Chatzensee, Fanel, Gletterens, and Bolle di Magadino). For quantification, we determined seven song variables and compared them within and between the <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b> Our results show considerable song variability within <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b> In addition, we found significant differences between various <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> for the variables song diversity and maximal frequency. Song diversity further differed between songs from populations north and the one south of the Alps. Our findings thus support the existence of local song dialects of the Reed Bunting in Switzerland; however, our results also confirm that song variability within <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> is extensive...|$|R
40|$|The {{coloration}} of ectotherms {{plays an}} important role in thermoregulation processes. Dark individuals should heat up faster and be able to reach a higher body temperature than light individuals and should therefore have benefits in cool areas. In central Europe, montane <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of adder (Vipera berus) and asp viper (Vipera aspis) exhibit a varying proportion of melanistic individuals. We tested whether the presence of melanistic V. aspis and V. berus could be explained by climatic conditions. We measured the climatic niche position and breadth of monomorphic (including strictly patterned individuals) and polymorphic <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> calculated their niche overlap and tested for niche equivalency and similarity. In accordance with expectations, niche overlap between polymorphic <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of both species is high, and even higher than that of polymorphic versus monomorphic montane <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of V. aspis, suggesting a predominant role of melanism in determining the niche of ectothermic vertebrates. However, unexpectedly, the niche of polymorphic <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of both species is narrower than that of monomorphic ones, indicating that colour polymorphism does not always enable the exploitation of a greater variability of resources, at least at the intraspecific level. Overall, our results suggest that melanism might be present only when the thermoregulatory benefit is higher than the cost of predation...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{differentiation}} {{and relationships}} among five <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> {{of the common}} starfish Asterina pectinifera were studied by allozyme analysis of 12 enzymes. The localities of five <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> examined were as follows: Asamushi from Mutsu Bay; Simoburo from Shimokita Peninsula; Esashi, Fukaura and Atsumi from northern parts of Japan Sea. From allele frequencies data in 23 genetic loci scored, the genetic identities（I） and genetic distances（D）between populations were calculated by the method of Nei（ 1972 ）. The genetic distance values obtained were comparable to those between conspecifi c <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of other echinoderms and many other animals. To clarify the genetic relationships among fi ve <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> the molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed by the UPGMA clustering method. It indicated that the fi ve <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> are divided into two large clusters: one consists of two populations（Asamushi and Simoburo）from Mutsu Bay and Tsugaru Strait, and the other consists of three populations（Esashi, Fukaura and Atsumi）from Japan Sea. This result was well consistent with the geographical distribution of five <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b> From the statistically significant difference of allele frequencies in some genetic loci, it was strongly suggested that the gene-fl ow between two clusters is considerably limited by the geographical barriers of three large peninsula（Tsugaru, Shimokita and Oshima Peninsula）. The divergence time between two clusters estimated from molecular clock based on genetic distance was approximately consistent with the geological data of the emergence time of Mutsu Bay and Tsugaru Strait. The present allozyme study would provide useful information for elucidating the speciation of marine invertebrates...|$|R
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the <b>local</b> <b>population</b> {{and this may}} lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E

40|$|In many benthic organisms with a planktonic larval stage, <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> have {{different}} morphology. Such difference {{may arise from}} some of the following proximate mechanisms. “Local recruitment (LR) ”: no larvae move between <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> and segregated populations possess alleles coding for locally adaptive morphology. “Intragenerational selection (IS) ”: larvae move between <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> and individuals with alleles for locally adaptive morphology survive after recruitment. “Phenotypic plasticity (PP) ”: larvae move between <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> and show phenotypic plasticity to adapt to a locality after recruitment. We examined which mechanism explains our finding that a planktonic developer Turbo coronatus coronatus (Gastropoda) had significantly longer spines on its shell on more exposed shores at scales of < 2 km. Experiments at Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, Japan, showed the following results. (a) Shorter- and longer-spined populations occurring within 2 km showed non-significant ϕ low st values (− 0. 0040 to 0. 00095) for the mitochondrial DNA COI region. This suggests no segregation of the <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> supporting the mechanisms IS and PP. (b) T. c. coronatus generated significantly longer spines 70 days after being transplanted to the habitat of a longer-spined population, supporting IS and PP. (c) Individuals caged in the sea for 79 days generated longer spines than individuals in the laboratory, supporting PP. In conclusion, shore-specific morphology of T. c. coronatus arises most likely from phenotypic plasticity and possibly from intragenerational selection...|$|R
