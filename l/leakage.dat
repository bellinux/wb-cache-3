40|$|Abstract: Pollution {{intensive}} production can {{be avoided}} domestically by increased imports and less exports of dirty products. Such trade effects may imply more emissions abroad, or pollution <b>leakages.</b> We study whether such <b>leakages</b> {{may contribute to the}} observed inverted relationship between emissions and economic growth - the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). In our case, the rich, open Norwegian economy, we find little evidence for the hypothesis that pollution <b>leakages</b> contribute to explain the EKC. Despite an observed decoupling of emissions from economic growth over the past 20 years, there was no increase in pollution <b>leakages</b> over this period. Rather, emissions related to export increased far more than the foreign emissions embodied in import, implying reduced <b>leakages.</b> In future projections, we find a lower degree of decoupling than in the past, but no corresponding reductions in <b>leakages.</b> Instead, <b>leakages</b> increase. This conclusion is fairly invariant to assumptions about future climate policy...|$|R

5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon <b>leakage</b> {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission permits (Carbon Trust, 2009). This acts as a subsidy for the sector in question. Free allocation of permits was opposed by the Garnaut Climate Change Review as it considered there were no circumstances that justify it and that governments could deal with market failure or claims for compensation more transparently with the revenue from full auctioning of permits. The economically efficient option would, however, be border adjustments (Neuhoff, 2009; Newbery, 2009). Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries.

40|$|<b>Leakages</b> in the {{district}} heating networks is a current and growing problem. To find the <b>leakages</b> today many district heating companies uses manual techniques that are both time consuming and insecure, the methods can leave a lot of <b>leakages</b> in older pipes undiscovered {{for a very long}} time. These undetected <b>leakages</b> costs {{the district}} heating companies {{a lot of money and}} can even be fatal. It is therefor of great importance that the <b>leakages</b> is found in time, thus the methods for leak detection needs to be improved. The main purpose of this thesis was to investigate the ability to use thermal images to automatically search for <b>leakages</b> in district heating systems. To investigate this aerial thermal images from 2013 were collected. Image analysis was performed using ArcGIS and ENVI. This included, among other things, image preprocessing such as to define the projection of the images and unsupervised isodata classification to find potential <b>leakages</b> in the thermal images. This automatic analysis resulted in many false alarms. One example were false alarms caused by vegetation, since vegetation absorbs heat during the day it appears warmer than the surroundings at night. To deal with this problem an unsupervised classification algorithm, isodata, was used again to classify the vegetational areas and the non-vegetational. This algorithm decreased the number of false alarms drastic and thereby increased the usability of the algorithm. Other false alarm that has not been automatically rejected in this thesis were for example false alarms caused by heat leaking from buildings. One way to map such false alarms could be to analyse the shape and the linearisation of the potential <b>leakages</b> close to buildings. This would hugely increase the accuracy of the used algorithm. The provided thermal images used in this thesis consisted of several confirmed <b>leakages.</b> All these confirmed <b>leakages</b> was found by the used algorithm. Although, the accuracy of the used algorithm could be discussed since many false alarms were generated. Nevertheless, to reject false alarms are much less time consuming than manual leak detection for an entire city. Thereby the conclusion that an automatic leak detection in district heating networks is possible, furthermore a leak detection tool like this would be usable for the district heating companies. The evaluations from several different district heating experts who are using Digpro's district heating application, dpHeating, today shows that a leak detection tool using thermal images would be a useful addition in dpHeating...|$|R

25|$|After a {{measuring}} time of 2 or 5 minutes, {{depending on the}} data sheet specification, the measured <b>leakage</b> current value has to be lower than the calculated value. Normally the <b>leakage</b> current is always lower the longer the capacitor voltage is applied.

25|$|The <b>leakage</b> current {{drops in}} the first minutes after {{applying}} DC voltage.

Solid electrolytes' <b>leakage</b> current drops much faster than in the case of non-solid types, but it remain at a somewhat higher level. Wet electrolytic capacitors with high water contend electrolytes {{in the first}} minutes generally have higher <b>leakage</b> current than those with organic electrolyte, but after several minutes they reach the same level. Although the <b>leakage</b> current of electrolytic capacitors is higher compared with the current flow over the insulation resistance at ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors can take several weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of unilateral action to curb carbon emissions has beendismissed because of possible “carbon leakages”, this {{referring to the}} rise of emissions in non-participating countries. This paper offers a general equilibrium (GE) exploration of the key mechanisms and factors underlying the size of carbon <b>leakages.</b> We developed a two-region, two-goods simplified GE framework, incorporating threetypes of fossil fuels (coal, oil and low-carbon energy), international trade and capital mobility. The model was designed to make tractable extensive multidimensional sensitivityanalysis. The results suggest that the coal supply elasticity plays a critical role, while substitution elasticities between traded goods and international capital mobility appear relatively less influential. The shape of the production function also matters forthe size of the <b>leakages.</b> Confirming the results obtained with large computable GE models, {{for a wide range of}} parameters’ values, carbon <b>leakages</b> appear to be small. Therefore, the argument that unilateral carbon abatement action taken by a large groupof countries (such as the Annex 1 group) is flawed by significant carbon <b>leakages</b> isnot supported by our sensitivity analysis. The likelihood of small <b>leakages</b> favours in fact the formation of a worldwide coalition to stabilise climate change...|$|R

40|$|In his book, <b>Leakages,</b> Treval Powers {{makes the}} {{outrageous}} claim that without <b>leakages,</b> the US economy could {{grow at a}} sustained rate of 13 % annually. According to his calculations (based on empirical evidence), normal <b>leakages</b> of 7. 4 % reduce {{the rate of growth}} to 5. 6 %, leaving the economy operating at only 92. 6 % of its capacity. Periodic restrictive policy by the Federal Reserve adds another layer of <b>leakages,</b> which can reduce growth to zero, causing the economy to operate at only 87 % of potential. Ironically, the Fed imposes tight policy because it wrongly believes that inflationary pressures result from excessive demand, even though the economy chronically operates well below capacity. Indeed, Powers argues that the greater the <b>leakages,</b> the higher the price level, hence, when the Fed tightens it actually puts upward pressure on prices. In his view, the economy has not been supply constrained, at least in the postwar era, so there has been no reason to fight inflation by constraining demand. All of this goes against the conventional wisdom. Powers might be dismissed as a crank, as someone who simply does not understand economics.
